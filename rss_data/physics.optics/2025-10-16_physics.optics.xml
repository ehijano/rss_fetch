      <title>Nonlinear dynamics in breathing-soliton lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent advances in the study of nonlinear dynamics in mode-locked fibre lasers operating in the breathing (pulsating) soliton regime. Leveraging advanced diagnostics and control strategies -- including genetic algorithms -- we uncover a rich spectrum of dynamical behaviours, including frequency-locked breathers, fractal Farey hierarchies, Arnold tongues with anomalous features, and breather molecular complexes. We also identify a novel route to chaos via modulated subharmonic states. These findings underscore the utility of fibre lasers as model systems for exploring complex dissipative dynamics, offering new opportunities for ultrafast laser control and fundamental studies in nonlinear science.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear near-field spectroscopy of exciton-polaritons in a van der Waals layered waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered van der Waals materials offer novel opportunities for on-chip waveguiding and development of integrated photonic circuits. In the strong light-matter coupling regime, their nonlinear response can be significantly enhanced, which is crucial for developing active photonic devices. However, probing the nonlinearity of waveguide modes in subwavelength-thick structures is challenging as they are not directly accessible from far-field. Here we apply a novel nonlinear near-field spectroscopic technique based on a GaP solid immersion lens and femtosecond laser excitation to study nonlinearity of guided modes in monolayer WS$_2$ encapsulated in hBN under the strong light-matter coupling regime. We reveal formation of exciton-polaritons with $\sim 50$ meV Rabi splitting and demonstrate a pump-induced transition from strong to weak coupling. Our results show that exciton resonance saturation and broadening lead to an efficient nonlinear response of guided polaritons, which can be employed for developing compact van der Waals photonic switches and modulators.</description>

      <title>Optical Computation-in-Communication enables low-latency, high-fidelity perception in telesurgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing intraoperative perception and decision-making in telesurgery, where physical separation impairs sensory feedback and control. Despite advances in medical AI and surgical robotics, conventional electronic AI architectures remain fundamentally constrained by the compounded latency from serial processing of inference and communication. This limitation is especially critical in latency-sensitive procedures such as endovascular interventions, where delays over 200 ms can compromise real-time AI reliability and patient safety. Here, we introduce an Optical Computation-in-Communication (OCiC) framework that reduces end-to-end latency significantly by performing AI inference concurrently with optical communication. OCiC integrates Optical Remote Computing Units (ORCUs) directly into the optical communication pathway, with each ORCU experimentally achieving up to 69 tera-operations per second per channel through spectrally efficient two-dimensional photonic convolution. The system maintains ultrahigh inference fidelity within 0.1% of CPU/GPU baselines on classification and coronary angiography segmentation, while intrinsically mitigating cumulative error propagation, a longstanding barrier to deep optical network scalability. We validated the robustness of OCiC through outdoor dark fibre deployments, confirming consistent and stable performance across varying environmental conditions. When scaled globally, OCiC transforms long-haul fibre infrastructure into a distributed photonic AI fabric with exascale potential, enabling reliable, low-latency telesurgery across distances up to 10,000 km and opening a new optical frontier for distributed medical intelligence.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of an interferometric technique for measuring vacuum magnetic birefringence with an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vacuum magnetic birefringence effect is a prediction of quantum electrodynamics, that in the presence of a magnetic field vacuum behaves as a non-linear medium, exhibiting a birefringence. In this work, an experiment is proposed to measure this effect for the first time, by sensing the changes in the frequencies of laser fields stabilized to the resonances of a 245 m long optical cavity whose eigenmode propagates through a string of 24 superconducting magnets arranged for the ALPS II experiment. Results from a prototype setup using a 19 m test cavity without a magnetic field are presented and projected in terms of the sensitivity of the proposed full-scale experiment.</description>

      <title>Giant bias-free nonreciprocity for unpolarized light via synthetic motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reciprocity breaking at optical frequencies typically relies on bulky magnets, dynamic modulation, or nonlinearities, all of which hinder chip-scale integration and the handling of unpolarised light. We introduce a fully passive, subwavelength metasurface that achieves polarisation-insensitive one-way transparency by combining self-magnetised ferrite nanodisks in a vortex state with symmetry-protected quasi-bound states in the continuum. The metasurface exhibits a pure synthetic moving-medium response at optical frequencies, yielding giant nonreciprocal directional dichroism. We report near-unity values for both the transmittance contrast and the emissivity-to-absorptivity ratio with experimentally widely available ferrite materials, all under unpolarised illumination and without external bias. Using temporal coupled-mode theory, we identify the design conditions necessary to maximise directional dichroism: critical coupling, Huygens-type resonance overlap, and strong inter-mode coupling. Furthermore, we propose a deterministic, stamp-assisted protocol for imprinting arbitrary, uniform, or patterned vortex configurations across large arrays of nanodisk meta-atoms, enabling scalable fabrication. This work establishes a practical route toward compact nonreciprocal photonics with applications in photonic gyrators, nonreciprocal wavefront engineering, and nonreciprocal solar cell technologies.</description>

      <title>Bell-State Quantum Holography with Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces composed of subwavelength nanostructures enable simultaneous control of polarization and wavefront, greatly enhancing holographic information capacity. Building on this capability, we extend holography into the quantum domain by experimentally realizing Bell-state holograms-distinct holographic images encoded in polarization-entangled Bell states of photon pairs. A polarization-multiplexed dielectric metasurface generates spatial modes conditioned on both input and output polarizations, entangling the holographic pattern with the two-photon state. To characterize these quantum holograms, we further develop quantum hologram tomography, reconstructing the full density matrix of the holographic state pixel by pixel. The reconstructed density-matrix hologram reveals tailor-made holographic symbols attached to individual Bell states through the metasurface, with contrast built up among the different Bell components as theory shows. This framework unifies metasurface photonics with quantum-state reconstruction and provides a scalable route toward high-dimensional quantum communication, encryption and information processing based on holographically encoded quantum light.</description>

      <title>Subdiffractive confinement of ultrashort mid-IR pulses with photonic funnels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control the spatial distribution of light, particularly in deep sub-wavelength areas, is important for a range of materials science, microscopy, and communications applications. Separately, materials science and communications rely on the ability to temporally shape the evolution of electromagnetic pulses. In this work we investigate theoretically the propagation of ultrafast pulses inside hyperbolic metamaterials-based photonic funnels, which have been recently used to achieve deep subwavelength (wavelength/30) concentration of monochromatic mid-infrared light. By analyzing the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of the pulse-funnel interaction, we show that photonic funnels, in general, broaden bandwidth-limited ultrafast Gaussian pulses. We demonstrate that this broadening can be mitigated by pre-chirping the incoming light, realizing simultaneous intensity enhancement and spatio-temporal compression of mid-wave IR light in the all-semiconductor "designer metal" funnel platform. Our analysis suggests that, in combination with linear chirp, designer-metal-based photonic funnels can be utilized with 100 fs bandwidth- and diffraction-limited pulses to produce wavelength/30-scale signals of ~200 fs duration, with intensity enhancement on the order of 5. Lowering material absorption can further enhance the peak intensity. The results presented can be used to assess the perspectives of ultrafast sub-diffraction light manipulation in other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum by adjusting the (meta)material composition of the funnels.</description>

      <title>A Flying Focus with Arbitrary Directionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flying focus techniques produce laser pulses whose focal points travel at arbitrary, controllable velocities. While this flexibility can enhance a broad range of laser-based applications, existing techniques constrain the motion of the focal point to the propagation direction of the pulse. Here, we introduce a flying focus configuration that decouples the motion of the focus from the propagation direction. A chirped laser pulse focused and diffracted by a diffractive lens and grating creates a focal point that can move both along and transverse to the propagation direction. The focal length of the lens, grating period, and chirp can be tuned to control the direction and velocity of the focus. Simulations demonstrate this control for a holographic configuration suited to high-power pulses, in which two off-axis pump beams with different focal lengths encode the equivalent phase of a chromatic lens and grating in a gas or plasma. For low-power pulses, conventional solid-state or adaptive optics can be used instead. Multi-dimensional control over the focal trajectory enables new configurations for applications, including laser wakefield acceleration of ions, steering of broadband THz radiation, and surface harmonic generation.</description>

      <title>Diffractive Retroreflector for Distributed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a modified corner cube reflector that encodes information from passive optical sensors in its retroreflected diffraction pattern, enabling remote sensor-state measurement over a single-ended optical link. The design interferes a reference path and a sensor-modulated path within the retroreflected beam to produce an interferometric signal suitable for reading out phase and amplitude variations with a squarelaw camera. This enables sensor-state determination in arbitrarily oriented passive nodes, extending coherent interferometric read out of chemical, biological, and physical sensors to scalable, robust, and inert field deployments.</description>

      <title>Origin of the voltage gap and recombination losses in all-perovskite tandem solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-perovskite tandem solar cells with narrow and wide bandgap perovskite absorbers are promising candidates for low-cost and high efficiency photovoltaic applications. However, the open circuit voltage of typical tandem structures is generally smaller than the sum of the individual voltages in the single-junction form; a quantity we call the voltage gap. Subcell optimization can only begin once nonradiative losses associated with each absorber layer can be properly identified. To address this, we used absolute electroluminescence hyperspectral imaging to construct external radiative efficiency maps of each subcell within the tandem stack and compare these measurements with single junction devices. These measurements were then combined with additional electro-optical characterization and modeling to construct subcell current vs voltage curves. We find that the narrow band gap subcell contributes the most towards the voltage gap and therefore fabrication and processing efforts should focus on reducing nonradiative recombination losses within the narrow band gap absorber.</description>

      <title>Wide-Field Reflective Imaging with an Epi-Illumination Multi-Camera Array Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an epi-illumination multi-camera array microscope (epi-MCAM) designed for wide-field reflective imaging of non-transparent samples. The epi-MCAM contains 24 tightly packed and synchronized epi-illumination microscope units, arranged in a $4 \times 6$ planar array at 18 mm spacing. Each unit contains a unique CMOS image sensor (13 megapixels each), an objective and tube lens pair, and a beamsplitter and epi-illumination light path. An epi-MCAM capture cycle produces a stitched image covering $72 \times 108~\mathrm{mm}^2$ at a micrometer scale resolution down to 2.46 $\mu$m. To image samples exceeding this native field of view, we translate the entire array across the sample surface to enable high-resolution coverage of large objects. We demonstrate the system's ability to image both flat and three-dimensionally structured reflective samples, such as semiconductor wafers and printed circuit boards, which highlight the epi-MCAM's strong potential within industrial inspection applications.</description>

      <title>A 2-bit Ku-band Digital Metasurface with Infinitely Scalable Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the design and implementation of a 2-bit digaital metasurface operating in the Ku-band, engineered to exhibit advanced polarization conversion characteristics and support dual-polarization control for both X- and Y-polarizations. To address the challenge of array size scalability hindered by extensive DC control routing in 2-bit metasurfaces, we propose a novel RF-DC separation architecture. This approach integrates the metasurface and DC control circuitry onto separate printed circuit boards (PCBs), interconnected via pin cascading, enabling theoretically unlimited two-dimensional array expansion. To validate this design, a ${4\times16 \times 16}$ metasurface prototype was fabricated and experimentally evaluated, which can achieve a gain of 28.3dB and an aperture efficiency of 21.02\%, confirming the scalability and performance of the proposed architecture. The developed 2-bit high-gain metasurface offers significant reference value for applications in long-distance communication and radar detection. Furthermore, the RF-DC separation architecture introduces a pioneering framework for large-scale metasurface deployment in practical engineering scenarios, enhancing design flexibility and scalability.</description>

      <title>Research Progress of Terahertz Technology in Microbiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature, and microbial activities are closely intertwined with the entire life cycle system and human life. Developing novel technologies for the detection, characterization and manipulation of microorganisms promotes their applications in clinical, environmental and industrial areas. Over the last two decades, terahertz (THz) technology has emerged as a new optical tool for microbiology. The great potential originates from the unique advantages of THz waves including the high sensitivity to water and inter-/intra-molecular motions, the non-invasive and label-free detecting scheme, and their low photon energy. THz waves have been utilized as a stimulus to alter microbial functions, or as a sensing approach for quantitative measurement and qualitative differentiation. This review specifically focuses on recent research progress of THz technology applied in the field of microbiology, including two major parts of THz biological effects and the microbial detection applications. In the end of this paper, we summarize the research progress and discuss the challenges currently faced by THz technology in microbiology, along with potential solutions. We also provide a perspective on future development directions. This review aims to build a bridge between THz photonics and microbiology, promoting both fundamental research and application development in this interdisciplinary field.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Theory of Metasurface Perfect Magnetic Conductor (PMC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial magnetic conductors (AMCs) mimic the idealized boundary condition of a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC), which reflects electromagnetic waves with a preserved electric field and inverted magnetic field. Despite their usefulness, existing AMC implementations often rely on complex or impractical designs, and lack a clear electromagnetic theory explaining their behavior, especially under oblique or polarization-diverse incidence. This work addresses these limitations by presenting a rigorous electromagnetic framework for PMC metasurfaces based on dipolar and quadrupolar surface susceptibilities within the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) formalism. We show that achieving polarization- and angle-independent PMC behavior requires a specific set of heteroanisotropic (nonlocal) susceptibilities, and we derive closed-form expressions for angular scattering that include higher-order multipole contributions. A physically realizable, asymmetric metasurface structure is then designed to satisfy these theoretical conditions. Despite its geometric asymmetry, the proposed structure exhibits a isotropic PMC response at resonance, confirmed by full-wave simulations and multipolar susceptibility extraction. These results demonstrate how properly engineered surface multipoles can yield angularly independent magnetic boundary conditions using only thin, passive metallic layers. This work bridges the gap between AMC design and electromagnetic theory, and enables a new class of angle-independent metasurface reflectors for more accurate simulations, optimizations and innovative AMC designs.</description>

      <title>Structured Random Phase Retrieval using Optical Diffusers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase retrieval is a nonlinear inverse problem that arises in a wide range of imaging modalities, from electron microscopy to optical Fourier ptychography. Among various modalities, random phase retrieval stands out thanks to its strong theoretical guarantees and efficient reconstruction algorithms, although its applicability is hindered by prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we propose the structured random models for phase retrieval, where we emulate a dense random matrix by a cascade of structured transforms and random diagonal matrices. We demonstrate that structured random models can achieve the same reconstruction performance as dense random models, with complexity reduced from quadratic to log-linear. Using a spectral method initialization followed by gradient descent, robust reconstruction is obtained at an oversampling ratio as low as 2.8. Moreover, we observe that the reconstruction performance is solely determined by the singular value distribution of the forward matrix. This class of models can directly be implemented with basic optical elements such as lenses and diffusers, paving the way for large-scale phase imaging with robust reconstruction guarantees.</description>

      <title>Bloch-Landau-Zener Oscillations in Moir\'e Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of two-dimensional Bloch-Landau-Zener (BLZ) oscillations of wavepackets in incommensurate moir\'e lattices under the influence of a weak linear gradient. Unlike periodic systems, aperiodic lattices lack translational symmetry and therefore do not exhibit a conventional band-gap structure. Instead, they feature a mobility edge, above which (in the optical context) all modes become localized. When a linear gradient is applied to a moir\'e lattice, it enables energy transfer between two or several localized modes, leading to the oscillatory behavior referred to as BLZ oscillations. This phenomenon represents simultaneous tunneling in real space and propagation constant (energy) space, and it arises when quasi-resonance condition for propagation constants and spatial proximity of interacting modes (together constituting a selection rule) are met. The selection rule is controlled by the linear gradient, whose amplitude and direction play a crucial role in determining the coupling pathways and the resulting dynamics. We derive a multimode model describing BLZ oscillations in the linear regime and analyze how both attractive and repulsive nonlinearities affect their dynamics. The proposed framework can be readily extended to other physical systems, including cold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates in aperiodic potentials.</description>

      <title>Resonate-and-Fire Photonic-Electronic Spiking Neurons for Fast and Efficient Light-Enabled Neuromorphic Processing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the spiking dynamics of biological neurons for brain-inspired computation. While electronic implementations of artificial spiking neurons have dominated to date, photonic approaches are attracting increasing research interest as they promise ultrafast, energy-efficient operation with low-crosstalk and high bandwidth. Nevertheless, existing photonic neurons largely mimic integrate-and-fire models, but neuroscience shows that neurons also encode information through richer mechanisms, such as the frequency and temporal patterns of spikes. Here, we present a photonic-electronic resonate-and-fire (R-and-F) spiking neuron that responds to the temporal structure of high-speed optical inputs. This is based on a light-sensitive resonant tunnelling diode that produces excitable spikes in response to nanosecond, low-power (100 microwatt) optical signals at infrared telecom wavelengths. We experimentally demonstrate control of R-and-F dynamics through inter-pulse timing of the optical stimuli and applied bias voltage, achieving bandpass filtering of both analogue and digital inputs. The R-and-F neuron also supports optical fan-in via wavelength-division multiplexed inputs from four vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). This electronic-photonic neuron exhibits key functionalities - including spike-frequency filtering, temporal pattern recognition, and digital-to-spiking conversion - critical for neuromorphic optical processing. Our approach establishes a pathway toward low-power, high-speed temporal information processing for light-enabled neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable on-chip vortex beam generation via Brillouin nonlinear optical radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated devices that generate structural optical fields with non-trivial orbital angular momentums (OAMs) hold great potential for advanced optical applications, but are restricted to complex nanostructures and static functionalities. Here, we demonstrate a reconfigurable OAM beam generator from a simple microring resonator without requiring grating-like nanostructures. Our approach harnesses Brillouin interaction between confined phonon and optical modes, where the acoustic field is excited through microwave input. The phonon stimulate the conversion from a guided optical mode into a free-space vortex beam. Under the selection rule of radiation, the OAM order of the emitted light is determined by the acousto-optic phase matching and is rapidly reconfigurable by simply tuning the microwave frequency. Furthermore, this all-microwave control scheme allows for the synthesis of arbitrary high-dimensional OAM superposition states by programming the amplitudes and phases of the driving fields. Analytical and numerical models predict a radiation efficiency over 25\% for experimentally feasible on-chip microcavities. This work introduces a novel paradigm for chip-to-free-space interfaces, replacing fixed nanophotonic structures with programmable acousto-optic interactions for versatile structured light generation.</description>

      <title>Dispersion engineered AlGaAs-on-insulator nanophotonics by distributed feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological advances in the fabrication of nanophotonic circuits have driven the scientific community to increasingly focus on the precise tailoring of their key optical properties, over a broadband spectral domain. In this context, the modulation of the local refractive index can be exploited to customize an effective reflectivity by the use of distributed Bragg mirrors, enabling the on-chip integration of Fabry-P\'erot resonators. The resulting cavity length is strongly wavelength-dependent, offering practical solutions to the growing demand of dispersion engineering. Owing to their typically high core-to-cladding refractive index contrast and exceptional nonlinear properties, III-V semiconductor-based platforms represent promising candidates for the fabrication of Bragg reflectors. In this work, we propose an AlGaAs-on-insulator linear resonator based on distributed Bragg mirrors. We discuss the first experimental demonstration of a systematic, shape-constrained inverse design technique which tailors a prescribed dispersion profile, showing a strong agreement between simulations and measurements. In perspective, the proposed approach offers an efficient and general response to the challenge of dispersion engineering in integrated optical circuits.</description>

      <title>Raman-Accelerated Power Depletion of Fundamental Mode in a Few-Mode Fiber in the Visible Spectral Range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally and numerically investigate Raman-driven power depletion in the fundamental mode of few-mode fibers (FMFs) excited by visible ultrashort pulses. Using a tunable femtosecond laser and SMF-28 fibers operated below the single-mode cutoff wavelength, we explore nonlinear mode dynamics through precise coupling, holographic mode decomposition, and spectral analysis. Experiments on 12-meter and 50-meter fibers reveal significant energy transfer to higher-order modes via intermodal Raman scattering. These findings advance our understanding of nonlinear propagation in FMFs, with important implications for high-power laser delivery and next-generation optical communication systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Non-Diffracting Beams for Resilient Near-Field Millimeter-Wave Communications A Quantitative Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non diffracting (ND) beams are often cited as a promising solution to mitigate blockage in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. However, a quantitative answer to the fundamental question, under what specific conditions do ND beams actually outperform conventional pencil beams, has remained elusive, especially in the emerging context of near-field communications. This paper provides the first systematic answer by mapping the performance advantage regimes of ND beams for blockage-resilient near-field links. We propose a unified holographic generator that synthesizes various structured beams (e.g., Bessel, Mathieu) under the physical constraints of a planar phased array, ensuring a fair comparison against a boresight baseline with identical EIRP and aperture. Through extensive, unbiased Monte Carlo simulations, we construct advantage regime maps that delineate the specific regions where ND beams offer a tangible link-level gain. Our key finding is that the advantage of ND beams is a powerful but conditional near field phenomenon. While offering a positive average gain, its performance is highly variable, with a 60-70% probability of outperforming the baseline in its optimal range. Crucially, this performance is strongly modulated by the obstacle's geometry, revealing a significant weakness against large blockers. These findings provide not just a practical roadmap for judiciously employing ND beams but also a clear motivation for future work in environment-aware, adaptively shaped structured beams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of plasmonic resonances across a broad spectral range is central to the development of tunable optical devices. Yet, achieving both redshifts and blueshifts within a single nanostructure has remained elusive. Here we introduce a metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) nanodisk array that enables bidirectional tuning of resonance wavelengths throughout the near-infrared (NIR) region. The observed spectral evolution follows the plasmon ruler relationship, with unprecedented tuning properties. In particular, we report a record blueshift response of 457.82 nm for a small nanodisk thickness variation of only 5-10 nm, the highest blueshift response demonstrated in plasmonic architectures to date. This platform offers finely tunable resonances spanning an exceptionally wide NIR range, providing new insights into electromagnetic (EM) coupling mechanisms and establishing a foundation for next-generation tunable devices in sensing, optical communications, and dynamic displays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for high-performance solar cells. This study investigates the temperature-dependent optoelectronic properties of mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite solar cells using electroluminescence (EL) and photoluminescence (PL) hyperspectral imaging, along with current-voltage analysis. Luminescence images, which were converted to EL and PL external radiative efficiency (ERE) maps, revealed significant changes in the optoelectronic behavior of these devices at low temperatures. Specifically, we found that a significant source of heterogeneity in the low-temperature EL ERE maps below 240 K is related to local charge injection and extraction bottlenecks, whereas PL ERE maps show suppressed non-radiative recombination and significant improvements in efficiency throughout the investigated temperature range. The spatial distribution of ERE and its variation with applied current were analyzed, offering insights into charge-carrier dynamics and defect behavior. Our results reveal that while the perovskite layer exhibits enhanced ERE at low temperatures, charge injection barriers at the interfaces of the perovskite solar cells significantly suppress EL and degrade the fill factor below 240 K. These findings reveal that a deeper understanding of the performance of perovskite solar cells under low-temperature conditions is an essential step toward their potential application in space power systems and advanced semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Laser-Induced Heating in Diamonds: Influence of Substrate Thermal Conductivity and Interfacial Polymer Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamonds hosting color centers possess intrinsically high thermal conductivity; therefore, laser-induced heating has often received little attention. However, when placed on substrates with low thermal conductivity, localized heating of diamonds under laser excitation can become significant, and the presence of an interfacial polymer layer between substrate and diamond further amplifies this effect. Yet, the relationship between substrate thermal conductivity, polymer thickness, and laser heating remains to be established. Here, a systematic investigation is presented on laser-induced heating of silicon-vacancy diamond on substrates with varying thermal conductivity and interfacial polymer thickness. Results reveal that even at a low excitation power of 737~$\mu$W/$\mu$m$^2$, thin amorphous holey carbon -- the lowest-conductivity substrate ($\sim$0.2~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$) studied -- exhibits substantial heating, while glass ($\sim$1.4~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, $\sim$0.35~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$) show noticeable heating only above 2.95~mW/$\mu$m$^2$. For polymer interlayers, a thickness of just 2.2~$\mu$m induces significant heating at 2.95~mW/$\mu$m$^2$ and above, highlighting strong influence of both substrate and polymer thickness on local heating response. Experimental findings are further validated using COMSOL Multiphysics simulations with a steady-state 3D heat transfer model. These results provide practical guidance for substrate selection and sample preparation, enabling optimization of conditions for optical thermometry and quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction in the regime of strong quantum coupling is usually treated within the framework of the Hopfield model. However, the picture of coupling well-defined modes of light and matter is correct only as long as the shapes of these eigenmodes are not substantially modified by the interaction. Moreover, parameters of theoretical models are usually obtained by fitting to experimental data. To date, there has been no straightforward method to determine a quantum master equation corresponding to a system with specific dielectric structure, which may lead to incompatibility of theoretical descriptions and physical realizations. We present a recipe for obtaining a quantum model in the polariton eigenmode basis based on Bogoliubov transformation in the conservative case and third quantization technique in the dissipative case. We show how this method can be used for boosting interaction strength and engineering nonlocal many-body interactions in carefully designed nanostructures, resulting in strongly nonclassical correlations of emitted light.</description>

      <title>Layered Bimetal Nanoporous Platforms for SERS Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoporous metals are extensively investigated as platforms for applications in plasmonics. They present high surface areas and strong local electric fields that can be tuned at different energies, playing with the choice of the metals and the morphology of the porous layers. Until recently, research in the field of plasmonics has primarily focused on porous metals composed of a single element, with limited attention given to the impact of alloy composition. The investigation of bi-metallic systems has only just begun to emerge in the literature. In particular, combining two or more different plasmonic metals, it could be possible to explore the interactions between two metals excited at specific energies. This involves plasmonic coupling, electron transfer, band hybridization at the interface, electromagnetic field interactions, and possibly thermal and electronic energy transfer depending on separation, size, and materials involved. The analysis of bi-metal systems can also be interesting in biomolecule detection, such as in the case of Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). Here we report, for the first time, a detailed study (comprising morphological analyses, numerical modelling, and optical spectroscopies) on bi-metal nanoporous platforms prepared with a dry-synthesis method enabling the easy and controllable fabrication of bilayers combining different metals such as Au, Ag, and Cu.</description>

      <title>Topological Engineering of High-Order Exceptional Points through Transformation Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian photonic systems have attracted considerable research interest due to their singular eigenvalue topology and associated anomalous physical phenomena. These properties enable diverse applications ranging from enhanced quantum metrology to chiral light-matter interactions. Practical implementation of high order EPs in optical platforms however remains fundamentally challenging, requiring precise multi-parameter control that often exceeds conventional design capabilities. This work presents a novel framework for engineering high order EPs through transformation optics (TO) principles, establishing a direct correspondence between mathematical singularities and physically controllable parameters. Our TO-based paradigm addresses critical limitations in conventional Hamiltonian approaches, where abstract parameter spaces lack explicit connections to experimentally accessible degrees of freedom, while simultaneously providing full-field mode solutions. In contrast to prevailing parity-time-symmetric architectures, our methodology eliminates symmetry constraints in EP design, significantly expanding the possibilities in non-Hermitian photonic engineering. The proposed technique enables unprecedented control over EP formation and evolution in nanophotonic systems, offering new pathways for developing topological optical devices with enhanced functionality and robustness.</description>

      <title>Skin mode tunability and self-healing effect in photonic Floquet lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04085</link>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems host exotic phenomena absent in their Hermitian counterparts, including the recently predicted self-healing effect (SHE) of non-Hermitian skin modes. To date, the SHE of skin modes in non-Hermitian systems has not been observed experimentally. Here we propose a feasible scheme to realize SHE in photonic Floquet lattices by exploiting skin mode tunability (SMT), a mechanism in which the spectrum of skin modes localized at one boundary can be tuned via a potential applied at the opposite boundary. Such tunability arises from the non-Hermitian biorthogonality of the eigenstates. We demonstrate that a certain skin mode is exceptionally sensitive to remote-boundary potentials in an array of $100$ coupled helical waveguides, allowing broad-range spectral control and the generation of SHE with experimentally accessible parameters. Our results establish a general framework for engineering skin modes via local perturbations, thereby expanding the toolbox for non-Hermitian wave control.</description>

      <title>Precision Thermometry of Flat Flames Using Spatially Resolved Multi-Color Laser Absorption Spectroscopy of Carbon Dioxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work developed an accurate and robust absorption-based method for spatially resolved measurements of gas temperatures in flames and reacting flows, with typical single-measurement uncertainties on the order of 1\%. This method exploits narrow-linewidth laser absorption of hot CO$_2$ molecules, which can be generated from combustion or artificially seeded into the flow. A collinear dual-laser setup allowed for periodic scans over tens of CO$_2$ absorption transitions near the $\nu_3$ bandhead every 100 $\mu s$, from which gas temperatures (as well as CO$_2$ concentrations) were determined with high sensitivity and robustness. Spatially resolved measurements were achieved using an electrically driven high-speed beam scanning system consisting of a 2-D galvo scanner and a pair of off-axis parabolic mirrors. An effective spatial resolution of 1 mm was achieved at a planar field measurement speed of 200 Hz and a volumetric field measurement speed of 2 Hz. A physically constrained nonlinear inference framework was also developed for the quantitative analysis of the measurement data. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed on axisymmetric flames stabilized on a Mckenna burner at various equivalence ratios and flow rates, and the results agreed asymptotically with the theoretical value of the adiabatic flame temperature. An additional experiment on a flame of complex geometry demonstrated an excellent level of resolution, precision, and contrast achieved by the current thermometry method. This method promises to provide good utility in future combustion studies due to its high performance metrics and relative ease of use.</description>

      <title>Oligonucleotide selective detection by levitated optomechanics</title>

Abstract: This study examines the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments. Silica nanoparticles were functionalized using ZnCl$_2$ and 25-mers of single-stranded deoxyadenosine and deoxythymidine monophosphate which were optically trapped by a 1550 nm wavelength laser in vacuum. In the optical trap, silica nanoparticles behave as harmonic oscillators, and their oscillation frequency and amplitude can be precisely detected by optical interferometry. The data was compared across particle types, revealing differences in frequency, width and amplitude of peaks with respect to motion of the silica nanoparticles which can be explained by a theoretical model. Data obtained from this platform was analyzed by fitting Lorentzian curves to the spectra. Dimensionality reduction detected differences between the functionalized and non-functionalized silica nanoparticles. Random forest modeling provided further evidence that the fitted data were different between the groups. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out, but did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Light Skyrmion Pulses via High Harmonic Generation</title>

Abstract: Paraxial light skyrmions are topological configurations that map a spatial domain of the field onto the full Poincar\'e sphere of polarization states. While optical skyrmions have been explored in continuous-wave regimes, their realization in the ultrafast domain remains open. Here we demonstrate that attosecond skyrmion pulses can be generated via high-harmonic generation. Advanced simulations combining single-atom strong-field theory and macroscopic propagation reveal that an infrared linearly polarized vector beam with fractional orbital angular momentum produces extreme-ultraviolet harmonic fields with nearly identical skyrmion polarization distributions across a broad spectral range. Using 1.2 $\mu$m driving fields and experimentally feasible spectral filtering, we show that the coherent superposition of consecutive harmonics centered at 70 eV yields a train of skyrmion pulses with $\sim500$ attoseconds duration. Our results open opportunities to use structured attosecond light with topological polarization textures in fields as ultrafast control, imaging and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Breather gas and shielding for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breathers have been experimentally and theoretically found in many physical systems -- in particular, in integrable nonlinear-wave models. A relevant problem is to study the \textit{breather gas}, which is the limit, for $N\rightarrow \infty $, of $N$-breather solutions. In this paper, we investigate the breather gas in the framework of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation with nonzero boundary conditions, using the inverse scattering transform and Riemann-Hilbert problem. We address aggregate states in the form of $N$-breather solutions, when the respective discrete spectra are concentrated in specific domains. We show that the breather gas coagulates into a single-breather solution whose spectral eigenvalue is located at the center of the circle domain, and a multi-breather solution for the higher-degree quadrature concentration domain. These coagulation phenomena in the breather gas are called \textit{breather shielding}. In particular, when the nonzero boundary conditions vanish, the breather gas reduces to an $n$-soliton solution. When the discrete eigenvalues are concentrated on a line, we derive the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem. When the discrete spectrum is uniformly distributed within an ellipse, it is equivalent to the case of the line domain. These results may be useful to design experiments with breathers in physical settings.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum of entangled photons as a probe for relativistic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) as both classical and quantum states of light has proven essential in numerous applications, from high-capacity information transfer to enhanced precision and accuracy in metrology. Here, we extend OAM metrology to relativistic scenarios to determine the Lorentz factor of a moving reference frame, exploiting the fact that OAM is not Lorentz invariant. We show that the joint OAM spectrum from entangled states is modified by length contraction when measured by two observers moving relative to the entanglement source. This relative motion rescales the spatial dimensions, thus breaking the orthogonality of the OAM measurement process and resulting in a broadening of the joint OAM spectrum that can precisely determine the Lorentz factor. We experimentally simulate velocities up to $0.99c$, confirm the predicted broadening, and use the measurement outcomes to extract the Lorentz factor. Our work provides a pathway for novel measurement techniques suitable for relativistic conditions that leverage OAM structured light as a resource.</description>
