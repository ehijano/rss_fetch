      <title>Automated Extraction of Mechanical Constitutive Models from Scientific Literature using Large Language Models: Applications in Cultural Heritage Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preservation of cultural heritage is increasingly transitioning towards data-driven predictive maintenance and "Digital Twin" construction. However, the mechanical constitutive models required for high-fidelity simulations remain fragmented across decades of unstructured scientific literature, creating a "Data Silo" that hinders conservation engineering. To address this, we present an automated, two-stage agentic framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract mechanical constitutive equations, calibrated parameters, and metadata from PDF documents. The workflow employs a resource-efficient "Gatekeeper" agent for relevance filtering and a high-capability "Analyst" agent for fine-grained extraction, featuring a novel Context-Aware Symbolic Grounding mechanism to resolve mathematical ambiguities. Applied to a corpus of over 2,000 research papers, the system successfully isolated 113 core documents and constructed a structured database containing 185 constitutive model instances and over 450 calibrated parameters. The extraction precision reached 80.4\%, establishing a highly efficient "Human-in-the-loop" workflow that reduces manual data curation time by approximately 90\%. We demonstrate the system's utility through a web-based Knowledge Retrieval Platform, which enables rapid parameter discovery for computational modeling. This work transforms scattered literature into a queryable digital asset, laying the data foundation for the "Digital Material Twin" of built heritage.</description>

      <title>DataJoint 2.0: A Computational Substrate for Agentic Scientific Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operational rigor determines whether human-agent collaboration succeeds or fails. Scientific data pipelines need the equivalent of DevOps -- SciOps -- yet common approaches fragment provenance across disconnected systems without transactional guarantees. DataJoint 2.0 addresses this gap through the relational workflow model: tables represent workflow steps, rows represent artifacts, foreign keys prescribe execution order. The schema specifies not only what data exists but how it is derived -- a single formal system where data structure, computational dependencies, and integrity constraints are all queryable, enforceable, and machine-readable. Four technical innovations extend this foundation: object-augmented schemas integrating relational metadata with scalable object storage, semantic matching using attribute lineage to prevent erroneous joins, an extensible type system for domain-specific formats, and distributed job coordination designed for composability with external orchestration. By unifying data structure, data, and computational transformations, DataJoint creates a substrate for SciOps where agents can participate in scientific workflows without risking data corruption.</description>

      <title>Resp-Agent: An Agent-Based System for Multimodal Respiratory Sound Generation and Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15909v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based respiratory auscultation is currently hindered by two fundamental challenges: (i) inherent information loss, as converting signals into spectrograms discards transient acoustic events and clinical context; (ii) limited data availability, exacerbated by severe class imbalance. To bridge these gaps, we present Resp-Agent, an autonomous multimodal system orchestrated by a novel Active Adversarial Curriculum Agent (Thinker-A$^2$CA). Unlike static pipelines, Thinker-A$^2$CA serves as a central controller that actively identifies diagnostic weaknesses and schedules targeted synthesis in a closed loop. To address the representation gap, we introduce a Modality-Weaving Diagnoser that weaves EHR data with audio tokens via Strategic Global Attention and sparse audio anchors, capturing both long-range clinical context and millisecond-level transients. To address the data gap, we design a Flow Matching Generator that adapts a text-only Large Language Model (LLM) via modality injection, decoupling pathological content from acoustic style to synthesize hard-to-diagnose samples. As a foundation for these efforts, we introduce Resp-229k, a benchmark corpus of 229k recordings paired with LLM-distilled clinical narratives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Resp-Agent consistently outperforms prior approaches across diverse evaluation settings, improving diagnostic robustness under data scarcity and long-tailed class imbalance. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zpforlove/Resp-Agent.</description>

      <title>LAND: A Longitudinal Analysis of Neuromorphic Datasets</title>

Abstract: Neuromorphic engineering has a data problem. Despite the meteoric rise in the number of neuromorphic datasets published over the past ten years, the conclusion of a significant portion of neuromorphic research papers still states that there is a need for yet more data and even larger datasets. Whilst this need is driven in part by the sheer volume of data required by modern deep learning approaches, it is also fuelled by the current state of the available neuromorphic datasets and the difficulties in finding them, understanding their purpose, and determining the nature of their underlying task. This is further compounded by practical difficulties in downloading and using these datasets. This review starts by capturing a snapshot of the existing neuromorphic datasets, covering over 423 datasets, and then explores the nature of their tasks and the underlying structure of the presented data. Analysing these datasets shows the difficulties arising from their size, the lack of standardisation, and difficulties in accessing the actual data. This paper also highlights the growth in the size of individual datasets and the complexities involved in working with the data. However, a more important concern is the rise of synthetic datasets, created by either simulation or video-to-events methods. This review explores the benefits of simulated data for testing existing algorithms and applications, highlighting the potential pitfalls for exploring new applications of neuromorphic technologies. This review also introduces the concepts of meta-datasets, created from existing datasets, as a way of both reducing the need for more data, and to remove potential bias arising from defining both the dataset and the task.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation Algorithms for Relational Clustering</title>

Abstract: Clustering plays a crucial role in computer science, facilitating data analysis and problem-solving across numerous fields. By partitioning large datasets into meaningful groups, clustering reveals hidden structures and relationships within the data, aiding tasks such as unsupervised learning, classification, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems. Particularly in relational databases, where data is distributed across multiple tables, efficient clustering is essential yet challenging due to the computational complexity of joining tables. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing efficient algorithms for $k$-median and $k$-means clustering on relational data without the need for pre-computing the join query results. For the relational $k$-median clustering, we propose the first efficient relative approximation algorithm. For the relational $k$-means clustering, our algorithm significantly improves both the approximation factor and the running time of the known relational $k$-means clustering algorithms, which suffer either from large constant approximation factors, or expensive running time. Given a join query $Q$ and a database instance $D$ of $O(N)$ tuples, for both $k$-median and $k$-means clustering on the results of $Q$ on $D$, we propose randomized $(1+\varepsilon)\gamma$-approximation algorithms that run in roughly $O(k^2N^{\mathsf{fhw}})+T_\gamma(k^2)$ time, where $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$ is a constant parameter decided by the user, $\mathsf{fhw}$ is the fractional hyper-tree width of $Q$, while $\gamma$ and $T_\gamma(x)$ are respectively the approximation factor and the running time of a traditional clustering algorithm in the standard computational setting over $x$ points.</description>

      <title>Arming Data Agents with Tribal Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) translation enables non-expert users to query relational databases through natural language. Recently, NL2SQL agents, powered by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), have significantly advanced NL2SQL translation. Nonetheless, NL2SQL agents still make mistakes when faced with large-scale real-world databases because they lack knowledge of how to correctly leverage the underlying data (e.g., knowledge about the intent of each column) and form misconceptions about the data when querying it, leading to errors. Prior work has studied generating facts about the database to provide more context to NL2SQL agents, but such approaches simply restate database contents without addressing the agent's misconceptions. In this paper, we propose Tk-Boost, a bolt-on framework for augmenting any NL2SQL agent with tribal knowledge: knowledge that corrects the agent's misconceptions in querying the database accumulated through experience using the database. To accumulate experience, Tk-Boost first asks the NL2SQL agent to answer a few queries on the database, identifies the agent's misconceptions by analyzing its mistakes on the database, and generates tribal knowledge to address them. To enable accurate retrieval, Tk-Boost indexes this knowledge with applicability conditions that specify the query features for which the knowledge is useful. When answering new queries, Tk-Boost uses this knowledge to provide feedback to the NL2SQL agent, resolving the agent's misconceptions during SQL generation, and thus improving the agent's accuracy. Extensive experiments across the BIRD and Spider 2.0 benchmarks with various NL2SQL agents shows Tk-Boost improves NL2SQL agents accuracy by up to 16.9% on Spider 2.0 and 13.7% on BIRD</description>
