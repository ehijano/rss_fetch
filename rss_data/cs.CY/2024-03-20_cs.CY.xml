      <title>(Beyond) Reasonable Doubt: Challenges that Public Defenders Face in Scrutinizing AI in Court</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accountable use of AI systems in high-stakes settings relies on making systems contestable. In this paper we study efforts to contest AI systems in practice by studying how public defenders scrutinize AI in court. We present findings from interviews with 17 people in the U.S. public defense community to understand their perceptions of and experiences scrutinizing computational forensic software (CFS) -- automated decision systems that the government uses to convict and incarcerate, such as facial recognition, gunshot detection, and probabilistic genotyping tools. We find that our participants faced challenges assessing and contesting CFS reliability due to difficulties (a) navigating how CFS is developed and used, (b) overcoming judges and jurors' non-critical perceptions of CFS, and (c) gathering CFS expertise. To conclude, we provide recommendations that center the technical, social, and institutional context to better position interventions such as performance evaluations to support contestability in practice.</description>

      <title>A Canary in the AI Coal Mine: American Jews May Be Disproportionately Harmed by Intellectual Property Dispossession in Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systemic property dispossession from minority groups has often been carried out in the name of technological progress. In this paper, we identify evidence that the current paradigm of large language models (LLMs) likely continues this long history. Examining common LLM training datasets, we find that a disproportionate amount of content authored by Jewish Americans is used for training without their consent. The degree of over-representation ranges from around 2x to around 6.5x. Given that LLMs may substitute for the paid labor of those who produced their training data, they have the potential to cause even more substantial and disproportionate economic harm to Jewish Americans in the coming years. This paper focuses on Jewish Americans as a case study, but it is probable that other minority communities (e.g., Asian Americans, Hindu Americans) may be similarly affected and, most importantly, the results should likely be interpreted as a "canary in the coal mine" that highlights deep structural concerns about the current LLM paradigm whose harms could soon affect nearly everyone. We discuss the implications of these results for the policymakers thinking about how to regulate LLMs as well as for those in the AI field who are working to advance LLMs. Our findings stress the importance of working together towards alternative LLM paradigms that avoid both disparate impacts and widespread societal harms.</description>

      <title>Community Needs and Assets: A Computational Analysis of Community Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A community needs assessment is a tool used by non-profits and government agencies to quantify the strengths and issues of a community, allowing them to allocate their resources better. Such approaches are transitioning towards leveraging social media conversations to analyze the needs of communities and the assets already present within them. However, manual analysis of exponentially increasing social media conversations is challenging. There is a gap in the present literature in computationally analyzing how community members discuss the strengths and needs of the community. To address this gap, we introduce the task of identifying, extracting, and categorizing community needs and assets from conversational data using sophisticated natural language processing methods. To facilitate this task, we introduce the first dataset about community needs and assets consisting of 3,511 conversations from Reddit, annotated using crowdsourced workers. Using this dataset, we evaluate an utterance-level classification model compared to sentiment classification and a popular large language model (in a zero-shot setting), where we find that our model outperforms both baselines at an F1 score of 94% compared to 49% and 61% respectively. Furthermore, we observe through our study that conversations about needs have negative sentiments and emotions, while conversations about assets focus on location and entities. The dataset is available at https://github.com/towhidabsar/CommunityNeeds.</description>

      <title>Analysing Guarantees in Australian Senate Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single Transferable Vote (STV) is used to elect candidates to the 76 seat Australian Senate across six states and two territories. These eight STV contests are counted using a combination of ballot scanners, manual data entry and tabulation software. On election night, some properties of the set of cast ballots are determined by hand. This includes the first preference tallies of each party. This technical report considers whether there are some properties, such as individual candidates' first preference tallies, that, if assumed to be accurate, imply a portion of the election outcome. The paper also presents an interesting example showing that the rules of STV tabulation used for the Australian Senate can allow bizarre behaviour, such as votes increasing in value over time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots in higher education institutions (HEIs) is reshaping the educational landscape, offering opportunities for enhanced student support, and administrative and research efficiency. This study explores the future implications of generative AI chatbots in HEIs, aiming to understand their potential impact on teaching and learning, and research processes. Utilizing a narrative literature review (NLR) methodology, this study synthesizes existing research on generative AI chatbots in higher education from diverse sources, including academic databases and scholarly publications. The findings highlight the transformative potential of generative AI chatbots in streamlining administrative tasks, enhancing student learning experiences, and supporting research activities. However, challenges such as academic integrity concerns, user input understanding, and resource allocation pose significant obstacles to the effective integration of generative AI chatbots in HEIs. This study underscores the importance of proactive measures to address ethical considerations, provide comprehensive training for stakeholders, and establish clear guidelines for the responsible use of generative AI chatbots in higher education. By navigating these challenges, and leveraging the benefits of generative AI technologies, HEIs can harness the full potential of generative AI chatbots to create a more efficient, effective, inclusive, and innovative educational environment.</description>

      <title>Conceptualizing predictive conceptual model for unemployment rates in the implementation of Industry 4.0: Exploring machine learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although there are obstacles related to obtaining data, ensuring model precision, and upholding ethical standards, the advantages of utilizing machine learning to generate predictive models for unemployment rates in developing nations amid the implementation of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) are noteworthy. This research delves into the concept of utilizing machine learning techniques through a predictive conceptual model to understand and address factors that contribute to unemployment rates in developing nations during the implementation of I4.0. A thorough examination of the literature was carried out through a literature review to determine the economic and social factors that have an impact on the unemployment rates in developing nations. The examination of the literature uncovered that considerable influence on unemployment rates in developing nations is attributed to elements such as economic growth, inflation, population increase, education levels, and technological progress. A predictive conceptual model was developed that indicates factors that contribute to unemployment in developing nations can be addressed by using techniques of machine learning like regression analysis and neural networks when adopting I4.0. The study's findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed predictive conceptual model in accurately understanding and addressing unemployment rate factors within developing nations when deploying I4.0. The model serves a dual purpose of predicting future unemployment rates and tracking the advancement of reducing unemployment rates in emerging economies. By persistently conducting research and improvements, decision-makers and enterprises can employ these patterns to arrive at more knowledgeable judgments that can advance the growth of the economy, generation of employment, and alleviation of poverty specifically in emerging nations.</description>

      <title>Towards Unsupervised Question Answering System with Multi-level Summarization for Legal Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper summarizes Team SCaLAR's work on SemEval-2024 Task 5: Legal Argument Reasoning in Civil Procedure. To address this Binary Classification task, which was daunting due to the complexity of the Legal Texts involved, we propose a simple yet novel similarity and distance-based unsupervised approach to generate labels. Further, we explore the Multi-level fusion of Legal-Bert embeddings using ensemble features, including CNN, GRU, and LSTM. To address the lengthy nature of Legal explanation in the dataset, we introduce T5-based segment-wise summarization, which successfully retained crucial information, enhancing the model's performance. Our unsupervised system witnessed a 20-point increase in macro F1-score on the development set and a 10-point increase on the test set, which is promising given its uncomplicated architecture.</description>

      <title>Predictive, scalable and interpretable knowledge tracing on structured domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems optimize the selection and timing of learning materials to enhance understanding and long-term retention. This requires estimates of both the learner's progress (''knowledge tracing''; KT), and the prerequisite structure of the learning domain (''knowledge mapping''). While recent deep learning models achieve high KT accuracy, they do so at the expense of the interpretability of psychologically-inspired models. In this work, we present a solution to this trade-off. PSI-KT is a hierarchical generative approach that explicitly models how both individual cognitive traits and the prerequisite structure of knowledge influence learning dynamics, thus achieving interpretability by design. Moreover, by using scalable Bayesian inference, PSI-KT targets the real-world need for efficient personalization even with a growing body of learners and learning histories. Evaluated on three datasets from online learning platforms, PSI-KT achieves superior multi-step predictive accuracy and scalable inference in continual-learning settings, all while providing interpretable representations of learner-specific traits and the prerequisite structure of knowledge that causally supports learning. In sum, predictive, scalable and interpretable knowledge tracing with solid knowledge mapping lays a key foundation for effective personalized learning to make education accessible to a broad, global audience.</description>

      <title>From Representational Harms to Quality-of-Service Harms: A Case Study on Llama 2 Safety Safeguards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption in various domains. However, these advancements have also introduced additional safety risks and raised concerns regarding their detrimental impact on already marginalized populations. Despite growing mitigation efforts to develop safety safeguards, such as supervised safety-oriented fine-tuning and leveraging safe reinforcement learning from human feedback, multiple concerns regarding the safety and ingrained biases in these models remain. Furthermore, previous work has demonstrated that models optimized for safety often display exaggerated safety behaviors, such as a tendency to refrain from responding to certain requests as a precautionary measure. As such, a clear trade-off between the helpfulness and safety of these models has been documented in the literature. In this paper, we further investigate the effectiveness of safety measures by evaluating models on already mitigated biases. Using the case of Llama 2 as an example, we illustrate how LLMs' safety responses can still encode harmful assumptions. To do so, we create a set of non-toxic prompts, which we then use to evaluate Llama models. Through our new taxonomy of LLMs responses to users, we observe that the safety/helpfulness trade-offs are more pronounced for certain demographic groups which can lead to quality-of-service harms for marginalized populations.</description>

      <title>Divide-Conquer Transformer Learning for Predicting Electric Vehicle Charging Events Using Smart Meter Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting electric vehicle (EV) charging events is crucial for load scheduling and energy management, promoting seamless transportation electrification and decarbonization. While prior studies have focused on EV charging demand prediction, primarily for public charging stations using historical charging data, home charging prediction is equally essential. However, existing prediction methods may not be suitable due to the unavailability of or limited access to home charging data. To address this research gap, inspired by the concept of non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), we develop a home charging prediction method using historical smart meter data. Different from NILM detecting EV charging that has already occurred, our method provides predictive information of future EV charging occurrences, thus enhancing its utility for charging management. Specifically, our method, leverages a self-attention mechanism-based transformer model, employing a ``divide-conquer'' strategy, to process historical meter data to effectively and learn EV charging representation for charging occurrence prediction. Our method enables prediction at one-minute interval hour-ahead. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving consistently high accuracy of over 96.81\% across different prediction time spans. Notably, our method achieves high prediction performance solely using smart meter data, making it a practical and suitable solution for grid operators.</description>

      <title>Agent Group Chat: An Interactive Group Chat Simulacra For Better Eliciting Collective Emergent Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate the role of language in human collective behaviors, we developed the Agent Group Chat simulation to simulate linguistic interactions among multi-agent in different settings. Agents are asked to free chat in this simulation for their own purposes based on their character setting, aiming to see agents exhibit emergent behaviours that are both unforeseen and significant. Four narrative scenarios, Inheritance Disputes, Law Court Debates, Philosophical Discourses, Movie Casting Contention, are integrated into Agent Group Chat to evaluate its support for diverse storylines. By configuring specific environmental settings within Agent Group Chat, we are able to assess whether agents exhibit behaviors that align with human expectations. We evaluate the disorder within the environment by computing the n-gram Shannon entropy of all the content speak by characters. Our findings reveal that under the premise of agents possessing substantial alignment with human expectations, facilitating more extensive information exchange within the simulation ensures greater orderliness amidst diversity, which leads to the emergence of more unexpected and meaningful emergent behaviors. The code is open source in https://github.com/MikeGu721/AgentGroup, and online platform will be open soon.</description>

      <title>How Gender Interacts with Political Values: A Case Study on Czech BERT Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural language models, which reach state-of-the-art results on most natural language processing tasks, are trained on large text corpora that inevitably contain value-burdened content and often capture undesirable biases, which the models reflect. This case study focuses on the political biases of pre-trained encoders in Czech and compares them with a representative value survey. Because Czech is a gendered language, we also measure how the grammatical gender coincides with responses to men and women in the survey. We introduce a novel method for measuring the model's perceived political values. We find that the models do not assign statement probability following value-driven reasoning, and there is no systematic difference between feminine and masculine sentences. We conclude that BERT-sized models do not manifest systematic alignment with political values and that the biases observed in the models are rather due to superficial imitation of training data patterns than systematic value beliefs encoded in the models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Law Enforcement Training: A Gamified Approach to Detecting Terrorism Financing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tools for fighting cyber-criminal activities using new technologies are promoted and deployed every day. However, too often, they are unnecessarily complex and hard to use, requiring deep domain and technical knowledge. These characteristics often limit the engagement of law enforcement and end-users in these technologies that, despite their potential, remain misunderstood. For this reason, in this study, we describe our experience in combining learning and training methods and the potential benefits of gamification to enhance technology transfer and increase adult learning. In fact, in this case, participants are experienced practitioners in professions/industries that are exposed to terrorism financing (such as Law Enforcement Officers, Financial Investigation Officers, private investigators, etc.) We define training activities on different levels for increasing the exchange of information about new trends and criminal modus operandi among and within law enforcement agencies, intensifying cross-border cooperation and supporting efforts to combat and prevent terrorism funding activities. On the other hand, a game (hackathon) is designed to address realistic challenges related to the dark net, crypto assets, new payment systems and dark web marketplaces that could be used for terrorist activities. The entire methodology was evaluated using quizzes, contest results, and engagement metrics. In particular, training events show about 60% of participants complete the 11-week training course, while the Hackathon results, gathered in two pilot studies (Madrid and The Hague), show increasing expertise among the participants (progression in the achieved points on average). At the same time, more than 70% of participants positively evaluate the use of the gamification approach, and more than 85% of them consider the implemented Use Cases suitable for their investigations.</description>

      <title>NELA-PS: A Dataset of Pink Slime News Articles for the Study of Local News Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pink slime news outlets automatically produce low-quality, often partisan content that is framed as authentic local news. Given that local news is trusted by Americans and is increasingly shutting down due to financial distress, pink slime news outlets have the potential to exploit local information voids. Yet, there are gaps in understanding of pink slime production practices and tactics, particularly over time. Hence, to support future research in this area, we built a dataset of over 7.9M articles from 1093 pink slime sources over 2.5 years.</description>

      <title>The Model Openness Framework: Promoting Completeness and Openness for Reproducibility, Transparency and Usability in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) offers unprecedented possibilities but its commercialization has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, bias, and safety. Many "open-source" GAI models lack the necessary components for full understanding and reproduction, and some use restrictive licenses, a practice known as "openwashing." We propose the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that rates machine learning models based on their completeness and openness, following principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. The MOF requires specific components of the model development lifecycle to be included and released under appropriate open licenses. This framework aims to prevent misrepresentation of models claiming to be open, guide researchers and developers in providing all model components under permissive licenses, and help companies, academia, and hobbyists identify models that can be safely adopted without restrictions. Wide adoption of the MOF will foster a more open AI ecosystem, accelerating research, innovation, and adoption.</description>

      <title>Machine-Made Media: Monitoring the Mobilization of Machine-Generated Articles on Misinformation and Mainstream News Websites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09820v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have gained traction, an increasing number of news websites have begun utilizing them to generate articles. However, not only can these language models produce factually inaccurate articles on reputable websites but disreputable news sites can utilize LLMs to mass produce misinformation. To begin to understand this phenomenon, we present one of the first large-scale studies of the prevalence of synthetic articles within online news media. To do this, we train a DeBERTa-based synthetic news detector and classify over 15.46 million articles from 3,074 misinformation and mainstream news websites. We find that between January 1, 2022, and May 1, 2023, the relative number of synthetic news articles increased by 57.3% on mainstream websites while increasing by 474% on misinformation sites. We find that this increase is largely driven by smaller less popular websites. Analyzing the impact of the release of ChatGPT using an interrupted-time-series, we show that while its release resulted in a marked increase in synthetic articles on small sites as well as misinformation news websites, there was not a corresponding increase on large mainstream news websites.</description>

      <title>Interoperability of the Metaverse: A Digital Ecosystem Perspective Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Metaverse is at the vanguard of the impending digital revolution, with the potential to significantly transform industries and lifestyles. However, in 2023, skepticism surfaced within industrial and academic spheres, raising concerns that excitement may outpace actual technological progress. Interoperability, recognized as a major barrier to the Metaverse's full potential, is central to this debate. CoinMarketCap's report in February 2023 indicated that of over 240 metaverse initiatives, most existed in isolation, underscoring the interoperability challenge. Despite consensus on its critical role, there is a research gap in exploring the impact on the Metaverse, significance, and developmental extent. Our study bridges this gap via a systematic literature review and content analysis of the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases, yielding 74 publications after a rigorous selection process. Interoperability, difficult to define due to varied contexts and lack of standardization, is central to the Metaverse, often seen as a digital ecosystem. Urs Gasser's framework, outlining technological, data, human, and institutional dimensions, systematically addresses interoperability complexities. Incorporating this framework, we dissect the literature for a comprehensive Metaverse interoperability overview. Our study seeks to establish benchmarks for future inquiries, navigating the complex field of Metaverse interoperability studies and contributing to academic advancement.</description>

      <title>FairSNA: Algorithmic Fairness in Social Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, designing fairness-aware methods has received much attention in various domains, including machine learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval. However, understanding structural bias and inequalities in social networks and designing fairness-aware methods for various research problems in social network analysis (SNA) have not received much attention. In this work, we highlight how the structural bias of social networks impacts the fairness of different SNA methods. We further discuss fairness aspects that should be considered while proposing network structure-based solutions for different SNA problems, such as link prediction, influence maximization, centrality ranking, and community detection. This paper clearly highlights that very few works have considered fairness and bias while proposing solutions; even these works are mainly focused on some research topics, such as link prediction, influence maximization, and PageRank. However, fairness has not yet been addressed for other research topics, such as influence blocking and community detection. We review state-of-the-art for different research topics in SNA, including the considered fairness constraints, their limitations, and our vision. This paper also covers evaluation metrics, available datasets, and synthetic network generating models used in such studies. Finally, we highlight various open research directions that require researchers' attention to bridge the gap between fairness and SNA.</description>

      <title>Analyzing User Engagement with TikTok's Short Format Video Recommendations using Data Donations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short-format videos have exploded on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. Despite this, the research community lacks large-scale empirical studies into how people engage with short-format videos and the role of recommendation systems that offer endless streams of such content. In this work, we analyze user engagement on TikTok using data we collect via a data donation system that allows TikTok users to donate their data. We recruited 347 TikTok users and collected 9.2M TikTok video recommendations they received. By analyzing user engagement, we find that the average daily usage time increases over the users' lifetime while the user attention remains stable at around 45%. We also find that users like more videos uploaded by people they follow than those recommended by people they do not follow. Our study offers valuable insights into how users engage with short-format videos on TikTok and lessons learned from designing a data donation system.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Privacy Risks of Individual Fairness in Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attraction due to their expansive real-world applications. To build trustworthy GNNs, two aspects - fairness and privacy - have emerged as critical considerations. Previous studies have separately examined the fairness and privacy aspects of GNNs, revealing their trade-off with GNN performance. Yet, the interplay between these two aspects remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of the interaction between the privacy risks of edge leakage and the individual fairness of a GNN. Our theoretical analysis unravels that edge privacy risks unfortunately escalate when the nodes' individual fairness improves. Such an issue hinders the accomplishment of privacy and fairness of GNNs at the same time. To balance fairness and privacy, we carefully introduce fairness-aware loss reweighting based on influence function and privacy-aware graph structure perturbation modules within a fine-tuning mechanism. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in achieving GNN fairness with limited performance compromise and controlled privacy risks. This work contributes to the comprehensively developing trustworthy GNNs by simultaneously addressing both fairness and privacy aspects.</description>

      <title>A Causal Framework to Evaluate Racial Bias in Law Enforcement Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in developing a data-driven method to evaluate race-induced biases in law enforcement systems. While the recent works have addressed this question in the context of police-civilian interactions using police stop data, they have two key limitations. First, bias can only be properly quantified if true criminality is accounted for in addition to race, but it is absent in prior works. Second, law enforcement systems are multi-stage and hence it is important to isolate the true source of bias within the "causal chain of interactions" rather than simply focusing on the end outcome; this can help guide reforms. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting a multi-stage causal framework incorporating criminality. We provide a theoretical characterization and an associated data-driven method to evaluate (a) the presence of any form of racial bias, and (b) if so, the primary source of such a bias in terms of race and criminality. Our framework identifies three canonical scenarios with distinct characteristics: in settings like (1) airport security, the primary source of observed bias against a race is likely to be bias in law enforcement against innocents of that race; (2) AI-empowered policing, the primary source of observed bias against a race is likely to be bias in law enforcement against criminals of that race; and (3) police-civilian interaction, the primary source of observed bias against a race could be bias in law enforcement against that race or bias from the general public in reporting against the other race. Through an extensive empirical study using police-civilian interaction data and 911 call data, we find an instance of such a counter-intuitive phenomenon: in New Orleans, the observed bias is against the majority race and the likely reason for it is the over-reporting (via 911 calls) of incidents involving the minority race by the general public.</description>
