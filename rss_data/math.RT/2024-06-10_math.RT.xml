      <title>Orbits and characters associated with rook placements for Sylow $p$-subgroups of finite orthogonal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup in a classical group over a finite field of characteristic $p$. The coadjoint orbits of the group $U$ play the key role in the description of irreducible complex characters of $U$. Almost all important classes of orbits and characters studied to the moment can be uniformly described as the orbits and characters associated with so-called orthogonal rook placements. In the paper, we study such orbits for the orthogonal group. We construct a polarization for the canonical form on such an orbit and present a semi-direct decomposition for the corresponding irreducible characters in the spirit of the Mackey little group method. As a corollary, we compute the dimension of an orbit associated with an orthogonal rook placement.</description>

      <title>Characters for extended affine Lie algebras; a combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of objects associated with general extended affine Lie algebras is typically distinct from their counterparts in affine Lie algebras. Our research focuses on studying characters and Cartan automorphisms, which appear in the study of Chevalley involutions and Chevalley bases for extended affine Lie algebras. We show that for almost all extended affine Lie algebras, any finite order Cartan automorphism is diagonal, and its corresponding combinatorial map is a character.</description>

      <title>Harder-Narasimhan filtrations of persistence modules: metric stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Harder-Narasimhan types are a family of discrete isomorphism invariants for representations of finite quivers. Previously (arXiv:2303.16075), we evaluated their discriminating power in the context of persistence modules over a finite poset, including multiparameter persistence modules (over a finite grid). In particular, we introduced the skyscraper invariant and proved it was strictly finer than the rank invariant. In order to study the stability of the skyscraper invariant, we extend its definition from the finite to the infinite setting and consider multiparameter persistence modules over $\mathbb Z ^n$ and $\mathbb R^n$. We then establish an erosion-type stability result for this version of the skyscraper invariant.</description>

      <title>Affine $\imath$quantum groups and twisted Yangians in Drinfeld presentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a family of algebras, twisted Yangians (of split type) in current generators and relations, via a degeneration of the Drinfeld presentation of affine $\imath$quantum groups (associated with split Satake diagrams). These new algebras admit PBW type bases and are shown to be a deformation of twisted current algebras; presentations for twisted current algebras are also provided. For type AI, it matches with the Drinfeld presentation of twisted Yangian obtained via Gauss decomposition. We conjecture that our split twisted Yangians are isomorphic to the corresponding ones in RTT presentation.</description>

      <title>Fans and polytopes in tilting theory I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15213v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite dimensional algebra $A$ over a field $k$, the 2-term silting complexes of $A$ gives a simplicial complex $\Delta(A)$ called the $g$-simplicial complex. We give tilting theoretic interpretations of the $h$-vectors and Dehn-Sommerville equations of $\Delta(A)$. Using $g$-vectors of 2-term silting complexes, $\Delta(A)$ gives a nonsingular fan $\Sigma(A)$ in the real Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathsf{proj} A)_{\mathbb{R}}$ called the $g$-fan. We give several basic properties of $\Sigma(A)$ including sign-coherence, sign decomposition, idempotent reductions, Jasso reductions, pairwise positivity and a connection with Newton polytopes of $A$-modules. Moreover, $\Sigma(A)$ gives a (possibly infinite and non-convex) polytope $P(A)$ in $K_0(\mathsf{proj} A)_{\mathbb{R}}$ called the $g$-polytope of $A$. We call $A$ $g$-convex if $P(A)$ is convex. In this case, we show that it is a reflexive polytope, and that the dual polytope is given by the 2-term simple minded collections of $A$. There are precisely 7 convex $g$-polyogons up to isomorphism. We give a classification of algebras whose $g$-polytopes are smooth Fano.
  We study $g$-fans and $g$-polytopes of two important classes of algebras. We show that the $g$-fan of a classical or generalized preprojective algebra is given by the Coxeter fan. It is $g$-convex if and only if it is of type $A$ or $B$, and in this case, its $g$-polytope is the dual polytope of the short root polytope. Moreover we classify Brauer graph algebras which are $g$-convex, and describe their $g$-polytopes as the root polytopes of type $A$ or $C$.</description>

      <title>Silting interval reduction and 0-Auslander extriangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a reduction technique for silting intervals in extriangulated categories, which we call "silting interval reduction". It provides a reduction technique for tilting subcategories when the extriangulated categories are exact categories.
  In 0-Auslander extriangulated categories (a generalization of the well-known two-term category $K^{[-1,0]}(\mathsf{proj}\Lambda)$ for an Artin algebra $\Lambda$), we provide a reduction theory for silting objects as an application of silting interval reduction. It unifies two-term silting reduction and Iyama-Yoshino's 2-Calabi-Yau reduction. The mutation theory developed by Gorsky, Nakaoka and Palu recently can be deduced from it. Since there are bijections between the silting objects and the support $\tau$-tilting modules over certain finite dimensional algebras, we show it is compatible with $\tau$-tilting reduction. This compatibility theorem also unifies the two compatibility theorems obtained by Jasso in his work on $\tau$-tilting reduction.
  We give a new construction for 0-Auslander extriangulated categories using silting mutation, together with silting interval reduction, we obtain some results on silting quivers. Finally, we prove that $d$-Auslander extriangulated categories are related to a certain sequence of silting mutations.</description>
