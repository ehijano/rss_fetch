      <title>A Satisfiability algorithm based on Simple Spinors of the Clifford algebra of $\mathbb{R}^{n,n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine the formulation of the Boolean satisfiability problem with $n$ Boolean variables in Clifford algebra ${\cal C}\ell(\mathbb{R}^{n,n})$ [3] and exploit this continuous setting to design a new unsatisfiability test. This algorithm is not combinatorial and proves unsatisfiability in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Embedding integrable spin models in solvable vertex models on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring a mapping among $n$-state spin and vertex models on the square lattice we argue that a given integrable spin model with edge weights satisfying the rapidity difference property can be formulated in the framework of an equivalent solvable vertex model. The Lax operator and the $\mathrm{R}$-matrix associated to the vertex model are built in terms of the edge weights of the spin model and these operators are shown to satisfy the Yang-Baxter algebra. The unitarity of the $\mathrm{R}$-matrix follows from an assumption that the vertical edge weights of the spin model satisfy certain local identity known as inversion relation. We apply this embedding to the scalar $n$-state Potts model and we argue that the corresponding $\mathrm{R}$-matrix can be written in terms of the underlying Temperley-Lieb operators. We also consider our construction for the integrable Ashkin-Teller model and the respective $\mathrm{R}$-matrix is expressed in terms of sixteen distinct weights parametrized by theta functions. We comment on the possible extention of our results to spin models whose edge weights are not expressible in terms of the difference of spectral parameters.</description>

      <title>Mixed state topological order: operator algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classification problem of mixed states in two-dimensional quantum spin systems in the operator algebraic framework of quantum statistical mechanics. We associate a braided $C^*$-tensor category to each state satisfying a mixed-state version of the approximate Haag duality. We study how this category behaves under decoherence: suppose the state is acted by a finite depth quantum channel. We prove that the braided $C^*$-tensor category of the final state is a braided $C^*$-tensor subcategory of the initial state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the case-(1) multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials of a discrete variable for 8 types ((dual)($q$-)Hahn, three kinds of $q$-Krawtchouk and $q$-Meixner). Based on them and the case-(1) multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials of Racah, $q$-Racah, Meixner, little $q$-Jacobi and little $q$-Laguerre types, exactly solvable continuous time birth and death processes are obtained. Their discrete time versions (Markov chains) are also obtained for finite types.</description>

      <title>Velocity Addition/Subtraction in Special Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider velocity addition/subtraction in Special Relativity and re-derive its well-known non-commutative and non-associative algebraic properties in a self contained way, including various explicit expressions for the Thomas angle, the derivation of which will be seen to be not as challenging as often suggested. All this is based on the polar-decomposition theorem in the traditional component language, in which Lorentz transformations are ordinary matrices. In the second part of this paper we offer a less familiar alternative geometric view, that leads to an invariant definition of the concept of relative velocity between two states of motion, which is based on the boost-link-theorem, of which we also offer an elementary proof that does not seem to be widely known in the relativity literature. Finally we compare this to the corresponding geometric definitions in Galilei-Newton spacetime, emphasising similarities and differences.</description>

      <title>Multivalued Wess-Zumino-Novikov Functional and Chiral Anomaly in Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19909v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hydrodynamic framework derived from the action of a perfect fluid, modified by the hydrodynamic analog of Novikov's multivalued functional. This modification introduces spin degrees of freedom into the fluid. The structure closely resembles the Abelian version of the Wess-Zumino functional, commonly applied in field theories with chiral anomalies. The deformation incorporates the transport properties of Weyl fermions and exhibits the chiral anomaly in the case of a charged fluid. It is also consistent with Onsager's semiclassical quantization of circulation. Additionally, we discuss the hydrodynamic analog of instantons and related topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Exact solvability of an Ising-type model, and exact solvability of the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</description>

      <title>Relational bundle geometric formulation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a bundle geometric formulation of non-relativistic many-particles Quantum Mechanics. A wave function is seen to be a $\mathbb{C}$-valued cocyclic tensorial 0-form on configuration space-time seen as a principal bundle, while the Schr\"odinger equation flows from its covariant derivative, with the action functional supplying a (flat) cocyclic connection 1-form on the configuration bundle. In line with the historical motivations of Dirac and Feynman, ours is thus a Lagrangian geometric formulation of QM, in which the Dirac-Feynman path integral arises in a geometrically natural way.
  Applying the dressing field method, we obtain a relational reformulation of this geometric non-relativistic QM: a relational wave function is realised as a basic cocyclic 0-form on the configuration bundle. In this relational QM, any particle position can be used as a dressing field, i.e. as a "physical reference frame". The dressing field method naturally accounts for the freedom in choosing the dressing field, which is readily understood as a covariance of the relational formulation under changes of physical reference frame.</description>

      <title>Equalities and inequalities from entanglement, loss, and beam splitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum optics bridges esoteric notions of entanglement and superposition with practical applications like metrology and communication. Throughout, there is an interplay between information theoretic concepts such as entropy and physical considerations such as quantum system design, noise, and loss. Therefore, a fundamental result at the heart of these fields has numerous ramifications in development of applications and advancing our understanding of quantum physics. Our recent proof for the entanglement properties of states interfering with the vacuum on a beam splitter led to monotonicity and convexity properties for quantum states undergoing photon loss [Lupu-Gladstein et al., arXiv:2411.03423 (2024)] by breathing life into a decades-old conjecture. In this work, we extend these fundamental properties to measures of similarity between states, provide inequalities for creation and annihilation operators beyond the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, prove a conjecture [Hertz et al., PRA 110, 012408 (2024)] dictating that nonclassicality through the quadrature coherence scale is uncertifiable beyond a loss of 50%, and place constraints on quasiprobability distributions of all physical states. These ideas can now circulate afresh throughout quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Green functions and Lagrangian intersection. Applications to the propagation of Bessel beams in non-homogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study semi-classical asymptotics for problems with localized right-hand sides by considering a Hamiltonian $H(x,p)$ positively homogeneous of degree $m\geq1$ on $T^*{\bf R}^n\setminus0$. The energy shell is $H(x,p)=E$, and the right-hand side $f_h$ is microlocalized: (1) on the vertical plane $\Lambda_0=\{x=x_0\}$; (2) on the ``cylinder'' $\Lambda_0=\{(X,P)=\bigl(\varphi\omega(\psi),\omega(\psi)\bigr); \ \varphi\in {\bf R}, \omega(\psi)=(\cos\psi,\sin\psi)\}$. when $n=2$. Most precise results are obtained in the isotropic case $H(x,p)={|p|^m\over\rho(x)}$, with $\rho$ a smooth positive function. In case (2), $\Lambda_0$ is the frequency set of Bessel function $J_0({|x|\over h})$, and the solution $u_h$ of $(H(x,hD_x)-E)u_h=f_h$ when $m=1$, already provides an insight in the structure of ``Bessel beams'', which arise in the theory of optical fibers. We present in this work some extensions of A.Anikin, S.Dobrokhotov, V.Nazaikinskii, M.Rouleux, Theor. Math. Phys. 214(1): p.1-23, 2023. In Sect.3 we sketch the semi-classical counterpart of the construction of parametrices for the Cauchy problem with Lagrangian intersections, as is set up by R.Melrose and G.Uhlmann. This involves Maslov {\it bi-canonical operator}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The description of the gravitation energy is a long standing problem. Although some success has been achieved, there is no satisfactory solution to this problem yet. Probably the most promising approach to this problem is given by teleparallelism. Many consistent and interesting results have been obtained in the context of the so-called Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, including results obtained with spacetimes that are neither static nor asymptotically flat. One example is the analysis of the plus-polarized $pp$-waves that has been made recently [Phys. Rev. D 108, 044043 (2023)]. In this paper, this analysis is extended to arbitrary polarization and some new results that shows the consistency of the teleparallel approach is obtained.</description>

      <title>Conformal Solutions of Static Plane Symmetric Cosmological Models in Cases of a Perfect Fluid and a Cosmic String Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we obtained exact solutions of Einstein's field equations for plane symmetric cosmological models by assuming that thy admit conformal motion. The space-time geometry of these solutions is found to be nonsingular, non-vacuum and conformally flat. We have shown that in the case of a perfect fluid, these solutions have an energy-momentum tensor possessing dark energy with negative pressure and the energy equation of state is $\rho +p=0$. We have shown that a fluid has acceleration, rotation, shear-free, vanishing expansion, and rotation. In the case of a cosmic string cloud, we found that the tension density and particle density decrease as the fluid moves along the direction of the strings, then vanish at infinity. We shown that the exact conformal solution for a static plane symmetric model reduces to the the well-known anti-De Sitter space time. We obtained that the space-time under consideration admits a conformal vector field orthogonal to the four-velocity vector and does not admits a vector parallel to the four-velocity vector. Some physical and kinematic properties of the resulting models are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quest for quantum advantage: Monte Carlo wave-function simulations of the Coherent Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) is a quantum network of optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) intended to find ground states of the Ising model. This is an NP-hard problem, related to several important minimization problems, including the max-cut graph problem, and many similar problems. In order to enhance its potential performance, we analyze the coherent coupling strategy for the CIM in a highly quantum regime. To explore this limit we employ accurate numerical simulations. Due to the inherent complexity of the system, the maximum network size is limited. While master equation methods can be used, their scalability diminishes rapidly for larger systems. Instead, we use Monte Carlo wave-function methods, which scale as the wave-function dimension, and use large numbers of samples. These simulations involve Hilbert spaces exceeding $10^{7}$ dimensions. To evaluate success probabilities, we use quadrature probabilities. We demonstrate the potential for quantum computational advantage through improved simulation times and success rates in a low-dissipation regime, by using quantum superpositions and time varying couplings to give enhanced quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization and eigenvalue asymptotics: power-law unbounded discrete operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a notion of Strong Power-Law SULE, proving that such an assumption implies uniform power-law dynamical localization. As an application of this study, we obtain a result on dynamical localization for long-range hopping lattice operators with uniform electric field, where the hopping coefficients decay slowly. We also prove, on a hypothesis of semi-uniform polynomial decay of eigenfunctions, that the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators of the form $H = A + V$ in $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$, where $A$ is bounded and $V$ grows according to a power-law $n^\alpha$, is governed by the same power-law $n^\alpha$; in particular, one has a new interpretation of results on the stable asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues for such models with electric field under sufficiently small perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and prove a maximum principle for a natural quantity related to the $k$-point correlation function of the classical one-component Coulomb gas. As an application, we show that the gas is confined to the droplet by a well-known effective potential in dimensions two and higher. We also prove new upper bounds for the particle density in the droplet that apply at any temperature. In particular, we give the first controls on the microscopic point process for high temperature Coulomb gases beyond the mean-field regime, proving that their laws are uniformly tight in the particle number $N$ for any inverse temperatures $\beta_N$. Furthermore, we prove that limit points are homogeneous mixed Poisson point processes if $\beta_N\to 0$.</description>

      <title>Encrypted Qubits can be Cloned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation, and each of the encrypted clones can be decrypted through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. A possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage. Beyond applications in cryptography, encrypted cloning could provide a form of redundancy, parallelism, fault tolerance or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem.</description>

      <title>On the Polynomial Degeneracy of Ricci Invariants and Spacetime Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the connection of a general relativistic matter-energy momentum tensor with the polynomial degeneracies of higher order curvature invariants defined in Riemannian geometry. The degeneracies enforce additional constraints on the energy-momentum tensor components. Due to these constraints the formation of a curvature singularity, for instance during a gravitational collapse can no longer be treated as inevitable. We find that there can be a formation of singularity iff the interior fluid evolves into (i) a pressure-less dust, (ii) an isotropic sphere or (iii) a distribution with negative pressure.</description>

      <title>Growth-fragmentations, Brownian cone excursions and SLE(6) explorations of a quantum disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to present a growth-fragmentation process naturally embedded in a Brownian excursion from boundary to apex in a cone of angle $2\pi/3$. This growth-fragmentation process corresponds, via the so-called mating-of-trees encoding arXiv:1409.7055, to the quantum boundary length process associated with a branching $\mathrm{SLE}_6$ exploration of a $\gamma= \sqrt{8/3}$ quantum disc. However, our proof uses only Brownian motion techniques, and along the way we discover various properties of Brownian cone excursions and their connections with stable L\'evy processes. Assuming the mating of trees encoding, our results imply several fundamental properties of the ${\gamma}= \sqrt{8/3}$-quantum disc $\mathrm{SLE}_6$-exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use resurgent extrapolation and continuation methods to extract detailed analytic information about the tilted cusp anomalous dimension solely from its weak coupling and strong coupling expansions. This enables accurate and smooth interpolation between the weak and strong coupling limits, and identifies the relevant singularities governing the finite radius of convergence of the weak coupling expansion and the asymptotic nature of the strong coupling expansion. The input data is purely perturbative, generated from the BES equations, and these resurgent methods extract accurate non-perturbative information which matches the underlying physical structure.</description>

Abstract: The use of the vacuum projector $|0 \rangle \langle 0| $ and of the unitary Weyl operators enables us to construct a set of Hermitian dichotomic operators in relativistic scalar Quantum Field Theory in Minkowski spacetime. Employing test functions supported in diamond regions, both Bell and Mermin inequalities are studied by means of a numerical setup. In addition to reporting expressive violations of both inequalities, the cluster property is also checked.</description>

      <title>Positive geometries and canonical forms via mixed Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ''Positive geometries'' are a class of semi-algebraic domains which admit a unique ''canonical form'': a logarithmic form whose residues match the boundary structure of the domain. The study of such geometries is motivated by recent progress in particle physics, where the corresponding canonical forms are interpreted as the integrands of scattering amplitudes. We recast these concepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory, and identify ''genus zero pairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for the study of positive geometries and their canonical forms. In this framework, we prove some basic properties of canonical forms which have previously been proved or conjectured in the literature. We give many examples and study in detail the case of arrangements of hyperplanes and convex polytopes.</description>

      <title>Effects of Spatial Curvature on Blackbody Radiation: Modifications to Energy Distribution and Fundamental Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of spatial curvature on blackbody radiation. By employing an analog model of general relativity, we replace the conventional straight-line harmonic oscillators used to model blackbody radiation with oscillators on a circle. This innovative approach provides an effective framework for describing blackbody radiation influenced by spatial curvature. We derive the curvature-dependent Planck energy distribution and find that moving from flat to curved space results in a reduction in both the height and width of the Planck function. Moreover, increasing the curvature leads to a pronounced redshift in the peak frequency. We also analyze the influence of spatial curvature on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Rayleigh-Jeans law, and Wien law.</description>

      <title>Discrete stress-energy tensor in the loop O(n) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:1604.06339v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the loop $O(n)$ model on the honeycomb lattice. By means of local non-planar deformations of the lattice, we construct a discrete stress-energy tensor. For $n\in [0,2]$, it gives a new observable satisfying a part of Cauchy-Riemann equations. We conjecture that it is approximately discrete-holomorphic and converges to the stress-energy tensor in the continuum, which is known to be a holomorphic function with the Schwarzian conformal covariance. In support of this conjecture, we prove it for the case of $n=1$ which corresponds to the Ising model. Moreover, in this case, we show that the correlations of the discrete stress-energy tensor with primary fields converge to their continuous counterparts, which satisfy the OPEs given by the CFT with central charge $c=1/2$.
  Proving the conjecture for other values of $n$ remains a challenge. In particular, this would open a road to establishing the convergence of the interface to the corresponding $\mathrm{SLE}_\kappa$ in the scaling limit.</description>

Abstract: It is known in scattering theory that the minimal velocity bound plays a conclusive role in proving the asymptotic completeness of the wave operators. In this study, we prove the minimal velocity bound and other important estimates for the two-body Schroedinger-type operator with fractional powers. We assume that the pairwise potential functions belong to broad classes that include long-range decay and Coulomb-type local singularities. Our estimates are expected to be applied to prove the asymptotic completeness for the fractional Schroedinger-type operators in various (not only short-range but also long-range and N-body) situations.</description>

      <title>Magnetisation moment of a bounded 3D sample: asymptotic recovery from planar measurements on a large disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14776v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstruction of the overall magnetisation vector (net moment) of a sample from partial data of the magnetic field. Namely, motivated by a concrete experimental set-up, we deal with a situation when the magnetic field is measured on a portion of the plane in vicinity of the sample and only one (normal to the plane) component of the field is available. Under assumption that the measurement area is a sufficiently large disk (lying in a horizontal plane above the sample), we obtain a set of estimates for the components of the net moment vector with the accuracy which improves asymptotically with the increase of the measurement disk radius. Compared to our previous preliminary results, the asymptotic formulas are now rigorously justified and higher-order estimates are derived. Moreover, the presented approach, based on an appropriate splitting in the Fourier domain and estimates of oscillatory integrals (involving both small and large parameters), elucidates the derivation of asymptotic estimates of an arbitrary order, a possibility that was previously unclear. The obtained results are illustrated numerically and their robustness with respect to noise is discussed. The proposed methodology should be applicable to other magnetic and gravimetric problems with planar measurements.</description>

Our result apply to finite temperature Schur measures, and extends both the result of Okounkov in \cite{okounkovschurmeasures} and of Cafasso-Ruzza in \cite{cafassoruzza} concerning the finite-temperature Plancherel measure. Our proof lies on the semi-infinite wedge formalism and the Boson-Fermion correspondance.</description>

      <title>On the relaxation to equilibrium of a quantum oscillator interacting with a radiation field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we investigate from the point of view of spectral theory the problem of relaxation to thermodynamical equilibrium of a quantum harmonic oscillator interacting with a radiation field. Our starting point is a system of infinitely many Pauli master equations governing the time evolution of the occupation probabilities of the available quantum states. The system we consider is derived from the evolution equation for the reduced density operator obtained after the initial interaction of the oscillator with the radiation field, the latter acting as a heat bath. We provide a complete spectral analysis of the infinitesimal generator of the equations, showing thereby that it generates an infinite-dimensional system of hyperbolic type. This implies that every global solution to the equations converge exponentially rapidly toward the corresponding Gibbs equilibrium state. We also provide a complete spectral analysis of a linear pencil naturally associated with the Pauli equations. All of our considerations revolve around the notion of compactness, more specifically around the existence of a new compact embedding result involving a space of sequences of Sobolev type into a weighted space of square-integrable summable sequences.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions and the two-point function plateau for the hierarchical $|\varphi|^4$ model in dimensions 4 and higher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain precise plateau estimates for the two-point function of the finite-volume weakly-coupled hierarchical $|\varphi|^4$ model in dimensions $d \ge 4$, for both free and periodic boundary conditions, and for any number $n \ge 1$ of components of the field $\varphi$. We prove that, within a critical window around their respective effective critical points, the two-point functions for both free and periodic boundary conditions have a plateau, in the sense that they decay as $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ until reaching a constant plateau value of order $V^{-1/2}$ (with a logarithmic correction for $d=4$), where $V$ is size of the finite volume. The two critical windows for free and periodic boundary conditions do not overlap. The dependence of the plateau height on the location within the critical window is governed by an explicit $n$-dependent universal profile which is independent of the dimension. The proof is based on a rigorous renormalisation group method and extends the method used by Michta, Park and Slade (arXiv:2306.00896) to study the finite-volume susceptibility and related quantities. Our results lead to precise conjectures concerning Euclidean (non-hierarchical) models of spin systems and self-avoiding walk in dimensions $d \ge 4$.</description>

      <title>Computation of $\wp$-functions on plane algebraic curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05632v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical tools for computation of $\wp$-functions, also known as Kleinian, or multiply periodic, are proposed. In this connection, computation of periods of the both first and second kinds is reconsidered. An analytical approach to constructing Riemann surfaces of plane algebraic curves of low gonalities is used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and tetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical models of Riemann surfaces give full control over computation of the Abel image of any point or divisor. Therefore, computation of $\wp$-functions at Abel images of given divisors can be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi inversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves are considered in detail, and illustrated by examples. A method of finding the unique characteristic corresponding to the vector of Riemann constants is suggested for non-hyperelliptic and hyperelliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Graded colour Lie superalgebras for solving L\'evy-Leblond equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The L\'evy-Leblond equation with free potential admits a symmetry algebra that is a $ \mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2 $-graded colour Lie superalgebra (see arXiv:1609.08224). We extend this result in two directions by considering a time-independent version of the L\'evy-Leblond equation. First, we construct a $ \mathbb{Z}_2^3 $-graded colour Lie superalgebra containing operators that leave the eigenspaces invariant and demonstrate the utility of this algebra in constructing general solutions for the free equation. Second, we find that the ladder operators for the harmonic oscillator generate a $ \mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2 $-graded colour Lie superalgebra and we use the operators from this algebra to compute the spectrum. These results illustrate two points: the L\'evy-Leblond equation admits colour Lie superalgebras with gradings higher than $ \mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2 $ and colour Lie superalgebras appear for potentials besides the free potential.</description>

      <title>All 4 x 4 solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</description>

      <title>Factorisability of the Harer-Zagier Transform of the HOMFLY-PT polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Harer-Zagier (HZ) transform maps the HOMFLY-PT polynomial into a rational function. For some special knots and links, the latter has a simple factorised form, both in the numerator and denominator. This property seems to be preserved under full twists and concatenation with the Jucys-Murphy braid, which are hence used to generate infinite families with HZ factorisability. For such families, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial can be fully encoded in two sets of integers, corresponding to the numerator and denominator exponents. These exponents turn out to be related to the Khovanov homology and its Euler characteristics. A criterion for when factorisability occurs is found via a conjectural relation between the HOMFLY-PT and Kauffman polynomials, which is proven in several special cases. The latter is equivalent to the vanishing of the two-crosscap BPS invariant of topological strings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the cyclic representations $\Omega_{rs}$ of $ U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ at $q^N=1$ that depend upon two points $r,s$ in the chiral Potts algebraic curve. We show how $\Omega_{rs}$ is related to the tensor product $\rho_r\otimes \bar{\rho}_s$ of two representations of the upper Borel subalgebra of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$. This result is analogous to the factorization property of the Verma module of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ at generic-$q$ in terms of two q-oscillator representation of the Borel subalgebra - a key step in the construction of the Q-operator. We construct short exact sequences of the different representations and use the results to construct Q operators that satisfy TQ relations for $q^N=1$ for both the 6-vertex and $\tau_2$ models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the convergence of the discrete Makeenko-Migdal equations for the Yang-Mills model on $(\varepsilon \mathbf{Z})^{2}$ to their continuum counterparts on the plane, in an appropriate sense. The key step in the proof is identifying the limits of the contributions from deformations as the area derivatives of the Wilson loop expectations.</description>

Abstract: We carefully review the hierarchical construction by Bouch [Bouch2015] of trees on the square lattice that can be grown from its root in $L!/C^L$ distinct ways, where $L$ denotes the number of bonds constituting the tree, and $C&gt;1$ is a constant. (As discussed in Section IV.A of [ParkerCaoAvdoshkinScaffidiAltman2019] and Appendix A.3 of [ShiraishiTasaki2024], this result has an implication on the operator growth in quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions.)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.12985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first of two papers devoted to the proof of conformal invariance of the critical double random current model on the square lattice. More precisely, we show the convergence of loop ensembles obtained by taking the cluster boundaries in the sum of two independent currents with free and wired boundary conditions. The strategy is first to prove convergence of the associated height function to the continuum Gaussian free field, and then to characterize the scaling limit of the loop ensembles as certain local sets of this Gaussian Free Field. In this paper, we identify uniquely the possible subsequential limits of the loop ensembles. Combined with the second paper, this completes the proof of conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>Mapping hydrodynamics for the facilitated exclusion and zero-range processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic limit for two degenerate lattice gases, the \emph{facilitated exclusion process} (FEP) and the \emph{facilitated zero-range process} (FZRP), both in the symmetric and the asymmetric case. For both processes, the hydrodynamic limit in the symmetric case takes the form of a diffusive Stefan problem, whereas the asymmetric case is characterized by a hyperbolic Stefan problem. Although the FZRP is attractive, a property that we extensively use to derive its hydrodynamic limits in both cases, the FEP is not. To derive the hydrodynamic limit for the latter, we exploit that of the zero-range process, together with a classical mapping between exclusion and zero-range processes, both at the microscopic and macroscopic level. Due to the degeneracy of both processes, the asymmetric case is a new result, but our work also provides a simpler proof than the one that was previously proposed for the FEP in the symmetric case in \cite{blondel2021stefan}.</description>

      <title>Exhaustive Characterization of Quantum Many-Body Scars using Commutant Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) in the language of commutant algebras, which are defined as symmetry algebras of families of local Hamiltonians. This framework explains the origin of dynamically disconnected subspaces seen in models with exact QMBS, i.e., the large "thermal" subspace and the small "non-thermal" subspace, which are attributed to the existence of unconventional non-local conserved quantities in the commutant; hence this unifies the study of conventional symmetries and weak ergodicity breaking phenomena into a single framework. Furthermore, this language enables us to use the von Neumann Double Commutant Theorem (DCT) to formally write down the exhaustive algebra of all Hamiltonians with a desired set of QMBS, which demonstrates that QMBS survive under large classes of local perturbations. We illustrate this using several standard examples of QMBS, including the spin-1/2 ferromagnetic, AKLT, spin-1 XY $\pi$-bimagnon, and the electronic $\eta$-pairing towers of states; and in each of these cases we explicitly write down a set of generators for the full algebra of Hamiltonians with these QMBS.Understanding this hidden structure in QMBS Hamiltonians also allows us to recover results of previous "brute-force" numerical searches for such Hamiltonians. In addition, this language clearly demonstrates the equivalence of several unified formalisms for QMBS proposed in the literature, and also illustrates the connection between two apparently distinct classes of QMBS Hamiltonians -- those that are captured by the so-called Shiraishi-Mori construction, and those that lie beyond. Finally, we show that this framework motivates a precise definition for QMBS that automatically implies that they violate the conventional Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), and we discuss its implications to dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study counting functions of planar polygons arising from homological mirror symmetry of elliptic curves. We first analyze the signature and rationality of the quadratic forms corresponding to the signed areas of planar polygons. Then we prove the convergence, meromorphicity, and mock modularity of the counting functions of convex planar polygons satisfying certain rationality conditions on the quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>Hyperballistic transport in dense systems of charged particles under ac electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Langevin equation is ubiquitously employed to numerically simulate plasmas, colloids and electrolytes. However, the usual assumption of white noise becomes untenable when the system is subject to an external AC electric field. This is because the charged particles in the system, which provide the thermal bath for the particle transport, become themselves responsive to the AC field and the thermal noise is field-dependent and non-Markovian. We theoretically study the particle diffusivity in a Langevin transport model for a tagged charged particle immersed in a dense system of charged particles (plus also, possibly, other neutral particles) that act as the thermal bath, under an external AC electric field. This is done by properly accounting for the effects of the AC field on the thermal bath statistics. We analytically derive the time-dependent generalized diffusivity $D(t)$ for different initial conditions. The generalized diffusivity exhibits damped oscillatory-like behaviour with initial very large peaks, where the generalized diffusion coefficient is enhanced by orders of magnitude with respect to the infinite-time steady-state value. The latter coincides with the Stokes-Einstein diffusivity in the absence of external field. For initial conditions where the external field is already on at $t=0$ and the system is thermalized under DC conditions for $t \leq 0$, the short-time behaviour is hyperballistic, $MSD \sim t^4$ (where MSD is the mean-squared displacement), leading to giant enhancement of the particle transport. Finally, the theory elucidates the role of medium polarization on the local Lorentz field, and allows for estimates of the effective electric charge due to polarization by the surrounding charges.</description>

      <title>Modeling of groundwater flow in porous medium layered over inclined impermeable bed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mathematical model of groundwater flow in porous medium layered over inclined impermeable bed. In its full generality, this is a free-surface problem. To obtain analytically tractable model, we use generalized Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption for inclined impermeable bed. In this way, we arrive at parabolic partial differential equation which is a generalization of the classical Boussinesq equation. Novelty of our approach consists in considering nonlinear constitutive law of the power type. Thus introducing $p$-Laplacian-like differential operator into the Boussinesq equation. Unlike in the classical case of the Boussinesq equation, the convective term cannot be set aside from the main part of the diffusive term and remains incorporated within it.
  In the sequel of the paper, we analyze qualitative properties of the stationary solutions of our model. In particular, we study existence and regularity of weak solutions for the following boundary value problem \begin{equation*} \begin{aligned}
  &amp;
  -
  \frac{\rm d}{{\rm d} x}
  \left[
  (u(x) + H) \left|\frac{{\rm d} u}{{\rm d} x}(x) \cos(\varphi) + \sin(\varphi) \right|^{p - 2}
  \left(\frac{{\rm d} u}{{\rm d} x}(x) \cos(\varphi) + \sin(\varphi)\right)
  \right]
  &amp;
  \begin{aligned}
  &amp;
  =
  f(x)\,, &amp; \qquad\qquad x \in (-1,1)\,,
  &amp;
  u(-1) = u(1) = 0\,,&amp;
  \end{aligned} \end{aligned} \end{equation*} where $p&gt;1$, $H&gt;0$, $\varphi\in (0, \pi/2)$, $f\geq 0$, $f\in L^{1}(-1,1)$. In the case of $p&gt;2$, we study validity of Weak and Strong Maximum Principles as well. We use methods based on the linearization of the $p$-Laplacian-type problems in the vicinity of known solution, error estimates, and analysis of Green's function of the linearized problem.</description>

Abstract: We establish the non-degeneracy of bubbling solutions for singular mean field equations when the blow-up points are either regular or involve non-quantized singular sources. This extends the results from Bartolucci-Jevnikar-Lee-Yang \cite{bart-5}, which focused on regular blow-up points. As a consequence, we establish the strict convexity of the Entropy in the large energy limit for a specific class of two-dimensional domains in the Onsager mean field vortex model with singular sources.</description>

      <title>On exact overlaps of integrable matrix product states: inhomogeneities, twists and dressing formulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invoking a quantum dressing procedure as well as the representation theory of twisted Yangians we derive a number of summation formulas for the overlap between integrable matrix product states and Bethe eigenstates which involve only eigenvalues of fused transfer matrices and which are valid in the presence of inhomogeneities as well as twists. Although the method is general we specialize to the $SO(6)$ spin chain for which integrable matrix product states corresponding to evaluation representations of the twisted Yangian $Y^+(4)$ encode the information about one-point functions of the D3-D5 domain wall version of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. Considering the untwisted and homogeneous limit of our summation formulas we finally fill the last gap in the analytical understanding of the overlap formula for the $SO(6$) sector of the D3-D5 domain wall system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I prove a scalar curvature rigidity theorem for spheres. In particular, I prove that geodesic balls of radii strictly less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in $n+1~(n\geq 2)$ dimensional unit sphere are rigid under smooth perturbations that increase scalar curvature preserving the intrinsic geometry and the mean curvature of the boundary, and such rigidity result fails for the hemisphere. The proof of this assertion requires the notion of a real Killing connection and solution of the boundary value problem associated with its Dirac operator. The result serves as the sharpest refinement of the now-disproven Min-Oo conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Last passage percolation (LPP) is a model of a directed metric and a zero-temperature polymer where the main observable is a directed path evolving in a random environment accruing as energy the sum of the random weights along itself. When the environment has light tails and a fast decay of correlation, the fluctuations of LPP are predicted to be explained by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality theory. However, the KPZ theory is not expected to apply for many natural environments, particularly "critical" ones exhibiting a hierarchical structure often leading to logarithmic correlations.
  In this article, we initiate a novel study of LPP in such hierarchical environments by investigating two particularly interesting examples. The first is an i.i.d. environment but with a power-law distribution with an inverse quadratic tail decay which is conjectured to be the critical point for the validity of the KPZ scaling relation. The second is the Branching Random Walk which is a hierarchical approximation of the two-dimensional Gaussian Free Field. The second example may be viewed as a high-temperature (weak coupling) directed version of Liouville Quantum Gravity, which is a model of random geometry driven by the exponential of a logarithmically-correlated field. Due to the underlying fractal structure, LPP in such environments is expected to exhibit logarithmic correction terms with novel critical exponents. While discussions about such critical models appear in the physics literature, precise predictions about exponents seem to be missing. Developing a framework based on multi-scale analysis, we obtain bounds on such exponents and prove almost optimal concentration results in all dimensions for both models. As a byproduct of our analysis we answer a long-standing question of Martin on necessary and sufficient conditions for the linear growth of the LPP energy in i.i.d. environments.</description>

      <title>A First Look at Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These are expanded notes for a short series of lectures, presented at the University of Luxembourg in 2017, giving an introduction to some of the ideas of supersymmetry and supergeometry. In particular, we start from some motivating facts in physics, pass to the theory of supermanifolds, then to spinors, ending up at super-Minkowski space-times. We examine some salient mathematical issues with understanding supersymmetry in a classical setting and make no attempt to discuss phenomenologically interesting models. Moreover, the presentation is "light" in the sense that nothing is carefully proved. The audience of the seminars ranged from Ph.D. students to more experienced postdocs in mathematics. The audience was assumed to have a working knowledge of differential geometry, elementary category theory, and basic ideas from classical &amp; quantum mechanics. No knowledge of supersymmetry and supergeometry is assumed.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the directed landscape from the KPZ fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the directed landscape is the unique coupling of the KPZ fixed point from all initial conditions at all times satisfying three natural properties: independent increments, monotonicity, and shift commutativity. Equivalently, we show that the directed landscape is the unique directed metric on $\mathbb R^2$ with independent increments and KPZ fixed point marginals. This gives a framework for proving convergence to the directed landscape given convergence to the KPZ fixed point. We apply this framework to prove convergence to the directed landscape for a range of models, some without exact solvability: asymmetric exclusion processes with potentially non-nearest neighbour interactions, exotic couplings of ASEP, the random walk and Brownian web distance, and directed polymer models. All of our convergence theorems are new except for colored ASEP and the KPZ equation, where we provide alternative proofs.</description>

      <title>Spectral comparison results for Laplacians on discrete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recent literature, various authors have studied spectral comparison results for Schr\"odinger operators with discrete spectrum in different settings including Euclidean domains and quantum graphs. In this note we derive such spectral comparison results in a rather general framework for general and possibly infinite discrete graphs. Along the way, we establish a discrete version of the local Weyl law whose proof does neither involve any Tauberian theorem nor the Weyl law as used in the continuous case.</description>

      <title>An impediment to torsion from spectral geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modifications of standard general relativity that bring torsion into a game have a long-standing history. However, no convincing arguments exist for or against its presence in physically acceptable gravity models. In this Letter, we provide an argument based on spectral geometry (using methods of pseudo-differential calculus) that suggests that the torsion shall be excluded from the consideration. We demonstrate that there is no well-defined functional extending to the torsion-full case of the spectral formulation of the Einstein tensor.</description>

      <title>Stringy scaling of multi-tensor hard string scattering amplitudes and the K-identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) with n-2 tachyons and 2 tensor states at arbitrary mass levels. We discover the stringy scaling behavior of these HSSA. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2 transverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases comparing to the degree of stringy scaling dimM1 of the n-1 tachyons and 1 tensor HSSA calculated previously. Moreover, we propose a set of K-identities which is the key to demonstrate the stringy scaling behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove both the diagonal and off-diagonal K-identities for the 4-point HSSA and give numerical proofs of these K-identities for some higher point HSSA.</description>

      <title>The clock advance description of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short paper we propose to extend the ETAS model to micro-seismic events. For that we interpret the triggered events in an ETAS model as individual local clock advances of an independent background process. The solution of the ETAS model thus becomes the sum of an infinite Markov chain of independent time adjusted background processses. This allows the incorporation of events at all scales. No artificial small magnitude cutoff is needed.</description>
