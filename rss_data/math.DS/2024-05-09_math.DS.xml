      <title>Abundance of periodic orbits for typical impulsive flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impulsive dynamical systems, modeled by a continuous semiflow and an impulse function, may be discontinuous and may have non-intuitive topological properties, as the non-invariance of the non-wandering set or the non-existence of invariant probability measures. In this paper we study dynamical features of impulsive flows parameterized by the space of impulses. We prove that impulsive semiflows determined by a C1-Baire generic impulse are such that the set of hyperbolic periodic orbits is dense in the set of non-wandering points which meet the impulsive region. As a consequence, we provide sufficient conditions for the non-wandering set of a typical impulsive semiflow (except the discontinuity set) to be invariant. Several applications are given concerning impulsive semiflows obtained from billiard, Anosov and geometric Lorenz flows.</description>

      <title>Measures of maximal entropy for non-uniformly hyperbolic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $C^{1+}$ maps, possibly non-invertible and with singularities, we prove that each homoclinic class of an adapted hyperbolic measure carries at most one adapted hyperbolic measure of maximal entropy. We then apply this to study the finiteness/uniqueness of such measures in several different settings: finite horizon dispersing billiards, codimension one partially hyperbolic endomorphisms with "large" entropy, robustly non-uniformly hyperbolic volume-preserving endomorphisms as in Andersson-Carrasco-Saghin, and strongly transitive non-uniformly expanding maps.</description>

      <title>Sobolev mappings on metric spaces and Minkowski dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the class of compactly H\"older mappings between metric spaces and determine the extent to which they distort the Minkowski dimension of a given set. These mappings are defined purely with metric notions and can be seen as a generalization of Sobolev mappings, without the requirement for a measure on the source space. In fact, we show that if $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous mapping lying in some super-critical Newtonian-Sobolev space $N^{1,p}(X,\mu)$, under standard assumptions on the metric measure space $(X,d,\mu)$, it is then a compactly H\"older mapping. The dimension distortion result we obtain is new even for Sobolev mappings between weighted Euclidean spaces and generalizes previous results of Kaufman and Bishop-Hakobyan-Williams.</description>

      <title>Exploring the limits of the law of mass action in the mean field description of epidemics on Erd\"os-R\'enyi networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manner epidemics occurs in a social network depends on various elements, with two of the most influential being the relationships among individuals in the population and the mechanism of transmission. In this paper, we assume that the social network has a homogeneous random topology of Erd\"os-R\'enyi type. Regarding the contagion process, we assume that the probability of infection is proportional to the proportion of infected neighbours.
  We consider a constant population, whose individuals are the nodes of the social network, formed by two variable subpopulations: Susceptible and Infected (SI model). We simulate the epidemics on this random network and study whether the average dynamics can be described using a mean field approach in terms of Differential Equations, employing the law of mass action. We show that a macroscopic description could be applied for low average connectivity, adjusting the value of the contagion rate in a precise function. This dependence is illustrated by calculating the transient times for each connectivity.
  This study contributes valuable insights into the interplay between network connectivity, contagion dynamics, and the applicability of mean-field approximations. The delineation of critical thresholds and the distinctive behaviour at lower connectivity enable a deeper understanding of epidemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Shadowing of actions of hyperbolic groups on their boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the canonical action of every hyperbolic group on its Gromov boundary has the shadowing (aka pseudo-orbit tracing) property. In particular, this recovers the results of Mann et al. that such actions are topologically stable.</description>

      <title>Scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of scale to generalize and compare different invariants of metric spaces and their measures. Several versions of scales are introduced such as Hausdorff, packing, box, local and quantization. They moreover are defined for different growth, allowing in particular a refined study of infinite dimensional spaces. We prove general theorems comparing the different versions of scales. They are applied to describe geometries of ergodic decompositions, of the Wiener measure and of functional spaces. The first application solves a problem of Berger on the notions of emergence (2020); the second lies in the geometry of the Wiener measure and extends the work of Dereich-Lifshits (2005); the last refines Kolmogorov-Tikhomirov (1958) study on functional spaces.</description>

      <title>Finite Measures of Maximal Entropy for an Open Set of Partially Hyperbolic Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms $f$ with a one-dimensional central direction such that the unstable entropy exceeds the stable entropy. Our main result proves that such maps have a finite number of ergodic measures of maximal entropy. Moreover, any $C^{1+}$ diffeomorphism near $f$ in the $C^1$ topology possesses at most the same number of ergodic measures of maximal entropy. Our contribution is in extending the findings in [4] to arbitrary dimensions. We believe our technique, essentially distinct from the one in that paper, is robust and may find applications in further contexts.</description>

      <title>Action Functional as an Early Warning Indicator in the Space of Probability Measures via Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical transition and tipping phenomena between two meta-stable states in stochastic dynamical systems represents an important problem. In this work, we expand the methodology from the traditional Onsager-Machlup action functional, which typically identifies the most probable transition pathway between two meta-stable states, to investigate the evolutionary transition dynamics between two meta-stable invariant sets. To address this, we incorporate a comprehensive framework derived from Schr\"odinger bridge and Optimal Transport. In contrast to existing methodologies such as statistical analysis, bifurcation theory, information theory, statistical physics, topology, and graph theory for early warning indicators, we introduce a novel perspective on early warning signals within the realm of probability measures which enables the development of indicators grounded in action functionals.
  In order to validate our framework, we apply this methodology to the Morris-Lecar model, which exhibits the generation of the repetitive firing in certain neurons resulting from a saddle-node bifurcation on an invariant circle. By varying the current condition, we investigate the transition dynamics between a meta-stable state and a stable invariant set (the limit cycle or homo-clinic orbit) within Morris-Lecar model. Additionally, we analyze real Alzheimer's data from the ADNI database to explore early warning signals indicating the transition from healthy to pre-AD states. This framework not only expands the transition pathway to encompass measures between two specified densities on invariant sets but also demonstrates potential of early warning indicators or biomarkers in complex diseases.</description>

      <title>Competing bootstrap processes on the random graph $G(n,p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of classic bootstrap percolation in which two competing processes concurrently evolve on the same graph $G(n,p)$. Nodes can be in one of three states, conveniently represented by different colors: red, black and white. Initially, a given number $a_R$ of active red nodes (red seeds) are selected uniformly at random among the $n$ nodes. Similarly, a given number $a_B$ of active black nodes (black seeds) are selected uniformly at random among the other $n-a_R$ nodes. All remaining nodes are initially white (inactive). White nodes wake up at times dictated by independent Poisson clocks of rate 1. When a white node wakes up, it checks the state of its neighbors: if the number of red (black) neighbors exceeds the number of black (red) neighbors by a fixed amount $r \geq 2$, the node becomes an active red (black) node, and remains so forever. The parameters of the model are, besides $r$ (fixed) and $n$ (tending to $\infty$), the numbers $a_R$ ($a_B$) of initial red (black) seeds, and the edge existence probability $p=p(n)$. We study the size $A^*_R$ ($A^*_B$) of the final set of active red (black) nodes, identifying different regimes which are analyzed under suitable time-scales, allowing us to obtain detailed (asymptotic) temporal dynamics of the two concurrent activation processes.</description>
