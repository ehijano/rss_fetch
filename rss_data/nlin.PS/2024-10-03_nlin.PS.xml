      <title>Reproducibility via neural fields of visual illusions induced by localized stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the modeling of experiments conducted by Billock and Tsou [V. A. Billock and B. H. Tsou, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 104 (2007), pp. 8490--8495] using an Amari-type neural field that models the average membrane potential of neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). The study specifically focuses on a regular funnel pattern localized in the fovea or the peripheral visual field. It aims to comprehend and model the visual phenomena induced by this pattern, emphasizing their nonlinear nature. The research involves designing sensory inputs that mimic the visual stimuli from Billock and Tsou's experiments. The cortical outputs induced by these sensory inputs are then theoretically and numerically studied to assess their ability to model the experimentally observed visual effects at the V1 level. A crucial aspect of this study is the exploration of the effects induced by the nonlinear nature of neural responses. By highlighting the significance of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the emergence of these visual phenomena, the research suggests that an interplay of both types of neuronal activities plays a crucial role in visual processes, challenging the assumption that the latter is primarily driven by excitatory activities alone.</description>

      <title>Geometrically constrained sine-Gordon field: BPS solitons and their collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an enlarged $(1+1)$-dimensional model with two real scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$ whose scalar potential $V(\phi,\chi)$ has a standard $\chi^4$ sector and a sine-Gordon one for $\phi$. These fields are coupled through a generalizing function $f(\chi)$ that appears in the scalar potential and controls the nontrivial dynamics of $\phi$. We minimize the effective energy via the implementation of the BPS technique. We then obtain the Bogomol'nyi bound for the energy and the first-order equations whose solutions saturate that bound. We solve these equations for a nontrivial $f(\chi)$. As the result, BPS kinks with internal structures emerge. They exhibit a two-kink profile. i.e. an effect due to geometrical constrictions. We consider the linear stability of these new configurations. In this sense, we study the existence of internal modes that play an important role during the scattering process. We then investigate the kink-antikink collisions, and present the numerical results for the most interesting cases. We also comment about their most relevant features.</description>
