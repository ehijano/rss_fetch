      <title>(3+1)-D gravastar in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley-like massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical properties of a (3+1)-D gravastar in the context of massive gravity are discussed in this work. In present investigation, the field equations have been solved for a static, uncharged sphere in order to achieve the gravastar model as proposed by Mazur and Mottola [Mazur and Mottola in Report No. LA-UR-01-5067,(2001); Mazur and Mottola, {\em Proc Natl Acad Sci} USA 101:9545, (2004)]. We address length of thin shell, energy, and entropy for the thin shell containing an ultra-relativistic stiff fluid. Israel matching criteria are used to ensure that the inner and outside geometries join smoothly. It turns out that the behavior of the gravastar is entirely altered by the existence of the graviton mass. Particularly, when $m\rightarrow0$, our findings precisely matched the outcomes of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Black holes, multiple propagation speeds and energy extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics predicts the speed of light to be a universal speed of propagation of massless carriers. However, other possibilities exist -- including Lorentz-violating theories -- where different fundamental fields travel at different speeds. Black holes are interesting probes of such physics, as distinct fields would probe different horizons. Here, we build an exact spacetime for two interacting scalar fields which have different propagation speeds. One of these fields is able to probe the black hole interior of the other, giving rise to energy extraction from the black hole and a characteristic late-time relaxation. Our results provide further stimulus to the search for extra degrees of freedom, black hole instability, and extra ringdown modes in gravitational-wave events.</description>

      <title>Systematic Biases in Estimating the Properties of Black Holes Due to Inaccurate Gravitational-Wave Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) observations of binary black-hole (BBH) coalescences are expected to address outstanding questions in astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. Realizing the full discovery potential of upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing runs and new ground-based facilities hinges on accurate waveform models. Using linear-signal approximation methods and Bayesian analysis, we start to assess our readiness for what lies ahead using two state-of-the-art quasi-circular, spin-precessing models: \texttt{SEOBNRv5PHM} and \texttt{IMRPhenomXPHM}. We ascertain that current waveforms can accurately recover the distribution of masses in the LVK astrophysical population, but not spins. We find that systematic biases increase with detector-frame total mass, binary asymmetry, and spin-precession, with most such binaries incurring parameter biases, extending up to redshifts $\sim3$ in future detectors. Furthermore, we examine three ``golden'' events characterized by large mass ratios, significant spin magnitudes, and high precession, evaluating how systematic biases may affect their scientific outcomes. Our findings reveal that current waveforms fail to enable the unbiased measurement of the Hubble-Lema\^itre parameter from loud signals, even for current detectors. Moreover, highly asymmetric systems within the lower BH mass-gap exhibit biased measurements of the secondary-companion mass, which impacts the physics of both neutron stars and formation channels. Similarly, we deduce that the primary mass of massive binaries ($ &gt; 60 M_\odot$) will also be biased, affecting supernova physics. Future progress in analytical calculations and numerical-relativity simulations, crucial for calibrating the models, must target regions of the parameter space with significant biases to develop more accurate models. Only then can precision GW astronomy fulfill the promise it holds.</description>

      <title>Twistor initial data characterisation of pp-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note gives a concise derivation of a twistor-initial-data characterisation of pp-wave spacetimes in vacuum. The construction is based on a similar calculation for the Minkowski spacetime in [Class. Quantum Grav. 28 075010]. The key difference is that for the Minkowski spacetime a necessary condition is that $\nabla_{A}{}^{A'}\bar{\kappa}_{A'} \neq 0$. In this note it is shown that if $\nabla_{A}{}^{A'}\bar{\kappa}_{A'}=0$ then the development is a pp-wave spacetime. Furthermore, it is shown that such condition propagates off the initial hypersurface, which, in turn, gives a twistor initial data characterisation of pp-waves.</description>

      <title>A robust test of general relativity at the galactic scales by combining strong lensing systems and gravitational wave standard sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the parametrized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ is a robust test of general relativity (GR). In some modified theories of gravity, $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ may evolve with the redshift and deviate from one at high redshifts. This means that precise constraints on $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ acquired in the solar system experiments could not be sufficient to test such theories and it is necessary to constrain $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$with high precision at high redshifts. However, in many approaches aimed at extragalactic tests of GR, the results might be biased due to entanglement of various factors, such as cosmic curvature, cosmic opacity, and the Hubble constant. Strong lensing systems naturally provide a laboratory to test $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ at galactic scales and high redshifts, but there is degeneracy between measured strength of gravity and cosmic distances in the lensing system. Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star mergers (standard sirens) provide a direct way to break this degeneracy by providing self-calibrated measurements of the luminosity distance. {We investigate the possibility of estimating $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ by combining well measured strongly lensed systems with GW signals from coalescing neutron stars. Such combination provides a cosmological-model independent, relatively pure and unbiased method for the inference of $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ parameter, avoiding the influence of the above factors and the mass-sheet degeneracy in the lens.} Based on the simulated future 55 lensed quasar systems we demonstrated that the precision of $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ parameter obtained by our method could be of order of $\sim 10^{-2}$. One may reasonably expect that our approach will play an increasingly important role in precise testing the validity of general relativity at galactic scales and high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Constraining a disformal Schwarzschild black hole in DHOST theories with the orbit of the S2 star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the observed data of the S2 orbit around the black hole Sgr A$^*$ and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we make a constraint on parameters of a disformal Schwarzschild black hole in quadratic degenerate higher-order scalartensor (DHOST) theories. This black hole belongs to a class of non-stealth solutions and owns an extra disformal parameter described the deviation from general relativity. Our results show that the best fit value of the disformal parameter is positive. However, in the range of $1\sigma$, we also find that general relativity remains to be consistent with the observation of the S2 orbit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general static, spherically symmetric background in the quadratic beyond Horndeski theory and analyse the behaviour of linear perturbations in both parity odd and parity even sectors. We derive a full set of stability conditions for an arbitrary static, spherically symmetric solution which guarantees absence of ghosts, gradient instabilities, tachyons and superluminal modes in both sectors.</description>

      <title>Emergent Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete canonical formulation of general covariance makes it possible to construct new modified theories of gravity that are not of higher-curvature form, as shown here in a spherically symmetric setting. The usual uniqueness theorems are evaded by using a crucial and novel ingredient, allowing for fundamental fields of gravity distinct from an emergent space-time metric that provides a geometrical structure to all solutions. As specific examples, there are new expansion-shear couplings in cosmological models, a form of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) can appear in a space-time covariant theory without introducing extra fields, and related effects help to make effective models of canonical quantum gravity fully consistent with general covariance.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the black-hole charges of M87* and Sagittarius A* by lensing rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and other observations on M87* and Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which are supermassive objects in M87 and our galaxy, respectively, we can put a constrain on the electrical or alternative charges of M87* and Sgr A*. The constraints on the charges by the EHT collaboration are based on the change rate of the radius of a photon sphere while their general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes implies that the observed rings are formed by the gravitational lensing of synchrotron radiations from a hot plasma near supermassive black holes. On this paper, we investigate the constraints on the charges of M87* and Sgr A* by using the change rate of size of not the photon sphere but the lensing ring, which is the image of a disk edge at the innermost stable circular orbit of a particle, lensed nearly outside of the photon sphere as the simplest model. We show that the bounds of the charge by using the change rate of size of the lensing ring is more relaxed than the ones by the photon sphere obtained by the EHT collaboration. We concentrate on the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole spacetime in this paper, but our result implies the relaxation of the bound of the charge parameters on other black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of local static, vacuum five-dimensional solutions with two commuting spatial isometries describing a black hole with a $S^3$ horizon and a 2-cycle `bubble' in the domain of outer communications. The solutions are obtained by adding distortions to an asymptotically flat seed solution. We show that the conical singularities in the undistorted geometry can be removed by an appropriate choice of the distortion.</description>

      <title>Horizon-penetrating form of parametrized metrics for static and stationary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rezzolla-Zhidenko (RZ) and Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) frameworks provide an efficient approach to characterize agnostically spherically symmetric or stationary black-hole spacetimes in arbitrary metric theories. In their original construction, these metrics were defined only in the spacetime region outside of the event horizon, where they can reproduce any black-hole metric with with percent precision and a few parameters only. At the same time, numerical simulations of accreting black holes often require metric functions that are regular across the horizon, so that the inner boundary of the computational domain can be placed in a region that is causally disconnected from the exterior. We present a novel formulation of the RZ/KRZ parametrized metrics in coordinate systems that are regular at the horizon and defined everywhere in the interior. We compare the horizon-penetrating form of the KRZ and RZ metrics with the corresponding forms of the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild coordinates and of the Schwarzschild metric in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, remarking the similarities and differences. We expect the horizon-penetrating formulations of the RZ/KRZ metrics to represent new tools to study via simulations the physical processes that occur near the horizon of an arbitrary black hole.</description>

      <title>A de Sitter S-matrix from amputated cosmological correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending scattering to states with unphysical mass values (particles ``off their mass shell'') has been instrumental in developing modern amplitude technology for Minkowski spacetime. Here, we study the off-shell correlators which underpin the recently proposed S-matrix for scattering on de Sitter spacetime. By labelling each particle with both a spatial momentum and an independent ``energy'' variable (the de Sitter analogue of a 4-momentum), we find that the practical computation of these correlators is greatly simplified. This allows us to derive compact expressions for all 3- and 4-particle S-matrices at tree-level for scalar fields coupled through any derivative interactions. As on Minkowski, we find that the 3-particle and exchange part of the 4-particle S-matrices are unique (up to crossing). The remaining contact part of the 4-particle S-matrix is an analytic function of just two differential operators, which become the usual Mandelstam variables in the Minkowski limit. Finally, we introduce a spectral decomposition for the tree-level exchange of a heavy field responsible for a cosmological collider signal. Once projected onto physical mass eigenstates, these S-matrix elements encode the statistical properties of the early inflationary perturbations.</description>

      <title>Quantized $p$-form Gauge Field in D-dimensional de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we utilize the dynamic invariant method to obtain a solution for the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, aiming to explore the quantum theory of a $p$-form gauge field propagating in $D$-dimensional de Sitter spacetimes. Thus, we present a generalization, through the use of $p$-form gauge fields, of the quantization procedure for the scalar, electromagnetic, and Kalb-Ramond fields, all of which have been previously studied in the literature. We present an exact solution for the $p$-form gauge field when $D=2(p+1)$, and we highlight the connection of the $p=4$ case with the chiral $N=2$, $D=10$ superstring model. We could observe particle production for $D \neq 2(p+1)$ because the solutions are time-dependent. Additionally, observers in an accelerated co-moving reference frame will also experience a thermal bath. This could have significance in the realm of extra-dimensional physics and presents the intriguing prospect that precise observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background might confirm the presence of additional dimensions.</description>

      <title>Tensor gauge fields and dark matter in general relativity with fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The action of general relativity with fermions has two independent symmetries: general coordinate invariance and local Lorentz invariance. General coordinate transformations act on coordinates and tensor indices, while local Lorentz transformations act on Dirac and Lorentz indices, much like a noncompact internal symmetry. \par The internal-symmetry character of local Lorentz invariance suggests that it might be implemented by tensor gauge fields with their own Yang-Mills action rather than by the spin connection as in standard formulations. But because the Lorentz group is noncompact, their Yang-Mills action must be modified by a neutral vector field whose average value at low temperatures is timelike. This vector field and the tensor gauge fields are neutral and interact gravitationally, so they contribute to hot and cold dark matter. \par The two independent symmetries of the action are reduced to a single symmetry of the vacuum, local Lorentz invariance, by the nonzero average values of the tetrads $c^a_{\phantom{a} k}$. The local Lorentz invariance of general relativity with fermions can be extended to local U(2,2) invariance. \par If the contracted squares of the covariant derivatives of the tetrads multiplied by the square of a mass $M$ are added to the action, then in the limit $M^2 \to \infty$, the equation of motion of the tensor gauge fields is the vanishing of the covariant derivatives of the tetrads, which is Cartan's first equation of structure. In the same limit, the tensor gauge fields approach the spin connection.</description>

      <title>Integral identities and universal relations for solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive a continuous infinity of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>

      <title>Space-time deterministic graph rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-terminating graph rewriting models, whose local rules are applied non-deterministically -- and yet enjoy a strong form of determinism, namely space-time determinism. Of course in the case of terminating computation it is well-known that the mess introduced by asynchronous rule applications may not matter to the end result, as confluence conspires to produce a unique normal form. In the context of non-terminating computation however, confluence is a very weak property, and (almost) synchronous rule applications is always preferred e.g. when it comes to simulating dynamical systems. Here we provide sufficient conditions so that asynchronous local rule applications conspire to produce well-determined events in the space-time unfolding of the graph, regardless of their application orders. Our first example is an asynchronous simulation of a dynamical system. Our second example features time dilation, in the spirit of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Inflation, Proton Decay and Gravitational Waves from Metastable Strings in $SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a realistic supersymmetric $\mu$-hybrid inflation model within the framework of $SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R$ gauge symmetry, wherein the symmetry breaking $SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R\rightarrow SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_{B-L}\times U(1)_R$ occurs before observable inflation, effectively eliminating topologically stable primordial monopoles. Subsequent breaking of $U(1)_{B-L} \times U(1)_R \rightarrow U(1)_Y$ after inflation leads to the formation of superheavy metastable cosmic strings (CSs), capable of producing a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) consistent with the recent PTA data. Moreover, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ align with Planck 2018 observations. A consistent scenario for reheating and non-thermal leptogenesis is employed to explain the observed matter content of the universe. Finally, the embedding of $G_{421}$ into the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry $G_{422}$ is briefly discussed, predicting potentially observable proton decay rates detectable at facilities such as Hyper Kamiokande and DUNE.</description>

      <title>Tests of the Kerr Hypothesis with MAXI J1803-298 Using Different RELXILL_NK Flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iron line spectroscopy has been one of the leading methods not only for measuring the spins of accreting black holes but also for testing fundamental physics. Basing on such a method, we present an analysis of a dataset observed simultaneously by NuSTAR and NICER for the black hole binary candidate MAXI J1803-298, which shows prominent relativistic reflection features. Various relxill_nk flavors are utilized to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. The results obtained from our analysis provide stringent constraints on Johannsen deformation parameter $\alpha_{13}$ with the highest precise to date, namely $\alpha_{13}=0.023^{+0.071}_{-0.038}$ from relxillD_nk and $\alpha_{13}=0.006^{+0.045}_{-0.022}$ from relxillion_nk respectively in 3-$\sigma$ credible lever, where Johannsen metric reduces to Kerr metric when $\alpha_{13}$ vanishes. Furthermore, we investigate the best model-fit results using Akaike Information Criterion and assess its systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensate as a quantum gravity probe; "Erste Abhandlung"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate interacting with a gravitational wave for the case when the gravitational fluctuations are quantized in order to incorporate quantum gravity effects into the theory. We observe that the solution of the time-dependent part of the pseudo-Goldstone boson has infusions from the noise induced by gravitons and the corresponding differential equation of motion is Langevin-like. Using this result, we obtain the quantum gravity modified Fisher information which has been termed as the quantum gravitational Fisher information (QGFI). The inverse square root of the stochastic average of the QGFI gives the minimum uncertainty in the measurement of the gravitational wave amplitude. The minimum uncertainty does not go to infinity as the measurement time approaches zero in a quantum gravity setup rather it has a measurable finite value for gravitons with high squeezing. Finally, we observe the effect of decoherence due to interacting phonon modes in the QGFI and observe a less obvious decoherence effect for higher squeezing of the initial graviton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most promising mechanism of generating primordial black holes (PBHs) is by the enhancement of power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation, which is usually accompanied by the the enhancement of non-Gaussianity that crucially changes the abundance of PBHs. In this review I will discuss how non-Gaussianity is generated in single field inflation as well as in the curvaton scenario, and then discuss how to calculate PBH mass function with such non-Gaussianities. I also show non-Gaussianity only has mild effects on the induced gravitational waves (GWs), which gives robust predictions in the mHz and nHz GW experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed description of a quantum scalar field theory within a flat spacetime confined to a cavity with perfectly reflecting moving boundaries. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between this time-dependent setting and a field theory on an acoustic metric with static Dirichlet boundary conditions. We discuss the classical and quantum aspects of the theory from the latter perspective, accompanied by the introduction of novel numerical techniques designed for the (nonperturbative) computation of particle production attributed to the Dynamical Casimir effect, applicable to arbitrary boundary trajectories. As an illustrative example of these methodologies, we compute the particle production for a massless field in 1+1 dimensions. Notably, our approaches readily extend to encompass scenarios involving massive fields and higher dimensions</description>

      <title>Quantum Approach to Bound States in Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that (possibly non-unique) suitable field dynamics can be prescribed in spacetimes with timelike boundaries by means of appropriate boundary conditions. In Ref. [J. Math. Phys. {\bf 21}, 2802 (1980)], Wald derived a conserved energy functional for each prescribed dynamics. This conserved energy is related to the positive self-adjoint extensions of the spatial part $A$ of the wave equation $\partial^2\Phi/\partial t^2=-A\Phi$ ($A$ may not be, in principle, essentially self-adjoint). This is quite surprising since the canonical energy is not conserved in these cases. In this paper, we rederive this energy functional from an action principle (with appropriate boundary terms) following Ref. [Phys. Rev. D, {\bf 69}, 085005, (2004)] and consider field dynamics arising from non-positive self-adjoint extensions of $A$. The spectrum of the resulting theory fails to be positive and unstable mode solutions for classical fields come to light. By studying fields in half-Minkowski spacetime, we illustrate that these unstable classical solutions come as a consequence of an inverted parabolic potential governing their dynamics. From the quantum mechanical point of view, this leads to an effective inverted harmonic oscillator at the boundary. We then explore these unstable modes behavior, as well as their instabilities, at the quantum level.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave seismology of charged strange stars in the Cowling approximation: the fluid pulsation modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study, within the framework of Cowling approximation, the effect of the electric charge on the gravitational wave frequency of fluid oscillation modes of strange quark stars. For this purpose, the dense matter of the stellar fluid is described by the MIT bag model equation of state (EoS), while for the electric charge profile, we consider that the electric charge density is proportional to the energy density. We find that the gravitational wave frequencies change with the increment of electric charge; these effects are more noticeable at higher total mass values. We obtain that the $f$-mode is very sensitive to the change in the electric charge of the star. Furthermore, in the case of the $p_1$ mode, the effect of the electric charge is not very significant. Our results reveal that the study of the fundamental pulsation mode of an electrically charged compact star is very important to distinguish whether compact stars could contain electric charge.</description>

      <title>A minimal solution to the axion isocurvature problem from a non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main limitation for pre-inflationary breaking of Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is the upper bound on the Hubble rate during inflation from axion isocurvature fluctuations. This leads to a tension between high scale inflation and QCD axions with Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale decay constants, which reduces the potential for a detection of tensor modes at next generation CMB experiments. We propose a mechanism that excplicitly breaks PQ symmetry via non-minimal coupling to gravity, that lifts the axion mass above the Hubble scale during inflation and has negligible impact on today's axion potential. The initially heavy axion gets trapped at an intermediate minimum during inflation given by the phase of the non-minimal coupling, before it moves to its true CP-conserving minimum after inflation. During this stage it undergoes coherent oscillations around an adiabatically decreasing minimum, which slightly dilutes the axion energy density, while still being able to explain the observed dark matter relic abundance. This scenario can be tested by the combination of next generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD with haloscopes such as ABRACADABRA or CASPEr-Electric.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Clues: DESI, Dark Energy, and the Cosmological Constant Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several attempts to solve the cosmological constant problem, which concerns the value of the cosmological constant being extremely smaller than the Standard Model mass scales, have introduced a scalar field with a very flat potential that can be approximated as linear around any given position. The scalar field scans the cosmological constant in such a way that the current small value is explained. Recently, Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) reported the results of the first year. Combining the data with CMB, Pantheon, Union3, and/or DES-SN5YR, there is a preference or anomaly, indicating that the dark energy in the current Universe slightly deviates from that in the $\Lambda$CDM model and varies over time. In this paper, I show that the simple linear potential of a scalar field that may explain the small cosmological constant can explain the DESI anomaly. In particular, the model proposed by the present author in 2108.04246, which relaxes the cosmological constant by the condition that inflation ends, predicts a time-dependence of the dark energy close to the one favored by the data.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from false-vacuum islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, much attention has been focused on the false-vacuum islands that are flooded by an expanding ocean of true-vacuum bubbles slightly later than most of the other parts of the world. These delayed decay regions will accumulate locally larger vacuum energy density by staying in the false vacuum longer than those already transited into the true vacuum. A false-vacuum island with thus acquired density contrast of a super-horizon size will evolve locally from radiation dominance to vacuum dominance, creating a local baby Universe that can be regarded effectively as a local closed Universe. If such density contrasts of super-horizon sizes can ever grow large enough to exceed the threshold of gravitational collapse, primordial black holes will form similar to those collapsing curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales induced by small-scale enhancements during inflation. If not, such density contrasts can still induce curvature perturbations potentially observable today. In this paper, we revisit and elaborate on the generations of primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from delayed-decayed false-vacuum islands during asynchronous first-order phase transitions with fitting formulas convenient for future model-independent studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an effective approach for the study of the interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic waves (EMWs), showing that quadrirefringence can be produced, a phenomenon consisting in a frequency and polarization dependency of the speed of the different polarizations of GWs and EMWs, which is also inducing a frequency and polarization dependent modification of the GW-EMW luminosity distance ratio. Quadrirefringence can be due to the GW-EMW interaction in the source or during the propagation from the source to the observer. In the first case the astrophysical properties of the source can induce a unique characteristic imprint on GWs and EMWs for each source, the rainbow of binaries, while the effect on the propagation from the source could be used to probe the large scale electromagnetic field using GWs. Numerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations can be used to obtain precise theoretical predictions for different binary systems with large electromagnetic and gravitational fields, such as binary neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the recent release of the black hole image of Sgr A* alongside the earlier image of M87*, one can achieve an in-depth understanding of gravitational physics at the horizon scale. According to the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration, the observed image is consistent with the expected appearance of a Kerr black hole. In the present work, we consider Kerr-Newman black holes in Weyl-Cartan theory as a supermassive black hole (BH) and evaluate the parameters of the model with shadow size estimates done by the observations of M87* and Sgr A* from EHT. Such a study can be a possible way to distinguish Weyl-Cartan theory from general relativity and ensure the validity of the idea. Besides, we calculate the energy emission rate for the corresponding BH and discuss how the model's parameters affect the emission of particles around the black hole. With this investigation, we are able to examine the time evolution and lifetime of the black hole in such a theory of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) occurs when GWs experience local gravitational potential. In the weak lensing regime, it has been reported that a simple consistency relation holds between the variances of the magnification and phase modulation. In this paper, we present two additional consistency relations between the averages and variances of the weakly lensed GW signals in wave optics. We demonstrate that these consistency relations are derived as the weak lensing limit of the full-order relations for the averages of the amplification factor and its absolute square. These full-order relations appear to originate from energy conservation and the Shapiro time delay, and they are demonstrated to hold irrespective of the matter distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can classical systems be described analytically at all orders in their interaction strength? For periodic and approximately periodic systems, the answer is yes, as we show in this work. Our analytical approach, which we call the \textit{Quantum Spectral Method}, is based on a novel application of Bohr's correspondence principle, obtaining non-perturbative classical dynamics as the classical limit of \textit{quantum matrix elements}. A major application of our method is the calculation of self-force as the classical limit of atomic radiative transitions. We demonstrate this by calculating an adiabatic electromagnetic inspiral, along with its associated radiation, at all orders in the multipole expansion. Finally, we propose a future application of the QSM to compute scalar and gravitational self-force in Schwarzschild, analytically.</description>

      <title>A hybrid approach to long-term binary neutron-star simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in the numerical modeling of binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers is long-term simulations of the post-merger remnant over timescales of the order of seconds. When this modeling includes all the aspects of complex physics, the computational costs can easily become enormous. To address this challenge in part, we have developed a novel hybrid approach in which the solution from a general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) code solving the full set of the Einstein equations in Cartesian coordinates is coupled with another GRMHD code in which the Einstein equations are solved under the Conformally Flat Condition (CFC). The latter approximation has a long history and has been shown to provide an accurate description of compact objects in non-vacuum spacetimes. An important aspect of the CFC is that the elliptic equations need to be solved only for a fraction of the steps needed for the underlying HD/MHD evolution, thus allowing for a gain in computational efficiency that can be up to a factor of $\sim 6~(230)$ in three-dimensional (two-dimensional) simulations. We present the basic features of the new code, the strategies necessary to interface it when importing both two- and three-dimensional data, and a novel and robust approach to the recovery of the primitive variables. To validate our new framework, we have carried out code tests with various coordinate systems and different numbers of spatial dimensions, involving a variety of astrophysical scenarios, including the evolution of the post-merger remnant of a BNS merger over a timescale of one second. \texttt{BHAC+}, can accurately reproduce the evolution of compact objects in non-vacuum spacetimes and that, when compared with the evolution in full general relativity, the CFC reproduces accurately both the gravitational fields and the matter variables at a fraction of the computational costs.</description>

Abstract: This article, the first in a series, analyzes the general theory of plane wave spacetimes. Following Dmitri Aleekseevsky, these are defined as spacetimes admitting a group of dilations leaving invariant a smooth curve. If this curve is specified as part of the structure, the spacetime is termed a Penrose limit, whose theory was developed first by Roger Penrose. The main result is that every plane wave is a Rosen universe, a generalization of the smooth metrics of Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen, allowing for certain isolated co-ordinate singularities; the latter are characterized. We conclude with an extended example, using the techniques developed in the article to associate a vacuum plane wave in four dimensions to any hyperbolic billiard trajectory.</description>

      <title>On Thermodynamic Stability of Black Holes. Part II: AdS Family of Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is aimed at providing a thorough analysis of the classical thermodynamic stability of black holes within the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) family. We utilize the Nambu bracket formalism to calculate local heat capacities and employ Sylvester's criterion in the mass-energy ensemble to determine both local and global thermodynamic stability regions. Emphasizing the crucial role of the cosmological constant, we establish the conditions necessary for the existence of thermodynamically stable black hole configurations. Our work highlights the applicability of classical thermodynamics in understanding black hole physics, while acknowledging the potential deviations that may impact the observables of the system beyond the classical level.</description>

      <title>Selecting energy-momentum trace dependent gravity theories with LSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study scalar cosmological perturbations in $f(R, T)$ modified gravity theories being $T$ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We provide detailed equations for the matter energy density contrast. We solve then numerically to promote a comparison with available large scale structure (LSS) formation observational data on $f \sigma_8$ and also addressing the $S_8$ tension. We identify $f(R,T)$ models that lead either to growth enhancement or suppression. Since recent results in the literature indicate a preference for the latter feature, this type of analysis is quite useful to select viable modifications of gravity. We studied class of such $f(R,T)$ models are either ruled out or severely restricted.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cosmology in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, in an FLRW background and a perfect fluid equation of state, we explore the possibility of the realization of an emergent scenario in a 4D regularized extension of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, with the field equations particularly expressed in terms of scalar-tensor degrees of freedom. By assuming non-zero spatial curvature ($k = \pm 1$), the stability of the Einstein static universe (ESU) and its subsequent exit into the standard inflationary system is tested through different approaches. In terms of dynamical systems, a spatially closed universe rather than an open universe shows appealing behaviour to exhibit a graceful transition from the Einstein static universe to standard cosmological history. We found that under linear homogeneous perturbations, for some constraints imposed on the model parameters, the Einstein static universe is stable under those perturbations. Moreover, it is noted that for a successful graceful transition, the equation of state $\omega$ must satisfy the conditions $-1 &lt; \omega &lt;0$ and $\omega &lt; -1$ for closed and open universes, respectively. Also, under density perturbations, the Einstein static universe is unstable if the fluid satisfies the strong energy condition but is stable if it violates it, for both closed and open universes. Furthermore, the Einstein static universe is seen to be stable under vector perturbations and tensor perturbations, regardless of whether the fluid obeys or violates the SEC.</description>

      <title>Transdimensional inference for gravitational-wave astronomy with Bilby</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has become increasingly useful to answer questions in gravitational-wave astronomy using transdimensional models where the number of free parameters can be varied depending on the complexity required to fit the data. Given the growing interest in transdimensional inference, we introduce a new package for the Bayesian inference Library (Bilby) called tBilby. The tBilby package allows users to set up transdimensional inference calculations using the existing Bilby architecture with off-the-shelf nested samplers and/or Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Transdimensional models are particularly helpful when we seek to test theoretically uncertain predictions described by phenomenological models. For example, bursts of gravitational waves can be modelled using a superposition of N wavelets where N is itself a free parameter. Short pulses are modelled with small values of N whereas longer, more complicated signals are represented with a large number of wavelets stitched together. Other transdimensional models have found use describing instrumental noise and the population properties of gravitational-wave sources. We provide a few demonstrations of tBilby, including fitting the gravitational-wave signal GW150914 with a superposition of N sine-Gaussian wavelets. We outline our plans to further develop the tbilby code suite for a broader range of transdimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star - White Dwarf Binaries: Probing Formation Pathways and Natal Kicks with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron star-white dwarf (NS+WD) binaries offer a unique opportunity for studying NS-specific phenomena with gravitational waves. In this paper, we employ the binary population synthesis technique to study the Galactic population of NS+WDs with the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We anticipate approximately $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ detectable NS+WDs by LISA, encompassing both circular and eccentric binaries formed via different pathways. Despite the challenge of distinguishing NS+WDs from more prevalent double white dwarfs in the LISA data (especially at frequencies below 2 mHz), we show that their eccentricity and chirp mass distributions may provide avenues to explore the NS natal kicks and common envelope evolution. Additionally, we investigate the spatial distribution of detectable NS+WDs relative to the Galactic plane and discuss prospects for identifying electromagnetic counterparts at radio wavelengths. Our results emphasise LISA's capability to detect and characterise NS+WDs and to offer insights into the properties of the underlying population. Our conclusions carry significant implications for shaping LISA data analysis strategies and future data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Radial acceleration relation of galaxies with joint kinematic and weak-lensing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine kinematic and gravitational lensing data to construct the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) of galaxies over a large dynamic range. We improve on previous weak-lensing studies in two ways. First, we compute stellar masses using the same stellar population model as for the kinematic data. Second, we introduce a new method for converting excess surface density profiles to radial accelerations. This method is based on a new deprojection formula which is exact, computationally efficient, and gives smaller systematic uncertainties than previous methods. We find that the RAR inferred from weak-lensing data smoothly continues that inferred from kinematic data by about $2.5\,\mathrm{dex}$ in acceleration. Contrary to previous studies, we find that early- and late-type galaxies lie on the same joint RAR when a sufficiently strict isolation criterion is adopted and their stellar and gas masses are estimated consistently with the kinematic RAR.</description>

      <title>Pole-Skipping and Chaos in Hot ${\cal M}$QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the question of whether thermal QCD at high temperature is chaotic from the ${\cal M}$ theory dual of QCD-like theories at intermediate coupling as constructed in arXiv: 2004.07259. The equations of motion of the gauge-invariant combination $Z_s(r)$ of scalar metric perturbations is shown to possess an irregular singular point at the horizon radius $r_h$. Very interestingly, at a specific value of the imaginary frequency and momentum used to read off the analogs of the ''Lyapunov exponent'' $\lambda_L$ and ''butterfly velocity'' $v_b$ not only does $r_h$ become a regular singular point, but truncating the incoming mode solution of $Z_s(r)$ as a power series around $r_h$, yields a ''missing pole'', i.e., $C_{n, n+1}=0,\ {\rm det}\ M^{(n)}=0, n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ is satisfied for a single $n\geq3$ depending on the values of the string coupling $g_s$, number of (fractional) $D3$ branes $(M)N$ and flavor $D7$-branes $N_f$ in the parent type IIB set (arXiv:hep-th/0902.1540), e.g., for the QCD(EW-scale)-inspired $N=100, M=N_f=3, g_s=0.1$, one finds a missing pole at $n=3$. For integral $n&gt;3$, truncating $Z_s(r)$ at ${\cal O}((r-r_h)^n)$, yields $C_{n, n+1}=0$ at order $n,\ \forall n\geq3$. Incredibly, (assuming preservation of isotropy in $\mathbb{R}^3$ even with the inclusion of higher derivative corrections) the aforementioned gauge-invariant combination of scalar metric perturbations receives no ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections. Hence, (the aforementioned analogs of) $\lambda_L, v_b$ are unrenormalized up to ${\cal O}(R^4)$ in ${\cal M}$ theory.</description>

      <title>Three Puzzles with Covariance and Supertranslation Invariance of Angular Momentum Flux (with Solutions)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe and solve three puzzles arising in covariant and supertranslation-invariant formulas for the flux of angular momentum and other Lorentz charges in asymptotically flat spacetimes: 1) Supertranslation-invariance and covariance imply invariance under spacetime translations; 2) the flux depends on redundant auxiliary degrees of freedom that cannot be set to zero in all Lorentz frames without breaking Lorentz covariance; 3) supertranslation-invariant Lorentz charges do not generate the transformations of the Bondi mass aspect implied by the isometries of the asymptotic metric. In this letter, we solve the first two puzzles by presenting covariant formulas that unambiguously determine the auxiliary degrees of freedom and clarify the last puzzle by explaining the different role played by covariant and canonical charges. Our construction makes explicit the choice of reference frame underpinning seemingly unambiguous results presented in the current literature.</description>

      <title>The universal thermodynamic properties of Extremely Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An extremely compact object (ECO) is defined as a quantum object without horizon, whose radius is just a small distance $s$ outside its Schwarzschild radius. We show that any ECO of mass $M$ in $d+1$ dimensions with $s\ll (M/m_p)^{2/(d-2)(d+1)}l_p$ must have (at leading order) the same thermodynamic properties -- temperature, entropy and radiation rates -- as the corresponding semiclassical black hole of mass $M$. An essential aspect of the argument involves showing that the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation has no consistent solution in the region just outside the ECO surface, unless this region is filled with radiation at the (appropriately blueshifted) Hawking temperature. In string theory it has been found that black hole microstates are fuzzballs -- objects with no horizon -- which are expected to have a radius that is only a little larger than the horizon radius. Thus the arguments of this paper provide a nice closure to the fuzzball paradigm: the absence of a horizon removes the information paradox, and the thermodynamic properties of the semiclassical hole are nonetheless recovered to an excellent approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider the four-dimensional Maxwell electrodynamics extended with CPT-even Myers-Pospelov Lorentz-violating dimension-six operators to investigate the associated two-dimensional properties in the context of quantum vacuum fluctuation effects, namely, the Casimir effect. Upon projecting out the 4D theory down to a 2D theory we obtain analogs of these operators leading to a modified dispersion relation in a Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) scalar model equivalent to the electromagnetic theory. By making use of the modified dispersion relation, we derive exact analytic expressions for the Casimir energy and force induced by imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions on the scalar field. In the regime where the LIV parameter becomes very small, we recover known results for the Casimir energy and force plus correction terms due to the LIV.</description>

      <title>Hint of dark matter-dark energy interaction in the current cosmological data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many previous studies have explored models of dynamically interacting dark energy scenarios instead of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter. This work aims to offer a comprehensive investigation of the Yukawa-type interaction between dark energy and dark matter where dark matter mass is also a function of a dynamical scalar field value. Unlike previous work, instead of taking an approximate solution, we numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation that governs the intricate interplay between these two components of the dark sector along with the corresponding perturbations, using a suitable shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions. We have conducted a thorough analysis of this interaction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating diverse datasets such as Planck, BAO, Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results, for the first time, reveal a discernible detection of the coupling constant, which encapsulates the strength of the dark sector interaction. We find non-zero $\beta$ values of 0.0487, 0.0680, 0.0712, and 0.0822 ($68\%$ Confidence Limit) corresponding to the inclusion of each dataset, respectively. Notably, the addition of SH$_0$ES data led to a significant increase in the prominence of $\beta$, suggesting the potential for new physics in the dark sector. This study serves as a strategic road map for future endeavours with non-linear cosmology, which will contribute to an enhanced understanding and refinement of constraints on the dark sector interaction.</description>
