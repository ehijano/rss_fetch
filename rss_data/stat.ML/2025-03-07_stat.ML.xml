      <title>Reheated Gradient-based Discrete Sampling for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, gradient-based discrete sampling has emerged as a highly efficient, general-purpose solver for various combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, achieving performance comparable to or surpassing the popular data-driven approaches. However, we identify a critical issue in these methods, which we term ''wandering in contours''. This behavior refers to sampling new different solutions that share very similar objective values for a long time, leading to computational inefficiency and suboptimal exploration of potential solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel reheating mechanism inspired by the concept of critical temperature and specific heat in physics, aimed at overcoming this limitation. Empirically, our method demonstrates superiority over existing sampling-based and data-driven algorithms across a diverse array of CO problems.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction with Upper and Lower Bound Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a Conformal Prediction (CP) methodology for building prediction intervals in a regression setting, given only deterministic lower and upper bounds on the target variable. It proposes a new CP mechanism (CPUL) that goes beyond post-processing by adopting a model selection approach over multiple nested interval construction methods. Paradoxically, many well-established CP methods, including CPUL, may fail to provide adequate coverage in regions where the bounds are tight. To remedy this limitation, the paper proposes an optimal thresholding mechanism, OMLT, that adjusts CPUL intervals in tight regions with undercoverage. The combined CPUL-OMLT is validated on large-scale learning tasks where the goal is to bound the optimal value of a parametric optimization problem. The experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline methods across various datasets.</description>

      <title>Generalization in Federated Learning: A Conditional Mutual Information Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widely adopted privacy-preserving distributed learning framework, yet its generalization performance remains less explored compared to centralized learning. In FL, the generalization error consists of two components: the out-of-sample gap, which measures the gap between the empirical and true risk for participating clients, and the participation gap, which quantifies the risk difference between participating and non-participating clients. In this work, we apply an information-theoretic analysis via the conditional mutual information (CMI) framework to study FL's two-level generalization. Beyond the traditional supersample-based CMI framework, we introduce a superclient construction to accommodate the two-level generalization setting in FL. We derive multiple CMI-based bounds, including hypothesis-based CMI bounds, illustrating how privacy constraints in FL can imply generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we propose fast-rate evaluated CMI bounds that recover the best-known convergence rate for two-level FL generalization in the small empirical risk regime. For specific FL model aggregation strategies and structured loss functions, we refine our bounds to achieve improved convergence rates with respect to the number of participating clients. Empirical evaluations confirm that our evaluated CMI bounds are non-vacuous and accurately capture the generalization behavior of FL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning Causal Response Representations through Direct Effect Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for learning causal response representations. Our method aims to extract directions in which a multidimensional outcome is most directly caused by a treatment variable. By bridging conditional independence testing with causal representation learning, we formulate an optimisation problem that maximises the evidence against conditional independence between the treatment and outcome, given a conditioning set. This formulation employs flexible regression models tailored to specific applications, creating a versatile framework. The problem is addressed through a generalised eigenvalue decomposition. We show that, under mild assumptions, the distribution of the largest eigenvalue can be bounded by a known $F$-distribution, enabling testable conditional independence. We also provide theoretical guarantees for the optimality of the learned representation in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and Fisher information maximisation. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our approach in simulation and real-world experiments. Our results underscore the utility of this framework in uncovering direct causal effects within complex, multivariate settings.</description>

      <title>Time-varying Factor Augmented Vector Autoregression with Grouped Sparse Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent economic events, including the global financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed limitations in linear Factor Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) models for forecasting and structural analysis. Nonlinear dimension techniques, particularly autoencoders, have emerged as promising alternatives in a FAVAR framework, but challenges remain in identifiability, interpretability, and integration with traditional nonlinear time series methods. We address these challenges through two contributions. First, we introduce a Grouped Sparse autoencoder that employs the Spike-and-Slab Lasso prior, with parameters under this prior being shared across variables of the same economic category, thereby achieving semi-identifiability and enhancing model interpretability. Second, we incorporate time-varying parameters into the VAR component to better capture evolving economic dynamics. Our empirical application to the US economy demonstrates that the Grouped Sparse autoencoder produces more interpretable factors through its parsimonious structure; and its combination with time-varying parameter VAR shows superior performance in both point and density forecasting. Impulse response analysis reveals that monetary policy shocks during recessions generate more moderate responses with higher uncertainty compared to expansionary periods.</description>

      <title>Determinant Estimation under Memory Constraints and Neural Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating or accurately estimating log-determinants of large positive semi-definite matrices is of fundamental importance in many machine learning tasks. While its cubic computational complexity can already be prohibitive, in modern applications, even storing the matrices themselves can pose a memory bottleneck. To address this, we derive a novel hierarchical algorithm based on block-wise computation of the LDL decomposition for large-scale log-determinant calculation in memory-constrained settings. In extreme cases where matrices are highly ill-conditioned, accurately computing the full matrix itself may be infeasible. This is particularly relevant when considering kernel matrices at scale, including the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) of neural networks trained on large datasets. Under the assumption of neural scaling laws in the test error, we show that the ratio of pseudo-determinants satisfies a power-law relationship, allowing us to derive corresponding scaling laws. This enables accurate estimation of NTK log-determinants from a tiny fraction of the full dataset; in our experiments, this results in a $\sim$100,000$\times$ speedup with improved accuracy over competing approximations. Using these techniques, we successfully estimate log-determinants for dense matrices of extreme sizes, which were previously deemed intractable and inaccessible due to their enormous scale and computational demands.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility Assessment of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Pregenual Anterior Cingulate Cortex across Sessions and Vendors via the Cloud Computing Platform CloudBrain-MRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the need to elucidate the mechanisms underlying illnesses and their treatment, as well as the lack of harmonization of acquisition and post-processing protocols among different magnetic resonance system vendors, this work is to determine if metabolite concentrations obtained from different sessions, machine models and even different vendors of 3 T scanners can be highly reproducible and be pooled for diagnostic analysis, which is very valuable for the research of rare diseases. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning once on two separate days within one week (one session per day, each session including two proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) scans with no more than a 5-minute interval between scans (no off-bed activity)) on each machine. were analyzed for reliability of within- and between- sessions using the coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and for reproducibility of across the machines using correlation coefficient. As for within- and between- session, all CV values for a group of all the first or second scans of a session, or for a session were almost below 20%, and most of the ICCs for metabolites range from moderate (0.4-0.59) to excellent (0.75-1), indicating high data reliability. When it comes to the reproducibility across the three scanners, all Pearson correlation coefficients across the three machines approached 1 with most around 0.9, and majority demonstrated statistical significance (P&lt;0.01). Additionally, the intra-vendor reproducibility was greater than the inter-vendor ones.</description>

      <title>Poisoning Bayesian Inference via Data Deletion and Replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research in adversarial machine learning (AML) has shown that statistical models are vulnerable to maliciously altered data. However, despite advances in Bayesian machine learning models, most AML research remains concentrated on classical techniques. Therefore, we focus on extending the white-box model poisoning paradigm to attack generic Bayesian inference, highlighting its vulnerability in adversarial contexts. A suite of attacks are developed that allow an attacker to steer the Bayesian posterior toward a target distribution through the strategic deletion and replication of true observations, even when only sampling access to the posterior is available. Analytic properties of these algorithms are proven and their performance is empirically examined in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. With relatively little effort, the attacker is able to substantively alter the Bayesian's beliefs and, by accepting more risk, they can mold these beliefs to their will. By carefully constructing the adversarial posterior, surgical poisoning is achieved such that only targeted inferences are corrupted and others are minimally disturbed.</description>

      <title>InfoSEM: A Deep Generative Model with Informative Priors for Gene Regulatory Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from gene expression data is crucial for understanding biological processes. While supervised models are reported to achieve high performance for this task, they rely on costly ground truth (GT) labels and risk learning gene-specific biases, such as class imbalances of GT interactions, rather than true regulatory mechanisms. To address these issues, we introduce InfoSEM, an unsupervised generative model that leverages textual gene embeddings as informative priors, improving GRN inference without GT labels. InfoSEM can also integrate GT labels as an additional prior when available, avoiding biases and further enhancing performance. Additionally, we propose a biologically motivated benchmarking framework that better reflects real-world applications such as biomarker discovery and reveals learned biases of existing supervised methods. InfoSEM outperforms existing models by 38.5% across four datasets using textual embeddings prior and further boosts performance by 11.1% when integrating labeled data as priors.</description>

      <title>Leveraging priors on distribution functions for multi-arm bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Dirichlet Process Posterior Sampling (DPPS), a Bayesian non-parametric algorithm for multi-arm bandits based on Dirichlet Process (DP) priors. Like Thompson-sampling, DPPS is a probability-matching algorithm, i.e., it plays an arm based on its posterior-probability of being optimal. Instead of assuming a parametric class for the reward generating distribution of each arm, and then putting a prior on the parameters, in DPPS the reward generating distribution is directly modeled using DP priors. DPPS provides a principled approach to incorporate prior belief about the bandit environment, and in the noninformative limit of the DP posteriors (i.e. Bayesian Bootstrap), we recover Non Parametric Thompson Sampling (NPTS), a popular non-parametric bandit algorithm, as a special case of DPPS. We employ stick-breaking representation of the DP priors, and show excellent empirical performance of DPPS in challenging synthetic and real world bandit environments. Finally, using an information-theoretic analysis, we show non-asymptotic optimality of DPPS in the Bayesian regret setup.</description>

      <title>Propagating Model Uncertainty through Filtering-based Probabilistic Numerical ODE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filtering-based probabilistic numerical solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), also known as ODE filters, have been established as efficient methods for quantifying numerical uncertainty in the solution of ODEs. In practical applications, however, the underlying dynamical system often contains uncertain parameters, requiring the propagation of this model uncertainty to the ODE solution. In this paper, we demonstrate that ODE filters, despite their probabilistic nature, do not automatically solve this uncertainty propagation problem. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach that combines ODE filters with numerical quadrature to properly marginalize over uncertain parameters, while accounting for both parameter uncertainty and numerical solver uncertainty. Experiments across multiple dynamical systems demonstrate that the resulting uncertainty estimates closely match reference solutions. Notably, we show how the numerical uncertainty from the ODE solver can help prevent overconfidence in the propagated uncertainty estimates, especially when using larger step sizes. Our results illustrate that probabilistic numerical methods can effectively quantify both numerical and parametric uncertainty in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Regularized Robustly Reliable Learners and Instance Targeted Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10572v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instance-targeted data poisoning attacks, where an adversary corrupts a training set to induce errors on specific test points, have raised significant concerns. Balcan et al (2022) proposed an approach to addressing this challenge by defining a notion of robustly-reliable learners that provide per-instance guarantees of correctness under well-defined assumptions, even in the presence of data poisoning attacks. They then give a generic optimal (but computationally inefficient) robustly reliable learner as well as a computationally efficient algorithm for the case of linear separators over log-concave distributions.
  In this work, we address two challenges left open by Balcan et al (2022). The first is that the definition of robustly-reliable learners in Balcan et al (2022) becomes vacuous for highly-flexible hypothesis classes: if there are two classifiers h_0, h_1 \in H both with zero error on the training set such that h_0(x) \neq h_1(x), then a robustly-reliable learner must abstain on x. We address this problem by defining a modified notion of regularized robustly-reliable learners that allows for nontrivial statements in this case. The second is that the generic algorithm of Balcan et al (2022) requires re-running an ERM oracle (essentially, retraining the classifier) on each test point x, which is generally impractical even if ERM can be implemented efficiently. To tackle this problem, we show that at least in certain interesting cases we can design algorithms that can produce their outputs in time sublinear in training time, by using techniques from dynamic algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Positive-Unlabeled Diffusion Models for Preventing Sensitive Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models but often generate sensitive data that are unwanted by users, mainly because the unlabeled training data frequently contain such sensitive data. Since labeling all sensitive data in the large-scale unlabeled training data is impractical, we address this problem by using a small amount of labeled sensitive data. In this paper, we propose positive-unlabeled diffusion models, which prevent the generation of sensitive data using unlabeled and sensitive data. Our approach can approximate the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for normal (negative) data using only unlabeled and sensitive (positive) data. Therefore, even without labeled normal data, we can maximize the ELBO for normal data and minimize it for labeled sensitive data, ensuring the generation of only normal data. Through experiments across various datasets and settings, we demonstrated that our approach can prevent the generation of sensitive images without compromising image quality.</description>

      <title>LEWIS (LayEr WIse Sparsity) -- A Training Free Guided Model Merging Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As specialized large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, model merging methods are being used to combine them to create a single multi-task model without requiring any additional data or training. However, these approaches fall short when the objective of merging is to increase the downstream model's performance on a particular task-specific benchmark. In this work, we propose LEWIS (Layer Wise Sparsity), a guided model-merging framework that uses activation-based layer importance to dynamically adjust layer-wise task-vector sparsity required for the merge process. LEWIS uses a calibration dataset to prioritize critical layers during the task-vector pruning process required for model merging. This approach guides existing merging methods by preserving essential layer-wise task-specific knowledge while ensuring the merged model performs the best at benchmarks resembling the calibration dataset. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LEWIS with performance improvements of code instruction-following and math-solving models created through model merging up to 4 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively, outperforming unguided data-less model merging approaches that use uniform-sparsity.</description>

      <title>Improved Robust Estimation for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Graphs: The Sparse Regime and Optimal Breakdown Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robustly estimating the edge density of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $G(n, d^\circ/n)$ when an adversary can arbitrarily add or remove edges incident to an $\eta$-fraction of the nodes. We develop the first polynomial-time algorithm for this problem that estimates $d^\circ$ up to an additive error $O([\sqrt{\log(n) / n} + \eta\sqrt{\log(1/\eta)} ] \cdot \sqrt{d^\circ} + \eta \log(1/\eta))$. Our error guarantee matches information-theoretic lower bounds up to factors of $\log(1/\eta)$. Moreover, our estimator works for all $d^\circ \geq \Omega(1)$ and achieves optimal breakdown point $\eta = 1/2$.
  Previous algorithms [AJK+22, CDHS24], including inefficient ones, incur significantly suboptimal errors. Furthermore, even admitting suboptimal error guarantees, only inefficient algorithms achieve optimal breakdown point. Our algorithm is based on the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy. A key ingredient is to construct constant-degree SoS certificates for concentration of the number of edges incident to small sets in $G(n, d^\circ/n)$. Crucially, we show that these certificates also exist in the sparse regime, when $d^\circ = o(\log n)$, a regime in which the performance of previous algorithms was significantly suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Probabilistic Air-Sea Flux Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying air-sea fluxes is important for understanding air-sea interactions and improving coupled weather and climate systems. This study introduces a probabilistic framework to represent the highly variable nature of air-sea fluxes, which is missing in deterministic bulk algorithms. Assuming Gaussian distributions conditioned on the input variables, we use artificial neural networks and eddy-covariance measurement data to estimate the mean and variance by minimizing negative log-likelihood loss. The trained neural networks provide alternative mean flux estimates to existing bulk algorithms, and quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates. Stochastic parameterization of air-sea turbulent fluxes can be constructed by sampling from the predicted distributions. Tests in a single-column forced upper-ocean model suggest that changes in flux algorithms influence sea surface temperature and mixed layer depth seasonally. The ensemble spread in stochastic runs is most pronounced during spring restratification.</description>

      <title>Mixed Likelihood Variational Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful models for human-in-the-loop experiments due to their flexibility and well-calibrated uncertainty. However, GPs modeling human responses typically ignore auxiliary information, including a priori domain expertise and non-task performance information like user confidence ratings. We propose mixed likelihood variational GPs to leverage auxiliary information, which combine multiple likelihoods in a single evidence lower bound to model multiple types of data. We demonstrate the benefits of mixing likelihoods in three real-world experiments with human participants. First, we use mixed likelihood training to impose prior knowledge constraints in GP classifiers, which accelerates active learning in a visual perception task where users are asked to identify geometric errors resulting from camera position errors in virtual reality. Second, we show that leveraging Likert scale confidence ratings by mixed likelihood training improves model fitting for haptic perception of surface roughness. Lastly, we show that Likert scale confidence ratings improve human preference learning in robot gait optimization. The modeling performance improvements found using our framework across this diverse set of applications illustrates the benefits of incorporating auxiliary information into active learning and preference learning by using mixed likelihoods to jointly model multiple inputs.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Scalable UE-AP Association in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO based on Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of access point (AP) and user equipment (UE) association in cell-free massive MIMO networks. It introduces a deep learning algorithm leveraging Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory cells and a hybrid probabilistic methodology for weight updating. This approach enhances scalability by adapting to variations in the number of UEs without requiring retraining. Additionally, the study presents a training methodology that improves scalability not only with respect to the number of UEs but also to the number of APs. Furthermore, a variant of the proposed AP-UE algorithm ensures robustness against pilot contamination effects, a critical issue arising from pilot reuse in channel estimation. Extensive numerical results validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superiority over widely used heuristic alternatives.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Poverty Targeting with Spatial Machine Learning: An application to Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study leverages spatial machine learning (SML) to enhance the accuracy of Proxy Means Testing (PMT) for poverty targeting in Indonesia. Conventional PMT methodologies are prone to exclusion and inclusion errors due to their inability to account for spatial dependencies and regional heterogeneity. By integrating spatial contiguity matrices, SML models mitigate these limitations, facilitating a more precise identification and comparison of geographical poverty clusters. Utilizing household survey data from the Social Welfare Integrated Data Survey (DTKS) for the periods 2016 to 2020 and 2016 to 2021, this study examines spatial patterns in income distribution and delineates poverty clusters at both provincial and district levels. Empirical findings indicate that the proposed SML approach reduces exclusion errors from 28% to 20% compared to standard machine learning models, underscoring the critical role of spatial analysis in refining machine learning-based poverty targeting. These results highlight the potential of SML to inform the design of more equitable and effective social protection policies, particularly in geographically diverse contexts. Future research can explore the applicability of spatiotemporal models and assess the generalizability of SML approaches across varying socio-economic settings.</description>

      <title>Beyond Disorder: Unveiling Cooperativeness in Multidirectional Associative Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By leveraging tools from the statistical mechanics of complex systems, in these short notes we extend the architecture of a neural network for hetero-associative memory (called three-directional associative memories, TAM) to explore supervised and unsupervised learning protocols. In particular, by providing entropic-heterogeneous datasets to its various layers, we predict and quantify a new emergent phenomenon -- that we term {\em layer's cooperativeness} -- where the interplay of dataset entropies across network's layers enhances their retrieval capabilities Beyond those they would have without reciprocal influence. Naively we would expect layers trained with less informative datasets to develop smaller retrieval regions compared to those pertaining to layers that experienced more information: this does not happen and all the retrieval regions settle to the same amplitude, allowing for optimal retrieval performance globally. This cooperative dynamics marks a significant advancement in understanding emergent computational capabilities within disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Sample-Optimal Agnostic Boosting with Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boosting provides a practical and provably effective framework for constructing accurate learning algorithms from inaccurate rules of thumb. It extends the promise of sample-efficient learning to settings where direct Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) may not be implementable efficiently. In the realizable setting, boosting is known to offer this computational reprieve without compromising on sample efficiency. However, in the agnostic case, existing boosting algorithms fall short of achieving the optimal sample complexity.
  This paper highlights an unexpected and previously unexplored avenue of improvement: unlabeled samples. We design a computationally efficient agnostic boosting algorithm that matches the sample complexity of ERM, given polynomially many additional unlabeled samples. In fact, we show that the total number of samples needed, unlabeled and labeled inclusive, is never more than that for the best known agnostic boosting algorithm -- so this result is never worse -- while only a vanishing fraction of these need to be labeled for the algorithm to succeed. This is particularly fortuitous for learning-theoretic applications of agnostic boosting, which often take place in the distribution-specific setting, where unlabeled samples can be availed for free. We detail other applications of this result in reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Canonical normalizing flows for manifold learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manifold learning flows are a class of generative modelling techniques that assume a low-dimensional manifold description of the data. The embedding of such a manifold into the high-dimensional space of the data is achieved via learnable invertible transformations. Therefore, once the manifold is properly aligned via a reconstruction loss, the probability density is tractable on the manifold and maximum likelihood can be used to optimize the network parameters. Naturally, the lower-dimensional representation of the data requires an injective-mapping. Recent approaches were able to enforce that the density aligns with the modelled manifold, while efficiently calculating the density volume-change term when embedding to the higher-dimensional space. However, unless the injective-mapping is analytically predefined, the learned manifold is not necessarily an efficient representation of the data. Namely, the latent dimensions of such models frequently learn an entangled intrinsic basis, with degenerate information being stored in each dimension. Alternatively, if a locally orthogonal and/or sparse basis is to be learned, here coined canonical intrinsic basis, it can serve in learning a more compact latent space representation. Toward this end, we propose a canonical manifold learning flow method, where a novel optimization objective enforces the transformation matrix to have few prominent and non-degenerate basis functions. We demonstrate that by minimizing the off-diagonal manifold metric elements $\ell_1$-norm, we can achieve such a basis, which is simultaneously sparse and/or orthogonal. Canonical manifold flow yields a more efficient use of the latent space, automatically generating fewer prominent and distinct dimensions to represent data, and a better approximation of target distributions than other manifold flow methods in most experiments we conducted, resulting in lower FID scores.</description>

      <title>PQMass: Probabilistic Assessment of the Quality of Generative Models using Probability Mass Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a likelihood-free method for comparing two distributions given samples from each, with the goal of assessing the quality of generative models. The proposed approach, PQMass, provides a statistically rigorous method for assessing the performance of a single generative model or the comparison of multiple competing models. PQMass divides the sample space into non-overlapping regions and applies chi-squared tests to the number of data samples that fall within each region, giving a p-value that measures the probability that the bin counts derived from two sets of samples are drawn from the same multinomial distribution. PQMass does not depend on assumptions regarding the density of the true distribution, nor does it rely on training or fitting any auxiliary models. We evaluate PQMass on data of various modalities and dimensions, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing the quality, novelty, and diversity of generated samples. We further show that PQMass scales well to moderately high-dimensional data and thus obviates the need for feature extraction in practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We endeavour to estimate numerous multi-dimensional means of various probability distributions on a common space based on independent samples. Our approach involves forming estimators through convex combinations of empirical means derived from these samples. We introduce two strategies to find appropriate data-dependent convex combination weights: a first one employing a testing procedure to identify neighbouring means with low variance, which results in a closed-form plug-in formula for the weights, and a second one determining weights via minimization of an upper confidence bound on the quadratic risk.Through theoretical analysis, we evaluate the improvement in quadratic risk offered by our methods compared to the empirical means. Our analysis focuses on a dimensional asymptotics perspective, showing that our methods asymptotically approach an oracle (minimax) improvement as the effective dimension of the data increases.We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods in estimating multiple kernel mean embeddings through experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards One Model for Classical Dimensionality Reduction: A Probabilistic Perspective on UMAP and t-SNE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP and t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a model introduced in ProbDR, that describes the graph Laplacian (an estimate of the data precision matrix) using a Wishart distribution, with a mean given by a non-linear covariance function evaluated on the latents. This interpretation offers deeper theoretical and semantic insights into such algorithms, by showing that variances corresponding to these covariances are low (potentially misspecified), and forging a connection to Gaussian process latent variable models by showing that well-known kernels can be used to describe covariances implied by graph Laplacians. We also introduce tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Mechanics of Feature Learning: Bottleneck Structure in Leaky ResNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Leaky ResNets, which interpolate between ResNets and Fully-Connected nets depending on an 'effective depth' hyper-parameter $\tilde{L}$. In the infinite depth limit, we study 'representation geodesics' $A_{p}$: continuous paths in representation space (similar to NeuralODEs) from input $p=0$ to output $p=1$ that minimize the parameter norm of the network. We give a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian reformulation, which highlight the importance of two terms: a kinetic energy which favors small layer derivatives $\partial_{p}A_{p}$ and a potential energy that favors low-dimensional representations, as measured by the 'Cost of Identity'. The balance between these two forces offers an intuitive understanding of feature learning in ResNets. We leverage this intuition to explain the emergence of a bottleneck structure, as observed in previous work: for large $\tilde{L}$ the potential energy dominates and leads to a separation of timescales, where the representation jumps rapidly from the high dimensional inputs to a low-dimensional representation, move slowly inside the space of low-dimensional representations, before jumping back to the potentially high-dimensional outputs. Inspired by this phenomenon, we train with an adaptive layer step-size to adapt to the separation of timescales.</description>

      <title>A conversion theorem and minimax optimality for continuum contextual bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05714v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the contextual continuum bandits problem, where the learner sequentially receives a side information vector and has to choose an action in a convex set, minimizing a function associated with the context. The goal is to minimize all the underlying functions for the received contexts, leading to the contextual notion of regret, which is stronger than the standard static regret. Assuming that the objective functions are $\gamma$-H\"older with respect to the contexts, $0&lt;\gamma\le 1,$ we demonstrate that any algorithm achieving a sub-linear static regret can be extended to achieve a sub-linear contextual regret. We prove a static-to-contextual regret conversion theorem that provides an upper bound for the contextual regret of the output algorithm as a function of the static regret of the input algorithm. We further study the implications of this general result for three fundamental cases of dependency of the objective function on the action variable: (a) Lipschitz bandits, (b) convex bandits, (c) strongly convex and smooth bandits. For Lipschitz bandits and $\gamma=1,$ combining our results with the lower bound of Slivkins (2014), we prove that the minimax optimal contextual regret for the noise-free adversarial setting is achieved. Then, we prove that in the presence of noise, the contextual regret rate as a function of the number of queries is the same for convex bandits as it is for strongly convex and smooth bandits. Lastly, we present a minimax lower bound, implying two key facts. First, obtaining a sub-linear contextual regret may be impossible over functions that are not continuous with respect to the context. Second, for convex bandits and strongly convex and smooth bandits, the algorithms that we propose achieve, up to a logarithmic factor, the minimax optimal rate of contextual regret as a function of the number of queries.</description>

      <title>How DNNs break the Curse of Dimensionality: Compositionality and Symmetry Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that deep neural networks (DNNs) can efficiently learn any composition of functions with bounded $F_{1}$-norm, which allows DNNs to break the curse of dimensionality in ways that shallow networks cannot. More specifically, we derive a generalization bound that combines a covering number argument for compositionality, and the $F_{1}$-norm (or the related Barron norm) for large width adaptivity. We show that the global minimizer of the regularized loss of DNNs can fit for example the composition of two functions $f^{*}=h\circ g$ from a small number of observations, assuming $g$ is smooth/regular and reduces the dimensionality (e.g. $g$ could be the quotient map of the symmetries of $f^{*}$), so that $h$ can be learned in spite of its low regularity. The measures of regularity we consider is the Sobolev norm with different levels of differentiability, which is well adapted to the $F_{1}$ norm. We compute scaling laws empirically and observe phase transitions depending on whether $g$ or $h$ is harder to learn, as predicted by our theory.</description>

      <title>Robust Amortized Bayesian Inference with Self-Consistency Losses on Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) can solve probabilistic inverse problems orders of magnitude faster than classical methods. However, neural ABI is not yet sufficiently robust for widespread and safe applicability. In particular, when performing inference on observations outside of the scope of the simulated data seen during training, for example, because of model misspecification, the posterior approximations are likely to become highly biased. Due to the bad pre-asymptotic behavior of current neural posterior estimators in the out-of-simulation regime, the resulting estimation biases cannot be fixed in acceptable time by just simulating more training data. In this proof-of-concept paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach that enables training not only on (labeled) simulated data generated from the model, but also on unlabeled data originating from any source, including real-world data. To achieve the latter, we exploit Bayesian self-consistency properties that can be transformed into strictly proper losses without requiring knowledge of true parameter values, that is, without requiring data labels. The results of our initial experiments show remarkable improvements in the robustness of ABI on out-of-simulation data. Even if the observed data is far away from both labeled and unlabeled training data, inference remains highly accurate. If our findings also generalize to other scenarios and model classes, we believe that our new method represents a major breakthrough in neural ABI.</description>

      <title>Golden Ratio Weighting Prevents Model Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies identified an intriguing phenomenon in recursive generative model training known as model collapse, where models trained on data generated by previous models exhibit severe performance degradation. Addressing this issue and developing more effective training strategies have become central challenges in generative model research. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon theoretically within a novel framework, where generative models are iteratively trained on a combination of newly collected real data and synthetic data from the previous training step. To develop an optimal training strategy for integrating real and synthetic data, we evaluate the performance of a weighted training scheme in various scenarios, including Gaussian distribution estimation and linear regression. We theoretically characterize the impact of the mixing proportion and weighting scheme of synthetic data on the final model's performance. Our key finding is that, across different settings, the optimal weighting scheme under different proportions of synthetic data asymptotically follows a unified expression, revealing a fundamental trade-off between leveraging synthetic data and generative model performance. Notably, in some cases, the optimal weight assigned to real data corresponds to the reciprocal of the golden ratio. Finally, we validate our theoretical results on extensive simulated datasets and a real tabular dataset.</description>

      <title>Defining and Characterizing Reward Hacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the first formal definition of reward hacking, a phenomenon where optimizing an imperfect proxy reward function leads to poor performance according to the true reward function. We say that a proxy is unhackable if increasing the expected proxy return can never decrease the expected true return. Intuitively, it might be possible to create an unhackable proxy by leaving some terms out of the reward function (making it "narrower") or overlooking fine-grained distinctions between roughly equivalent outcomes, but we show this is usually not the case. A key insight is that the linearity of reward (in state-action visit counts) makes unhackability a very strong condition. In particular, for the set of all stochastic policies, two reward functions can only be unhackable if one of them is constant. We thus turn our attention to deterministic policies and finite sets of stochastic policies, where non-trivial unhackable pairs always exist, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of simplifications, an important special case of unhackability. Our results reveal a tension between using reward functions to specify narrow tasks and aligning AI systems with human values.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Online Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This text presents an introduction to an emerging paradigm in control of dynamical systems and differentiable reinforcement learning called online nonstochastic control. The new approach applies techniques from online convex optimization and convex relaxations to obtain new methods with provable guarantees for classical settings in optimal and robust control.
  The primary distinction between online nonstochastic control and other frameworks is the objective. In optimal control, robust control, and other control methodologies that assume stochastic noise, the goal is to perform comparably to an offline optimal strategy. In online nonstochastic control, both the cost functions as well as the perturbations from the assumed dynamical model are chosen by an adversary. Thus the optimal policy is not defined a priori. Rather, the target is to attain low regret against the best policy in hindsight from a benchmark class of policies.
  This objective suggests the use of the decision making framework of online convex optimization as an algorithmic methodology. The resulting methods are based on iterative mathematical optimization algorithms, and are accompanied by finite-time regret and computational complexity guarantees.</description>

      <title>Careful with that Scalpel: Improving Gradient Surgery with an EMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond minimizing a single training loss, many deep learning estimation pipelines rely on an auxiliary objective to quantify and encourage desirable properties of the model (e.g. performance on another dataset, robustness, agreement with a prior). Although the simplest approach to incorporating an auxiliary loss is to sum it with the training loss as a regularizer, recent works have shown that one can improve performance by blending the gradients beyond a simple sum; this is known as gradient surgery. We cast the problem as a constrained minimization problem where the auxiliary objective is minimized among the set of minimizers of the training loss. To solve this bilevel problem, we follow a parameter update direction that combines the training loss gradient and the orthogonal projection of the auxiliary gradient to the training gradient. In a setting where gradients come from mini-batches, we explain how, using a moving average of the training loss gradients, we can carefully maintain this critical orthogonality property. We demonstrate that our method, Bloop, can lead to much better performances on NLP and vision experiments than other gradient surgery methods without EMA.</description>

      <title>Which Frequencies do CNNs Need? Emergent Bottleneck Structure in Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the emergence of a Convolution Bottleneck (CBN) structure in CNNs, where the network uses its first few layers to transform the input representation into a representation that is supported only along a few frequencies and channels, before using the last few layers to map back to the outputs. We define the CBN rank, which describes the number and type of frequencies that are kept inside the bottleneck, and partially prove that the parameter norm required to represent a function $f$ scales as depth times the CBN rank $f$. We also show that the parameter norm depends at next order on the regularity of $f$. We show that any network with almost optimal parameter norm will exhibit a CBN structure in both the weights and - under the assumption that the network is stable under large learning rate - the activations, which motivates the common practice of down-sampling; and we verify that the CBN results still hold with down-sampling. Finally we use the CBN structure to interpret the functions learned by CNNs on a number of tasks.</description>

      <title>Some Targets Are Harder to Identify than Others: Quantifying the Target-dependent Membership Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a Membership Inference (MI) game, an attacker tries to infer whether a target point was included or not in the input of an algorithm. Existing works show that some target points are easier to identify, while others are harder. This paper explains the target-dependent hardness of membership attacks by studying the powers of the optimal attacks in a fixed-target MI game. We characterise the optimal advantage and trade-off functions of attacks against the empirical mean in terms of the Mahalanobis distance between the target point and the data-generating distribution. We further derive the impacts of two privacy defences, i.e. adding Gaussian noise and sub-sampling, and that of target misspecification on optimal attacks. As by-products of our novel analysis of the Likelihood Ratio (LR) test, we provide a new covariance attack which generalises and improves the scalar product attack. Also, we propose a new optimal canary-choosing strategy for auditing privacy in the white-box federated learning setting. Our experiments validate that the Mahalanobis score explains the hardness of fixed-target MI games.</description>

      <title>Your Finetuned Large Language Model is Already a Powerful Out-of-distribution Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the likelihood ratio between a pretrained large language model (LLM) and its finetuned variant as a criterion for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. The intuition behind such a criterion is that, the pretrained LLM has the prior knowledge about OOD data due to its large amount of training data, and once finetuned with the in-distribution data, the LLM has sufficient knowledge to distinguish their difference. Leveraging the power of LLMs, we show that, the likelihood ratio can serve as an effective OOD detection criterion. Moreover, we apply the proposed LLM-based likelihood ratio to detect OOD questions in question-answering (QA) systems, which can be used to improve the performance of specialized LLMs for general questions. Given that likelihood can be easily obtained by the loss functions within contemporary neural network frameworks, it is straightforward to implement this approach in practice. Since both the pretrained LLMs and its various finetuned models are widely available from online platforms such as Hugging Face, our proposed criterion can be effortlessly incorporated for OOD detection without the need for further training. We conduct comprehensive evaluation across on multiple settings, including far OOD, near OOD, spam detection, and QA scenarios, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

      <title>Data-driven Error Estimation: Upper Bounding Multiple Errors without Class Complexity as Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing confidence intervals that are simultaneously valid across a class of estimates is central for tasks such as multiple mean estimation, bounding generalization error in machine learning, and adaptive experimental design. We frame this as an "error estimation problem," where the goal is to determine a high-probability upper bound on the maximum error for a class of estimates. We propose an entirely data-driven approach that derives such bounds for both finite and infinite class settings, naturally adapting to a potentially unknown correlation structure of random errors. Notably, our method does not require class complexity as an input, overcoming a major limitation of existing approaches such as union bounding and bounds based on Talagrand's inequality. In this paper, we present our simple yet general solution and demonstrate its flexibility through applications ranging from constructing multiple simultaneously valid confidence intervals to optimizing exploration in contextual bandit algorithms.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimisation: The Optimal Switching Regret for all Segmentations Simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the classic problem of online convex optimisation. Whereas the notion of static regret is relevant for stationary problems, the notion of switching regret is more appropriate for non-stationary problems. A switching regret is defined relative to any segmentation of the trial sequence, and is equal to the sum of the static regrets of each segment. In this paper we show that, perhaps surprisingly, we can achieve the asymptotically optimal switching regret on every possible segmentation simultaneously. Our algorithm for doing so is very efficient: having a space and per-trial time complexity that is logarithmic in the time-horizon. Our algorithm also obtains novel bounds on its dynamic regret: being adaptive to variations in the rate of change of the comparator sequence.</description>

      <title>Timber! Poisoning Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Timber, the first white-box poisoning attack targeting decision trees. Timber is based on a greedy attack strategy that leverages sub-tree retraining to efficiently estimate the damage caused by poisoning a given training instance. The attack relies on a tree annotation procedure, which enables the sorting of training instances so that they are processed in increasing order of the computational cost of sub-tree retraining. This sorting yields a variant of Timber that supports an early stopping criterion, designed to make poisoning attacks more efficient and feasible on larger datasets. We also discuss an extension of Timber to traditional random forest models, which is valuable since decision trees are typically combined into ensembles to improve their predictive power. Our experimental evaluation on public datasets demonstrates that our attacks outperform existing baselines in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, or both. Moreover, we show that two representative defenses can mitigate the effect of our attacks, but fail to effectively thwart them.</description>

      <title>Learning from negative feedback, or positive feedback or both</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing preference optimization methods often assume scenarios where paired preference feedback (preferred/positive vs. dis-preferred/negative examples) is available. This requirement limits their applicability in scenarios where only unpaired feedback--for example, either positive or negative--is available. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that decouples learning from positive and negative feedback. This decoupling enables control over the influence of each feedback type and, importantly, allows learning even when only one feedback type is present. A key contribution is demonstrating stable learning from negative feedback alone, a capability not well-addressed by current methods. Our approach builds upon the probabilistic framework introduced in (Dayan and Hinton, 1997), which uses expectation-maximization (EM) to directly optimize the probability of positive outcomes (as opposed to classic expected reward maximization). We address a key limitation in current EM-based methods: they solely maximize the likelihood of positive examples, while neglecting negative ones. We show how to extend EM algorithms to explicitly incorporate negative examples, leading to a theoretically grounded algorithm that offers an intuitive and versatile way to learn from both positive and negative feedback. We evaluate our approach for training language models based on human feedback as well as training policies for sequential decision-making problems, where learned value functions are available.</description>

      <title>LoLCATs: On Low-Rank Linearizing of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works show we can linearize large language models (LLMs) -- swapping the quadratic attentions of popular Transformer-based LLMs with subquadratic analogs, such as linear attention -- avoiding the expensive pretraining costs. However, linearizing LLMs often significantly degrades model quality, still requires training over billions of tokens, and remains limited to smaller 1.3B to 7B LLMs. We thus propose Low-rank Linear Conversion via Attention Transfer (LoLCATs), a simple two-step method that improves LLM linearizing quality with orders of magnitudes less memory and compute. We base these steps on two findings. First, we can replace an LLM's softmax attentions with closely-approximating linear attentions, simply by training the linear attentions to match their softmax counterparts with an output MSE loss ("attention transfer"). Then, this enables adjusting for approximation errors and recovering LLM quality simply with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, training efficiency, and scalability. We significantly reduce the linearizing quality gap and produce state-of-the-art subquadratic LLMs from Llama 3 8B and Mistral 7B v0.1, leading to 20+ points of improvement on 5-shot MMLU. Furthermore, LoLCATs does so with only 0.2% of past methods' model parameters and 0.4% of their training tokens. Finally, we apply LoLCATs to create the first linearized 70B and 405B LLMs (50x larger than prior work). When compared with prior approaches under the same compute budgets, LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, closing the gap between linearized and original Llama 3.1 70B and 405B LLMs by 77.8% and 78.1% on 5-shot MMLU.</description>

      <title>Understanding Expert Structures on Minimax Parameter Estimation in Contaminated Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct the convergence analysis of parameter estimation in the contaminated mixture of experts. This model is motivated from the prompt learning problem where ones utilize prompts, which can be formulated as experts, to fine-tune a large-scale pre-trained model for learning downstream tasks. There are two fundamental challenges emerging from the analysis: (i) the proportion in the mixture of the pre-trained model and the prompt may converge to zero during the training, leading to the prompt vanishing issue; (ii) the algebraic interaction among parameters of the pre-trained model and the prompt can occur via some partial differential equations and decelerate the prompt learning. In response, we introduce a distinguishability condition to control the previous parameter interaction. Additionally, we also investigate various types of expert structure to understand their effects on the convergence behavior of parameter estimation. In each scenario, we provide comprehensive convergence rates of parameter estimation along with the corresponding minimax lower bounds. Finally, we run several numerical experiments to empirically justify our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Network Causal Effect Estimation In Graphical Models Of Contagion And Latent Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key question in many network studies is whether the observed correlations between units are primarily due to contagion or latent confounding. Here, we study this question using a segregated graph (Shpitser, 2015) representation of these mechanisms, and examine how uncertainty about the true underlying mechanism impacts downstream computation of network causal effects, particularly under full interference -- settings where we only have a single realization of a network and each unit may depend on any other unit in the network. Under certain assumptions about asymptotic growth of the network, we derive likelihood ratio tests that can be used to identify whether different sets of variables -- confounders, treatments, and outcomes -- across units exhibit dependence due to contagion or latent confounding. We then propose network causal effect estimation strategies that provide unbiased and consistent estimates if the dependence mechanisms are either known or correctly inferred using our proposed tests. Together, the proposed methods allow network effect estimation in a wider range of full interference scenarios that have not been considered in prior work.

      <title>VISION-XL: High Definition Video Inverse Problem Solver using Latent Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for solving high-definition video inverse problems using latent image diffusion models. Building on recent advancements in spatio-temporal optimization for video inverse problems using image diffusion models, our approach leverages latent-space diffusion models to achieve enhanced video quality and resolution. To address the high computational demands of processing high-resolution frames, we introduce a pseudo-batch consistent sampling strategy, allowing efficient operation on a single GPU. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency, we present pseudo-batch inversion, an initialization technique that incorporates informative latents from the measurement. By integrating with SDXL, our framework achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction across a wide range of spatio-temporal inverse problems, including complex combinations of frame averaging and various spatial degradations, such as deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Unlike previous methods, our approach supports multiple aspect ratios (landscape, vertical, and square) and delivers HD-resolution reconstructions (exceeding 1280x720) in under 6 seconds per frame on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU.</description>

      <title>An Analysis Framework for Understanding Deep Neural Networks Based on Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancing artificial intelligence demands a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying deep learning. Here, we propose a straightforward analysis framework based on the dynamics of learning models. Neurons are categorized into two modes based on whether their transformation functions preserve order. This categorization reveals how deep neural networks (DNNs) maximize information extraction by rationally allocating the proportion of neurons in different modes across deep layers. We further introduce the attraction basins of the training samples in both the sample vector space and the weight vector space to characterize the generalization ability of DNNs. This framework allows us to identify optimal depth and width configurations, providing a unified explanation for fundamental DNN behaviors such as the "flat minima effect," "grokking," and double descent phenomena. Our analysis extends to networks with depths up to 100 layers.</description>

      <title>Rational Tuning of LLM Cascades via Probabilistic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the reliability of large language models (LLMs) has recently garnered significant attention. Given LLMs' propensity to hallucinate, as well as their high sensitivity to prompt design, it is already challenging to predict the performance of an individual LLM. However, the problem becomes more complex for compound LLM systems such as cascades, where in addition to each model's standalone performance, we must understand how the error rates of different models interact. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for the joint performance distribution of a sequence of LLMs, which enables a framework for rationally tuning the confidence thresholds of a LLM cascade using continuous optimization. Compared to selecting confidence thresholds using grid search, our parametric Markov-copula model significantly improves runtime scaling with respect to the length of the cascade and the desired resolution of the cost-error curve, turning them from intractable into low-order polynomial. In addition, the optimal thresholds computed using our continuous optimization-based algorithm increasingly outperform those found via grid search as cascade length grows, improving the area under the cost-error curve by 1.9% on average for cascades consisting of at least three models. Overall, our Markov-copula model provides a rational basis for tuning LLM cascade performance and points to the potential of probabilistic methods in analyzing LLM systems.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein-regularized Conformal Prediction under General Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction yields a prediction set with guaranteed $1-\alpha$ coverage of the true target under the i.i.d. assumption, which may not hold and lead to a gap between $1-\alpha$ and the actual coverage. Prior studies bound the gap using total variation distance, which cannot identify the gap changes under distribution shift at a given $\alpha$. Besides, existing methods are mostly limited to covariate shift,while general joint distribution shifts are more common in practice but less researched.In response, we first propose a Wasserstein distance-based upper bound of the coverage gap and analyze the bound using probability measure pushforwards between the shifted joint data and conformal score distributions, enabling a separation of the effect of covariate and concept shifts over the coverage gap. We exploit the separation to design an algorithm based on importance weighting and regularized representation learning (WR-CP) to reduce the Wasserstein bound with a finite-sample error bound.WR-CP achieves a controllable balance between conformal prediction accuracy and efficiency. Experiments on six datasets prove that WR-CP can reduce coverage gaps to $3.2\%$ across different confidence levels and outputs prediction sets 37$\%$ smaller than the worst-case approach on average.</description>

      <title>Iterative Flow Matching -- Path Correction and Gradual Refinement for Enhanced Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models for image generation are now commonly used for a wide variety of applications, ranging from guided image generation for entertainment to solving inverse problems. Nonetheless, training a generator is a non-trivial feat that requires fine-tuning and can lead to so-called hallucinations, that is, the generation of images that are unrealistic. In this work, we explore image generation using flow matching. We explain and demonstrate why flow matching can generate hallucinations, and propose an iterative process to improve the generation process. Our iterative process can be integrated into virtually $\textit{any}$ generative modeling technique, thereby enhancing the performance and robustness of image synthesis systems.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Learning Method to Connect Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing fast and accurate surrogate models is a key ingredient for making robust predictions in many topics. We introduce a new model, the Multiparameter Eigenvalue Problem (MEP) emulator. The new method connects emulators and can make predictions directly from observables to observables. We present that the MEP emulator can be trained with data from Eigenvector Continuation (EC) and Parametric Matrix Model (PMM) emulators. A simple simulation on a one-dimensional lattice confirms the performance of the MEP emulator. Using $^{28}$O as an example, we also demonstrate that the predictive probability distribution of the target observables can be easily obtained through the new emulator.</description>

      <title>When Can You Get Away with Low Memory Adam?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adam is the go-to optimizer for training modern machine learning models, but it requires additional memory to maintain the moving averages of the gradients and their squares. While various low-memory optimizers have been proposed that sometimes match the performance of Adam, their lack of reliability has left Adam as the default choice. In this work, we apply a simple layer-wise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis to quantify when second-moment tensors can be effectively replaced by their means across different dimensions. Our SNR analysis reveals how architecture, training hyperparameters, and dataset properties impact compressibility along Adam's trajectory, naturally leading to $\textit{SlimAdam}$, a memory-efficient Adam variant. $\textit{SlimAdam}$ compresses the second moments along dimensions with high SNR when feasible, and leaves when compression would be detrimental. Through experiments across a diverse set of architectures and training scenarios, we show that $\textit{SlimAdam}$ matches Adam's performance and stability while saving up to $98\%$ of total second moments. Code for $\textit{SlimAdam}$ is available at https://github.com/dayal-kalra/low-memory-adam.</description>
