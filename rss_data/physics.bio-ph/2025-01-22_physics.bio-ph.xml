      <title>Microtubules: dynamics, soliton waves, some roles in the cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we deal with nonlinear dynamics of microtubules (MTs). The structure and role of MTs in cells are explained. One model explaining MT dynamics is explained. Solutions of the crucial nonlinear differential equation depend on used mathematical procedures. Two of them, continuum and semi-discrete approximations, are explained. Finally, these solutions are shown and discussed. They are solitonic waves. Three different kinds of them are known in the moment. They are kink solitons, breathers and bell-type solitons.</description>

      <title>A Model for Self-Organized Growth, Branching, and Allometric Scaling of the Planarian Gut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth and scaling of organs is a fundamental aspect of animal development. However, how organs grow to the right size and shape required by physiological demands, remains largely unknown. Here, we provide a framework combining theory and experiment to study the scaling of branched organs. As a biological model, we focus on the branching morphogenesis of the planarian gut, which is a highly branched organ responsible for the delivery of nutrients. Planarians undergo massive body size changes requiring gut morphology to adapt to these size variations. Our experimental analysis shows that various gut properties scale with organism size according to power laws. We introduce a theoretical framework to understand the growth and scaling of branched organs. Our theory considers the dynamics of the interface between organ and surrounding tissue to be controlled by a morphogen and illustrates how a shape instability of this interface can give rise to the self-organized formation and growth of complex branched patterns. Considering the reaction-diffusion dynamics in a growing domain representative of organismal growth, we show that a wide range of scaling behaviors of the branching pattern emerges from the interplay between interface dynamics and organism growth. Our model can recapitulate the scaling laws of planarian gut morphology that we quantified and also opens new directions for understanding allometric scaling laws in various other branching systems in organisms.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Electrostatic Interaction and Steric Repulsion between Bacteria and Gold Surface Influences Raman Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures have wide applications in photonics including pathogen detection and diagnosis via Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). Despite major role plasmonics play in signal enhancement, electrostatics in SERS is yet to be fully understood and harnessed. Here, we perform a systematic study of electrostatic interactions between 785 nm resonant gold nanorods designed to harbor zeta potentials of +29, +16, 0 and -9 mV spanning positive neutral and negative domains. SERS activity is tested on representative Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria with zeta potentials of -30 and -23 mV respectively in water. Raman spectroscopy and Cryo-Electron microscopy reveal that +29, +16, 0 and -9 mV nanorods give SERS enhancement of 7.2X, 3.6X, 4.2X, 1.3X to Staphylococcus epidermidis and 3.9X, 2.8X, 2.9X, 1.1X to Escherichia coli. Theoretical results show that electrostatics play the major role among all interaction forces in determining cell-nanorod proximity and signal enhancement. We identify steric repulsion due to cell protrusions to be the critical opposing force. Finally, a design principle is proposed to estimate the electrostatic strength in SERS. Our work provides new insights into the principle of bacteria-nanorod interactions, enabling reproducible and precise biomolecular readouts, critical for next-generation point-of-care diagnostics and smart healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cell Characterization via Hydrodynamic Compression in Suspended Microchannel Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microfluidics offer remarkable flexibility for in-flow analyte characterization and can even measure the mechanical properties of biological cells through the application of hydrodynamic forces. In this work, we present a new approach to enhance the performance of nanomechanical resonators featuring integrated microfluidic channels when they are used as cell sensors by means of applying hydrostatic compressions. For this purpose, we have studied analytically how this kind of compressions affects either the mechanical properties of the resonator as well as the analytes. We found that, depending on factors such as device geometry and material composition, the mass limit of detection of the resonator can be reduced while the buoyant mass of the particles is increased when a hydrostatic compression is applied, improving the performance of the sensor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applying these hydrostatic compressions induces shifts in mass distributions among cell lines with similar physical properties, which not only potentially enhances the ability to differentiate between these lines, but also opens the door to measure the cell's compressibility, a biophysical parameter of interest with practical diagnostic applications.</description>

      <title>Boundary curvature-dependent dynamical trapping of undulating worms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of {\it Lumbriculus variegatus} in polygonal chambers and show that the worms align with the boundaries as they move forward and get dynamically trapped at concave corners over prolonged periods of time before escaping. We develop a kinematic model to calculate and describe the evolution of the worm's mean body orientation angle relative to the boundary. Performing simulations with a minimal active elastic dumbbell model, we then show that both the boundary aligning and corner trapping behavior of the worm are captured by steric interactions with the boundaries. The dimensionless ratio of the strength of forward motion and diffusion caused by the worm's undulatory and peristaltic strokes is shown to determine the boundary alignment dynamics and trapping time scales of the worm. The simulations show that that the body angle with the boundary while entering the concave corner is important to the trapping time distributions with shallow angles leading to faster escapes. Our study demonstrates that directed motion and limited angular diffusion can give rise to aggregation which can mimic shelter seeking behavior in slender undulating limbless worms even when thigmotaxis or contact seeking behavior is absent.</description>

      <title>Miniaturized liquid metal composite circuits with energy harvesting coils for battery-free bioelectronics and optogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past years, rapid progress has been made on soft-matter electronics for wearable and implantable devices, for bioelectronics and optogenetics. Liquid Metal (LM) based electronics were especially popular, due to their long-term durability, when subject to repetitive strain cycles. However, one major limitation has been the need for tethering bioelectronics circuits to external power, or the use of rigid bulky batteries. This has motivated a growing interest in wireless energy transfer, which demands circuit miniaturization. However, miniaturization of LM circuits is challenging due to low LM-substrate adhesion, LM smearing, and challenges on microchip-interfacing. In this article, we address these challenges by high-resolution laser-assisted micropatterning of biphasic LM composites and vapor-assisted LM microchip soldering. Through development of a search algorithm for optimization of the biphasic ink coil performance, we designed and implemented micro coils with trace spacing of 50 {\mu}m that can harvest a significant amount of energy (178 mW/cm2) through near field inductive coupling. We show miniaturized soft-matter circuits with integrated SMD chips such as NFC chips, capacitors, and LEDs that are implemented in a few minutes through laser patterning, and vaporassisted soldering. In the context of optogenetics, where lightweight, miniaturized systems are needed to provide optical stimulation, soft coils stand out in terms of their improved conformability and flexibility. Thus, this article explores the applications of soft coils in wearable and implantable devices, with a specific focus on their use in optogenetics.</description>

      <title>Dependence of energy relaxation and vibrational coherence on the location of light-harvesting chromoproteins in photosynthetic antenna protein complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phycobilisomes are antenna protein complexes in cyanobacteria and red algae. In phycobilisomes, energy transfer is unidirectional with an extremely high quantum efficiency close to unity. We investigate intraprotein energy relaxation and quantum coherence of constituent chromoproteins of allophycocyanin (APC) and two kinds of C-phycocyanin (CPC) in phycobilisomes using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D-ES). These chromoproteins have similar adjacent pairs of pigments $\alpha$84 and $\beta$84, which are excited to delocalized exciton states. However, the kinetics and coherence of exciton states are significantly different from each other. Even CPCs with almost the same molecular structure display significantly different spectra and kinetics when the locations in the phycobilisome are different. This difference may be one of the key mechanisms for the efficient and unidirectional energy transfer in phycobilisomes. We observe low-frequency coherent vibrational motion of approximately 200 cm$^{-1}$ with large amplitude and a decay time of 200 fs. The wave packet motion involving energy relaxation and oscillatory motions on the potential energy surface of the exciton state is clearly visualized using beat-frequency-resolved 2D-ES.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systemic drug administration often causes off-target effects limiting the efficacy of advanced therapies. Targeted drug delivery approaches increase local drug concentrations at the diseased site while minimizing systemic drug exposure. We present a magnetically guided microrobotic drug delivery system capable of precise navigation under physiological conditions. This platform integrates a clinical electromagnetic navigation system, a custom-designed release catheter, and a dissolvable capsule for accurate therapeutic delivery. In vitro tests showed precise navigation in human vasculature models, and in vivo experiments confirmed tracking under fluoroscopy and successful navigation in large animal models. The microrobot balances magnetic material concentration, contrast agent loading, and therapeutic drug capacity, enabling effective hosting of therapeutics despite the integration complexity of its components, offering a promising solution for precise targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>The $(2+\delta)$-dimensional theory of the electromechanics of lipid membranes: III. Constitutive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article concludes a three-part series developing a self-consistent theoretical framework of the electromechanics of lipid membranes at the continuum scale. Owing to their small thickness, lipid membranes are commonly modeled as two-dimensional surfaces. However, this approach breaks down when considering their electromechanical behavior as it requires accounting for their thickness. To address this, we developed a dimension reduction procedure in part 1 to derive effective surface theories explicitly capturing the thickness of lipid membranes. We applied this method to dimensionally reduce Gauss' law and the electromechanical balance laws and referred to the resulting theory as $(2+\delta)$-dimensional, where $\delta$ indicates the membrane thickness. However, the $(2+\delta)$-dimensional balance laws derived in part 2 are general, and specific material models are required to specialize them to lipid membranes. In this work, we devise appropriate three-dimensional constitutive models that capture the in-plane fluid and out-of-plane elastic behavior of lipid membranes. The viscous behavior is recovered by a three-dimensional Newtonian fluid model, leading to the same viscous stresses as strictly two-dimensional models. The elastic resistance to bending is recovered by imposing a free energy penalty on local volume changes. While this gives rise to the characteristic bending resistance of lipid membranes, it differs in its higher-order curvature terms from the Canham-Helfrich-Evans theory. Furthermore, motivated by the small mid-surface stretch of lipid membranes, we introduce reactive stresses that enforce mid-surface incompressibility, resulting in an effective surface tension. Finally, we use the constitutive and reactive stresses to derive the equations of motion describing the electromechanics of lipid membranes.</description>

      <title>Nanopillar-Driven Antibacterial Surfaces: Elucidating Bactericidal Mechanisms and Engineering Nanostructures for Enhanced Efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insects like dragonflies and cicadas possess nanoprotusions on their wings that rupture bacterial membranes upon contact, inspiring synthetic antibacterial surfaces mimicking this phenomenon. Designing such biomimetic surfaces requires understanding the mechanical interaction between nanopillars and bacterial membranes. However, the small scales of these interactions pose challenges. Molecular Dynamics simulations offer precise and efficient modeling at these scales. This study presents a coarse-grained membrane model to explore the mechanical responses of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial membranes to nanopillar arrays. By varying bacterial shapes (spherical and cylindrical), membrane bending rigidity, and loading rates, we identified two distinct failure mechanisms. Low bending rigidity, typical of gram-negative bacteria, leads to tearing near nanopillar tips, contrary to prior assumptions. High bending rigidity, characteristic of gram-positive bacteria, results in puncturing at contact points. Gram-positive bacteria are more resistant, requiring a threefold increase in loading rate for effective piercing. Nanopillar height and spacing also critically impact bactericidal efficacy: greater heights enhance activity beyond a critical threshold, while increased spacing reduces efficacy. This simplified coarse-grained model, representing bacterial membranes with high fidelity, enables cost-effective, full-scale simulations over extended periods. Our findings provide essential insights for optimizing nanopillared surface designs, advancing antibacterial technology through tailored height and spacing configurations.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced proliferation of vortices around marine invertebrate larvae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ocean is teeming with a myriad of invertebrate planktonic larvae, which thrive in a viscous fluid environment. Many of them rely on ciliary beating to generate fluid flows for locomotion and feeding. Their forms, local morphologies, and ciliation patterns exhibit remarkable diversity, producing intricate and dynamic three-dimensional flows that are notoriously difficult to characterize in laboratory settings. Traditional microscopic imaging techniques typically involve gently squeeze-confining the soft larvae between a glass slide and cover slip, to study their flows in quasi-two-dimensions. However, a comprehensive hydrodynamic framework for the low-to-intermediate Reynolds number flows at the larval scale in quasi-2D confinement - particularly in light of their complex forms - has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that vortices around larvae proliferate with increasing confinement, and elucidate the underlying physical mechanism. We experimentally quantify confinement-induced flows in larvae of sea stars and sea urchins. The flows exhibited strikingly universal patterns: under weak confinement, all larvae generated two vortices, whereas under strong confinement, multiple vortices appeared. The experimental observations were well captured by a low Reynolds number theoretical model based on superposition of confined Stokeslets. Building on experiments and theory, we developed a comprehensive framework for confinement-induced larval flows, which suggests that the vorticity dynamics are primarily determined by local morphological features, rather than the larval forms. Our work provides fundamental insights into the form-functional relationships between larval morphology and flow generation. Our findings are broadly applicable to understanding fluid flows generated by a wide range of ciliated organisms with complex forms and morphologies, from micro- to milli-length-scales.</description>

      <title>Extreme scaling of the metadynamics of paths algorithm on the pre-exascale JUWELS Booster supercomputer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD)-based path sampling algorithms are a very important class of methods used to study the energetics and kinetics of rare (bio)molecular events. They sample the highly informative but highly unlikely reactive trajectories connecting different metastable states of complex (bio)molecular systems. The metadynamics of paths (MoP) method proposed by Mandelli, Hirshberg, and Parrinello [Pys. Rev. Lett. 125 2, 026001 (2020)] is based on the Onsager-Machlup path integral formalism. This provides an analytical expression for the probability of sampling stochastic trajectories of given duration. In practice, the method samples reactive paths via metadynamics simulations performed directly in the phase space of all possible trajectories. Its parallel implementation is in principle infinitely scalable, allowing arbitrarily long trajectories to be simulated. Paving the way for future applications to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein-ligand (un)binding, a problem of great pharmaceutical interest, we present here the efficient implementation of MoP in the HPC-oriented biomolecular simulation software GROMACS. Our benchmarks on a membrane protein (150,000 atoms) show an unprecedented weak scaling parallel efficiency of over 70% up to 3200 GPUs on the pre-exascale JUWELS Booster machine at the J\"ulich Supercomputing Center.</description>

      <title>A differentiable Gillespie algorithm for simulating chemical kinetics, parameter estimation, and designing synthetic biological circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gillespie algorithm is commonly used to simulate and analyze complex chemical reaction networks. Here, we leverage recent breakthroughs in deep learning to develop a fully differentiable variant of the Gillespie algorithm. The differentiable Gillespie algorithm (DGA) approximates discontinuous operations in the exact Gillespie algorithm using smooth functions, allowing for the calculation of gradients using backpropagation. The DGA can be used to quickly and accurately learn kinetic parameters using gradient descent and design biochemical networks with desired properties. As an illustration, we apply the DGA to study stochastic models of gene promoters. We show that the DGA can be used to: (i) successfully learn kinetic parameters from experimental measurements of mRNA expression levels from two distinct $\textit{E. coli}$ promoters and (ii) design nonequilibrium promoter architectures with desired input-output relationships. These examples illustrate the utility of the DGA for analyzing stochastic chemical kinetics, including a wide variety of problems of interest to synthetic and systems biology.</description>

Abstract: The spread of metastases is a crucial process in which some questions remain unanswered. In this work, we focus on tumor cells circulating in the bloodstream, the so-called Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs). Our aim is to characterize their trajectories under the influence of hemodynamic and adhesion forces. We focus on already available in vitro measurements performed with a microfluidic device corresponding to the trajectories of CTCs -- without or with different protein depletions -- interacting with an endothelial layer. A key difficulty is the weak knowledge of the fluid velocity that has to be reconstructed. Our strategy combines a differential equation model -- a Poiseuille model for the fluid velocity and an ODE system for the cell adhesion model -- and a robust and well-designed calibration procedure. The parameterized model quantifies the strong influence of fluid velocity on adhesion and confirms the expected role of several proteins in the deceleration of CTCs. Finally, it enables the generation of synthetic cells, even for unobserved experimental conditions, opening the way to a digital twin for flowing cells with adhesion.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo simulation framework for investigating the effect of inter-track coupling on H$_2$O$_2$ productions at ultra-high dose rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Lower production of H$_2$O$_2$ in water is a hallmark of ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) compared to the conventional dose rate (CDR). However, the current computational models based on the predicted yield of H$_2$O$_2$ are in opposite of the experimental data. Methods: We construct an analytical model for the rate equation in the production of H$_2$O$_2$ from \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals and use it as a guide to propose a hypothetical geometrical inhomogeneity in the configuration of particles in the FLASH-UHDR beams. We perform a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the track structures for a system of charged particles impinging the medium in the form of clusters and/or bunches. Results: We demonstrate the interplay of diffusion, reaction rates, and overlaps in track-spacing attribute to a lower yield of H$_2$O$_2$ at FLASH-UHDR vs. CDR. This trend is reversed if spacing among the tracks becomes larger than a critical value, with a length scale that is proportional to the diffusion length of \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals modulated by a rate of decay due to recombination with other species, available within a track, and the space among the tracks. The latter is substantial on the suppressing of the H$_2$O$_2$ population at FLASH-UHDR relative to CDR. Conclusions: Based on our analysis of the present work, at FLASH-UHDR, the lower yield in H$_2$O$_2$ can be interpreted as a signature of bunching the particles in beams of ionizing radiation. The beams enter the medium in closely packed clusters and form inhomogeneities in the track-structure distribution. Thus the MC simulations based on the assumption of uniformly distributed tracks are unable to explain the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Controlling noisy herds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling multi-agent systems is a persistent challenge in organismal, robotic and social collectives, especially when agents exhibit stochastic indecisiveness -- frequently switching between conflicting behavioral rules. Here, we investigate the control of such noisy indecisive collectives through the lens of century-old sheepdog trials, where small groups of sheep exhibit unpredictable switching between fleeing and following behaviors. Unlike cohesive large flocks, these small indecisive groups are difficult to control, yet skilled dog-handler teams excel at both herding and precisely splitting them (shedding) on demand. Using a stochastic model, we introduce two central parameters -- pressure (stimulus intensity) and lightness (response isotropy) -- to simulate and quantify herding and shedding dynamics. Surprisingly, we find that stochastic indecisiveness, typically perceived as a challenge, can be leveraged as a critical tool for efficient control, enabling controlled herding and splitting of noisy groups. Building on these insights, we develop the Indecisive Swarm Algorithm (ISA) for artificial agents and benchmark its performance against standard algorithms, including the Averaging-Based Swarm Algorithm (ASA) and the Leader-Follower Swarm Algorithm (LFSA). ISA minimizes control energy in trajectory-following tasks, outperforming alternatives under noisy conditions. By framing these results within a stochastic temporal network framework, we show that even with a probabilistic description of the future dynamics, network restructuring (temporality) enhances control efficiency in a specific class of control problems. These insights establish a scalable framework for controlling noisy, behavior-switching collectives, with applications in swarm robotics, cellular engineering, opinion dynamics, and temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired super-resolution of fluorescent point-like sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental super-resolution of pairs of point-like fluorescent sources using a modified image inversion interferometer microscope. The technique is inspired by recent developments in the application of quantum parameter estimation theory to semiclassical imaging problems. We find that the image inversion technique requires special polarization filtering to account for the dipolar nature of the emission. Using an azimuthal polarizer, we obtain improvements in the Fisher information of point-source separation by over an order of magnitude relative to direct imaging. Unlike established super-resolution fluorescence techniques, the method does not require sequential photoswitching/blinking of the fluorophores, and thus could facilitate significant speed-ups for certain biological imaging/tracking tasks.</description>
