      <title>Comparing noisy neural population dynamics using optimal transport distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological and artificial neural systems form high-dimensional neural representations that underpin their computational capabilities. Methods for quantifying geometric similarity in neural representations have become a popular tool for identifying computational principles that are potentially shared across neural systems. These methods generally assume that neural responses are deterministic and static. However, responses of biological systems, and some artificial systems, are noisy and dynamically unfold over time. Furthermore, these characteristics can have substantial influence on a system's computational capabilities. Here, we demonstrate that existing metrics can fail to capture key differences between neural systems with noisy dynamic responses. We then propose a metric for comparing the geometry of noisy neural trajectories, which can be derived as an optimal transport distance between Gaussian processes. We use the metric to compare models of neural responses in different regions of the motor system and to compare the dynamics of latent diffusion models for text-to-image synthesis.</description>

      <title>Diverging network architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ connectome and signaling network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connectome describes the complete set of synaptic contacts through which neurons communicate. While the architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ connectome has been extensively characterized, much less is known about the organization of causal signaling networks arising from functional interactions between neurons. Understanding how effective communication pathways relate to or diverge from the underlying structure is a central question in neuroscience. Here, we analyze the modular architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ signal propagation network, measured via calcium imaging and optogenetics, and compare it to the underlying anatomical wiring measured by electron microscopy. Compared to the connectome, we find that signaling modules are not aligned with the modular boundaries of the anatomical network, highlighting an instance where function deviates from structure. An exception to this is the pharynx which is delineated into a separate community in both anatomy and signaling. We analyze the cellular compositions of the signaling architecture and find that its modules are enriched for specific cell types and functions, suggesting that the network modules are neurobiologically relevant. Lastly, we identify a "rich club" of hub neurons in the signaling network. The membership of the signaling rich club differs from the rich club detected in the anatomical network, challenging the view that structural hubs occupy positions of influence in functional (signaling) networks. Our results provide new insight into the interplay between brain structure, in the form of a complete synaptic-level connectome, and brain function, in the form of a system-wide causal signal propagation atlas.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Latent Variables for Cross-Individual Primary Visual Cortex Modeling and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating the functional mechanisms of the primary visual cortex (V1) remains a fundamental challenge in systems neuroscience. Current computational models face two critical limitations, namely the challenge of cross-modal integration between partial neural recordings and complex visual stimuli, and the inherent variability in neural characteristics across individuals, including differences in neuron populations and firing patterns. To address these challenges, we present a multi-modal identifiable variational autoencoder (miVAE) that employs a two-level disentanglement strategy to map neural activity and visual stimuli into a unified latent space. This framework enables robust identification of cross-modal correlations through refined latent space modeling. We complement this with a novel score-based attribution analysis that traces latent variables back to their origins in the source data space. Evaluation on a large-scale mouse V1 dataset demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-individual latent representation and alignment, without requiring subject-specific fine-tuning, and exhibits improved performance with increasing data size. Significantly, our attribution algorithm successfully identifies distinct neuronal subpopulations characterized by unique temporal patterns and stimulus discrimination properties, while simultaneously revealing stimulus regions that show specific sensitivity to edge features and luminance variations. This scalable framework offers promising applications not only for advancing V1 research but also for broader investigations in neuroscience.</description>

      <title>A unified theory for the development of tinnitus and hyperacusis based on associative plasticity in the dorsal cochlear nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tinnitus and hyperacusis can occur together or in isolation, with hyperacusis being associated with tinnitus much more frequently than vice versa. This striking correlation between tinnitus and hyperacusis prevalence implicates that there might be a common origin such as a (hidden) hearing loss and possibly interrelated neural mechanisms of pathological development of those two conditions. In this theoretical paper, we propose such interrelated pathological mechanisms, localized in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) of the brainstem, that are based on classical mechanisms of Hebbian and associative plasticity known from classical conditioning. Specifically, our model proposes that hyperacusis results from synaptic enhancement of cochlear input to the DCN, whereas chronic tinnitus results from synaptic enhancement of somatosensory input to the DCN. Specific conditions leading to one or the other condition are discussed. Our model predicts, that hearing loss leads to chronic tinnitus, while noise exposure (which may also cause hearing loss) leads to hyperacusis.</description>

      <title>Accessing the topological properties of human brain functional sub-circuits in Echo State Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an emerging trend in neuromorphic computing that centers around the use of brain connectomics as a blueprint for artificial neural networks. Connectomics-based neuromorphic computing has primarily focused on embedding human brain large-scale structural connectomes (SCs), as estimated from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) modality, to echo-state networks (ESNs). A critical step in ESN embedding requires pre-determined read-in and read-out layers constructed by the induced subgraphs of the embedded reservoir. As \textit{a priori} set of functional sub-circuits are derived from functional MRI (fMRI) modality, it is unknown, till this point, whether the embedding of fMRI-induced sub-circuits/networks onto SCs is well justified from the neuro-physiological perspective and ESN performance across a variety of tasks. This paper proposes a pipeline to implement and evaluate ESNs with various embedded topologies and processing/memorization tasks. To this end, we showed that different performance optimums highly depend on the neuro-physiological characteristics of these pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits. In general, fMRI-induced sub-circuit-embedded ESN outperforms simple bipartite and various null models with feed-forward properties commonly seen in MLP for different tasks and reservoir criticality conditions. We provided a thorough analysis of the topological properties of pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits and highlighted their graph-theoretical properties that play significant roles in determining ESN performance.</description>

      <title>CogSimulator: A Model for Simulating User Cognition &amp; Behavior with Minimal Data for Tailored Cognitive Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between cognition and gaming, notably through educational games enhancing cognitive skills, has garnered significant attention in recent years. This research introduces the CogSimulator, a novel algorithm for simulating user cognition in small-group settings with minimal data, as the educational game Wordle exemplifies. The CogSimulator employs Wasserstein-1 distance and coordinates search optimization for hyperparameter tuning, enabling precise few-shot predictions in new game scenarios. Comparative experiments with the Wordle dataset illustrate that our model surpasses most conventional machine learning models in mean Wasserstein-1 distance, mean squared error, and mean accuracy, showcasing its efficacy in cognitive enhancement through tailored game design.</description>

      <title>An Analytically Solvable Model of Firing Rate Heterogeneity in Balanced State Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributions of neuronal activity within cortical circuits are often found to display highly skewed shapes with many neurons emitting action potentials at low or vanishing rates, while some are active at high rates. Theoretical studies were able to reproduce such distributions, but come with a lack of mathematical tractability, preventing a deeper understanding of the impact of model parameters. In this study, using the Gauss-Rice neuron model, we present a balanced-state cortical circuit model for which the firing rate distribution can be exactly calculated. It offers selfconsistent solutions to recurrent neuronal networks and allows for the combination of multiple neuronal populations, with single or multiple synaptic receptors (e.g. AMPA and NMDA in excitatory populations), paving the way for a deeper understanding of how firing rate distributions are impacted by single neuron or synaptic properties.</description>
