      <title>Blow-up exponents and a semilinear elliptic equation for the fractional Laplacian on hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{H}^n$ be the $n$-dimensional real hyperbolic space, $\Delta$ its nonnegative Laplace--Beltrami operator whose bottom of the spectrum we denote by $\lambda_{0}$, and $\sigma \in (0,1)$.
  The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we determine the Fujita exponent for the fractional heat equation \[\partial_{t} u + \Delta^{\sigma}u = e^{\beta t}|u|^{\gamma-1}u,\] by proving that nontrivial positive global solutions exist if and only if $\gamma\geq 1 + \beta/ \lambda_{0}^{\sigma}$. On the other hand, we prove the existence of non-negative, bounded and finite energy solutions of the semilinear fractional elliptic equation \[
  \Delta^{\sigma} v - \lambda^{\sigma} v - v^{\gamma}=0 \] for $0\leq \lambda \leq \lambda_{0}$ and $1&lt;\gamma&lt; \frac{n+2\sigma}{n-2\sigma}$. The two problems are known to be connected and the latter, aside from its independent interest, is actually instrumental to the former.
  \smallskip
  At the core of our results stands a novel fractional Poincar\'e-type inequality expressed in terms of a new scale of $L^{2}$ fractional Sobolev spaces, which sharpens those known so far, and which holds more generally on Riemannian symmetric spaces of non-compact type. We also establish an associated Rellich--Kondrachov-like compact embedding theorem for radial functions, along with other related properties.</description>

      <title>Multiscale modelling, analysis and simulation of cancer invasion mediated by bound and soluble enzymes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a cell-scale model for the degradation of the extra-cellular matrix by membrane-bound and soluble matrix degrading enzymes produced by cancer cells. Based on the microscopic model and using tools from the theory of homogenisation we propose a macroscopic model for cancer cell invasion into the extra-cellular matrix mediated by bound and soluble matrix degrading enzymes. For suitable and biologically relevant initial data we prove the macroscopic model is well-posed. We propose a finite element method for the numerical approximation of the macroscopic model and report on simulation results illustrating the role of the bound and soluble enzymes in cancer invasion processes.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Scattering for the Energy-Critical Wave Equation on Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering theory for the energy-critical wave equation on asymptotically flat spacetimes has, to date, been qualitative. While the qualitative scattering of solutions is well-understood, explicit bounds on the solution's global spacetime norms have been unavailable in this geometric setting.
  This paper establishes an explicit, exponential-type global bound on the Strichartz norm $\| u\|_{L^8_{t,x}}$ for solutions to the defocusing equation $\Box_g u=u^5$, where $\Box_g$ is the d'Alembertian associated with the perturbed metric. The bound depends on the solution's energy and an \textit{a priori} $\dot H^5 \times \dot H^4$ regularity bound on the solution.
  The proof develops a strategy that bypasses the need for vector-field commutators. It combines an interaction Morawetz estimate adapted to variable coefficients to control the solution's recent history with a dispersive analysis founded on integrated local energy decay to control the remote past. This strategy, in turn, necessitates the regularity and specific decay assumptions on the metric.
  As a result, this work upgrades the existing qualitative scattering theory to a fully quantitative statement, which provides a concrete measure of the global behavior of solutions in this geometric setting.</description>

      <title>On the absence of anomalous dissipation for the Navier-Stokes equations with Navier boundary conditions: a sufficient condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a bounded domain with Navier boundary conditions. We provide a sufficient condition for the absence of anomalous energy dissipation without making assumptions on the behaviour of the corresponding pressure near the boundary or the existence of a strong solution to the incompressible Euler equations with the same initial data. We establish our result by using our recent regularity results for the pressure corresponding to weak solutions of the incompressible Euler equations [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 249 (2025), 28].</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of the Larson-Penston collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove nonlinear stability of the Larson-Penston family of self-similarly collapsing solutions to the isothermal Euler-Poisson system. Our result applies to radially symmetric perturbations and it is the first full nonlinear stability result for radially imploding compressible flows. At the heart of the proof is the ground state character of the Larson-Penston solution, which exhibits important global monotonicity properties used throughout the proof.
  One of the key challenges is the proof of mode-stability for the non self-adjoint spectral problem which arises when linearising the dynamics around the Larson-Penston collapsing solution. To exclude the presence of complex growing modes other than the trivial one associated with time translation symmetry, we use a high-order energy method in low and high frequency regimes, for which the monotonicity properties are crucially exploited, and use rigorous computer-assisted techniques in the intermediate regime. In addition, the maximal dissipativity of the linearised operator is proven on arbitrary large backward light cones emanating from the singular point using the global monotonicity of the Larson-Penston solutions. Such a flexibility in linear analysis also facilitates nonlinear analysis and allows us to identify the exact number of derivatives necessary for the nonlinear stability statement. The proof is based on a two-tier high-order weighted energy method which ties bounds derived from the Duhamel formula to quasilinear top order estimates. To prove global existence we further use the Brouwer fixed point theorem to identify the final collapse time, which suppresses the trivial instability caused by the time-translation symmetry of the system.</description>

      <title>Effects of temporal variations on wave speeds of bistable traveling waves for Lotka-Volterra competition systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the bistable traveling waves for two-species Lotka-Volterra competition systems in time periodic environments. We focus especially on the influence of the temporal period, with existence results established for both small and large periods.We also show the existence of, and derive explicit formulas for, the limiting speeds as the period tends to zero or infinity, and provide estimates for the corresponding rates of convergence. Furthermore, we analyze the sign of wave speed. Assuming that both species share identical diffusion rates and intraspecific competition rates, we obtain a criterion for determining the sign of wave speed by comparing the intrinsic growth rates and interspecific competition strengths. More intriguingly, based on our explicit formulas for the limiting speeds, we construct an example in which the sign of wave speed changes with the temporal period. This example reveals that temporal variations can significantly influence competition outcomes,enabling different species to become dominant under different periods.</description>

      <title>Global Existence and Incompressible Limit for the Three-Dimensional Axisymmetric Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Large Bulk Viscosity and Large Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the three-dimensional axisymmetric compressible Navier-Stokes equations with slip boundary conditions in a cylindrical domain excluding the axis. We establish the global existence and exponential decay of weak, strong, and classical solutions with large initial data and vacuum, under the assumption that the bulk viscosity coefficient is sufficiently large. Moreover, we demonstrate that as the bulk viscosity coefficient tends to infinity, the solutions of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to those of the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Ill-posedness in $B^s_{p,\infty}$ of the Euler equations: Non-continuous dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve an open problem left in the monographs \cite[Bahouri-Chemin-Danchin, (2011)]{BCD}. Precisely speaking, it was obtained in \cite[Theorem 7.1 on pp293, (2011)]{BCD} the existence and uniqueness of $B^s_{p,\infty}$ solution for the Euler equations. We furthermore prove that the solution map of the Euler equation is not continuous in the Besov spaces from $B^s_{p,\infty}$ to $L_T^\infty B^s_{p,\infty}$ for $s&gt;1+d/p$ with $1\leq p\leq \infty$ and in the H\"{o}lder spaces from $C^{k,\alpha}$ to $L_T^\infty C^{k,\alpha}$ with $k\in \mathbb{N}^+$ and $\alpha\in(0,1)$, which later covers particularly the ill-posedness of $C^{1,\alpha}$ solution in \cite[Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., (2018)]{MYtams}. Beyond purely technical aspects on the choice of initial data, a remarkable novelty of the proof is the construction of an approximate solution to the Burgers equation.</description>

Abstract: This article is devoted to studying the inverse scattering for the fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation, and in particular we solve the Born approximation problem. Based on the ($p$,$q$)-type resolvent estimate for the fractional Laplacian, we derive an expression for the scattering amplitude of the scattered solution of the fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We prove the uniqueness of the potential using the scattering amplitude data.</description>

      <title>Wave maps from circle to Riemannian manifold: global controllability is equivalent to homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study wave maps from the circle to a general compact Riemannian manifold. We prove that the global controllability of this geometric equation is characterized precisely by the homotopy class of the data. As a remarkable intermediate result, we establish uniform-time global controllability between steady states, providing a partial answer to an open problem raised by Dehman, Lebeau and Zuazua (2003). Finally, we obtain quantitative exponential stability around closed geodesics with negative sectional curvature. This work highlights the rich interplay between partial differential equations, differential geometry, and control theory.</description>

      <title>Degenerate Elliptic PDEs on a Network with Kirchhoff Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we are interested in semilinear, possibly degenerate elliptic equations posed on a general network, with nonlinear Kirchhoff-type conditions for its interior vertices and Dirichlet boundary conditions for the boundary ones. The novelty here is the generality of the equations posed on each edge that is incident to a particular vertex, ranging from first-order equations to uniformly elliptic ones. Our main result is a strong comparison principle, i.e., a comparison result between discontinuous viscosity sub and supersolutions of such problems, from which we conclude the existence and uniqueness of a continuous viscosity by Perron's method. Further extensions are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes existence, uniqueness, and an L^1-comparison principle for weak solutions of a PDE system modeling phase transition reaction-diffusion in congested crowd motion. We consider a general reaction term and mixed homogeneous (Dirichlet and Neumann) boundary conditions. This model is applicable to various problems, including multi-species diffusion-segregation and pedestrian dynamics with congestion. Furthermore, our analysis of the reaction term yields sufficient conditions combining the drift with the reaction that guarantee the absence of congestion, reducing the dynamics to a constrained linear reaction-transport equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new methods designed to numerically approximate the solution to the time dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation, based on two types of ansatz: tensors, and approximation by a linear combination of gaussian wave packets. In both cases, the method can be seen as a restricted optimization problem, which can be solved by adapting either the Alternating Least Square algorithm in the tensor case, or some greedy algorithm in the gaussian wavepacket case. We also discuss the efficiency of both approaches.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a perturbation theory of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^n$ $(n \geq 3)$ is studied to investigate decay estimate of solutions around a non-constant state. As a concrete problem, stability is considered for a perturbation system from a stationary solution $u_\omega$ belonging to the weak $L^n$ space. Decay rates of the perturbation including $L^\infty$ norm are obtained which coincide with those of the heat kernel. The proof is based on deriving suitable resolvent estimates with perturbation terms in the low frequency part having a parabolic spectral curve. Our method can be applicable to dispersive hyperbolic systems like wave equations with strong damping. Indeed, a parabolic type decay rate of a solution is obtained for a damped wave equation including variable coefficients which satisfy spatial decay conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish global existence and decay of solutions of a viscous half Klein-Gordon equation with a quadratic nonlinearity considering initial data, whose Fourier transform is small in L1 cap Linfty. Our analysis relies on the observation that nonresonant dispersive effects yield a transformation of the quadratic nonlinearity into a subcritical nonlocal quartic one, which can be controlled by the linear diffusive dynamics through a standard L1 - Linfty argument. This transformation can be realized by applying the normal form method of Shatah or, equivalently, through integration by parts in time in the associated Duhamel formula.</description>

      <title>Vorticity blow-up for the 3D incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the finite-time blow-up for classical solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations with low-regularity initial vorticity. Applying the self-similar method and stability analysis of the self-similar system in critical Sobolev space, we prove that the vorticity of the axi-symmetric 3D Euler equations develops a finite-time singularity with certain scaling indices. Furthermore, we investigate the time integrability of the solutions. The proof is based on the new observations for the null structure of the transport term, and the parameter stability of the fundamental self-similar models.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of long waves through regions of irregular floating ice and bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05581v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing theoretical results for attenuation of surface waves propagating on water of random fluctuating depth are shown to over predict the rate of decay due to the way in which ensemble averaging is performed. A revised approach is presented which corrects this and is shown to conserve energy. New theoretical predictions are supported by numerical results which use averaging of simulations of wave scattering over finite sections of random bathymetry for which transfer matrix eigenvalues are used to accurately measure decay. The model of wave propagation used in this paper is derived from a linearised long wavelength assumption whereby depth averaging leads to time harmonic waves being represented as solutions to a simple ordinary differential equation. In this paper it is shown how this can be adapted to incorporate a model of a continuous covering of the surface by fragmented floating ice. Attenuation of waves through broken ice of random thickness is then analysed in a similar manner as bed variations previously and some comparisons are made with published field data for attenuation of waves in the marginal ice zones. Key features of the data are reproduced by theory including the attenuation being proportional to a power of frequency between 2 and 4 as well as capturing the "roll-over effect" at high frequencies.</description>

      <title>On the attenuation of waves through broken ice of randomly-varying thickness on water of finite depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent work of Dafydd and Porter [2024] on the attenuation of waves propagating through floating broken ice of random thickness is extended to consider water of non-shallow depth. A theoretical model of broken floating ice is analysed using a multiple scales analysis to provide an explicit expression for the attenuation of waves as they propagate from a region of constant thickness ice into a semi-infinite region of ice whose thickness is a slowly-varying random function of distance. Theoretical predictions are shown to compare well to numerical simulations of scattering over long finite regions of ice of randomly-varying thickness computed from an approximate depth-averaged model derived under a mild-slope assumption. The theory predicts a low-frequency attenuation proportional to the eighth power of frequency and a roll-over effect at higher frequencies. The relationship between the results and field measurements are discussed.</description>

      <title>SRaFTE: Super-Resolution and Future Time Extrapolation for Time-Dependent PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SRaFTE (Super-Resolution and Future Time Extrapolation), a two-phase learning framework that couples coarse grid solvers with neural operators to super-resolve and forecast fine grid dynamics for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). In our construction, Phase 1 learns a super-resolution map from coarse to fine solutions, while Phase 2 embeds this operator in a predictor-corrector loop with the coarse solver, forming an operator composition that serves as a surrogate fine grid propagator for future-time extrapolation. We benchmark SRaFTE on three canonical two-dimensional PDEs of increasing dynamical complexity: the heat equation, the wave equation, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Compared to well-known benchmarks, SRaFTE provides reliable super-resolution in Phase 1 and delivers consistently accurate long-term forecasts in Phase 2 across all three examples for new test data. Our results suggest that coupling a learned super-resolution operator with a coarse grid solver provides an effective and efficient means of modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly when the dynamics of the PDEs at the coarse and fine resolutions exhibit pronounced scale separation.</description>

      <title>On Courant-type bounds and spectral partitioning via Neumann domains on quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on quantum graphs, with a particular focus on Morse eigenfunctions via nodal and Neumann domains. Building on Courant-type arguments, we establish upper bounds for the number of nodal points and explore conditions under which Neumann domains of eigenfunctions correspond to minimizers to a class of spectral partition problems often known as spectral minimal partitions. The main focus will be the analysis on tree graphs, where we characterize the spectral energies of such partitions and relate them to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian under genericity assumptions. Notably, we introduce a notion analogous to Courant-sharpness for Neumann counts and demonstrate when spectral minimal partitions coincide with partitions formed by Neumann domains of eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Global existence and pointwise decay for nonlinear waves under the null condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves global existence and sharp pointwise decay for solutions to nonlinear wave equations satisfying the semilinear null condition, on a class of three-dimensional, asymptotically flat, and notably, non-stationary spacetimes. We consider nonlinearities satisfying a generalized null condition which does not necessarily retain its structure when commuted with vector fields. For sufficiently small initial data, and under the assumption that the underlying linear operator satisfies an integrated local energy decay estimate, we prove that solutions exist for all time and we establish sharp pointwise decay estimates for the solution $\phi$ and its vector-fields. The solution itself decays as $|\phi(t,x)| \lesssim \langle t+r \rangle^{-1} \langle t-r \rangle^{-1}$. This rate matches that of the linear equation on a flat background. This rate is sharp, as this behavior holds already for certain time-dependent perturbations of the classical null form on Minkowski space, which we specify.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two curves bounding a region of area $A$ that evolve under curve shortening flow, we propose the principle that the regularity of one should be controllable in terms of the regularity of the other, starting from time $A/\pi$. We prove several results of this form and demonstrate that no estimate can hold before that time. As an example application, we construct solutions to graphical curve shortening flow starting with initial data that is merely an $L^1$ function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to establish the Runge-type approximation in $L^2(0,T;\widetilde{H}^s(\Omega))$ for solutions of linear nonlocal wave equations. To achieve this, we extend the theory of very weak solutions for classical wave equations to our nonlocal framework. This strengthened Runge approximation property allows us to extend the existing uniqueness results for Calder\'on problems of linear and nonlinear nonlocal wave equations in our earlier works. Furthermore, we prove unique determination results for the Calder\'on problem of nonlocal wave equations with polyhomogeneous nonlinearities.</description>

Abstract: Given $s\in (3/2,2)$ and $\varepsilon &gt;0$, we construct a compactly supported initial data $\theta_0$ such that $\| \theta_0 \|_{H^s}\leq \varepsilon$ and there exist $T&gt;0$, $c&gt;0$ and a local-in-time solution $\theta$ of the SQG equation that is compactly supported in space, continuous and differentiable in $t$ and in $x$ on $\mathbb{R}^2\times [0,T]$, and, for each $t\in [0,T]$, $ \theta (\cdot ,t ) \in {H^{s/(1+ct)}}$ and $ \theta (\cdot ,t ) \not \in {H^\beta }$ for any $\beta &gt; s/(1+ct)$. Moreover, $\theta$ is unique among all solutions with initial condition $\theta_0$ which belong to $C([0,T];H^{1+\alpha })$ for any $\alpha &gt;0$ and is continuous and differentiable in $t$ and in $x$ on $\mathbb{R}^2\times [0,T]$.</description>

      <title>The Ground State of a Cubic-quintic Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger Equation with Radial Potential in the Thomas-Fermi Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the ground state of the cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger energy functional \begin{gather*}
  \begin{aligned}
  {E}(\varphi)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\left(|\nabla \varphi|^2+V(x)|\varphi|^2\right)\,dx
  \pm\frac{1}{4}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|\varphi|^4\,dx
  +\frac{1}{6}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|\varphi|^6\,dx, (d=1,2,3)
  \end{aligned} \end{gather*}
  under the mass constraint $\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|\varphi|^2\,dx=N$, where $N$ can be viewed as particle number, and $V(x)$ behaves like $C|x|^p (p\geq 2)$ as $|x|\rightarrow +\infty$, including the harmonic potential. When $N\rightarrow +\infty$, we show that up to a suitable scaling the ground state $\varphi_N$ would convergence strongly in some $L^q(\mathbb{R}^d)$ space to a Thomas-Fermi minimizer, this limit can be referred to as the \emph{Thomas-Fermi limit}. The limit Thomas-Fermi profile has compact support, given by $u^{TF}(x)=\left[\mu^{TF}-C_0|x|^p\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}_{+}$, where $\mu^{TF}$ is a suitable Lagrange multiplier with exact value. We find that, similar to the asymptotic analysis in [J. Funct. Anal. 260 (2011), 2387-2406.] and [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 217 (2015), 439-523.] for Gross-Pitaevskii energy in the Thomas-Fermi limit where a small parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to 0, there also has a steep \emph{corner layer} near the boundary of compact support of $u^{TF}(x)$, in which the ground state has irregular behavior as $N\rightarrow +\infty$. Finally, we establish a new energy method to obtain the $L^\infty$-convergence rates of ground states $\varphi_N$ inside the corner layer and outside corner layer respectively, this method may be applicable to other general nonlinearities.</description>

Abstract: We investigate regularity properties of minimizers for non-autonomous convex variational integrands $F(x, \mathrm{D} u)$ with linear growth, defined on bounded Lipschitz domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. Assuming appropriate ellipticity conditions and H\"older continuity of $\mathrm{D}_zF(x,z)$ with respect to the first variable, we establish higher integrability of the gradient of minimizers and provide bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set of minimizers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses several geometric inverse problems for some linear parabolic systems where the initial data (and sometimes also the coefficients of the equations) are unknown.
  The goal is to identify a subdomain within a multidimensional set.
  The non-homogeneous part of the equation is expressed as a function satisfying some specific assumptions near a positive time.
  We establish uniqueness results by incorporating observations that can be on a part of the boundary or in an interior (small) domain.
  Through this process, we also derive information about the initial data.
  The main tools required for the proofs include semigroup theory, unique continuation and time analyticity results</description>

Abstract: We obtain an upper bound on the heat kernel of the Keller-Segel finite particle system that exhibits blow up effects. The proof exploits a connection between Keller-Segel finite particles and certain non-local operators. The latter allows to address some aspects of the critical behaviour of the Keller-Segel system resulting from its two-dimensionality.</description>

Abstract: We consider the following nonlinear elliptic system of Hamiltonian type with critical exponents: \begin{equation*}\left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;-\Delta u + V(|y'|,y'') u = v^p, \;\; \text{in} \;\; \mathbb{R}^N,\\ &amp;-\Delta v + V(|y'|,y'') v = u^q, \;\; \text{in} \;\; \mathbb{R}^N,\\ &amp;u, v &gt; 0 , (u,v) \in (\dot{W}^{2,\frac{p+1}{p}} (\mathbb{R}^N) \cap L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)) \times (\dot{W}^{2,\frac{q+1}{q}} (\mathbb{R}^N) \cap L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)) ,\end{aligned}\right. \end{equation*} where $(y', y'') \in \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^{N-2}$ and $V(|y'|, y'')\not\equiv 0$ is a bounded non-negative function in $\mathbb{R}_+\times \mathbb{R}^{N-2}$, $p,q&gt;1$ satisfying $$\frac{1}{p+1}+\frac{1}{q+1}=\frac{N-2}{N}.$$ By using a finite reduction argument and local Pohozaev identities, under the assumption that $N\geq 5$, $(p,q)$ lies in the certain range and $r^2V(r,y'')$ has a stable critical point, we prove that the above problem has infinitely many solutions whose energy can be made arbitrarily large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:math/0607294v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of concentrated polymer solutions modeled by a 2D Smoluchowski equation. We describe the long time behavior of the polymer suspensions in a fluid.
  When the flow influence is neglected the equation has a gradient structure. The presence of a simple flow introduces significant structural changes in the dynamics. We study the case of an externally imposed flow with homogeneous gradient. We show that the equation is still dissipative but new phenomena appear.The dynamics depend on both the concentration intensity and the structure of the flow.
  In certain limit cases the equation has a gradient structure, in an appropriate reference frame, and the solutions evolve to either a steady state or a tumbling wave. For small perturbations of the gradient structure we show that for small concentrations the solutions evolve in the long time limit to a steady state. However for high concentrations there is a rigidity phenomenon for the tumbling wave.</description>
