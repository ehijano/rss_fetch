      <title>Model-Free Deep Hedging with Transaction Costs and Light Data Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Option pricing theory, such as the Black and Scholes (1973) model, provides an explicit solution to construct a strategy that perfectly hedges an option in a continuous-time setting. In practice, however, trading occurs in discrete time and often involves transaction costs, making the direct application of continuous-time solutions potentially suboptimal. Previous studies, such as those by Buehler et al. (2018), Buehler et al. (2019) and Cao et al. (2019), have shown that deep learning or reinforcement learning can be used to derive better hedging strategies than those based on continuous-time models. However, these approaches typically rely on a large number of trajectories (of the order of $10^5$ or $10^6$) to train the model. In this work, we show that using as few as 256 trajectories is sufficient to train a neural network that significantly outperforms, in the Geometric Brownian Motion framework, both the classical Black &amp; Scholes formula and the Leland model, which is arguably one of the most effective explicit alternatives for incorporating transaction costs. The ability to train neural networks with such a small number of trajectories suggests the potential for more practical and simple implementation on real-time financial series.</description>

      <title>Regression and Forecasting of U.S. Stock Returns Based on LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyses the investment returns of three stock sectors, Manuf, Hitec, and Other, in the U.S. stock market, based on the Fama-French three-factor model, the Carhart four-factor model, and the Fama-French five-factor model, in order to test the validity of the Fama-French three-factor model, the Carhart four-factor model, and the Fama-French five-factor model for the three sectors of the market. French five-factor model for the three sectors of the market. Also, the LSTM model is used to explore the additional factors affecting stock returns. The empirical results show that the Fama-French five-factor model has better validity for the three segments of the market under study, and the LSTM model has the ability to capture the factors affecting the returns of certain industries, and can better regress and predict the stock returns of the relevant industries. Keywords- Fama-French model; Carhart model; Factor model; LSTM model.</description>

      <title>Developing Cryptocurrency Trading Strategy Based on Autoencoder-CNN-GANs Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18202v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast and analyze financial time series. The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to filter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then, one-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and extracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is fed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected network. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data, combined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance, validating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover underlying patterns in financial sequences. Keywords - CNN;GANs; Cryptocurrency; Prediction.</description>
