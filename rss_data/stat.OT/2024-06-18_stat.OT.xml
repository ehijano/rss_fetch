      <title>Producing treatment hierarchies in network meta-analysis using probabilistic models and treatment-choice criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key output of network meta-analysis (NMA) is the relative ranking of the treatments; nevertheless, it has attracted a lot of criticism. This is mainly due to the fact that ranking is an influential output and prone to over-interpretations even when relative effects imply small differences between treatments. To date, common ranking methods rely on metrics that lack a straightforward interpretation, while it is still unclear how to measure their uncertainty. We introduce a novel framework for estimating treatment hierarchies in NMA. At first, we formulate a mathematical expression that defines a treatment choice criterion (TCC) based on clinically important values. This TCC is applied to the study treatment effects to generate paired data indicating treatment preferences or ties. Then, we synthesize the paired data across studies using an extension of the so-called "Bradley-Terry" model. We assign to each treatment a latent variable interpreted as the treatment "ability" and we estimate the ability parameters within a regression model. Higher ability estimates correspond to higher positions in the final ranking. We further extend our model to adjust for covariates that may affect treatment selection. We illustrate the proposed approach and compare it with alternatives in two datasets: a network comparing 18 antidepressants for major depression and a network comparing 6 antihypertensives for the incidence of diabetes. Our approach provides a robust and interpretable treatment hierarchy which accounts for clinically important values and is presented alongside with uncertainty measures. Overall, the proposed framework offers a novel approach for ranking in NMA based on concrete criteria and preserves from over-interpretation of unimportant differences between treatments.</description>

      <title>Philosophy within Data Science Ethics Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is wide agreement that ethical considerations are a valuable aspect of a data science curriculum, and to that end, many data science programs offer courses in data science ethics. There are not always, however, explicit connections between data science ethics and the centuries-old work on ethics within the discipline of philosophy. Here, we present a framework for bringing together key data science practices with ethics topics. The ethics topics were collated from sixteen data science ethics courses with public-facing syllabi and reading lists. We encourage individuals who are teaching data science ethics to engage with the philosophical literature and its connection to current data science practices, which are rife with potentially morally charged decision points.</description>

      <title>The PORTSEA (Portuguese School of Extremes and Applications) and a few personal scientific achievements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Portuguese School of Extremes and Applications is nowadays well recognised by the international scientific community, and in my opinion, the organisation of a NATO Advanced Study Institute on Statistical Extremes and Applications, which took place at Vimeiro in the summer of 1983, was a landmark for the international recognition of the group. The dynamic of publication has been very high and the topics under investigation in the area of Extremes have been quite diverse. In this article, attention will be paid essentially to some of the scientific achievements of the author in this field.</description>
