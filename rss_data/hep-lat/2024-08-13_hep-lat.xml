      <title>Systematic Uncertainties from Gribov Copies in Lattice Calculation of Parton Distributions in the Coulomb gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been proposed to compute parton distributions from boosted correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge within the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory. This method does not involve Wilson lines and could greatly improve the efficiency and precision of lattice QCD calculations. However, there are concerns about whether the systematic uncertainties from Gribov copies, which correspond to the ambiguity in lattice gauge-fixing, are under control. This work gives an assessment of the Gribov copies' effect in the Coulomb-gauge-fixed quark correlators. We utilize different strategies for the Coulomb-gauge fixing, selecting two different groups of Gribov copies based on the lattice gauge configurations. We test the difference in the resulted spatial quark correlators in the vacuum and a pion state. Our findings indicate that the statistical errors of the matrix elements from both Gribov copies, regardless of the correlation range, decrease proportionally to the square root of the number of gauge configurations. The difference between the strategies does not show statistical significance compared to the gauge noise. This demonstrates that the effect of the Gribov copies can be neglected in the practical lattice calculation of the quark parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Properties of Gauge Theories from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16235v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between higher-form symmetries and entanglement properties in discrete lattice gauge theories, which can exhibit both topologically ordered phases and higher-form symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Our study centers on generalizing the Fradkin-Shenker model, where the Gauss law constraint can be either emergent or exact. The phase diagram includes a topologically ordered phase and a non-trivial SPT phase protected by a 1-form and a 0-form symmetry. We obtain the following key findings: First, the entanglement properties depend on whether the 1-form symmetries and the Gauss law are exact or emergent. For the emergent Gauss law, the entanglement spectrum (ES) of the non-trivial SPT phase exhibits degeneracies, which are robust at low energies against weak perturbations that explicitly break the exact 1-form symmetry. When the Gauss law and the 1-form symmetry are both exact, the ES degeneracy is extensive. This extensive degeneracy is fragile and can be removed completely by infinitesimal perturbations that explicitly break the exact 1-form symmetry while keeping the Gauss law exact. Second, we consider the ES in the topologically ordered phase where 1-form symmetries are spontaneously broken. In contrast to the ES of the non-trivial SPT phase, we find that spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking removes "half" of the ES levels, leading to a non-degenerate ES in the topologically ordered phase in general. Third, we derive a connection between spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking and the topological entanglement entropy (TEE). Using this relation, we investigate the entanglement entropy that can be distilled in the deconfined phase of the original Fradkin-Shenker model using gauge-invariant measurements. We show that the TEE is robust against the measurement when the 1-form symmetry is emergent but fragile when the 1-form symmetry is exact.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative four-gluon vertex in soft kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a nonperturbative study of the form factor associated with the projection of the full four-gluon vertex on its classical tensor, for a set of kinematics with one vanishing and three arbitrary external momenta. The treatment is based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation governing this vertex, and a large-volume lattice simulation, involving ten thousand gauge field configurations. The key hypothesis employed in both approaches is the ``planar degeneracy'', which classifies diverse configurations by means of a single variable, thus enabling their meaningful ``averaging''. The results of both approaches show notable agreement, revealing a considerable suppression of the averaged form factor in the infrared. The deviations from the exact planar degeneracy are discussed in detail, and a supplementary variable is used to achieve a more accurate description. The effective charge defined through this special form factor is computed within both approaches, and the results obtained are in excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>$DK/D\pi$ scattering and an exotic virtual bound state at the $SU(3)$ flavour symmetric point from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastic $S-$wave scattering of a charm meson with a light pseudoscalar meson in $J^P =0^+$ is investigated in the flavour $\bar{\mathbf{3}}$, $\mathbf{6}$ and $\overline{\mathbf{15}}$ sectors at the $SU(3)_f$ flavour point using lattice QCD, working on three volumes with $m_{\pi} \approx 700$ MeV. Large bases of interpolating operators are employed to extract finite-volume spectra, which are subsequently used with the L\"uscher method to provide constraints on infinite-volume scattering amplitudes. Examining the singularities of the amplitudes, the $S-$wave amplitude in the flavour $\bar{\mathbf{3}}$ sector is found to contain a deeply bound state, strongly coupled to elastic threshold, corresponding to the $J^P = 0^+$ $D_{s0}^*(2317)$. In the exotic flavour $\mathbf{6}$ sector a virtual bound state is found at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{pole}}} = 2510 - 2610$ MeV, roughly $40-140$ MeV below threshold, whereas the $\overline{\mathbf{15}}$ channel shows weak repulsion.</description>

      <title>New insights into the nature of the $\Lambda(1380)$ and $\Lambda(1405)$ resonances away from the SU(3) limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the SU(3) limit, we consider the nature of the dynamically generated resonances $\Lambda(1380)$, $\Lambda(1405)$ and $\Lambda(1680)$ as the pion and kaon masses are tuned to their physical values. We show that the accidental symmetry of the two octets due to the leading order Weinberg-Tomozawa term is broken by the next-to-leading order terms. Most interestingly, we observe an interchange of the two trajectories of the $\Lambda(1380)$ and the $\Lambda(1405)$ away from the SU(3) limit at next-to-leading order. This remarkable phenomenon can be investigated using lattice QCD calculations that start from the SU(3) limit.</description>

      <title>Novel knotted non-abelian gauge fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analogy to null electromagnetic fields we define null YM fields. We show that the null non-abelian $SU(N)$ gauge fields admit a set of $2 N^2$ conserved "helicities". We derive null YM solutions that carry finite helicities by uplifting the abelian Hopfion solution and their generalizations. Another method that we implement is to deform YM solutions which do not carry helicities into ones that have nontrivial helicities. A nontrivial non-Abelian solution with helicities is found as a wave of infinite energy. We also discuss non-abelian generalizations of the Bateman parameterization for null abelian gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Predicting isovector charmonium-like states from X(3872) properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using chiral effective field theory, we predict that there must be isovector charmonium-like $D\bar D^*$ hadronic molecules with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ denoted as $W_{c1}$. The inputs are the properties of the $X(3872)$, including its mass and the ratio of its branching fractions of decays into $J/\psi\rho^0$ and $J/\psi\omega$. The predicted states are virtual state poles of the scattering matrix, pointing at a molecular nature of the $X(3872)$ as well as its spin partners. They should show up as either a mild cusp or dip at the $D\bar D^*$ thresholds, explaining why they are elusive in experiments. The so far negative observation also indicates that the $X(3872)$ is either a bound state with non-vanishing binding energy or a virtual state, only in these cases the $X(3872)$ signal dominates over that from the $W_{c1}^0$. The pole positions are $3881.2^{+0.8}_{-0.0}- i 1.6^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$ MeV for $W_{c1}^0$ on the fourth Riemann sheet of the $D^0\bar D^{*0}$-$D^+D^{*-}$ coupled-channel system, and $3866.9^{+4.6}_{-7.7}- i (0.07\pm0.01)$ MeV for $W_{c1}^\pm$ on the second Riemann sheet of the $(D\bar D^*)^\pm$ single-channel system. The findings imply that the peak in the $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass distribution is not purely from the $X(3872)$ but contains contributions from $W_{c1}^0$ predicted here. The states should have isovector heavy quark spin partners with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $2^{++}$ and $1^{+-}$, with the last one corresponding to $Z_c$. We suggest to search for the charged $0^{++}$, $1^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ states in $J/\psi\pi^\pm \pi^0$.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative study of the electroweak phase transition in the real scalar singlet extended Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a nonperturbative lattice study of the electroweak phase transition in the real singlet scalar extension of the Standard Model.We consider both the heavy and light singlet-like scalar regimes at non-zero singlet-doublet mixing angle. After reviewing features of the lattice method relevant for phase transition studies, we analyze the dependence of phase transition thermodynamics on phenomenologically relevant parameters. In the heavy singlet-like scalar regime, we find that the transition is crossover for small doublet-singlet mixing angles, despite the presence of an energy barrier in the tree-level potential. The transition becomes first order for sufficiently large mixing angles. We find two-loop perturbation theory to agree closely with the lattice results for all thermodynamical quantities considered here (critical temperature, order parameter discontinuity, latent heat) when the transition is strongly first order. For the light singlet-like scalar regime relevant to exotic Higgs decays, we update previous one-loop perturbative results using the two-loop loop dimensionally reduced effective field theory and assess the nature of the transition with lattice simulations at set of benchmark parameter points. For fixed singlet-like scalar mass the transition becomes crossover when the magnitude of the Higgs-singlet portal coupling is small. We perform our simulations in the high-temperature effective theory, which we briefly review, and present analytic expressions for the relevant lattice-continuum relations.</description>

      <title>VAIM-CFF: A variational autoencoder inverse mapper solution to Compton form factor extraction from deeply virtual exclusive reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new methodology for extracting Compton form factors (CFFs) in from deeply virtual exclusive reactions such as the unpolarized DVCS cross section using a specialized inverse problem solver, a variational autoencoder inverse mapper (VAIM). The VAIM-CFF framework not only allows us access to a fitted solution set possibly containing multiple solutions in the extraction of all 8 CFFs from a single cross section measurement, but also accesses the lost information contained in the forward mapping from CFFs to cross section. We investigate various assumptions and their effects on the predicted CFFs such as cross section organization, number of extracted CFFs, use of uncertainty quantification technique, and inclusion of prior physics information. We then use dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis to visualize the missing physics information tracked in the latent space of the VAIM framework. Through re-framing the extraction of CFFs as an inverse problem, we gain access to fundamental properties of the problem not comprehensible in standard fitting methodologies: exploring the limits of the information encoded in deeply virtual exclusive experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of a relativistic Bose gas under rigid rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of a rigidly rotating relativistic Bose gas. First, we derive the solution of the equation of motion corresponding to a rotating complex Klein-Gordon field and determine the free propagator of this model utilizing the Fock-Schwinger proper-time method. Using this propagator, we then obtain the thermodynamic potential of this model in the zeroth and first perturbative level. In addition, we compute the nonperturbative ring contribution to this potential. Our focus is on the dependence of these expressions on the angular velocity, which effectively acts as a chemical potential. Using this thermodynamic potential, we calculate several quantities, including the pressure, angular momentum and entropy densities, heat capacity, speed of sound, and moment of inertia of this rigidly rotating Bose gas as functions of temperature ($T$), angular velocity ($\Omega$), and the coupling constant ($\alpha$). We show that certain thermodynamic instabilities appear at high temperatures and large couplings. They are manifested as zero and negative values of the above quantities, particularly the moment of inertia and heat capacity. Zero moment of inertia leads to the phenomenon of supervorticity at certain $T$ or $\alpha$. Supervortical temperatures (couplings) decrease with increasing coupling (temperature). We also observe superluminal sound velocities at high $T$ and for large $\alpha$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the constraints on low-energy coefficients of the $\nu$SMEFT generalization of the Standard Model effective theory in the simple case of a $\text{U}(1)^\prime$ enlargement of the Standard Model gauge group. In particular, we analyse the constraints imposed by the requirement that the extended theory remains free of gauge anomalies. We present the cases of explicit realisations, showing the obtained correlations among the coefficients of $d=6$ operators.</description>
