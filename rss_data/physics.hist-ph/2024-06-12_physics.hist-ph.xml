      <title>The elision of the subject and the manifestation of the world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to the contextuality of the properties of quantum objects, quantum mechanics does not appear to countenance the elision of the thinking and perceiving subject. If quantum objects owe their properties to the experimental conditions in which they are observed, the experimental apparatus cannot owe its properties to the quantum objects of which it is commonly said to be composed. It follows that neither quantum objects nor measuring instruments can be regarded as property-carriers existing independently of conscious subjects. However, if the difference between the classical domain and the quantum domain is understood as essentially the difference between the manifested world and what is instrumental in its manifestation, the elision of the subject can again be achieved.</description>

      <title>Representational conventions and invariant structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the philosophical literature, symmetries of physical theories are most often interpreted within the general doctrine called 'Sophistication'. Roughly speaking, it says that models related by symmetries can peacefully co-exist while representing the same physical possibility. But this interpretation still leaves open two main worries about Sophistication: (a) it allows the individuation of what I call 'structure-tokens' to remain intractable and thus of limited use, which is why practising physicists frequently invoke 'relational, symmetry-invariant observables'; and (b) it leaves us with no formal framework for expressing counterfactual statements about the world. Here, I will show that a new Desideratum to be satisfied by theories with symmetries answers these worries. The new Desideratum is that the theory admits what I will call representational conventions for its structure-tokens.</description>
