      <title>Ultra-low threshold chaos in cavity magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity magnomechanics using mechanical degrees of freedom in ferromagnetic crystals provides a powerful platform for observing many interesting classical and quantum nonlinear phenomena in the emerging field of magnon spintronics. However, to date, the generation and control of chaotic motion in a cavity magnomechanical system remain an outstanding challenge due to the inherently weak nonlinear interaction of magnons. Here, we present an efficient mechanism for achieving magnomechanical chaos, in which the magnomechanical system is coherently driven by a two-tone microwave field consisting of a pump field and a probe field. Numerical simulations show that the relative phase of the two input fields plays an important role in controlling the appearance of chaotic motion and, more importantly, the threshold power of chaos is reduced by 6 orders of magnitude from watts to microwatts. In addition to providing insight into magnonics nonlinearity, cavity magnomechanical chaos will always be of interest because of its significance both in fundamental physics and potential applications ranging from ultra-low threshold chaotic motion to chaos-based secret information processing.</description>

      <title>Measuring dynamical phase transitions in time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in methods for detecting and interpreting changes in experimental time evolution data. Based on measured time series, the quantitative characterization of dynamical phase transitions at bifurcation points of the underlying chaotic systems is a notoriously difficult task. Building on prior theoretical studies that focus on the discontinuities at $q=1$ in the order-$q$ R\'enyi-entropy of the trajectory space, we measure the derivative of the spectrum. We derive within the general context of Markov processes a computationally efficient closed-form expression for this measure. We investigate its properties through well-known dynamical systems exploring its scope and limitations. The proposed mathematical instrument can serve as a predictor of dynamical phase transitions in time series.</description>

      <title>Interface-induced turbulence in viscous binary fluid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of interface-induced turbulence, an emergent nonequilibrium statistically steady state (NESS) with spatiotemporal chaos, which is induced by interfacial fluctuations in low-Reynolds-number binary-fluid mixtures. We uncover the properties of this NESS via direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of cellular flows in the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations for binary fluids. We show that, in this NESS, the shell-averaged energy spectrum $E(k)$ is spread over several decades in the wavenumber $k$ and it exhibits a power-law region, indicative of turbulence but without a conventional inertial cascade. To characterize the statistical properties of this turbulence, we compute, in addition to $E(k)$, the time series $e(t)$ of the kinetic energy and its power spectrum, scale-by-scale energy transfer as a function of $k$, and the energy dissipation resulting from interfacial stresses. Furthermore, we analyze the mixing properties of this low-Reynolds-number turbulence via the mean-square displacement (MSD) of Lagrangian tracer particles, for which we demonstrate diffusive behavior at long times, a hallmark of strong mixing in turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Duffing oscillator: metamorphoses of $1:2$ resonance and its interaction with the primary resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $1: 2$ resonance in the periodically forced asymmetric Duffing oscillator due to the period-doubling of the primary $1: 1$ resonance or forming independently, coexisting with the primary resonance. We compute the steady-state asymptotic solution - the amplitude-frequency implicit function. Working in the differential properties of implicit functions framework, we describe complicated metamorphoses of the $1:2$ resonance and its interaction with the primary resonance.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Purcell-type microswimmers with active-elastic joints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purcell's planar three-link microswimmer is a classic model of swimming in low-Reynolds-number fluid, inspired by motion of flagellated microorganisms. Many works analyzed this model, assuming that the two joint angles are directly prescribed in phase-shifted periodic inputs. In this work, we study a more realistic scenario by considering an extension of this model which accounts for joints' elasticity and mechanical actuation of periodic torques, so that the joint angles are dynamically evolving. Numerical analysis of the swimmer's dynamics reveals multiplicity of periodic solutions, depending on parameters of the inputs - frequency and amplitude of excitation, joints' stiffness ratio, as well as joint's activation. We numerically study swimming direction reversal, as well as bifurcations, stability transitions, and symmetry breaking of the periodic solutions, which represent the effect of buckling instability observed in swimming microorganisms. The results demonstrate that this variant of Purcell's simple model displays rich nonlinear dynamic behavior with actuated-elastic joints. Similar results are also obtained when studying an extended model of a six-link microswimmer.</description>

      <title>Hayden-Preskill recovery in chaotic and integrable unitary circuit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hayden-Preskill protocol probes the capability of information recovery from local subsystems after unitary dynamics. As such it resolves the capability of quantum many-body systems to dynamically implement a quantum error-correcting code. The transition to coding behavior has been mostly discussed using effective approaches, such as entanglement membrane theory. Here, we present exact results on the use of Hayden-Preskill recovery as a dynamical probe of scrambling in local quantum many-body systems. We investigate certain classes of unitary circuit models, both structured Floquet (dual-unitary) and Haar-random circuits. We discuss different dynamical signatures corresponding to information transport or scrambling, respectively, that go beyond effective approaches. Surprisingly, certain chaotic circuits transport information with perfect fidelity. In integrable dual-unitary circuits, we relate the information transmission to the propagation and scattering of quasiparticles. Using numerical and analytical insights, we argue that the qualitative features of information recovery extend away from these solvable points. Our results suggest that information recovery protocols can serve to distinguish chaotic and integrable behavior, and that they are sensitive to characteristic dynamical features, such as long-lived quasiparticles or dual-unitarity.</description>
