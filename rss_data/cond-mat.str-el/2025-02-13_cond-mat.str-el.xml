      <title>Magnetic order through Kondo coupling to quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of magnetic order in localized spins that interact solely through their coupling to a Kitaev-type spin liquid. Using three toy models -- the Kitaev model, the Yao-Lee model, and a square-lattice generalization of the Kitaev model -- we calculate the effective exchange Hamiltonians mediated by the fractionalized excitations of these spin liquids. This setup is analogous to a Kondo lattice model, where conduction electrons are replaced by itinerant Majorana fermions. In the Kitaev model, our results show that the lowest-order perturbation theory generates short-range interactions with modified couplings and extending to sixth order introduces longer-range interactions while preserving the quantum spin-liquid ground state. Models involving more Majorana flavors on honeycomb and square lattices exhibit more complex behavior. The honeycomb Yao-Lee model with three flavors of itinerant Majorana fermions generates long-range RKKY-type interactions, leading to antiferromagnetic order and partial gapping of the Majorana fermion spectrum. In contrast, the square-lattice model produces a combination of anisotropic short- and long-range interactions, which can give rise to either a dimerized quantum paramagnetic state or an Ising antiferromagnet, depending on the parameters. These results illustrate the rich variety of magnetic orders that can be mediated by Kitaev-type spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Kitaev-Ising-$J_1$-$J_2$ model: a density matrix renormalization group study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the Kitaev honeycomb model with the additional XX Ising interaction between the nearest and the next nearest neighbors (Kitaev-Ising-$J_1$-$J_2$ model), by using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. Such additional interaction correspond to the nearest and diagonal interactions on the square lattice. Phase diagram of the bare Kitaev model consist of low entangled commensurate magnetic phases and entagled Kitaev spin liquid. Anisotropic Ising interaction allows the entangled incommensurate magnetic phases in the phase diagram, which previously was predicted only for more complex type of interactions. We study the scaling law of the entanglement entropy and the bond dimension of the matrix product state with the size of the system. In addition, we propose an optimization algorithm to prevent DMRG from getting stuck in the low-entangled phases.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origin of Reduced Magnetic Order in a Frustrated Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08523v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although magnetic frustration in metals provides a promising avenue for novel quantum phenomena, their microscopic interpretation is often challenging. Here we use the face-centered cubic intermetallic HoInCu$_4$ as model material to show that Hamiltonians neglecting the charge degree of freedom are appropriate for frustrated metals possessing low density of states at the Fermi surface. Through neutron scattering techniques we determine matching magnetic exchange interactions in the paramagnetic and field-polarized states using an effective spin-1 Heisenberg Hamiltonian, for which we identify antiferromagnetic nearest and next-nearest neighbour interactions $J_1$ and $J_2$ that are close to the critical ratio $J_2$/$J_1$ = 1/2. The study further provides evidence that spin-wave theory fails to predict the low-energy spin dynamics in the antiferromagnetic zero-field state, which is dominated by overdamped magnetic excitations. We conclude that the low-energy fluctuations arise from quantum fluctuations, accounting for the missing moment of the strongly renormalized magnetic long-range order.</description>

      <title>Broken symmetries associated with a Kagome chiral charge order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality or handedness manifests in all fields of science, ranging from cell biology, molecular interaction, and catalysis to different branches of physics. In condensed matter physics, chirality is intrinsic to enigmatic quantum phases, such as chiral charge density waves and chiral superconductivity. Here, the underlying chiral response is subtle and leads to broken symmetries in the ground state. Detection of subtle broken symmetries is the key to understand these quantum states but they are extremely challenging to expose leading to debate and controversy. Here, using second-order optical response, we uncover the broken symmetries of a chiral charge density wave in the Kagome lattice KV3Sb5, revealing the relevant broken symmetries of its charge order. KV3Sb5 undergoes a phase transition to a charge-ordered state at low temperatures. Our polarization-dependent mid-infrared photocurrent microscopy reveals an intrinsic, longitudinal helicity-dependent photocurrent associated with the charge order. Our measurements, supported by our theoretical analysis, provide direct evidence for broken inversion and mirror symmetries at the charge order transition, indicating a chiral charge ordered state. On the other hand, we do not observe a circular photogalvanic effect along the direction perpendicular to that of the incident light, imposing stringent constraints on the rotational and point group symmetries of the charge order. Our study not only visualizes the chiral nature of the Kagome charge order revealing its broken symmetries, but also highlights the nonlinear photogalvanic effect as a sensitive probe for detecting subtle symmetry breakings.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of Bad Fermions: Origin of Two Gaps in HTSC Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the doped ${t-t'}$ Hubbard model with parameters typical for high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Our approach is based on a novel strong-coupling Green's function expansion around a reference system -- the exactly solvable undoped particle-hole symmetric Hubbard lattice -- that possesses a large antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard-Slater gap in the electron spectrum. The electron spectral function in the case of a large next-nearest-neighbor hopping ${t'=-0.3t}$, which is characteristic of the ${T_c \approx 100\,\text{K}}$ family of cuprates, reveals a strongly renormalized flat band feature with a pseudogap around the antinodal point. The superconducting response of this system to a small ${d_{x^2-y^2}}$-like external field exhibits a very unusual form. It features a pseudogap at the antinodal point in the normal part of the Nambu Green's function, related to a ``bad-fermion'' behavior in a normal phase, as well as a ${d}$-wave-like structure in the anomalous (Gorkov's) Green's function, with zero response at the nodal point of the Brillouin zone. Remarkably, we find that the anomalous part of the response deviates essentially from the simplest ${(\cos{k_x}-\cos{k_y})}$ form in momentum space. Specifically, its extrema are shifted away from the ${(\pi,0)}$ and ${(0,\pi)}$ points due to suppression of the response by the pseudogap. The observed two-gap structure of the electron spectra in a generic strong-coupling model of cuprates can serve as a basis for phenomenological treatment of different physical properties of high-temperature superconductors within two-fluid model.</description>

      <title>Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.</description>

      <title>Lattice Defects in Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have become a key platform for studying quantum many-body systems. In these setups, defects arise naturally due to various imperfections and can significantly modify the theoretical predictions compared to an ideal model. Here, we investigate the impact of geometric defects in the simplest situation -- a one-dimensional Rydberg atom array, both at and away from its emergent Ising criticality. In the presence of defects, we demonstrate that relevant physical quantities can be extracted from one-point correlation functions. At the critical point, we show that different types of kinks yield distinct outcomes corresponding to their respective spatial-internal symmetries: site-centered kinks can effectively break the array at the kink position regardless of the kink angle, while bond-centered kinks lead to interesting intermediate-coupling fixed points. In the latter case, due to a special renormalization group flow trajectory, the whole system can appear ordered if the system is not large enough. Additionally, away from criticality, the bond-centered kink induces a localization-delocalization transition of the domain wall, characteristic of quantum wetting. These findings highlight the utility of kinks as experimental probes and stress the importance of controlling defects so that experimental observations remain faithful to the pristine model.</description>

      <title>Imaging van Hove Singularity Heterogeneity in Overdoped Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuning the chemical potential of a solid to the vicinity of a van Hove singularity (vHS) is a well-established route to discovering emergent quantum phases. In monolayer graphene, the use of electron-donating metal layers has recently emerged as a method to dope the chemical potential to the nearest vHS, as evidenced by Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. In this work, we study the spatial uniformity of the doping from this process using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM). Using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), we achieve electron doping of graphene on SiC using Ytterbium (Yb-Graphene). We show using in-situ ARPES that the chemical potential is shifted to within 250 meV of the vHS. Using in-situ SI-STM, we establish that there exists significant inhomogeneity in the vHS position in overdoped graphene. We find two separate reasons for this. First, the spatial inhomogeneity of the intercalated Yb leads to local variations in the doping, with a length scale of inhomogeneity set by the screening length of ~ 3 nm. Second, we observe the presence of substitutional Yb dopants in the graphene basal plane. These Yb dopants cause a strong local shift of the doping, along with a renormalization of the quasiparticle amplitude. Theoretical calculations confirm that the Yb impurities effectively change the local potential, thus energetically shifting the position of the van Hove singularity. Our results point to the importance of considering the spatial structure of doping and its inextricable link to electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Fermionic CFTs from topological boundaries in abelian Chern-Simons theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum field theory is referred to as bosonic (non-spin) if its physical quantities are independent of the spacetime spin structure, and as fermionic (spin) if they depend on it. We explore fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs) that emerge from bosonic abelian Chern-Simons theories, playing the role of a symmetry topological field theory, by imposing topological boundary conditions. Our construction includes the fermionic generalization of code CFTs. When the Chern-Simons theory is associated with the root lattice of a simply laced Lie algebra, this approach yields a fermionic CFT with a level-one affine Lie algebra symmetry. As an application, we consider the Chern-Simons theories corresponding to a class of supersymmetric vertex operator algebras studied by Johnson-Freyd and classify their fermionic topological boundary conditions that give rise to supersymmetric CFTs.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases in a flat-top optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermionic atoms in a large-scale, homogeneous optical lattice provide an ideal quantum simulator for investigating the fermionic Hubbard model, yet achieving this remains challenging. Here, by developing a hybrid potential that integrates a flat-top optical lattice with an optical box trap, we successfully realize the creation of three-dimensional, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases across approximately $8\times10^5$ lattice sites. This homogeneous system enables us to capture a well-defined energy band occupation that aligns perfectly with the theoretical calculations for a zero-temperature, ideal fermionic Hubbard model. Furthermore, by employing novel radio-frequency spectroscopy, we precisely measure the doublon fraction $D$ as a function of interaction strength $U$ and temperature $T$, respectively. The crossover from metal to Mott insulator is detected, where $D$ smoothly decreases with increasing $U$. More importantly, we observe a non-monotonic temperature dependence in $D$, revealing the Pomeranchuk effect and the development of extended antiferromagnetic correlations.</description>

      <title>Probing the many-body localized spin-glass phase through quench dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstates of quantum many-body systems are often used to define phases of matter in and out of equilibrium; however, experimentally accessing highly excited eigenstates is a challenging task, calling for alternative strategies to dynamically probe nonequilibrium phases. In this work, we characterize the dynamical properties of a disordered spin chain, focusing on the spin-glass regime. Using tensor-network simulations, we observe oscillatory behavior of local expectation values and bipartite entanglement entropy. We explain these oscillations deep in the many-body localized spin glass regime via a simple theoretical model. From perturbation theory, we predict the timescales up to which our analytical description is valid and confirm it with numerical simulations. Finally, we study the correlation length dynamics, which, after a long-time plateau, resumes growing in line with renormalization group (RG) expectations. Our work suggests that RG predictions can be quantitatively tested against numerical simulations and experiments, potentially enabling microscopic descriptions of dynamical phases in large systems.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity near an Ising nematic quantum critical point in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near a two-dimensional Ising-type nematic quantum critical point, the quantum fluctuations of the nematic order parameter are coupled to the electrons, leading to non-Fermi liquid behavior and unconventional superconductivity. The interplay between these two effects has been extensively studied through the Eliashberg equations for the superconducting gap. However, previous studies often rely on various approximations that may introduce uncertainties in the results. Here, we revisit this problem without these approximations and examine how their removal changes the outcomes. We numerically solve four self-consistent Eliashberg integral equations of the mass renormalization $A_{1}(p)$, the chemical potential renormalization $A_{2}(p)$, the pairing function $\Phi(p)$, and the nematic self-energy (polarization) function $\Pi(q)$ using the iteration method. Our calculations retain the explicit non-linearity and the full momentum dependence of these equations. We find that discarding some commonly used approximations allows for a more accurate determination of the superconducting gap $\Delta = \Phi/A_{1}$ and the critical temperature $T_{c}$. The Eliashberg equations have two different convergent gap solutions: an extended $s$-wave gap and a $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave gap. The latter is fragile, whereas the former is robust against small perturbations.</description>

      <title>Interlayer interactions in $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under pressure: from $s^{\pm}$ to $d_{xy}$-wave superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of \emph{interlayer} interaction terms in the competition between different superconducting gap symmetries in the bilayer nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under high pressure. We study a two-layer, two-orbital electron model that encompasses both intra- and interlayer Coulomb interaction terms within the matrix random-phase approximation. We find that interlayer interactions favor a $d_{xy}$-wave superconducting pairing symmetry over the $s^{\pm}$-wave symmetry, which has been found to prevail when interlayer interactions are disregarded. Moreover, our findings indicate that interlayer interactions enhance the interorbital pairing, incorporating contributions from all three electron pockets, arising from both $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character, resulting in nodes within the gap function (not present in the $s^{\pm}$-wave state) and consequently favoring the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing.</description>

Abstract: The control of antiferromagnets with ultrashort optical pulses has emerged as a prominent field of research. Tailored laser excitation can launch coherent spin waves at terahertz frequencies, yet a comprehensive description of their generation mechanisms is still lacking despite extensive efforts. Using terahertz emission spectroscopy, we investigate the generation of a coherent magnon mode in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$ under a range of photoexcitation conditions. By tuning the pump photon energy from transparency to resonant with a $d$-$d$ transition, we reveal a striking change in the coherent magnon's dependence on the pump polarization, indicating two distinct excitation mechanisms. Our findings provide a strategy for the manipulation of magnetic modes via photoexcitation around sub-gap electronic states.</description>

      <title>Transient dynamical phase diagram of the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the real-time dynamics of the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model across a broad range of coupling strengths, using the numerically exact inchworm quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. From short- and intermediate-time dynamics starting from an initially decoupled state, we extract signatures of the zero-temperature quantum phase transition between localized and delocalized states. We show that the dynamical phase diagram thus obtained differs from the equilibrium phase diagram in both the values of critical couplings and the associated values of the critical exponent. We also identify and quantitatively analyze two competing mechanisms for the crossover between coherent oscillations and incoherent decay. Deep in the sub-Ohmic regime, the crossover is driven by the damping of the oscillation amplitude, while closer to the Ohmic regime the oscillation frequency itself drops sharply to zero at large coupling.</description>

      <title>Generalized Josephson effect with arbitrary periodicity in quantum magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Easy-plane quantum magnets are strikingly similar to superconductors, allowing for spin supercurrent and an effective superconducting phase stemming from their $U(1)$ rotation symmetry around the $z$-axis. We uncover a generalized fractional Josephson effect with a periodicity that increases linearly with system size in one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ chains at selected anisotropies and phase-fixing boundary fields. The effect combines arbitrary integer periodicities in a single system, exceeding the $4\pi $ and $8\pi $ periodicity of superconducting Josephson effects of Majorana zero modes and other exotic quasiparticles. We reveal a universal energy-phase relation and connect the effect to the recently discovered phantom helices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical kinetic energy quenching in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of critical spin fluctuations and hot electrons at the metallic antiferromagnetic quantum critical points with $Z_2$ and $O(2)$ spin symmetries, building upon earlier works on the $O(3)$ symmetric theory. The interacting theories in $2+1$ dimensions are approached from $3+1$-dimensional theories in the $\epsilon$-expansion that tunes the co-dimension of Fermi surface as a control parameter. The low-energy physics of the $Z_2$ and $O(2)$ theories qualitatively differ from each other and also from that of the $O(3)$ theory. The difference is caused by higher-order quantum corrections beyond the one-loop order that are important even to the leading order in $\epsilon$. The naive loop-expansion breaks down due to dynamical quenching of kinetic energy: the speed of the collective mode ($c$) and the Fermi velocity perpendicular to the magnetic ordering vector ($v$) become vanishingly small at low energies. What sets the three theories apart is the hierarchy that emerges between the quenched kinetic terms. At the infrared fixed point, $c/v$ becomes $0$, $1$ and $\infty$ in the $Z_2$, $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ theories, respectively. At intermediate energy scales, the slow renormalization group (RG) flows of $c$ and $v$ toward their fixed point values create approximate scale invariance controlled by approximate marginal parameters. The manifold of those quasi-fixed points and the RG flow therein determines crossovers from scaling behaviours with transient critical exponents at intermediate energy scales to the universal scaling in the low-energy limit. If the symmetry group is viewed as a tuning parameter, the $O(2)$ theory corresponds to a multi-critical point which has one additional quasi-marginal parameter than the other two theories.</description>

      <title>Two Channel Multi impurity Kondo model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasua-Yoisida interaction in two channel Kondo impurity systems is a relevant perturbation when the number of impurities N is greater than 3. We find a new critical point with anomalous dimensions 1/(N+1) for the spin operator and the Sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat scales as $\gamma \sim T^{- \frac{3}{N+1}}$. The inter-channel hybridization plays the role of the most relevant operator at this fixed point having anomalous dimensions (N-1)/(2N+2)$. The critical point universal properties are relevant to many strong correlation problems, such as impurity placed in a Majorana metal and the multichannel Kondo lattice model of heavy fermion materials. We discuss relevance of our results for cluster DMFT studies of quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Possible Fano effect and suppression of Andreev reflection in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently-discovered high-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has stimulated intensive debates. Key controversies concern interlayer versus intralayer pairing scenarios and if the hybridization plays a key role in establishing the superconductivity. But experimental clarification is difficult due to the limitation of employing state-of-the-art techniques under high pressure. Here we propose that quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection may provide a feasible way to distinguish different pairing scenarios. We predict that an asymmetric Fano line shape may be induced by the hybridization between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ metallic bands and the strongly renormalized flat $d_{z^2}$ quasiparticle bands. In the superconducting state, we show that the Andreev reflection should be greatly suppressed for interlayer pairing superconductivity with a small interlayer hopping. We propose future experiments to examine these predictions and help clarify the fundamental physics of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and other multilayer nickelate superconductors.</description>
