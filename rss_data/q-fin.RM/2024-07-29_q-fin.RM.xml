      <title>Testing for the Asymmetric Optimal Hedge Ratios: With an Application to Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing financial risk is of paramount importance to investors, financial institutions, and corporations. Since the pioneering contribution of Johnson (1960), the optimal hedge ratio based on futures is regularly utilized. The current paper suggests an explicit and efficient method for testing the null hypothesis of a symmetric optimal hedge ratio against an asymmetric alternative one within a multivariate setting. If the null is rejected, the position dependent optimal hedge ratios can be estimated via the suggested model. This approach is expected to enhance the accuracy of the implemented hedging strategies compared to the standard methods since it accounts for the fact that the source of risk depends on whether the investor is a buyer or a seller of the risky asset. An application is provided using spot and futures prices of Bitcoin. The results strongly support the view that the optimal hedge ratio for this cryptocurrency is position dependent. The investor that is long in Bitcoin has a much higher conditional optimal hedge ratio compared to the one that is short in the asset. The difference between the two conditional optimal hedge ratios is statistically significant, which has important repercussions for implementing risk management strategies.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of Big Data and Machine Learning-Based Risk Monitoring System in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing complexity of financial markets and rapid growth in data volume, traditional risk monitoring methods no longer suffice for modern financial institutions. This paper designs and optimizes a risk monitoring system based on big data and machine learning. By constructing a four-layer architecture, it effectively integrates large-scale financial data and advanced machine learning algorithms. Key technologies employed in the system include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Trees, and real-time data processing platform Apache Flink, ensuring the real-time and accurate nature of risk monitoring. Research findings demonstrate that the system significantly enhances efficiency and accuracy in risk management, particularly excelling in identifying and warning against market crash risks.</description>

      <title>The Democratization of Wealth Management: Hedged Mutual Fund Blockchain Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop several innovations to bring the best practices of traditional investment funds to the blockchain landscape. Specifically, we illustrate how: 1) fund prices can be updated regularly like mutual funds; 2) performance fees can be charged like hedge funds; 3) mutually hedged blockchain investment funds can operate with investor protection schemes, such as high water marks; and 4) measures to offset trading related slippage costs when redemptions happen. Using our concepts - and blockchain technology - traditional funds can calculate performance fees in a simplified manner and alleviate several operational issues. Blockchain can solve many problems for traditional finance, while tried and tested wealth management techniques can benefit decentralization, speeding its adoption. We provide detailed steps - including mathematical formulations and instructive pointers - to implement these ideas and discuss how our designs overcome several blockchain bottlenecks, making smart contracts smarter. We provide numerical illustrations of several scenarios related to our mechanisms.</description>
