      <title>On the decay of a light spinless particle into two photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effective couplings of a light, spinless, gauge-singlet particle $\phi$ to on-shell photons. Starting from the most general theory at the electroweak scale, which allows for CP-violating interactions suppressed by inverse powers of an ultraviolet scale $\Lambda$, we derive the corresponding low-energy effective theory valid below the GeV scale. Within this framework, we systematically expand the effective couplings of $\phi$ to on-shell photons in powers of small parameters. Working at the one-loop level, we retain terms at first order in $1/\Lambda$. We incorporate both isospin-breaking effects and $\eta$-$\eta'$ mixing, and provide explicit expressions for the couplings up to first order in $m_\phi^2/m_\eta^2$ and $m_\pi^2/m_\eta^2$. As applications, we compute the decay rate of $\phi$ into two photons and illustrate our results in several physically motivated scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quirks Live in Cool Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that cosmological observations place strong bounds on the reheat temperature $T_\text{RH}$ of the Standard Model (SM) in minimal models of `quirks' -- heavy fermions transforming under the SM gauge group together with a new non-Abelian gauge interaction with a confinement scale far below the mass of the fermions. These models have unique collider signals associated with the confining flux strings, which cannot break due to the large mass of the quirks. Our work shows that in these models $T_\text{RH} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV for the entire `quirky' parameter space where the effects of the flux string are important. These bounds are in tension with most models of baryogenesis, showing that the discovery of quirks at colliders can have far-reaching implications for cosmology. The bounds arise because the irreducible relic abundance of glueballs from UV freeze-in, combined with their long lifetimes, leads to constraints from the disruption of BBN, distortions of the CMB, excess $\gamma$-rays, an over-abundance of self-interacting dark matter, and contributions to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. The glueball freeze-in abundance has a strong dependence on $T_\text{RH}$, making the bounds relatively insensitive to strong interaction uncertainties. The bounds are robust to the SM quantum numbers of the quirks and the presence of Yukawa couplings with the Higgs. In non-minimal extensions of the model where the glueballs can decay to an additional dark sector, the bounds remain for models where the flux string has a macroscopic length at colliders. We also show that for quirk masses above $\sim 10$ TeV, the dark glueballs can be the dominant component of dark matter. This work illustrates a striking connection between quirky collider signals and cosmological probes of new physics, strengthening the case for targeted quirk searches at colliders.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions from LLE-type R-parity Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) induced by the trilinear $LLE$ couplings in $R$-parity-violating supersymmetry in a split-family spectrum where third-generation sleptons can be comparatively light. We systematically classify the relevant coupling patterns, derive the corresponding effective interactions and NSI parameters, and confront the resulting parameter space with a broad set of experimental constraints. We find that percent-level NSI can be realized in selected channels, with the largest magnitudes reaching $\varepsilon_{ee}\simeq 8\%$ and $\varepsilon_{\mu\mu}\simeq 3.8\%$, while other entries are typically restricted to the sub-percent level (including $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}\simeq -0.3\%$ in the viable off-diagonal case). We also highlight the structural origin of the different constraint patterns between $\widetilde{\tau}_R$- and $\widetilde{\tau}_L$-mediated scenarios and comment on the relation to the Zee model.</description>

      <title>Assessing the role of threshold conditions in the determination of uncertainties in pole extractions using Pad\'e approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we discuss the determination of the $f_0(500)$ resonance by analytic continuation through Pad\'e approximants of the $\pi\pi$-scattering amplitude from the physical region to the pole in the complex energy plane. Using as input a class of admissible parametrizations of the scalar-isoscalar $\pi\pi$ partial wave and imposing now the correct threshold behavior of the partial amplitude, we improve on the determinations of pole positions obtained in Ref. [1], thus empowering the Pad\'e method as a simple and precise tool for extracting resonance poles from amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Echoes of $R^3$ modification and Goldstone preheating in the CMB-BAO landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $R^2$ and the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation are disfavored by the observed high spectral index $n_s$ from the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements at the $\sim2\sigma$ level. The addition of a dimension-six $R^3$ term in the action helps alleviate this tension. We show that the parameter space accounting for the observed high $n_s$ also induces rapid Goldstone and Higgs preheating. The preheating, especially from Goldstone modes, helps match the CMB and inflationary scales, which in turn supports the observed $n_s$.</description>

      <title>Generalized structure functions in semileptonic tau decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In case there are tensor interactions beyond the SM in the low-energy effective Lagrangian, their interference with the SM V-A currents yields a contribution for tau decays into three or more mesons that cannot be included in the famous structure functions introduced by K\"uhn and Mirkes in their seminal 1992 paper. We present this generalization here, highlighting again the importance of measuring the (generalized) spectral functions, as being model-independent and exploiting maximally the data. This can be particularly relevant for CP and T violation studies with at least three mesons in the final state of the tau decay.</description>

      <title>Irreducible Constraints on Hadronically Interacting Sub-GeV Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive conservative upper limits on the dark-matter--nucleon scattering cross-section for sub-GeV mass dark matter. Working exclusively within the low-energy chiral effective theory, we derive bounds that are independent of the details of the dark matter interactions in the UV. Dark matter that interacts only hadronically at leading order also inevitably interacts with photons or electrons at next-to-leading-order. We show that these electromagnetic interactions lead to strong constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis and over-production of dark matter via freeze-in at low temperatures, while the leading-order hadronic couplings face stringent constraints from meson decays. Combining these constraints, we rule out both spin-independent and spin-dependent dark-matter--nucleon scattering cross-sections $\gtrsim 10^{-36}\,{\rm cm}^2$ for dark matter masses in the keV - 100 MeV range. These bounds are several orders of magnitude stronger than the existing constraints from astrophysics and cosmology and have significant implications for future low-mass direct detection experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the framework of generalized parton distribution, we provide a unified interpretation of the connected and disconnected contributions from the ab-initio Euclidean path-integral formulation of the hadronic tensor in both the nucleon elastic form factors and the parton distribution functions. We develop a phenomenology to elucidate non-perturbative contributions to deep inelastic structure functions, which can be extended to observables in heavy-ion collisions probing baryon junctions.</description>

      <title>Formulation of Relativistic Dissipative Spin Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of this thesis is to develop a consistent theoretical framework of dissipative hydrodynamics for a relativistic fluid with spin - hereafter referred to as relativistic dissipative spin hydrodynamics. In this framework, the dynamical description of a relativistic fluid requires a new macroscopic variable, the spin density, which is associated with a spin tensor. This tensor, defined as the expectation value of a rank-3 tensor operator in quantum field theory, contributes to the system's total angular momentum. The need for such a theory is motivated by recent measurements of spin polarization of hadrons produced in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
  Two distinct formulation methods are employed. The first is grounded in covariant thermodynamics and extends the conventional Navier-Stokes and M\"uller-Israel-Stewart theories of relativistic hydrodynamics by incorporating a spin tensor. The second is based on principles of relativistic quantum statistical mechanics, building upon and generalizing the foundational Zubarev approach. Both formulations aim to construct a closed system of evolution equations for the macroscopic variables and, via an entropy-current analysis, to identify the dissipative currents and their associated transport coefficients.
  These two approaches provide different perspectives for future applications focused on spin polarization measurements. Beyond its phenomenological relevance, the theory also opens several avenues for further theoretical developments. These include the verification of the thermodynamic relations employed in the first formulation method using microscopic frameworks, as well as a deeper understanding of the emerging transport coefficients - particularly those associated with the spin tensor - through microscopic modeling or data-driven parameter extraction.</description>

      <title>Explicit rephasing transformation of four-generation mixing matrix and formulae for CP phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present an explicit rephasing transformation that maps a general $4\times4$ flavor mixing matrix to the standard parametrization of four-generation models. By combining rephasing-covariant minors and the determinant systematically, we derive expressions for all three Dirac-type CP phases, three Majorana phases, and four unphysical phases by arguments of matrix elements. The resulting formulae smoothly reduce to the three-generation results in the limit where the fourth generation decouples.</description>

      <title>A novel realization of linear seesaw model in a non-invertible selection rule with the assistance of $\mathbb Z_3$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel realization of linear seesaw model in a non-invertible selection rule with the assistance of $\mathbb Z_3$ symmetry. In our framework, Dirac mass matrices are generated at one-loop level, dynamically breaking the non-invertible symmetry while the symmetry is invariant under the tree-level. In addition to the active neutrino masses, the model exhibits rich and testable phenomenology such as non-unitarity bound, lepton flavor violations, lepton anomalous magnetic moment, and dark matter candidate. After describing our model, we carry out numerical analysis and show some results for our physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Axion-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate axion-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields, focusing on the evolution of the photon intensity and polarizations induced by conversion into axions. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields characterized by the power spectra of their helical/non-helical components, we express the expectation values and variances of the photon intensity and linear/circular polarizations after conversion in terms of these spectra. We find nontrivial dependencies of these statistical quantities on the characteristic magnetic field correlation length, the propagation distance, and the axion mass. Moreover, we find that nontrivial polarizations emerge even if the photons are initially unpolarized, that the variances of these observables become suppressed in specific frequency regions, and that a peak structure arises in the expectation value of the circular polarization in the presence of statistically helical magnetic fields. We also point out consistency relations among these statistical quantities that hold independently of the specific forms of the magnetic field power spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the continuous advances in modern experimental facilities, we investigate the radially excited F-wave bottom and bottom-strange mesons that have not yet been observed experimentally. By combining theoretical inputs with available experimental information on charm mesons and applying flavor-symmetry parameters, we predict the masses of the radially excited F-wave bottom states and their strange partners. In addition, we compute their strong decay widths in terms of the hadronic coupling constants $\tilde{g}_{ZH}$ and $\tilde{g}_{RH}$. Using the presently estimated values of these couplings, we obtain upper bounds on the corresponding decay widths. These predictions will serve as testable benchmarks for forthcoming heavy-flavor spectroscopy findings.</description>

      <title>Large lepton asymmetry from axion inflation and helium abundance hinted by ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of helical magnetic fields and the associated chiral asymmetry via the chiral anomaly is a generic feature in pseudoscalar inflation. In the presence of a Chern--Simons coupling between the inflaton and a U(1) gauge field, the homogeneous evolution of the inflaton induces a tachyonic instability in one circular polarization of the gauge field, resulting in the production of helical magnetic fields. In this work, we show that, in the case of a gauged lepton flavor symmetry, U(1)$_{L_i-L_j}$, this mechanism can lead to the generation of a sizable lepton asymmetry. In a simple setup, however, the resulting lepton asymmetry is typically too small to have an observational consequences, even setting aside constraints from baryon overproduction via sphaleron processes, due to the backreaction of the produced gauge fields and fermions on the inflationary dynamics. We demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by implementing a mechanism to suppress fermion production during inflation. As a result, a much larger lepton asymmetry can be generated from the subsequent decay of magnetic helicity. Remarkably, for the gauged U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry, the generated asymmetry can be sufficiently large to suppress the primordial helium abundance, as may be inferred from recent cosmic microwave background observations by ACT.</description>

      <title>Dipion transitions from $X(3872)$ to $\chi_{cJ}\ (J=0,1,2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dipion transition processes $X(3872)\to \pi \pi \chi_{cJ} (J=0,1,2)$ within the framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory, treating $X(3872)$ as a molecular state composed of $D\bar{D}^*+h.c.$ components. By analyzing the box and triangle loop diagrams with nonrelativistic effective field theory power counting rule, we demonstrate that box diagrams dominate these dipion transitions processes. Branching ratios are calculated as functions of the mixing angle $\theta$, which parameterizes the neutral and charged meson compositions of the $X(3872)$. Our results indicate that the branching fractions for $X(3872)\to\pi\pi\chi_{c0}$, $X(3872)\to \pi\pi\chi_{c1}$, and $X(3872)\to \pi\pi\chi_{c2}$ are of orders $10^{-4}$, $10^{-3}$, and $10^{-5}$, respectively. We also predict the ratios ${\mathcal{B}[X(3872)\rightarrow \pi\pi\chi_{c0/2}]}/{\mathcal{B}[X(3872)\rightarrow \pi\pi\chi_{c1}]}$ and ${\mathcal{B}[X(3872)\rightarrow \pi^+\pi^-\chi_{cJ}]}/{\mathcal{B}[X(3872)\rightarrow \pi^0\pi^0\chi_{cJ}]}$. The latter deviates from isospin-symmetry expectations, revealing various degrees of isospin violation. By studying the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\pi^+\chi_{cJ}$ invariant mass spectra, we find a double-bump structure in the $\pi^ + \pi^-$ invariant mass distributions of the process $X(3872)\to \pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1}$ and $\pi^+\chi_{c0}$ invariant mass distribution of the process $X(3872)\to \pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c0}$, which could be tested by the future experimental measurements.</description>

Abstract: The total yield of neutral D-mesons (4$\pi$) in central Xe+La interactions at 150 GeV per nucleon has been calculated within the Geant4 FTF model. Our calculation is close to predictions of Monte Carlo models that do not account for quark-gluon plasma formation. As the predictions, our calculation substantially underestimates preliminary experimental data. The experimental data indicate enhanced charmed particle production in nucleus-nucleus interactions. We present also our calculations for charmed meson production in ${\rm p+p}$, ${\rm d+d}$ and ${\rm ^4He+^4He}$ interactions for future NICA/SPD experiment at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$10 and 20 GeV.</description>

      <title>Search for Light Dark Matter in Rare Meson Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current dark matter direct detection experiments have low sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter. In this work, we demonstrate that rare $B$ and $K$ meson decays with missing energy in the final state can serve as efficient probes in this mass range. We analyze a generic $Z^{\prime}$ portal dark matter model and derive upper limits on its parameters from experimental bounds on the rare $B$ and $K$ meson decays. Our results show that such meson decay processes provide complementary constraints to current direct detection experiments for sub-GeV dark matter, particularly for interaction forms mediated by dark matter momentum dependent operators.</description>

      <title>Can Randomness lead to non-anarchical mixing angles ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the proposal of Craig and Sutherland that Anderson localization in a disordered fermion theory space can generate small neutrino masses from TeV scale physics \citecraig2018exponential}. Building on this idea, we ask a broader question: can randomness in fermion mass parameters also give rise to nonanarchical neutrino mixing angles, and how does the answer depend on the geometry of the mass graph? To explore this, we analyse three representative geometries a nearest neighbour chain, a fully connected non local model, and the Petersen graph in both Dirac and Majorana neutrino realisations. In the regime of strong diagonal disorder, all geometries display robust localization and naturally generate the observed neutrino mass scale, with the corresponding flavour mixing angles reflecting the random localization centres and thus taking an anarchical form. In the regime of weak disorder, where localization is milder, and eigenmodes can exhibit quasidegeneracies, light neutrino masses can emerge through GIM-mechanismlike cancellations among the heavy states. The weak disorder with geometry dependent weak localization constitutes a distinct pathway to structured mixings within disordered theory spaces. Overall, our results delineate the regimes in which disorder driven mechanisms produce hierarchical masses and identify the conditions under which structured flavour mixing can arise.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement between partons in a strongly coupled quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a first-principles, non-perturbative investigation of quantum entanglement between partonic constituents in a strongly coupled 3+1-dimensional scalar Yukawa theory, using light-front Hamiltonian methods with controlled Fock-space truncations. By explicitly constructing reduced density matrices for (mock) nucleon, pion, and anti-nucleon subsystems from light-front wave functions, we compute key entanglement witnesses, including von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and linear entropy, in both quenched (no sea pairs) and unquenched frameworks. We find that the entanglement entropy is closely related to the Shannon entropy of the transverse momentum dependent distribution, establishing a link between quantum information and parton structure. In contrast, the unquenched theory reveals genuinely non-classical correlations: the entanglement entropy cannot be reduced to any Shannon entropy of normalized parton distributions, demonstrating that the full hadronic wave function encodes quantum information beyond classical probabilities. Our findings highlight the role of entanglement as a fundamental probe of non-perturbative dynamics in relativistic quantum field theory and lay the groundwork for extending these concepts to QCD and future collider phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide results for the vacuum expectation values of the flowed action density, the quark condensate, and the quark kinetic operator in the gradient-flow formalism. We work in $N_\text{F}$-flavor QCD, keeping the heaviest quark massive and all others massless. The vacuum expectation values of these operators are calculated numerically through next-to-next-to-leading order QCD, providing important input for the extraction of fundamental QCD parameters from lattice calculations. While the focus is on charm- and bottom-quark mass effects, we provide the results in a form that is independent of the specific quark mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the nature of higher dimensional operators generated by quantum gravity. Calculating the tree-level and one-loop effective operators generated by graviton exchange between fields of the standard model and those of a hidden sector, we show that the leading order operators generated by quantum gravity are non-local dimension 6 operators. Dimension 5 operators are not generated by perturbative (weak field) effects, although they might be generated by strong field effects such as Planck-scale fluctuations in spacetime. We investigate the consequences of our findings for models of ultralight scalar dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a detailed impact study of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering unpolarized cross sections' measurements using the proposed SoLID apparatus at Jefferson Lab. This type of data, collected at large Bjorken $x_{bj}$, moderate values of $Q^2$ and small values of the transverse momentum of produced hadrons, $P_{hT}$, allows to study transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution and fragmentation functions in a still poorly explored region. We present the projected results for charged light mesons based on simulated data. For the azimuthal-angle integrated cross sections we adopt the TMD framework up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (N3LL) accuracy, while a simpler TMD parton model is employed for the study of azimuthal angular dependencies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Origin of Classical Background Fields from Coherent States: A First-Principles Formulation in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical background electromagnetic fields are routinely employed in quantum electrodynamics to describe a wide range of physical situations, from laser-matter interactions to strong-field phenomena. In this work, we present a first-principles formulation that clarifies the quantum origin of such classical background fields in QED by systematically deriving them from coherent states of the electromagnetic field.
  Abstract Starting from the operator formulation of QED, we show how scattering amplitudes between coherent states naturally lead to an effective description in terms of background fields, while maintaining a clear separation between the coherent laser mode and other quantized photon degrees of freedom. This framework allows one to consistently incorporate effects beyond the fixed background approximation, such as depletion and backreaction, without assuming any particular field strength or intensity regime.
  Abstract We further demonstrate how the conventional generating functional with a prescribed background field emerges as a limiting case, corresponding to fixed coherent state boundary conditions. The path integral representation is then obtained as a reformulation of the same underlying Heisenberg picture amplitudes, providing a unified view of operator-based and functional approaches.
  Abstract Our results establish a general and intensity-independent foundation for QED with coherent background fields, within which the standard formulations of strong-field QED arise as well-defined special cases.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the 2021 Outburst of GX 339-4 with AstroSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the 2021 outburst of GX 339-4 using AstroSat observations in the hard-intermediate (HIMS) and soft-intermediate states (SIMS). Spectral and timing analyses across these states suggest that during the SIMS, unabsorbed flux (0.1-3 keV), inner disc temperature, and "apparent" inner disc radius do not change, suggesting the stability of the disc. In the SIMS, the photon index decreases from 2.1 to 1.7, indicating spectral hardening. The power density spectra (PDS) suggest the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the HIMS and SIMS. The QPO frequency evolves from 0.1 Hz to 0.2 Hz in the HIMS, and further to 5.7 Hz in the SIMS. We also observe a decrease in QPO frequency from 5.7 Hz to 4.5 Hz during the SIMS. We discuss the evolution of the QPO, fractional root mean square (rms) amplitude, and time-lag spectra. We discover that variations in disc normalization, disc temperature, and coronal heating rate can reproduce the observed rms and lag spectra with a time delay between them.</description>

      <title>Acoustic gravitational waves from primordial curvature perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard perturbative calculations of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) have neglected nonperturbative effects in the large-amplitude regime. We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime. These results highlight the importance of nonperturbative effects for accurate predictions of stochastic GW signals induced from primordial curvature perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to call a class of deformed Feynman integrals as twisted Feynman integrals, where the integrand has an additional exponential factor linear in loop momenta. Such integrals appear in various contexts: tensor reduction of Feynman integrals, Fourier transform of Feynman integrals, and spin-resummed dynamics in post-Minkowskian gravity. First, we construct a mathematical framework that manifests the geometric interpretation of twisted Feynman integrals. Next, we generalise the standard mathematical tools for studying Feynman integrals for application to their twisted cousins, and explore their mathematical properties. In particular, it is found that (i) twisted Feynman integrals fall under the class of exponential periods, and (ii) the leading singularity approach using the (generalised) Baikov parametrisation applied to twisted Feynman integrals fail to detect the geometry underlying their function space.</description>

      <title>When Geometry Radiates Review: Gravitational Waves in Theory, Cosmology, and Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves provide a unique window into gravity, cosmology, and high-energy physics, enabling the exploration of fundamental phenomena across a wide range of scales. This review presents a coherent and pedagogical framework that bridges foundational theory with observational frontiers. We begin by developing the theory of gravitational radiation within linearized general relativity, deriving gravitational waves as solutions to the linearized Einstein equations and clarifying their physical interpretation, polarization states, and key properties. We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors. We then discuss the astrophysical and cosmological mechanisms responsible for generating gravitational radiation. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the field and outlining promising directions for future theoretical and observational developments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of the Born-Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory, the hyperfine structure of heavy quarkonium hybrids at leading order in the 1/m Q expansion is determined by two potentials. We estimate those potentials by interpolating between the known short distance behavior and the long distance behavior calculated in the QCD Effective String Theory. The long distance behavior depends, at leading order, on two parameters which can be obtained from the long distance behavior of the heavy quarkonium potentials (up to sign ambiguities). The short distance behavior depends, at leading order, on two extra paramentes, which are obtained from a lattice calculation of the lower lying charmonium hybrid multiplets. This allows us to predict the hyperfine splitting both of bottomonium hybrids and of higher multiplets of charmonium hybrids. We carry out a careful error analysis and compare with other approaches.</description>

      <title>A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quartic-divergent vacuum energy poses an ultraviolet (UV) challenge (the cosmological constant problem) in probing the nature of dark energy. Here we try to evaluate the contribution of the vacuum energy to dark energy with a method of the UV-free scheme. The result indicates that it is not a problem in the UV region but a question of the contributions of heavy fields being suppressed. Then, we explore an effective description via scale decoupling. The parameter spaces suggest that the vacuum energy of active neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV $(10^{-3}$ eV) is expected. The normal ordering neutrinos are preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

Abstract: Inelastic dark matter scenarios have attracted considerable attention in contemporary particle physics. In this study, we investigate the phenomenology of sub-GeV inelastic dark matter interacting via a lepton-specific scalar portal. By solving the Boltzmann equations, we obtain thermal target curves for several inelastic DM mass splittings in the sub-GeV mediator-mass range. We study the discovery potential of lepton fixed-target experiments, particularly NA64e, LDMX, and NA64$\mu$, via their missing-energy signatures. Our analysis focuses on the $\phi$-strahlung process, $l N \to l N \phi$, followed by the invisible decay of the scalar mediator into Majorana dark matter particles $\phi \to \chi_1 \chi_2$. We use this channel to probe the mediator coupling to charged leptons of the Standard Model. For phenomenologically viable parameters of the inelastic dark matter scenario, we derive projected sensitivities for NA64e, LDMX, and NA64$\mu$, assuming that the boosted state $\chi_2$ decays visibly via $\chi_2 \to \chi_1 e^+ e^-$ outside the detector acceptance. Our results demonstrate the complementary roles of electron- and muon-beam experiments in exploring the sub-GeV inelastic dark matter sector interacting via a scalar portal.</description>

      <title>Reflections on Noether's second theorem and the energy-momentum tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through symmetry of the action under global spacetime translations, Noether's first theorem infamously entails an energy-momentum tensor (EMT) that is neither symmetric nor gauge-invariant. In a prior work [Phys. Rev. D 106, 125012 (2022)], I had obtained a symmetric and gauge-invariant EMT by using Noether's second theorem instead, with local spacetime translations as the symmetry group. However, the derivation therein was flawed, containing a faulty assumption about the transformation rule for spinor fields. In this work, I revisit the derivation of [Phys. Rev. D 106, 125012 (2022)], both correcting the faulty step and simplifying the derivation for broader accessibility. The end result is an EMT for quantum chromodynamics that is gauge-invariant, but not symmetric.</description>

      <title>Prospects for compact hexaquarks under the limitation imposed by quark confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The limitation of flavor constituents for compact multiquarks is crucial for understanding the strong interaction at the low energy scale. Utilizing the MIT bag model that incorporates perturbative interactions and confinement energy $E_{\rm CON}$, we derive a critical bag radius $R_c=5.61\,$GeV$^{-1}$ from the condition $E_{\rm CON} &lt; 0$ at zero temperature and zero baryon density, which aligns with the string-breaking distance of 1.2--1.4$\,$fm. Applying this framework to 6-, 7-, and 8-quark systems, we find the bag radii $R_0$ to be highly sensitive to relativistic effects from light quarks, leading to the exclusion of most heavy-light flavor configurations (e.g., $n^3\bar{c}^3$, $n^3\bar{n}\bar{c}^2$) due to positive $E_{\rm CON}$ and radii exceeding the critical radius. Color-spin wavefunctions are constructed using Young tableaux to evaluate interaction matrices and OZI-superallowed decays. Broad decay widths in fully heavy systems for OZI-superallowed modes could arise from wavefunction overlaps due to heavy flavor symmetry, suggesting possible narrow widths for $nnb\bar{b}\bar{b}\bar{b}$ and $nnn\bar{b}\bar{b}\bar{b}$ hexaquarks. This phenomenological approach provides insights into the limitations on multiquarks imposed by confinement. It recommends experimental searches at LHCb for these states.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous instabilities in high-density QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QCD at large densities exhibits a moat regime in the scalar-pseudoscalar sector. The resolution of its dynamics is pivotal for the access to the onset of new phases including the potential critical endpoint of QCD. In this work we present the first selfconsistent analysis of this regime with the functional renormalisation group approach to QCD. We map out the moat regime, including a first analysis of potential inhomogeneous instabilities at baryon chemical potential $\mu_B\gtrsim 600$ MeV on the chiral crossover line.</description>

      <title>Overdamped quasibound states inside a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02676</link>

Abstract: Schwarzschild black-hole interiors, bounded by event horizons and terminated by spacelike singularities, are regions where all physical observers are inevitably destroyed. In the geometric optics approximation, waves follow null geodesics to the singularity. However, outside the geometric optics regime, the behavior of wave propagation can be rich and nuanced, even in such extreme habitats. In this work, we show that axial gravitational perturbations in the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole can form overdamped (non-oscillatory) quasibound states that decay before reaching the singularity. Using Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates to avoid coordinate ambiguities, we identify these modes and analyze their eigenfunctions. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that the Regge-Wheeler master function of these modes have non-zero amplitude at the future event horizon but decay before interacting with the singularity. We consider observations of the modes along timelike geodesics. This work suggests that certain gravitational fluctuations can hover transiently within the black-hole interior, challenging common assumptions about wave behavior in uncharted and extreme regions of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Singular $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\alpha$-attractor models naturally appear in supergravity with hyperbolic geometry. The simplest versions of $\alpha$-attractors, T- and E-models, originate from theories with non-singular potentials. In canonical variables, these potentials have a plateau that is approached exponentially fast at large values of the inflaton field $\varphi$. In a closely related class of polynomial $\alpha$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of potentials, which can be singular at the boundary of the moduli space, S-models. These potentials may have a short plateau, after which the potential may grow polynomially or exponentially at large values of the inflaton field. We will show that this class of models may provide a simple solution to the initial conditions problem for $\alpha$-attractors and may account for a very broad range of possible values of $n_{s}$ matching the recent ACT, SPT, and DESI data.</description>
