      <title>Machine learning delta-T noise for temperature bias estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delta-T shot noise is activated in temperature-biased electronic junctions, down to the atomic scale. It is characterized by a quadratic dependence on the temperature difference and a nonlinear relationship with the transmission coefficients of partially opened conduction channels. In this work, we demonstrate that delta-T noise, measured across an ensemble of atomic-scale junctions, can be utilized to estimate the temperature bias in these systems. Our approach employs a supervised machine learning algorithm to train a neural network with input features being the scaled electrical conductance, the delta-T noise, and the mean temperature. Due to limited experimental data, we generate synthetic datasets, designed to mimic experiments. The neural network, trained on these synthetic data, was subsequently applied to predict temperature biases from experimental datasets. Using performance metrics, we demonstrate that the mean bias -- the deviation of predicted temperature differences from their true value -- is less than 1 K for junctions with conductance up to 4$G_0$. Our study highlights that, while a single delta-T noise measurement is insufficient for accurately estimating the applied temperature bias due to noise contributions from other sources, averaging over an ensemble of junctions enables predictions within experimental uncertainties. This demonstrates that machine learning approaches can be utilized for estimation of temperature biases, and similarly other stimuli in electronic junctions.</description>

      <title>Topological magnetism in diluted artificial adatom lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control matter at the atomic scale has revolutionized our understanding of the physical world, opening doors to unprecedented technological advancements. Quantum technology, which harnesses the unique principles of quantum mechanics, enables us to construct and manipulate atomic structures with extraordinary precision.
  Here, we propose a bottom-up approach to create topological magnetic textures in diluted adatom lattices on the Nb(110) surface. By fine-tuning adatom spacing, previously inaccessible magnetic phases can emerge. Our findings reveal that interactions between magnetic adatoms, mediated by the Nb substrate, foster the formation of unique topological spin textures, such as skyrmions and anti-skyrmions, both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic. Since Nb can be superconducting, our findings present a novel platform with valuable insights into the interplay between topological magnetism and superconductivity, paving the way for broader exploration of topological superconductivity in conjunction with spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Universal Moir\'e Buckling of Freestanding 2D Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of membranes, a classic subject, acquires new momentum from two-dimensional (2D) materials multilayers. This work reports the surprising results emerged during a theoretical study of equilibrium geometry of bilayers as freestanding membranes. While ordinary membranes are prone to buckle around compressive impurities, we predict that all 2D material freestanding bilayers universally undergo, even if impurity-free, a spontaneous out-of-plane buckling. The moir\'e network nodes here play the role of internal impurities, the dislocations that join them giving rise to a stress pattern, purely shear in homo-bilayers and mixed compressive/shear in hetero-bilayers. That intrinsic stress is, theory and simulations show, generally capable to cause all freestanding 2D bilayers to undergo distortive bucklings with large amplitudes and a rich predicted phase transition scenario. Realistic simulations predict quantitative parameters expected for these phenomena as expected in hetero-bilayers such as graphene/hBN, $\rm{WS_2/WSe_2}$ hetero-bilayers, and for twisted homo-bilayers such as graphene, hBN, $\rm{MoS_2}$. Buckling then entails a variety of predicted consequences. Mechanically, a critical drop of bending stiffness is expected at all buckling transitions. Thermally, the average buckling corrugation decreases with temperature, with buckling-unbuckling phase transitions expected in some cases, and the buckled state often persisting even above room temperature. Buckling will be suppressed by deposition on hard attractive substrates, and survive in reduced form on soft ones. Frictional, electronic and other associated phenomena are also highlighted. The universality and richness of these predicted phenomena strongly encourages an experimental search, which is possible but still missing.</description>

      <title>Measurements of absolute bandgap deformation-potentials of optically-bright bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides show many exciting features, including long-lived interlayer excitons and wide bandgap tunability using strain. Not many investigations on experimental determinations of deformation potentials relating changes in optoelectronic properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ with the strain are present in the literature. Our experimental study focuses on three widely investigated high-symmetry points, K$_{c}$, K$_{v}$, and Q$_{c}$, where subscript c (v) refers to the conduction (valence) band, in the Brillouin zone of bilayer WSe$_2$. Using local biaxial strains produced by nanoparticle stressors, a theoretical model, and by performing the spatially- and spectrally-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we determine absolute deformation potential of -5.10 $\pm$ 0.24 eV for Q$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ indirect bandgap and -8.50 $\pm$ 0.92 eV for K$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ direct bandgap of bilayer WSe$_2$. We also show that $\approx$0.9% biaxial tensile strain is required to convert an indirect bandgap bilayer WSe$_2$ into a direct bandgap semiconductor. Moreover, we also show that a relatively small amount of localized strain $\approx$0.4% is required to make a bilayer WSe$_2$ as optically bright as an unstrained monolayer WSe$_2$. The bandgap deformation potentials measured here will drive advances in flexible electronics, sensors, and optoelectronic- and quantum photonic- devices through precise strain engineering.</description>

      <title>Bimerons as Edge states in Thin Magnetic Strips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic bimerons are potential information carriers in spintronic devices. Bimerons, topologically equivalent to skyrmions, manifest in chiral magnetic systems with in-plane magnetization due to anisotropies or external magnetic fields. Applications demanding their current-driven motion face significant challenges, notably the bimeron Hall effect, which causes transverse movement and annihilation at nanomagnet borders. This study addresses the problem of stabilizing bimeron propagation under current-driven conditions. We demonstrate that bimerons can propagate through thin ferromagnetic strips without annihilation when the easy-axis anisotropy and the electric current are orthogonal. Our findings indicate that below a threshold value of current, the repulsion between the bimeron and the strip boundary allows for stable soliton propagation, even in bent regions. This phenomenon extends to bimeron chains, which propagate parallel to the current flow. By enabling stable long-distance propagation, our results open new avenues for developing bimeron-based racetrack memory devices, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of future spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Optical activity of chiral excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent activity in the area of chiroptical phenomena has been focused on the connection between structural asymmetry, electron spin configuration and light matter interactions in chiral semiconductors. In these systems, spin-splitting phenomena emerge due to inversion symmetry breaking and the presence of extended electronic states, yet the connection to chiroptical phenomena is lacking. Here, we develop an analytical effective mass model of chiral excitons, parameterized by density functional theory. The model accounts for parity mixing of the band edge Bloch functions resulting from polar distortions, resulting in magnetic dipole allowed transitions. Through the study of a prototypical chiral 2D hybrid perovskite semiconductor, we show that circular dichroism of the chiral exciton and its interband continuum emerges from spin-splitting via cross coupling of Rashba-like and chiral/helical spin-texture components. As a counterpoint, we apply our model to describe chiroptical properties of excitons in perovskite nanocrystals that occur without chiral lattice distortions.</description>

      <title>Realizing the interacting resonant level model using a quantum dot detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interacting resonant level model is the simplest quantum impurity model to display strongly correlated effects in mesoscopic systems, which triggered its extensive theoretical study. However, to date, there have not been any realizations of the model with controllable interaction parameters, and thus the detailed predictions could not be confirmed. Here we use a recently developed approach to Anderson orthogonality catastrophe physics, using a charge detector coupled to a quantum dot system, to devise a simple experimental system that could display IRLM behavior, and detail its predictions. At the same time, the mapping to IRLM allows us to determine the interaction parameter of the charge detector using simple experimental probes.</description>

      <title>Magnetically tuned topological phase in graphene nanoribbon heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and magnetism often triggers the exotic quantum phases. Here, we report an accessible scheme to engineer the robust $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topology by intrinsic magnetism, originating from the zigzag segment connecting two armchair segments with different width, in one-dimensional graphene nanoribbon heterojunctions. Our first-principle and model simulations reveal that the emergent spin polarization substantially modifies the dimerization between junction states, forming the special SSH mechanism depending on the magnetic configurations. Interestingly, the topological phase in magnetic state is only determined by the width of the narrow armchair segment, in sharp contrast with that in the normal state. In addition, the emergent magnetism increases the bulk energy band gap by an order of magnitude than that in the nonmagnetic state. We also discuss the $\mathbb{Z}$ topology of the junction states and the termination-dependent of topological end states. Our results bring new way to tune the topology in graphene nanoribbon heterostructure, providing a new platform for future one-dimensional topological devices and molecular-scale spintronics.</description>

      <title>Transistors based on Novel 2-D Monolayer Semiconductors Bi2O2Se, InSe, and MoSi2N4 for Enhanced Logic Density Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making ultra-short gate-length transistors significantly contributes to scaling the contacted gate pitch. This, in turn, plays a vital role in achieving smaller standard logic cells for enhanced logic density scaling. As we push the boundaries of miniaturization, it is intriguing to consider that the ultimate limit of contacted gate pitch could be reached with remarkable 1 nm gate-length transistors. Here, we identify InSe, Bi2O2Se, and MoSi2N4 as potential two-dimensional semiconductors for 1 nm transistors with low contact resistance and outstanding interface properties. We employ a fully self-consistent ballistic quantum transport model starting from first-principle calculations. Our simulations show that the interplay between electrostatics and quantum tunneling influences the performance of these devices over the device design space. MoSi2N4 channels have the best immunity to quantum tunneling, and Bi2O2Se channel devices have the best electrostatics. We show that for a channel length of 12 nm, all the devices can deliver I_$ON$/I_$OFF$ &gt; 10^3 , suitable for electronic applications, and Bi2O2Se is the best-performing channel material.</description>

      <title>Redefining the dielectric response of nanoconfined liquids: insights from water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments show that the relative dielectric constant $\epsilon$ of water confined to a film of nanometric thickness reaches a strikingly low value of 2.1, barely above the bulk's 1.8 value for the purely electronic response. We argue that $\epsilon$ is not a well-defined measure for dielectric properties at sub-nanometer scales due to the ambiguous definition of confinement width. Instead we propose the 2D polarisability $\alpha_{\perp}$ as the appropriate, well-defined response function whose magnitude can be directly obtained from both measurements and computations. Our molecular-dynamics computations based on density-functional theory and empirical force fields reproduce the previously reported low dielectric response of confined water, and importantly predict a very significant reduction, $\sim 30$\%, of the electronic response as compared with the bulk's, contrary to what is widely assumed, highlighting the importance of electronic degrees of freedom to interpret the dielectric response of polar fluids under nanoconfinement rconditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum microwaves: stabilizing squeezed light by phase locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bright sources of quantum microwave light are an important building block for various quantum technological applications. Josephson junctions coupled to microwave cavities are a particularly versatile and simple source for microwaves with quantum characteristics, such as different types of squeezing. Due to the inherent nonlinearity of the system, a pure dc-voltage bias can lead to the emission of correlated pairs of photons into a stripline resonator. However, a drawback of this method is that it suffers from bias voltage noise, which disturbs the phase of the junction and consequently destroys the coherence of the photons, severely limiting its applications. Here we describe how adding a small ac reference signal either to the dc-bias or directly into the cavity can stabilize the system and counteract the sensitivity to noise. We first consider the injection locking of a single-mode device, before turning to the more technologically relevant locking of two-mode squeezed states, where phase locking preserves the entanglement between photons. Finally, we describe locking by directly injecting a microwave into the cavity, which breaks the symmetry of the squeezing ellipse. In all cases, locking can mitigate the effects of voltage noise, and enable the use of squeezed states in quantum technological applications.</description>

      <title>Coulomb screening of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has been a subject of intense debate. While some experimental evidence indicated an unconventional pairing mechanism, efforts to tune the critical temperature by screening the Coulomb interactions have been unsuccessful, possibly indicating a conventional phonon-mediated pairing. Here we study a double-layer electronic system consisting of two twisted graphene bilayers in immediate proximity of each other but remaining electronically decoupled. By increasing the carrier density in one bilayer, we completely suppressed both the superconductivity and the correlated-insulator state in the adjacent magic-angle graphene. The observation of such a screening effect offers strong support for an unconventional mechanism of Cooper pairing in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, shedding new light on the underlying physics governing their properties.</description>

      <title>Double-edged Role of Interactions in Superconducting Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the unconventional superconducting phases in moire materials, a critical question is the role played by electronic interactions in the formation of Cooper pairs. In twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), the strength of electronic interactions can be reduced by increasing the twist angle or screening provided by the dielectric medium. In this work, we place tBLG at 3-4 nm above bulk SrTiO3 substrates, which have a large yet tunable dielectric constant. By raising the dielectric constant in situ in a magic angle device, we observe suppression of both the height and the width of the entire superconducting dome, thus demonstrating that, unlike conventional superconductors, the pairing mechanism in tBLG is strongly dependent on electronic interactions. Interestingly, in contrast to the absence of superconductivity in devices on SiO2 with angle&gt;1.3 deg, we observe a superconducting pocket in a large-angle (angle=1.4 deg) tBLG/STO device while the correlated insulating states are absent. These experimental results are in qualitative agreement with a theoretical model in which the pairing mechanism arises from Coulomb interactions that are screened by plasmons, electron-hole pairs, and longitudinal acoustic phonons. Our results highlight the unconventional nature of the superconductivity in tBLG, the double-edged role played by electronic interactions in its formation, as well as their complex interplay with the correlated insulating states.</description>

      <title>Anomalous geometric transport signatures of topological Euler class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Riemannian quantum-geometric structures in semiclassical transport features of two-dimensional multigap topological phases. In particular, we study nonlinear Hall-like bulk electric current responses and, accordingly, semiclassical equations of motion induced by the presence of a topological Euler invariant. We provide analytic understanding of these quantities by phrasing them in terms of momentum-space geodesics and geodesic deviation equations and further corroborate these insights with numerical solutions. Within this framework, we moreover uncover anomalous bulk dynamics associated with the second- and third-order nonlinear Hall conductivities induced by a patch Euler invariant. As a main finding, our results show how one can reconstruct the Euler invariant on coupling to electric fields at nonlinear order and from the gradients of the electric fields. Furthermore, we comment on the possibility of deducing the non-trivial non-Abelian Euler class invariant specifically in second-order nonlinear ballistic conductance measurements within a triple-contact setup, which was recently proposed to probe the Euler characteristics of more general Fermi surfaces. Generally, our results provide a route for deducing the topology in real materials that exhibit the Euler invariant by analyzing bulk electrical currents.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent flow in inhomogeneous superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the supercurrent flow pattern is altered by inhomogeneities in superconducting films. Working in the vicinity of the critical temperature and assuming a model of short-range disorder in the quadratic term of the Ginzburg-Landau functional, we develop a perturbation theory in the inhomogeneity strength. Absorbing the ultraviolet divergences into the renormalization of the critical temperature, we arrive at a well-defined theory governed by large-scale physics. In the presence of inhomogeneities, the correlation functions of the order parameter and supercurrent exhibit a long-range power-law behavior, which can be attributed to the mixing of the amplitude and phase modes. The fluctuation magnitude grows with increasing the average current, and the system becomes strongly inhomogeneous near the critical current.</description>

      <title>Friedel oscillations and chiral superconductivity in monolayer NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1965 Kohn and Luttinger proposed a genuine electronic mechanism for superconductivity. Despite the bare electrostatic interaction between two electrons being repulsive, in a metal electron-hole fluctuations can give rise to Friedel oscillations of the screened Coulomb potential. Cooper pairing among the electrons then emerges when taking advantage of the attractive regions. The nature of the leading pairing mechanism in some two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is still debated. Focusing on NbSe$_2$, we show that superconductivity can be induced by the Coulomb interaction when accounting for screening effects on the trigonal lattice with multiple orbitals. Using ab initio-based tight-binding parametrizations for the relevant low-energy d-bands, we evaluate the screened interaction microscopically, in a scheme that includes Bloch overlaps and Umklapp processes. In the direct space, we find long-range Friedel oscillations which alternate in sign. The momentum-resolved gap equations predict two quasi-degenerate nematic solutions near the critical temperature $T_c$, signaling the unconventional nature of the pairing. Their complex linear combination, i.e., a chiral gap with p-like symmetry, provides the ground state of the system. Our prediction of a fully gapped chiral phase well below $T_c$ is in agreement with the spectral function extracted from tunneling spectroscopy measurements of single-layer NbSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical response and spontaneous polarization in layer-stacked gallenene using second harmonic generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00461v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gallenene is a promising low-dimensional material with a structure down to the thickness of a single atom, similar to graphene. However, van der Waals stacking of two-dimensional (2D) gallenene under confinement remain poorly understood. In this study, we present evidence of the formation of parallel-stacked hexagonal gallenene (a100) structures in liquid gallium. The present study demonstrates the AB stacking of 2D gallenene a100 crystals in liquid gallium sandwiched between two graphene layers, as observed through transmission electron microscopy. A nonlinear optical response of the confined hexagonal gallenene was investigated through second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. The SHG signal exhibits periodic peak intensity shifts upon angular rotation up to 90 degrees and intensity dampening at elevated temperatures. These findings offer insights on device applications of 2D gallenene.</description>

      <title>Floquet driven long-range interactions induce super-extensive scaling in quantum battery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving quantum advantage in energy storage and power extraction is a primary objective in the design of quantum-based batteries. We explore how long-range (LR) interactions in conjunction with Floquet driving can improve the performance of quantum batteries, particularly when the battery is initialized in a fully polarized state. In particular, we exhibit that by optimizing the driving frequency, the maximum average power scales super extensively with system-size which is not achievable through next-nearest neighbor interactions or traditional unitary charging, thereby gaining genuine quantum advantage. We illustrate that the inclusion of either two-body or many-body interaction terms in the LR charging Hamiltonian leads to a scaling benefit. Furthermore, we discover that a super-linear scaling in power results from increasing the strength of interaction compared to the transverse magnetic field and the range of interaction with low fall-off rate, highlighting the advantageous role of long-range interactions in optimizing quantum battery charging.</description>

      <title>Vertical Emission of Blue Light from a Symmetry Breaking Plasmonic Nanocavity-Emitter System Supporting Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs), introduced in structured metallic surface cavities, provides a crucial mechanism for designing plasmonic open-resonant cavities with high quality (high-Q) factors, making significant advances in plasmonic nanophotonics. However, the two major bottlenecks for plasmonic nanocavities: enhancing emission and big beam divergence for quantum emitters, due to the strong intrinsic Ohmic losses of metals. Here, we propose and realize a {\sigma}h symmetry-breaking plasmonic honeycomb nanocavities (PHC) that support quasi-BIC resonance modes with high-Q factors. Our anodic oxidation-engineered strategy breaks out-of-plane symmetry while preserving in-plane symmetry, enabling the PHC to exhibit collective plasmonic lattice resonances (PLR) couplings and achieve Q-factors exceeding 106. Experimentally, we couple perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) to the PHC, demonstrating effective tuning of their emission properties and beam quality in the blue spectral region, achieving a 32-fold emission enhancement by suppress Ohmic loss and the life time of quantum emitters, simultaneously realize vertical emission in the 2.556 - 2.638 eV region, with a far-field hexagonal beam shape and a full width at half maximum of 12.6 degree under optimal coupling conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate topological band inversion characterized by Zak phase transitions by continuously tuning the system parameters, confirming that the PHC supports topologically non-trivial q-BIC due to PLR coupling. The PHC presents itself as a promising next-generation, high-brightness nanoscale light source matrix, which can be directly scaled up to cover a wide wavelength range from UV to IR.</description>

      <title>Light-matter interactions in layered materials and heterostructures: from moir\'e physics and magneto-optical effects to ultrafast dynamics and hybrid meta-photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials have revolutionized how we approach light-matter interactions, offering unprecedented optical and electronic properties with the potential for vertical heterostructures and manipulation of spin-valley degrees of freedom. The discovery of moir\'e physics in twisted heterostructures has further unlocked new possibilities for controlling the band structure of tailored semiconductor heterostructures. In parallel, the integration of 2D materials with hybrid photonic structures and ultrafast studies on their optical and spin-valley properties has revealed a wealth of novel physical phenomena. This perspective highlights the recent advances in our understanding of light-matter interactions in moir\'e and 2D systems, with a particular emphasis on ultrafast processes and the integration of these materials into photonic platforms. We explore the implications for optoelectronics and emerging photonic technologies, positioning 2D materials as a transformative tool for next-generation devices.</description>

      <title>Universal Spreading Dynamics in Quasiperiodic Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive type of wave propagation, due to the intricate interplay of non-Hermiticity and disorder. Here, we investigate the spreading dynamics in the archetypal non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model with quasiperiodic disorder. We uncover counter-intuitive transport behaviors: subdiffusion with a spreading exponent $\delta=1/3$ in the localized regime and diffusion with $\delta=1/2$ in the delocalized regime, in stark contrast to their Hermitian counterparts (halted vs. ballistic). We then establish a unified framework from random-variable perspective to determine the universal scaling relations in both regimes for generic disordered non-Hermitian systems. An efficient method is presented to extract the spreading exponents from Lyapunov exponents. The observed subdiffusive or diffusive transport in our model stems from Van Hove singularities at the tail of imaginary density of states, as corroborated by Lyapunov-exponent analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene, renowned for its exceptional electronic and optical properties as a robust 2D material, traditionally lacks electronic correlation effects. Proximity coupling offers a promising method to endow quantum materials with novel properties. In this study, we achieve such a proximity coupling by intercalating Sn between the buffer layer of graphene on SiC(0001), allowing us to explore the coupling between a correlated 2D electron gas and a Dirac metal. This results in the stabilization of Sn-$\sqrt{3}$ superlattice structures at the interface, which reveal Mott-Hubbard bands, in excellent agreement with both experimental observations and theoretical predictions. Additionally, we found signatures of quasiparticle peaks close to the Fermi energy, in detail depending on the hybridization strength and doping level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the transverse charge transport in Josephson junctions based on the tilted Dirac materials with valley-dependent gaps. It is shown that a finite tilt-assisted transverse Josephson Hall current is present under broken time-reversal symmetry. This transverse current is driven by the superconducting phase difference across the junction and exhibits a nonsinusoidal current-phase relation, leading to the transverse Josephson diode effect (TJDE), where the critical currents flowing oppositely along the transverse direction are asymmetric. Compared to the conventional longitudinal Josephson diode effect, the predicted TJDE supports a fully polarized diode efficiency with a $100\%$ quality factor and can completely decouple the input signal path from the output, suggesting potential applications for nonreciprocal superconducting devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that including the second viscosity of an electron gas in the hydrodynamic model allows for highly accurate modeling of the optical response of heavily doped semiconductors. In our setup, which improves resonance visibility compared to previous approaches, plasmon resonances become more distinct, allowing for detailed analysis of the underlying physics. With advanced fitting techniques based on a physics-informed cost function and a tailored optimization algorithm, we obtain close agreement between simulations and experimental data across different sample thicknesses. This enhanced resonance visibility, combined with our integrated approach, shows that key parameters such as doping level and effective electron mass can be retrieved from a single optical measurement. The spatial dispersion taken into account in the hydrodynamic framework is essential for accurately describing the optical response of plasmonic materials in this frequency range and is likely to become a standard modeling approach.</description>

Abstract: Chiral symmetry is broken by typical interactions in lattice models, but the statistical interactions embodied in the anyon-Hubbard model are an exception. It is an example of a correlated hopping model in which chiral symmetry protects a degenerate zero-energy subspace. Complementary to the traditional approach of anyon braiding in real space, we adiabatically evolve the statistical parameter in the anyon-Hubbard model and we find non-trivial Berry phases and holonomies in this chiral subspace. The corresponding states possess stationary checkerboard pattern in their $N$-particle densities which are preserved under adiabatic manipulation. We give an explicit protocol for how these chirally-protected zero energy states can be prepared, observed, validated, and controlled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high electrical conductivity and good chemical stability of MXenes offer hopes for their use in many applications, such as wearable electronics, energy storage, or electromagnetic interference shielding. While their optical, electronic and electrochemical properties have been widely studied, the information on thermal properties of MXenes is scarce. In this study, we investigate the heat transport properties of Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene single flakes using scanning thermal microscopy and find exceptionally low anisotropic thermal conductivities within the Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ flakes, leading to an effective thermal conductivity of 0.78$\pm$0.21 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. This observation is in stark contrast to the predictions of the Wiedemann-Franz law, as the estimated Lorenz number is only 0.25 of the classical value. Due to the combination of low thermal conductivity and low emissivity of Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$, the heat loss from it is two orders of magnitude smaller than that from common metals. Our study explores the heat transport mechanisms of MXenes and highlights a promising approach for developing thermal insulation, two-dimensional thermoelectric, or infrared stealth materials.</description>

      <title>Andreev non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for open Josephson junctions from Green's functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of open Josephson junctions (JJs) through a minimal effective non-Hermitian (NH) approach derived from the equilibrium Green's function (GF) formalism. Specifically, we consider a JJ with a quantum dot barrier coupled to a normal metal reservoir. The coupling introduces an imaginary self-energy term in the JJ Hamiltonian which can be naturally accounted for in the NH formalism. While most approaches to similar problems work with the full junction Hamiltonian we propose a scheme for deriving an effective NH Hamiltonian for the Andreev levels only, that we compute from the singular part of the barrier GF. To establish the range of applicability of this NH model we benchmark our results for both the dot density of states and the supercurrent against exact GF predictions in different transport regimes. We find that, as a rule of thumb, the Andreev NH description is accurate when the spectral overlap between the Andreev bound states (ABS) and the near-gap continuum states is negligible, i.e. when the ABS energies lie sufficiently far from the superconducting gap relative to their line-width. This method not only highlights the effective physics of the JJ but also offers a scalable framework for studying large-size devices.</description>

Abstract: A two-terminal quantum spin-Hall heat engine and refrigerator with embedded Majorana bound states (MBS) is analyzed for optimality in thermoelectric performance using the Landaeur-Buttiker approach. This investigation can be an effective tool to detect MBS. Furthermore, the occurrence of MBS can enhance the performance to rival, as well as outperform, some modern nanoscale quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators. The optimal performance of this MBS quantum heat engine and quantum refrigerator can be further enhanced by an Aharonov-Bohm flux.</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence and Energy Transfer Mediated by Hyperbolic Polaritons</title>

Abstract: Under high electrical current, some materials can emit electromagnetic radiation beyond incandescence. This phenomenon, referred to as electroluminescence, leads to the efficient emission of visible photons and is the basis of domestic lighting devices (e.g., light-emitting diodes). In principle, electroluminescence can lead to mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission of confined light-matter excitations called phonon-polaritons, resulting from the coupling of photons with crystal lattice vibrations (optical phonons). In particular, phonon-polaritons arising in the van der Waals crystal hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) exhibit hyperbolic dispersion, which enhances light-matter coupling. For this reason, electroluminescence of hyperbolic phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) has been proposed as an explanation for the peculiar radiative energy transfer within hBN-encapsulated graphene transistors. However, since HPhPs are confined, they are inaccessible in the far-field, so that any hint of electroluminescence is only based on indirect electronic signatures and needs to be confirmed by direct observation. Here, we demonstrate far-field mid-IR ({\lambda} = 6.5 {\mu}m) electroluminescence of HPhPs excited by strongly biased high-mobility graphene within a van der Waals heterostructure, and we quantify the associated radiative energy transfer through the material. The presence of HPhPs is revealed via far-field mid-IR spectroscopy due to their elastic scattering at discontinuities in the heterostructure. The associated radiative flux is quantified by mid-IR pyrometry of the substrate receiving the energy. This radiative energy transfer is shown to be reduced in hBN with nanoscale inhomogeneities, demonstrating the central role of the electromagnetic environment in this process.</description>

Abstract: Developing new material platforms for use in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures is desirable due to limitations caused by intrinsic microwave losses present in commonly used III/V material systems. With the recent reports on tantalum superconducting qubits that show improvements over the Nb and Al counterparts, exploring Ta as an alternative superconductor in hybrid material systems is promising. Here, we study the growth of Ta on semiconducting Ge (001) substrates grown via molecular beam epitaxy. We show that at a growth temperature of 400$^{\circ}$C the Ta diffuses into the Ge matrix in a self-limiting nature resulting in smooth and abrupt surfaces and interfaces with roughness on the order of 3-7 \r{A} as measured by atomic force microscopy and x-ray reflectivity. The films are found to be a mixture of Ta$_{5}$Ge$_{3}$ and TaGe$_{2}$ binary alloys and form a native oxide that seems to form a sharp interface with the underlying film. These films are superconducting with a $T_{C}\sim 1.8-2$K and $H_{C}^{\perp} \sim 1.88T$, $H_{C}^{\parallel} \sim 5.1T$. These results show this tantalum germanide film to be promising for future superconducting quantum information platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform simulations for transport and nontrivial fusion of Majorana zero modes in topological superconducting quantum wires. We uncover interesting behaviors of nonadiabatic transition associated with the transport through mini-gate-controlled multiple-segments modulations. Owing to breaking of the initial fermion parity induced by nonadiabatic transitions, a deviation from the statistics of outcomes of nontrivial fusion arises and is analyzed. Moreover, we develop a measurement scheme to infer the amount of fermion parity breaking and nonadiabatic transition probability to excited states, based on the characteristic spectrum of measurement current by a quantum-point-contact detector, by measurement of the charge occupation dynamics in a fusion-outcome-probing quantum dot.</description>

Abstract: The miniaturization of integrated circuits is facing an obstruction due to the escalating electrical resistivity of conventional copper interconnects. The underlying reason for this problem was unveiled by Fuchs and Sondheimer, who showed that thinner wires are more resistive because current-carrying electrons encounter the rough surfaces of the wire more frequently therein. Here, we present a generalization of the Fuchs-Sondheimer theory to Dirac and Weyl materials, which are candidates for next-generation interconnects. We predict a nonlinear longitudinal electric current originating from the combined action of the Berry curvature and non-specular surface-scattering.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments (Subero et. al. Nature Comm. $\bf{14}$, 7924 (2023)) we analyze photonic heat transport through a Josephson junction in a dissipative environment. For this purpose we derive general expressions for the heat current in terms of non-equilibrium Green functions for the junction coupled in series or in parallel with two environmental impedances at different temperatures. We show that even on the insulating side of the Schmid transition the heat current is sensitive to the Josephson coupling exhibiting an opposite behavior for the series and parallel connection and in qualitative agreement with experiments. We also predict that this device should exhibit heat rectification properties and provide simple expressions to account for them in terms of the system parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Valley Hall effect without Berry curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE) is characterized by the valley Chern number (VCN) in a way that one-dimensional (1D) chiral metallic states are guaranteed to appear at the domain walls (DW) between two domains with opposite VCN for a given valley. Although in the case of QVHE, the total BC of the system is zero, the BC distributed locally around each valley makes the VCN well-defined as long as inter-valley scattering is negligible. Here, we propose a new type of valley-dependent topological phenomenon that occurs when the BC is strictly zero at each momentum. Such zero Berry curvature (ZBC) QVHE is characterized by the valley Euler number (VEN) which is computed by integrating the Euler curvature around a given valley in two-dimensional (2D) systems with space-time inversion symmetry. 1D helical metallic states can be topologically protected at the DW between two domains with the opposite VENs when the DW configuration preserves either the mirror symmetry with respect to the DW or the combination of the DW space-time inversion, and chiral symmetries. We establish the fundamental origin of ZBC-QVHE. Also, by combining tight-binding model study and first-principles calculations, we propose stacked hexagonal bilayer lattices including h-BX (X=As, P) and large-angle twisted bilayer graphenes as candidate systems with robust helical DW states protected by VEN.</description>

      <title>Momentum-space theory for topological magnons in 2D ferromagnetic skyrmion lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnon dynamics in skyrmion lattices have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in topological magnonics. Existing theories often follow a single-momentum approach, assuming significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) to minimize the skyrmion's dimensions, which can lead to oversimplification in describing magnon behavior. This study introduces a multi-momentum operator theory for magnons in large 2D skyrmions, where each skyrmion encompasses several thousand spins. The proposed theory fully transforms the magnon Hamiltonian into momentum space, incorporating off-diagonal terms to capture umklapp scattering caused by the skyrmion wave vectors. Our results reveal deviations from single-momentum theories, demonstrating that flat bands are not universal features of the skyrmionic magnon spectrum. Additionally, we find that manipulating the skyrmion size with an external magnetic field induces multiple topological phase transitions. At high magnetic fields, the low-energy magnon spectrum becomes densely packed and entirely topological, resembling a topological band continuum.</description>

Abstract: Planar germanium quantum wells have recently been shown to host hard-gapped superconductivity. Additionally, quantum dot spin qubits in germanium are well-suited for quantum information processing, with isotopic purification to a nuclear spin-free material expected to yield long coherence times. Therefore, as one of the few group IV materials with the potential to host superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, proximitized quantum dots in germanium is a compelling platform to achieve and combine topological superconductivity with existing and novel qubit modalities. Here we demonstrate a quantum dot (QD) in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure proximitized by a platinum germanosilicide (PtGeSi) superconducting lead (SC), forming a SC-QD-SC junction. We show tunability of the QD-SC coupling strength, as well as gate control of the ratio of charging energy and the induced gap. We further exploit this tunability by exhibiting control of the ground state of the system between even and odd parity. Furthermore, we characterize the critical magnetic field strengths, finding a critical out-of-plane field of 0.90(4). Finally we explore sub-gap spin splitting in the device, observing rich physics in the resulting spectra, that we model using a zero-bandwidth model in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov limit. The demonstration of controllable proximitization at the nanoscale of a germanium quantum dot opens up the physics of novel spin and superconducting qubits, and Josephson junction arrays in a group IV material.</description>

Abstract: We propose that a high-quality flat interface or boundary may act as a long-range skew scatterer for charged quasiparticles in a metal. In the presence of electric current parallel to the interface the number of clockwise and anti-clockwise reflections from the interface are no longer compensated. This results in a net orbital magnetization that can be observed by magneto-electric Kerr effect in a vicinity of the mean free path from the edge. The value of effective magnetization is given by the product of charge current density and the electron mean free path. Unlike orbital Hall or orbital Edelstein effects the proposed phenomenon does not require inversion symmetry breaking in the bulk of the sample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our study delves into the modifications observed in Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation when its generating charged particle moves parallel to an interface formed by two generic magnetoelectric media, focusing on topological insulators. We compute the electromagnetic field through the Green's function. Applying the far-field approximation and the steepest descent method, we derive analytical expressions for the electric field, revealing contributions from spherical and lateral waves with topological origins. Subsequently, we analyze the angular distribution of the radiation, particularly focusing on parallel motions in close proximity to the interface. Our findings indicate that the radiation along the Vavilov-Cherenkov cone is inhomogeneous and asymmetric. We analyze the radiated energy at both sides of the interface. Finally, we discuss the particle's retarding force, which is notably enhanced in the ultrarelativistic regime. We illustrate these results for the topological insulator TlBiSe$_2$ and the magnetoelectric TbPO$_4$.</description>

Abstract: Atomically thin materials offer multiple opportunities for layer-by-layer control of their electronic properties. While monolayer graphene (MLG) is a zero-gap system, Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) acquires a finite band gap when the symmetry between the layers' potential energy is broken, usually, via a displacement electric field applied in double-gate devices. Here, we introduce a twistronic stack comprising both MLG and BLG, synthesized via chemical vapor deposition, showing a Bernal gap in the absence of external fields. Although a large ($\sim30^{\circ}$) twist angle decouples the MLG and BLG electronic bands near Fermi level, proximity-induced energy shifts in the outermost layers result in a built-in asymmetry, which requires a displacement field of $0.14$ V/nm to be compensated. The latter corresponds to a $\sim10$ meV intrinsic BLG gap, a value confirmed by our thermal-activation measurements. The present results highlight the role of structural asymmetry and encapsulating environment, expanding the engineering toolbox for monolithically-grown graphene multilayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical phonon engineering through nonlinear effects has been utilized in ultrafast control of material properties. However, nonlinear optical phonons typically exhibit rapid decay due to strong mode-mode couplings, limiting their effectiveness in temperature or frequency sensitive applications. In this study, we report the observation of long-lived nonlinear optical phonons through the spontaneous formation of phonon frequency combs in the van der Waals material CrXTe$_3$ (X=Ge, Si) using high-resolution Raman scattering. Unlike conventional optical phonons, the highest $A_g$ mode in CrGeTe$_3$ splits into equidistant, sharp peaks forming a frequency comb that persists for hundreds of oscillations and survives up to 100K before decaying. These modes correspond to localized oscillations of Ge$_2$Te$_6$ clusters, isolated from Cr hexagons, behaving as independent quantum oscillators. Introducing a cubic nonlinear term to the harmonic oscillator model, we simulate the phonon time evolution and successfully replicate the observed comb structure. Similar frequency comb behavior is observed in CrSiTe$_3$, demonstrating the generalizability of this phenomenon. Our findings reveal that Raman scattering effectively probes high-frequency nonlinear phonon modes, providing new insight into generating long-lived, tunable phonon frequency combs with applications in ultrafast material control and phonon-based technologies.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the magnetization is equal to the edge current in the thermodynamic limit for a large class of models of lattice fermions with finite-range interactions satisfying local indistinguishability of the Gibbs state, a condition known to hold for sufficiently high temperatures. Our result implies that edge currents in such systems are determined by bulk properties and are therefore stable against large perturbations near the boundaries. Moreover, the equality persists also after taking the derivative with respect to the chemical potential. We show that this form of bulk-edge correspondence is essentially a consequence of homogeneity in the bulk and locality of the Gibbs state. An important intermediate result is a new version of Bloch's theorem for two-dimensional systems, stating that persistent currents vanish in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Pymablock: an algorithm and a package for quasi-degenerate perturbation theory</title>

Abstract: A common technique in the study of complex quantum-mechanical systems is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian by using quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. While the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation achieves this and constructs an effective Hamiltonian, its scaling is suboptimal, it is limited to two subspaces, and implementing it efficiently is both challenging and error-prone. We introduce an algorithm for constructing an equivalent effective Hamiltonian as well as a Python package, Pymablock, that implements it. Our algorithm combines an optimal asymptotic scaling and the ability to handle any number of subspaces with a range of other improvements. The package supports numerical and analytical calculations of any order and it is designed to be interoperable with any other packages for specifying the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate how the package handles constructing a k.p model, analyses a superconducting qubit, and computes the low-energy spectrum of a large tight-binding model. We also compare its performance with reference calculations and demonstrate its efficiency.</description>

      <title>How pure can we go with adiabatic state manipulation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative systems with decoherence free subspaces, a.k.a. dark spaces (DSs), can be used to protect quantum information. At the same time, dissipation is expected to give rise to coherent information degradation outside the DS. Employed to support quantum information platforms, DSs can be adiabatically modified in a way that resembles adiabatic control of coherent systems. Here we study the slow evolution of a purely dissipative system with a spectral gap $\gamma$, characterized by a strong symmetry, under a cyclic protocol with period $T$. Non-adiabatic corrections to the state evolution give rise to decoherence: the evolution within the instantaneous DS is described by a time-local effective Liouvillian operator that leads to purity degradation over a period, of order $1/\gamma T$. We obtain a closed form of the latter to order $1/(\gamma T)^2$. Our analysis underlines speed limitations in quantum information processing in the absence of corrective measures.</description>

      <title>Anomalous radiation reaction in a circularly polarized field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07664v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum corrections to electron dynamics in a circularly polarized electromagnetic field are found within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems. It is demonstrated that emission of photons by an electron rotating under the field leads to the quantum recoil force acting on the electron perpendicularly to the velocity of its forward movement, which differs crucially from the known classical recoil force directed oppositely to the velocity. Physically, such an anomalous radiation reaction arises from the one-loop QED correction to the photon emission and has no analogue within the classical electrodynamics. Possible manifestations of this phenomenon are discussed for electrons in strong laser fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitter interacting with a dispersive dielectric object: a model based on the modified Langevin noise formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we model the interaction of a quantum emitter with a finite-size dispersive dielectric object in an unbounded space within the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics, using the modified Langevin noise formalism, without any restrictions on the emitter level structure or dipole operator. The quantized electromagnetic field consists of two contributions: the medium-assisted field, which accounts for the electromagnetic field generated by the noise polarization currents of the dielectric, and the scattering-assisted field, which takes into account the electromagnetic field incoming from infinity and scattered by the dielectric. We show that the emitter couples to two distinct bosonic baths: a medium-assisted bath and a scattering-assisted bath, each characterized by its own spectral density. We identify the conditions under which the electromagnetic environment composed of these two baths can be effectively replaced by a single bosonic bath, so that the reduced dynamics of the quantum emitter remain unchanged. In particular, when the initial states of the medium- and scattering-assisted baths are thermal states with the same temperature, we find that a single bosonic bath with a spectral density equal to the sum of the medium-assisted and scattering-assisted spectral densities is equivalent to the original electromagnetic environment.</description>

      <title>Phosphorus Nanotubes from Chemical Cleavage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17531</link>

Abstract: We propose a strategy to make phosphorus nanotubes from two well-known phosphorus allotropes: violet phosphorus and fibrous red phosphorus. First-principles calculations show that doping with sulfur dissociates the covalent bonds between tubular phosphorus structures that form bilayers in these allotropes, resulting in free-standing 1D nanotubes. Due to the substitutional nature of the sulfur dopant, the resulting 1D structure is linear, unlike the helical ring structure studied previously. The sulfur sites are situated periodically along the 1D nanotubes and can be further functionalized. Our results show that the S-doped phosphorus nanotube can sustain a tensile strain of up to 18%. The strain also substantially modifies the electronic band gap and the effective mass of carriers. Calculations using the many-body Green's functions (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approaches reveal a large exciton binding energy of 1.57 eV. The one-dimensional nature, linearity, functionalizability, mechanical flexibility, tunability of electronic properties, and large exciton binding energy make this material interesting for applications in optoelectronic devices, solar cells, chemical sensors, and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Generating non-Clifford gate operations through exact mapping between Majorana fermions and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana fermions and their generalizations to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ parafermions are considered promising building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers for their ability to encode quantum information nonlocally. In such topological quantum computers, highly robust quantum gates are obtained by braiding pairs of these quasi-particles. However, it is well-known that braiding Majorana fermions or parafermions only leads to a Clifford gate, hindering quantum universality. This paper establishes an exact mapping between Majorana fermions to $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions in systems under total parity non-conserving and total parity conserving setting. It is revealed that braiding of Majorana fermions may lead to non-Clifford quantum gates in the 4-dimensional qudit representation spanned by $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions, whilst braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions may similarly yield non-Clifford quantum gates in the qubit representation spanned by Majorana fermions. This finding suggests that topologically protected universal quantum computing may be possible with Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) by supplementing the usual braiding operations with the braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions (Majorana fermions) that could be formed out of Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) via the mapping prescribed here. Finally, the paper discusses how braiding of Majorana fermions or $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions could be obtained via a series of parity measurements.</description>
