      <title>Competition between transient oscillations and early stochasticity in exponentially growing populations</title>

Abstract: It has been recently shown that the exponential growth rate of a population of bacterial cells starting from a single cell shows transient oscillations due to early synchronized bursts of division. These oscillations are enhanced by cell size regulation and contain information about single-cell growth statistics. Here, we report a phase transition in these oscillations as a function of growth rate variability. Below the transition point, these oscillations become asymptotically deterministic and can be measured experimentally, while above the transition point, the stochasticity in population growth dominates the oscillations and masks all the information about single cell growth statistics. The analytically calculated transition point, which roughly corresponds to $13\%$ variability in single-cell growth rate, falls within physiologically relevant parameters. Additionally, we show that the oscillations can stochastically emerge even when the initial state contains multiple cells with out-of-phase division cycles. We show that the amplitude and the phase of these oscillations are stochastic and would vary across repeated measurements with the same initial conditions. We provide analytic expressions as well as numerical estimates for the typical oscillation amplitude and the number of generations before the amplitude falls below a given measurement threshold for E. coli in multiple growth conditions.</description>
