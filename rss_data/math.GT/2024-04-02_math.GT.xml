      <title>Quandle Action Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quandle Coloring Quivers are directed graph-valued invariants of classical and virtual knots and links associated to finite quandles. Quandle action quivers are subquivers of the full quandle coloring quiver associated to quandle actions by elements of the coloring quandle. These quivers provide a categorification of the quandle counting invariant associated to each element of the quandle. We obtain new polynomial invariants called quandle action polynomials from these quivers as decategorifications.</description>

      <title>The extremal length systole of the cube punctured at its vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the extremal length systole of the cube punctured at its vertices is realized by the 12 curves surrounding its edges and give a characterization of the corresponding quadratic differentials, allowing us to estimate its value to high precision. The proof uses a mixture of exact calculations done using branched covers and elliptic integrals, together with estimates obtained using either the geometry of geodesic trajectories on the cube or explicit conformal maps.</description>

      <title>Non-ergodicity on the SU(2)-character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the dynamics of a group $\Gamma$ generated by Dehn twists along two filling multi-curves or a family of filling curves on the SU(2)-representation variety of closed surfaces. Consequently, we provide explicit $\Gamma$-invariant rational functions on the representation variety of the genus two closed surface $S_2$ for some pair of multi-curves. We establish a similar result for the SU(2)-character variety of genus four non-orientable surfaces $N_4$ for some family of filling curves.</description>

      <title>Non-triviality of welded knots and ribbon torus-knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study welded knots and their invariants. We focus on generating examples of non-trivial knotted ribbon tori as the tube of welded knots that are obtained from classical knot diagrams by welding some of the crossings. Non-triviality is shown by determining the fundamental group of the concerned welded knot. Sample examples under consideration are the standard diagrams of the family of $(2,q)$ torus knots and the twist knots. Standard diagrams of knots from Rolfsen's tables with $6$ crossings are also discussed which are not in the family of torus and twist knots.</description>

      <title>Is the geography of Heegaard Floer homology restricted or the $L$-space conjecture false?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent note F. Lin showed that if a rational homology sphere $Y$ admits a taut foliation then the Heegaard Floer module $HF^-(Y)$ contains a copy of $\mathbf{F}[U]/U$ as a summand (arXiv:2309.01222). This implies that either the $L$-space conjecture is false or that Heegaard Floer homology satisfies a geography restriction. We verify that Lin's geography restriction holds for a wide class of rational homology spheres. Indeed, we show that the Heegaard Floer module $HF^-(Y)$ may satisfy a stronger geography restriction.</description>

      <title>On aspherical symplectic fillings with finite capacities of the prequantization bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A prequantization bundle is a negative circle bundle over a symplectic surface together with a contact form induced by a S1-invariant connection. Given a symplectically aspherical symplectic filling of a prequantization bundle satisfying certain topological conditions, suppose that a version of symplectic capacity of the symplectic filling is finite. Then, we show that the symplectic filling is diffeomorphic to the associated disk bundle.</description>

      <title>Random meander model for links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.03451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest a new random model for links based on meander diagrams and graphs. We then prove that trivial links appear with vanishing probability in this model, no link $L$ is obtained with probability 1, and there is a lower bound for the number of non-isotopic knots obtained for a fixed number of crossings. A random meander diagram is obtained through matching pairs of parentheses, a well-studied problem in combinatorics. Hence tools from combinatorics can be used to investigate properties of random links in this model, and, moreover, of the respective 3-manifolds that are link complements in 3-sphere. We use this for exploring geometric properties of a link complement. Specifically, we give expected twist number of a link diagram and use it to bound expected hyperbolic and simplicial volume of random links. The tools from combinatorics that we use include Catalan and Narayana numbers, and Zeilberger's algorithm.</description>

      <title>1-loop equals torsion for fibered 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In earlier work of two of the authors, two 1-loop polynomial invariants of cusped 3-manifolds were constructed using combinatorial data of ideal triangulations, and conjectured to be equal to the $\mathbb{C}^2$ and the $\mathbb{C}^3$-torsion polynomials. Here, we prove this conjecture for all fibered 3-manifolds with toroidal boundary, and we illustrate our theorems with exact computations of the 1-loop and the torsion polynomials. As further evidence for the conjecture, we confirm it for more than 6,600 nonfibered manifolds, and use this data to explore the extent to which the $\mathbb{C}^2$-torsion determines the Thurston norm.</description>

      <title>Exotic Dehn twists on 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of exotic Dehn twists along 3-manifolds $\neq S^3$ inside $4$-manifolds, which produces the first known examples of exotic diffeomorphisms of contractible 4-manifolds, more generally of definite 4-manifolds, and exotic diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds with $\neq S^3$ boundary that survive after one stabilization. We also construct the smallest closed 4-manifold known to support an exotic diffeomorphism. These exotic diffeomorphisms are the Dehn twists along certain Seifert fibered 3-manifolds. As a consequence, we get loops of diffeomorphisms of 3-manifolds that topologically extend to some 4-manifolds $X$ but not smoothly so, implying the non-surjectivity of $\pi_1(\mathrm{Diff}(X)) \to \pi_1(\mathrm{Homeo}(X))$. Our method uses $2$-parameter families Seiberg-Witten theory over $\mathbb{RP}^2$, while known methods to detect exotic diffeomorphisms used $1$-parameter families gauge-theoretic invariants. Using a similar strategy, we construct a new kind of exotic diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds, given as commutators of diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Invariants of virtual links and twisted links using affine indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The affine index polynomial and the $n$-writhe are invariants of virtual knots which are introduced by Kauffman and by Satoh and Taniguchi independently. They are defined by using indices assigned to each classical crossing, which we call affine indices in this paper. We discuss a relationship between the invariants and generalize them to invariants of virtual links. The invariants for virtual links can be also computed by using cut systems. We also introduce invariants of twisted links by using affine indices.</description>

      <title>Twisted Knots and the Perturbed Alexander Invariant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perturbed Alexander invariant $\rho_1$, defined by Bar-Natan and van der Veen, is a powerful, easily computable polynomial knot invariant with deep connections to the Alexander and colored Jones polynomials. We study the behavior of $\rho_1$ for families of knots $\{K_t\}$ given by performing $t$ full twists on a set of coherently oriented strands in a knot $K_0 \subset S^3$. We prove that as $t \to \infty$ the coefficients of $\rho_1$ grow asymptotically linearly, and we show how to compute this growth rate for any such family. As an application we give the first theorem on the ability of $\rho_1$ to distinguish knots in infinite families. Our methods also yield a new proof that the Alexander polynomial stabilizes under such twisting and we show how to compute the limit of Alexander polynomials, strengthening a recent result of Chen. Finally, we conjecture that $\rho_1$ obstructs knot positivity via a "perturbed Conway invariant."</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the moduli space of framed quadratic differentials with prescribed singularities parameterized by a decorated marked surface with punctures (DMSp), where simple zeros, double poles and higher order poles respectively correspond to decorations, punctures and boundary components. We show that the fundamental group of this space equals the kernel of the Abel-Jacobi map from the surface mapping class group of DMSp to the first homology group of the marked surface (without decorations/punctures). Moreover, a universal cover of this space is given by the space of stability conditions on the associated 3-Calabi-Yau category. Furthermore, when we partial compactify and orbifold this moduli space by allowing the collision of simple zeros and some of the double poles, the resulting moduli space is isomorphic to a quotient of the space of stability conditions on the deformed (with respect to those collidable double poles) 3-Calabi-Yau category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.11026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a new family of spectral invariants associated to certain Lagrangian links in compact and connected surfaces of any genus. We show that our invariants recover the Calabi invariant of Hamiltonians in their limit. As applications, we resolve several open questions from topological surface dynamics and continuous symplectic topology: we show that the group of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms of any compact surface with (possibly empty) boundary is not simple; we extend the Calabi homomorphism to the group of Hameomorphisms constructed by Oh-M\"uller; and, we construct an infinite dimensional family of quasimorphisms on the group of area and orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the two-sphere. Our invariants are inspired by recent work of Polterovich and Shelukhin defining and applying spectral invariants for certain classes of links in the two-sphere.</description>

      <title>634 vertex-transitive and more than $10^{103}$ non-vertex-transitive 27-vertex triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1987 Brehm and K\"uhnel showed that any combinatorial $d$-manifold with less than $3d/2+3$ vertices is PL homeomorphic to the sphere and any combinatorial $d$-manifold with exactly $3d/2+3$ vertices is PL homeomorphic to either the sphere or a manifold like a projective plane in the sense of Eells and Kuiper. The latter possibility may occur for $d\in\{2,4,8,16\}$ only. There exist a unique $6$-vertex triangulation of $\mathbb{RP}^2$, a unique $9$-vertex triangulation of $\mathbb{CP}^2$, and at least three $15$-vertex triangulations of $\mathbb{HP}^2$. However, until now, the question of whether there exists a $27$-vertex triangulation of a manifold like the octonionic projective plane has remained open. We solve this problem by constructing a lot of examples of such triangulations. Namely, we construct $634$ vertex-transitive $27$-vertex combinatorial $16$-manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. Four of them have symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_3^3\rtimes \mathrm{C}_{13}$ of order $351$, and the other $630$ have symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_3^3$ of order $27$. Further, we construct more than $10^{103}$ non-vertex-transitive $27$-vertex combinatorial $16$-manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. Most of them have trivial symmetry group, but there are also symmetry groups $\mathrm{C}_3$, $\mathrm{C}_3^2$, and $\mathrm{C}_{13}$. We conjecture that all the triangulations constructed are PL homeomorphic to the octonionic projective plane $\mathbb{OP}^2$. Nevertheless, we have no proof of this fact so far.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05323v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an analogue of the Arnold surface for odd degree flexible curves, and we use it to double branch cover $Q$-flexible embeddings, where $Q$-flexible is a condition to be added to the classical notion of a flexible curve. This allows us to obtain a Viro--Zvonilov-type inequality: an upper bound on the number of non-empty ovals of a curve of odd degree. We investigate our method for flexible curves in a quadric to derive a similar bound in two cases. We also digress around a possible definition of non-orientable flexible curves, for which our method still works and a similar inequality holds.</description>

      <title>On possible symmetry groups of 27-vertex triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1987 Brehm and K\"uhnel showed that any triangulation of a $d$-manifold (without boundary) that is not homeomorphic to the sphere has at least $3d/2+3$ vertices. Moreover, triangulations with exactly $3d/2+3$ vertices may exist only for `manifolds like projective planes', which can have dimensions $2$, $4$, $8$, and $16$ only. There is a $6$-vertex triangulation of the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, a $9$-vertex triangulation of the complex projective plane $\mathbb{CP}^2$, and $15$-vertex triangulations of the quaternionic projective plane $\mathbb{HP}^2$. Recently, the author has constructed first examples of $27$-vertex triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane $\mathbb{OP}^2$. The four most symmetrical have symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_3^3\rtimes \mathrm{C}_{13}$ of order $351$. These triangulations were constructed using a computer program after the symmetry group was guessed. However, it remained unclear why exactly this group is realized as the symmetry group and whether $27$-vertex triangulations of manifolds like $\mathbb{OP}^2$ exist with other (possibly larger) symmetry groups. In this paper we find strong restrictions on symmetry groups of such $27$-vertex triangulations. Namely, we present a list of $26$ subgroups of $\mathrm{S}_{27}$ containing all possible symmetry groups of $27$-vertex triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. (We do not know whether all these subgroups can be realized as symmetry groups.) The group $\mathrm{C}_3^3\rtimes \mathrm{C}_{13}$ is the largest group in this list, and the orders of all other groups do not exceed $52$. A key role in our approach is played by the use of Smith and Bredon's results on the topology of fixed point sets of finite transformation groups.</description>

      <title>Positive scalar curvature metrics and aspherical summands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove for $n\in\{3,4,5\}$ that the connected sum of a closed aspherical $n$-manifold with an arbitrary non-compact manifold does not admit a complete metric with nonnegative scalar curvature. In particular, a special case of our result answers a question of Gromov.
  More generally, we generalize the partial classification result of Chodosh, Li, and Liokumovich to the non-compact domination case with our newly-developed technique.
  Our result unifies all previous results of this type, and confirms the validity of Gromov's non-compact domination conjecture for closed aspherical manifolds of dimensions 3, 4, and 5.</description>

Abstract: Morse functions with exactly two singular points on homotopy spheres and canonical projections of spheres are generalized as special generic maps. A special generic map is, roughly, a smooth map represented as the composition of a smooth surjection onto a manifold whose preimages are diffeomorphic to a unit sphere in the interior of the manifold and single point sets on the boundary with a smooth immersion of codimension $0$.
  This paper constructs real algebraic maps topologically special generic maps whose images are smoothly embedded manifolds.
  We are also interested in construction of explicit and meaningful smooth maps in differential topology and recently ones in real algebraic geometry. This has been an important and difficult problem.
  In such stories, we have previously constructed real algebraic maps topologically regarded as special generic maps. This paper is a kind of additional short remark on such maps.</description>
