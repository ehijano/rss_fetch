      <title>More room at the top: how small buoys aim at the detailed dynamics of the air-sea interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air-sea exchange processes have been identified as essential for both short- and long-term atmospheric and ocean forecasts. The two phases of the fluid layer covering our planet interact across a vast range of scales that we need to explore to achieve a better understanding of the exchange processes. While satellites provide a distributed large-scale view of the sea surface situation, highly detailed measurements, e.g., from oceanographic towers, are necessarily local. The required intermediate solution (i.e., data that are both accurate and distributed) can be provided by swarms of miniature surface buoys. As size, weight, and cost are reduced, these can be deployed in large numbers to investigate specific processes that are at present only crudely parameterized in our models as a result of scarcity of good measurements. Perhaps the most crucial process is white-capping in stormy conditions, where air-sea exchanges are enhanced by one or two orders of magnitude. Other applications include wave-current interactions, wave-ice interactions, and plunging breakers in the coastal zone.
  Following a dedicated workshop, we summarize here the main findings and possibilities derived from the different approaches, and summarize the state of the art for a selection of miniature buoys. We list the solutions presented at the workshop, as well as other similar buoys, with their main characteristics and range of application. We describe the various possibilities of practical use and the scientific and engineering problems to be solved. Looking to the future, we also point out where the present technological improvements are leading to.</description>

      <title>Melancholia States of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a much studied component of the climate system, because its suspected multistability is associated with tipping behaviour yielding potentially large regional and global climatic impacts. In this paper we investigate the global stability properties of the system using an ocean general circulation model. We construct an unstable AMOC state, i.e., an unstable solution of the flow that resides between the stable regimes of a vigorous and collapsed AMOC. Such a solution, also known as a Melancholia or edge state, is a dynamical saddle embedded in the boundary separating the competing basins of attraction. It is physically relevant since it lies on the most probable path of a noise-induced transition between the two stable regimes, and because tipping occurs when one of the attractors and the Melancholia state collide. Its properties may thus give hints towards physical mechanisms and predictability of the critical transition. We find that while the AMOC Melancholia state as viewed from its upper ocean properties lies between the vigorous and collapsed regimes, it is characterized by an Atlantic deep ocean that is fresher and colder compared to both stable regimes. The Melancholia state has higher dynamic enthalpy than either stable state, representing a state of higher potential energy that is in good agreement with the dynamical landscape view on metastability.</description>
