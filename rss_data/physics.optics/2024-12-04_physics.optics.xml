      <title>Synthetic non-Abelian Electric Fields and Spin-Orbit Coupling in Photonic Synthetic Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a scheme to synthesize photonic non-Abelian electric field and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the synthetic frequency dimension based on a polarization-multiplexed time-modulated ring resonator. Inside the ring resonator, the cascade of polarization-dependent phase modulation, polarization rotation, and phase retardation enables a photonic realization of minimal SOC composed of equal Rashba and Dresselhaus terms. The synthetic bands and associated spin textures can be effectively probed by the continuous-wave polarization- and time-resolved band structure measurements. Meanwhile, the pulse dynamics in the frequency dimension can be manipulated by both synthetic Abelian and non-Abelian electric fields, leading to Bloch oscillation, Zitterbewegung, and their interplay dynamics. Our proposed setup can be realized with free-space optics, fibers, and integrated photonics, and provides pseudospin control knobs for large-scale synthetic lattices based on frequency combs.</description>

      <title>Broadband THz emission of long pulses from photomixing process with optical chirped pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) generation via photomixing on photoconductive antenna using twin delayed chirped pulses provides a long THz pulse with a narrow bandwidth. To generate a long pulse with broad bandwidth, we propose a new method that combines two long optical pulses with opposite chirps. The pulses exhibit temporal distributions of their instantaneous frequencies with opposite slopes. As a result, interaction between the beat frequency evolving over time and a photoconductor produces a broad THz spectrum with temporal variations. In our experimental setup, we generate a 12 ps-long pulse with a 1 THz bandwidth spectrum, featuring a frequency ramp of 90 GHz/ps, resembling a chirped THz pulse. This approach signifies a major advancement toward integrating photomixer technology, particularly in THz ranging applications.</description>

      <title>Time-periodic (Floquet) systems in classical wave physics and engineering: Opinion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of classical waves in time-periodic systems is experiencing a resurgence of interest, motivated by their rich physics and the new engineering opportunities they enable, with several analogies to parallel efforts in other branches of physics, e.g., Floquet-engineered quantum materials and time crystals. Here, we first briefly review some of the most prominent features enabled by time-periodic modulations, and we then focus on two specific areas, namely, time-varying systems to break reciprocity and to overcome various theoretical limitations and performance bounds, discussing their current status, challenges, and opportunities.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Raman Scattering in Nonlinear Silicon Nanophotonic Waveguides: Theory and Applications in Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonics caught world attention since channel capacity limit of metallic interconnects approached due to research and design in high speed digital processors. Use of dielectrics, instead, suitable for light propagation was more attractive due to its extremely wide bandwidth. Many of the devices, both active and passive, have been demonstrated using these insulating materials. Due to its excellent optical characteristics, established fabrication history, and cheaper throughput, silicon found its place in photonics arena. However, due to its indirect band structure, efficient light sources are not possible using silicon as the base material. Nevertheless, techniques such as stimulated Raman scattering and third-harmonic generation have made it possible to avoid this natural hurdle in the path of silicon as a light source. This paper reviews basic theory of stimulated Raman scattering, its applications in the context of silicon based photonic integrated circuits and describes ways to improve this nonlinear effect. This paper also covers few of the most important demonstrations of stimulated Raman scattering published in literature from the last decade.</description>

      <title>Band structure reconstruction in the topological semimetal PrAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between nontrivial topology, magnetism and strong correlation has generated considerable research interest in condensed matter physics. The topological RAlX (R = rare earth ; X = Si and Ge) family has provided an excellent platform for exploring these complex interactions. Here, we performed infrared spectroscopy measurements on the ferromagnetic (FM) topological semimetal PrAlSi, in oder to investigate the impact of FM orderings on the topological band structure. We find that the optical conductivity associated with the Dirac/Weyl cones exhibits two segments of linearly increasing parts in the normal state, connected by a kink feature at around 1 960 cm-1. By entering the FM state, however, an additional linear-growing segment shows up in between the original ones, suggesting that the band structure is reconstructed. We propose that these observations can be effectively explained by a scenario where the Dirac/Weyl nodes are split into pairs of Weyl nodes with lower degeneracy, due to the time reversal symmetry breaking induced by the FM ordering. This band structure reconstruction also leads to a sudden enhancement of the itinerant carrier density. In addition, the effective mass of the itinerant carriers are estimated to be two orders of magnitude smaller than the free electron mass, providing a rare case where nearly all the free carriers exhibit behaviors characteristic of relativistic Dirac or Weyl fermions. Our results demonstrate an compelling example of the strong interaction between magnetic order and topological band structures, which opens up new avenues for exploring novel topological materials and their potential applications.</description>

      <title>Characterization of polarising components at cryogenic temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling polarisation directly at low temperature is crucial for development of optical spectroscopy techniques at sub-Kelvin temperatures, for example, in a hybrid scheme where light is fed into and collected in the cryostat by fibres that are as easy to install as electrical wiring, but where distortions in the fibre need to be compensated for by discrete polarising optical components. The latter are poorly characterised at low temperatures. So we cool-down polarising components from room temperature to 4K and monitor the evolution of the polarisation properties in this range. We test a zero-order half-wave plate, a polarising beamsplitting cube and a dichroic polariser in the optical telecommunication range at 1.5$\mu$m. We show that the polarisation is maintained at the $10^{-4}$ level within the whole temperature range. This is consistent with the typical thermal contraction of optical materials. This level of precision is sufficient for many optics experiments at low temperature. We argue that these experiments will allow the design of compact fibre based probes for cryogenic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Effect of nonreciprocal thermal radiation on radiative cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative cooling has showcased great potential for passive refrigeration without extra energy consumption, while its cooling power and efficiency is confined by Kirchhoff's law, that is, the emissivity is equal to the absorptivity. The recent development of thermal nonreciprocity that breaks the limitations of Kirchhoff's law, especially in broadband manner, makes nonreciprocal radiative cooling (NRC) possible. Since there lacks of reports of NRC theoretically or experimentally, it is time to evaluate the feasibility and worthiness of develop NRC. Here, we discussed the effects of NRC at around room temperature (298.15 K) from three perspectives: ideal selective radiators, non-selective radiators, and colored radiators. Compared to the traditional reciprocal radiative cooling, the nonreciprocity within the non-atmospheric window band (4-8 {\mu}m or 13-25 {\mu}m) exhibits a certain gain, yet the nonreciprocity in the atmospheric window band (8-13 {\mu}m) results in a negative gain. Additionally, it should be noted that the radiators discussed in this work are horizontally placed without the influence of asymmetric external heat sources. The current findings shatter the inherent notion of nonreciprocal radiative cooling and offer some theoretical support for the practical realization and application of nonreciprocal radiative refrigeration devices.</description>

      <title>Topological Valley Photonic Waveguides: Scattering matrix evaluation for linear computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological boundary modes utilizing valley mode waveguides have opened opportunities in, for instance, the design of high transmission waveguides with tolerance to geometrical defects and sharp bends. Applications of these waveguides include linear computational processes and the emulation of logic gates using linear structures, among other scenarios. Here we present the design of a 6-port junction that exhibits equal power splitting to three other ports when excited at single port with no reflections. In studying this structure, a scattering matrix is extracted at telecom wavelengths (around 1550 nm). The linearity of the system along with the scattering matrix are exploited to produce linear operations such as routing of information considering two incident signals or multiple signals applied from different ports. Our work may be exploited to analytically design larger networks without the need of computationally expensive trial and error numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Bulk-hole correspondence and inner robust boundary modes in singular flatband lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological entities based on bulk-boundary correspondence are ubiquitous, from conventional to higher-order topological insulators, where the protected states are typically localized at the outer boundaries (edges or corners). A less explored scenario involves protected states that are localized at the inner boundaries, sharing the same energy as the bulk states. Here, we propose and demonstrate what we refer to as the bulk-hole correspondence - a relation between the inner robust boundary modes (RBMs) and the existence of multiple "holes" in singular flatband lattices, mediated by the immovable discontinuity of the bulk Bloch wavefunctions. We find that the number of independent flatband states always equals the sum of the number of independent compact localized states and the number of nontrivial inner RBMs, as captured by the Betti number that also counts the hole number from topological data analysis. This correspondence is universal for singular flatband lattices, regardless of the lattice shape and the hole shape. Using laser-written Kagome lattices as a platform, we experimentally observe such inner RBMs, demonstrating their real-space topological nature and robustness. Our results may extend to other singular flatband systems beyond photonics, including non-Euclidean lattices, providing a new approach for understanding nontrivial flatband states and topology in hole-bearing lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Ultra-narrow linewidth light generation based on an optoelectronic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) incorporating a feedback loop is proposed for generating ultra-narrow linewidth light. This OEO not only generates a low-noise optical oscillation that effectively isolates the phase fluctuations from the pump laser but also generates a radio frequency (RF) signal that captures these fluctuations. These fluctuations in the RF domain enable a high-performance feedback loop to stabilize the pump laser, further improving the performance of the desired optical oscillation to a remarkable phase noise of -100 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz and an integrated linewidth of 0.23 Hz. The proposed scheme integrating oscillation and feedback loop represents a significant shift in the generating narrow-linewidth light, paving the way for advancements in various fields, such as coherent optical communications, atomic spectroscopy, metrology, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Thermo-optical spiking and mixed-mode oscillations in injected Kerr microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of vertically emitting Kerr microcavities under detuned optical injection, considering the impact of slow thermal effects. Our model integrates thermal detuning caused by refractive index shifts due to heating. Through numerical and analytical approaches, we uncover a rich spectrum of dynamical behaviors, including excitable thermo-optical pulses, mixed-mode oscillations, and chaotic spiking, governed by a higher-dimensional canard scenario. Introducing a long external feedback loop with time delays comparable to the microcavity photon lifetime but shorter than thermal relaxation timescales, reveals how delay affects excitability and stabilizes temporal localized states. Our findings extend the understanding of excitable systems, demonstrating how thermal and feedback mechanisms interplay to shape nonlinear optical dynamics. Further, our approach paves the way for the study of cavity stabilization and cavity cooling using an additional control beam.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Superradiant Scintillation from Weakly Confined CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiency and emission rate are two traditionally conflicting parameters in radiation detection, and achieving their simultaneous maximization could significantly advance ultrafast time-of-flight (ToF) technologies. In this study, we demonstrate that this goal is attainable by harnessing the giant oscillator strength (GOS) inherent to weakly confined perovskite nanocrystals, which enables superradiant scintillation under mildly cryogenic conditions that align seamlessly with ToF technologies. We show that the radiative acceleration due to GOS encompasses both single and multiple exciton dynamics arising from ionizing interactions, further enhanced by suppressed non-radiative losses and Auger recombination at 80 K. The outcome is ultrafast scintillation with 420 ps lifetime and light yield of ~10'000 photons/MeV for diluted NC solutions, all without non-radiative losses. Temperature-dependent light-guiding experiments on test-bed nanocomposite scintillators finally indicate that the light-transport capability remains unaffected by the accumulation of band-edge oscillator strength due to GOS. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing ultrafast nanotech scintillators with optimized light output and timing performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Vector Network Analysis With a Photonic Frequency Extender Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a photonic ultra-wideband frequency extension for a commercial Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) to perform free-space measurements in a frequency range from 70 GHz up to 520 GHz with a Hz level resolution. The concept is based on the synchronization of continuous-wave (CW) lasers with highly frequency-stable electronic emitter sources as a reference. The use of CW photomixers with bandwidths up to several terahertz allows for the straightforward expansion of the covered frequency range to 1 THz or even beyond. This can be achieved, for instance, by cascading additional lasers within the synchronization scheme. Consequently, the necessity for additional frequency extender modules, as seen in current state-of-the-art VNAs, is eliminated, thereby reducing the complexity and cost of the system significantly. To showcase the capabilities of the Photonic Vector Network Analyzer (PVNA) extender concept, we conducted S21 transmission measurements of various cross-shaped bandpass filters and waveguide-coupled high-frequency (HF) components. Additionally, the analyzed magnitude and phase data were either compared to electro-magnetic (EM) simulations or referenced against data obtained from commercial electronic frequency extender modules.</description>

      <title>Theory of monochromatic advanced-wave picture and applications in biphoton optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Klyshko's advanced-wave picture (AWP) is mainly interpreted by replacing the nonlinear crystal producing biphotons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) by a mirror in quantum imaging protocols with thin crystals, where the biphotons are perfectly correlated in position at the crystal. To better explain the biphoton spatial states produced by arbitrary crystals and pump beams, we develop a formal theory of AWP with monochromatic lights that the conditional wave function of one photon is calculated by propagation, multiplication, and another propagation. The case of more general photon postselection or no detection and the inclusion of polarization are studied. Then, we explain the form of biphoton state from SPDC with a bulk crystal and its free-space propagation. By treating the biphoton wave function as an impulse response function of a classical optical setup, we analyze quantum imaging with undetected photons and quantum holography with polarization entanglement, where properties like the spatial resolution can be concisely deduced. This method can be employed to design nonlinear materials or novel quantum imaging techniques. Finally, we discuss Klyshko's original proposal beyond monochromatic lights with the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect as an example.</description>

Abstract: Reducing optical losses is crucial for reducing quantum noise in gravitational-wave detectors. Losses are the main source of degradation of the squeezed vacuum. Frequency dependent squeezing obtained via a filter cavity is currently used to reduce quantum noise in the whole detector bandwidth. Such filter cavities are required to have high finesse in order to produce the optimal squeezing angle rotation and the presence of losses is particularly detrimental for the squeezed beam, as it does multiple round trip within the cavity. Characterising such losses is crucial to assess the quantum noise reduction achievable. In this paper we present an in-situ measurement of the optical losses, done for different positions of the beam on the mirrors of the Virgo filter cavity. We implemented an automatic system to map the losses with respect to the beam position on the mirrors finding that optical losses depend clearly on the beam hitting position on input mirror, varying from 42 ppm to 87 ppm, while they are much more uniform when we scan the end mirror (53 ppm to 61 ppm). We repeated the measurements on several days, finding a statistical error smaller than 4 ppm. The lowest measured losses are not much different with respect to those estimated from individual mirror characterisation performed before the installation (30.3 - 39.3 ppm). This means that no major loss mechanism has been neglected in the estimation presented here. The larger discrepancy found for some beam positions is likely to be due to contamination. In addition to a thorough characterisation of the losses, the methodology described in this paper allowed to find an optimal cavity axis position for which the cavity round trip losses are among the lowest ever measured. This work can contribute to achieve the very challenging losses goals for the optical cavities of the future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Parity breaking in Thouless quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian evolution is a landmark in modern theoretical physics. But if non-commutative dynamics has a significant impact in the control of entanglement and transport in quantum systems is an open question. Here we propose to utilize non-Abelian Thouless pumping in one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks in lattices with degenerate Bloch-bands. We show how the interplay of non-commutativity and topology enables geometrically protected quantum coin and shift operators. By composing different non-Abelian pumping cycles, different classes of tunable protected quantum walks arise. Surprisingly, the walks break parity symmetry and generate a dynamic process described by a Weyl-like equation. The amount of entanglement can be varied by acting on the initial conditions. The asymptotic statistical distribution and its features are determined by closed form analytical expression and confirmed numerically.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Photonic Time-Multiplexed C-NOT Gate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-qubit controlled-not (C-NOT) gate is an essential component in the construction of a gate-based quantum computer. In fact, its operation, combined with single qubit rotations allows to realise any quantum circuit. Several strategies have been adopted in order to build quantum gates, among them the photonic one offers the dual advantage of excellent isolation from the external environment and ease of manipulation at the single qubit level. Here we adopt a scalable time-multiplexed approach in order to build a fully reconfigurable architecture capable of implementing a post-selected interferometric scheme that implements the C-NOT operation with a fidelity of $(93.8\pm1.4)\%$. We use our experimental platform to generate the four Bell states.</description>

      <title>Photonic time crystals: Theory and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of photonic time crystals - artificial materials whose electromagnetic properties are periodically modulated in time at scales comparable to the oscillation period of light while remaining spatially uniform. Being the temporal analogs to traditional photonic crystals, photonic time crystals differ in that they exhibit momentum bandgaps instead of energy bandgaps. The energy is not conserved within momentum bandgaps, and eigenmodes with exponentially growing amplitudes exist in the momentum bandgap. Such properties make photonic time crystals a fascinating novel class of artificial materials from a basic science and applied perspective. This tutorial overviews the fundamental electromagnetic equations governing photonic time crystals and explores the groundbreaking physical phenomena they support. Based on these properties, we also oversee a diverse range of applications they unlock. Different material platforms suitable for creating photonic time crystals are discussed and compared. Furthermore, we elaborate on the connections between wave amplification in photonic time crystals and parametric amplification mechanisms in electrical circuits and nonlinear optics. The tutorial will be helpful for readers with physics or engineering backgrounds. It is designed to serve as an introductory guide for beginners and to establish a reference baseline reflecting the current understanding for researchers in the field.</description>

      <title>Study of energy backflow in unidirectional monochromatic and space-time waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Backflow, or retropropagation, is a counterintuitive phenomenon whereby for a forward-propagating wave the energy locally propagates backward. In the context of backflow, physically most interesting are the so-called unidirectional waves, which contain only forward propagating plane wave constituents. Yet, very few such waves possessing closed-form analytic expressions for evaluation of the Poynting vector are known. In this study, we examine energy backflow in a novel (2+1)-dimensional unidirectional monochromatic wave and in a (2+1)D spatio-temporal wave packet, analytic expressions which we succeeded to find. We also present a detailed study of the backflow in the "needle" pulse. This is an interesting model object because well-known superluminal non-diffracting space-time wave packets can be derived from its factored wave function. Finally we study the backflow in an unidirectional version of the so-called focus wave mode--a pulse propagating luminally and without spread, which is the first and most studied representative of the (3+1)D non-diffracting space-time wave packets (also referred to as spatiotemporally localized waves).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) presents distinctive computational challenges, including their large memory requirements. Advancements in the two-photon polymerization (2PP) fabrication process introduce additional complexity, necessitating the development of more flexible optimization algorithms to enable the creation of multi-material 3D structures with unique properties. This paper presents a memory efficient reverse-mode automatic differentiation framework for finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations that is able to handle complex constraints arising from novel fabrication methods. Our method is based on straight-through gradient estimation that enables non-differentiable shape parametrizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by creating increasingly complex structures to solve the coupling problem in PICs. The results highlight the potential of our method for future PIC design and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Switching, Amplifying, and Chirping Diode Lasers with Current Pulses for High Bandwidth Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of simple and low-cost devices for switching, amplifying, and chirping diode lasers based on current modulation are presented. Direct modulation of diode laser currents is rarely sufficient to establish precise amplitude and phase control over light, as its effects on these parameters are not independent. These devices overcome this limitation by exploiting amplifier saturation and dramatically outperform commonly used external modulators in key figures of merit for quantum technological applications. Semiconductor optical amplifiers operated on either rubidium D line are recast as intensity switches and shown to achieve ON:OFF ratios $&gt;10^6$ in as little as 50 ns. Current is switched to a 795 nm wavelength (Rb D1) tapered amplifier to produce optical pulses of few nanosecond duration and peak powers of 3 W at a similar extinction ratio. Fast rf pulses are applied directly to a laser diode to shift its emission frequency by up to 300 MHz in either direction and at a maximum chirp rate of 150 MHz/ns. Finally, the latter components are combined, yielding a system that produces watt-level optical pulses with arbitrary frequency chirps in the given range and &lt;2% residual intensity variation, all within 65 ns upon asynchronous demand. Such systems have broad application in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and are of particular interest to fast experiments simultaneously requiring high power and low noise, for example quantum memory experiments with atomic vapors.</description>

      <title>Extending the FDTD GVADE method nonlinear polarization vector to include anisotropy</title>

Abstract: In this paper the finite-difference time-domain general vector auxiliary differential equation method [Greene, J. H. and A. Taflove, Opt. Express 14, 8305 (2006)], nonlinear polarization vector, the nonlinear electric dipole moment per unit volume, is extended to include anisotropy, in nonlinear isotropic media at optical frequencies. The theory is presented for extending the numerical method in 3D Cartesian coordinates, and then example simulation results are presented for two isotropic media. First, the simplified 2D transverse magnetic case is revisited for the fused silica example introduced in the 2006 paper, including the anisotropic part of the nonlinear polarization vector in the simulation; the simulation results including the anisotropic part of the polarization vector were compared with the purely isotropic polarization vector simulation results. Second, a simplified 2D transverse magnetic example was simulated in carbon disulfide, with its strong molecular re-orientation induced polarization anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons through optically-induced ultrafast transient gratings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast excitation of non-equilibrium carriers under intense pulses offer unique opportunities for controlling optical properties of semiconductor materials. In this work, we propose a scheme for ultrafast generation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) via a transient metagrating formed under two interfering optical pump pulses in the semiconductor GaAs thin film. The grating can be formed due to modulation of the refractive index associated with the non-equilibrium carriers generation. The formed temporal grating structure enables generation of SPP waves at GaAs/Ag interface via weak probe pulse excitation. We propose a theoretical model describing non-equilibrium carriers formation and diffusion and their contribution to permittivity modulation via Drude and band-filling mechanisms. We predict that by tuning the parameters of the pump and probe one can reach critical coupling regime and achieve efficient generation of SPP at the times scales of 0.1-1 ps.</description>

      <title>Enhanced $Q$ factor and robustness of photonic bound states in the continuum merging at locally bent trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) in planar photonic structures have attracted broad scientific interest owing to their exceptional capability to confine light. Topological robustness of certain BICs allows them to be moved in the momentum space by tuning the geometric parameters of the structure. In this work, we study such a BIC in a one-dimensional periodic grating, and find that its momentum-space position can be made a non-monotonic function of a geometric parameter, forming a locally bent ''V''-shaped trajectory. We show that, near the turning point of this trajectory, the robustness of the BIC and its $Q$ factor can be greatly enhanced. We tune such ''V-BICs'' to almost merge with a symmetry-protected BIC at the $\Gamma$-point. This creates a ''K''-shaped ultrahigh-$Q$ region containing a BIC with a much higher and more stable $Q$ factor compared to the ordinary merging BICs. The ''K-BICs'' are also found to provide a strong enhancement of the $Q$ factor in finite gratings over an extremely wide range of geometric parameters. Our findings enable further advancements in the development of ultrahigh-$Q$ BICs and their applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric dependent anomalous velocity in systems subject to complex electric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Berry phases have long been known to significantly alter the properties of periodic systems, resulting in anomalous terms in the semiclassical equations of motion describing wave-packet dynamics. In non-Hermitian systems, generalizations of the Berry connection have been proposed and shown to have novel effects on dynamics and transport. In this work, we consider perturbing fields which are themselves non-Hermitian, in the form of complex external electric fields, which are realizable as gain/loss gradients. We derive the full set of semiclassical equations of motion and show that the anomalous velocity depends not only on the Berry curvature, but on the entirety of the quantum geometric tensor, including the quantum metric. This quantum metric dependent velocity appears regardless of whether the unperturbed Hamiltonian is Hermitian or not. These analytical results are compared with numerical lattice simulations which reveal these anomalous terms even in one-dimension. Our work expands the range of phenomena expected to be detectable in experimental setups, which should be realizable in currently available metamaterials and classical wave systems, including mechanical, acoustic, and optical.</description>

Abstract: A method to compute the excitation of narrow transitions at hard x-ray energies by short focused x-ray pulses is developed. In particular, the effect of thin-film cavities on the pulse propagation is incorporated via a semi-analytical algorithm requiring the numerical evaluation of only one two-dimensional Fourier transform. We investigate various limiting cases to confirm the reliability of the algorithm. As an application, we show how a focused x-ray pulse propagates in cavity structures utilized in previous theoretical studies and experiments with collimated beams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for differentiating shapes represented in binary images with respect to their parameters. This framework functions as an automatic differentiation tool for shape parameters, generating both binary density maps for optical simulations and computing gradients when the simulation provides a gradient of the density map. Our algorithm enables robust gradient computation that is insensitive to the image's pixel resolution and is compatible with all density-based simulation methods. We demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness, and generalizability of our differential shape algorithm using photonic designs with different shape parametrizations across several differentiable optical solvers. We also demonstrate a substantial reduction in optimization time using our gradient-based shape optimization framework compared to traditional black-box optimization methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A leaky wave antenna based on spin photonic topological insulators has been developed, featuring a hexagonal unit cell arranged in an armchair configuration. This configuration offers advantages over the zigzag arrangement, particularly with its wider leaky region and more suitable pattern. While the proposed antenna is a uniform leaky wave antenna, it is capable of radiating in both backward and forward directions. Notably, the transition through the broadside in the scanning range does not result in a significant drop in performance, despite the presence of an open stop band. This characteristic is unique among leaky wave antennas, to the best of our knowledge.</description>
