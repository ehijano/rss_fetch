      <title>A Supergeometric Fa\`{a} di Bruno Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the multivariate Fa\`{a} di Bruno formula to the super case, where anticommuting odd coordinates are considered. The formula takes the same form as the classical case but contains some nontrivial signs, which essentially measure the failure to order the odd factors and derivatives optimally. As a quick application, we obtain an explicit combinatorial formula for the generalized super Bell polynomials, defined by Fan and Hon.</description>

      <title>Homotopies for Lagrangian field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the variational bicomplex for $\mathcal{E}$ the space of sections of a graded, affine bundle. Local functionals $\mathcal{F}$ are defined as an equivalence class of density-valued functionals, which represent Lagrangian densities. A choice of a $k$-symplectic local form $\omega$ on $\mathcal{E}$ induces a Lie$[k]$ algebra structure on (Hamiltonian) local functionals $(\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{ham}},\{\cdot,\cdot\}_{\mathrm{ham}})$. For any $\omega$ and any choice of a cohomological vector field $Q$ compatible with $\omega$, we build an explicit $L_\infty$ algebra on a resolution of $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{ham}}$, which is $L_\infty$ quasi-isomorphic to a dgL$[k]$a $(\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{ham}},d_{\mathrm{ham}},\{\cdot,\cdot\}_{\mathrm{ham}})$. In the case $k=-1$, this provides an explicit lift of the standard Batalin--Vilkovisky framework to local forms enriched by the $L_\infty$ structure, in terms of local homotopies. We further provide a multisymplectic interpretation of the resulting data.</description>

      <title>Anomalous free energy expansions of planar Coulomb gases: multi-component and conformal singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the partition function $$ Z_n = \int_{\mathbb{C}^n } \prod_{1 \le j&lt;k \le n} |z_{j}-z_{k}|^{2} \prod_{j=1}^{n} |z_j|^{2c}\, e^{-n V(z_{j})}\frac{d^{2}z_{j}}{\pi}, $$ where $c&gt;-1$ and $$ V(z)= |z|^{2d}-t(z^{d}+\overline{z}^{d}), \qquad t &gt;0, \, d \in \mathbb{N}. $$ The associated droplet reveals a topological phase transition: for $t &gt; 1/\sqrt{d}$, it consists of $d$ connected components; whereas for $t &lt; 1/\sqrt{d}$, it becomes simply connected and contains the origin, where a conformal singularity arises. In both regimes, we establish the asymptotic expansion $$ \log Z_n = C_1 n^2 + C_2 n \log n + C_3 n + C_4 \log n + C_5 + O(n^{-1}), $$ as $n \to \infty$, and derive all coefficients explicitly. In the multi-component regime $t &gt; 1/\sqrt{d}$, the constant term $C_5$ exhibits an oscillatory behaviour that depends on the congruence class of $n$ modulo $d$. In particular, in the special case $c = 0$ with $n$ divisible by $d$, our result confirms a conjecture of Dea\~no and Simm. In contrast, in the conformal singularity regime $t &lt; 1/\sqrt{d}$, the oscillatory behaviour disappears, while additional contributions in $C_4$ arise beyond the scope of the conjecture of Jancovici et al. As a special case $d = 1$, our result yields the asymptotic expansion for the moments of the characteristic polynomial of the complex Ginibre ensemble with finite exponent. In the bulk regime, we further derive the full expansion in powers of $1/N$, thereby providing a precise evaluation of the error term in the result of Webb and Wong.</description>

      <title>An analytic approach to the stress energy tensor in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a framework for quantum fields in curved spacetimes that possess a stress energy tensor as a connection one form on a suitable moduli space of metrics. In generic spacetimes the existence of such a tensor is thought to be a replacement for the existence of symmetries that the Minkowski theory relies on. It is shown that the local time-slice property and the implementability of local isometries is a consequence of the existence of a stress energy tensor that is a local field. We prove that the Klein-Gordon field, in an irreducible Fock representation in which the ground state is Hadamard, is an example. In this example we show that the scattering matrix for compactly supported metric perturbations exists in the Fock space and is smooth on a dense set with respect to the perturbation parameter. This generalises results by Dimock and Wald.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of generalized spin--boson models with critical ultraviolet divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous construction of generalized spin--boson models with commuting transition matrices and form factors exhibiting critical ultraviolet (UV) divergences. That is, we cover all divergences where a self-energy renormalization, but no non-Fock representation, is required. Our method is based on a direct definition of the renormalized Hamiltonian on a sufficiently large test domain, followed by a Friedrichs extension. We then prove that this Hamiltonian coincides with the one obtained by cut-off renormalization. Furthermore, we show that for specific supercritical cases, i.e., when a non-Fock representation is required, the renormalized Hamiltonian is trivial.</description>

      <title>Non-Trivial Renormalization of Spin-Boson Models with Supercritical Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct the non-trivial, renormalized Hamiltonian for a class of spin-boson models with supercritical form factors, including the one describing the Weisskopf-Wigner spontaneous emission. The renormalization is performed through both a self-energy and mass renormalization, in the so-called Hamiltonian formalism of constructive quantum field theory, implemented by a non-unitary dressing transformation. This solves the problem of triviality for unitarily-renormalized supercritical spin-boson models.</description>

      <title>Teleparallel gravity from the principal bundle viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine whether the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) can be formulated as a gauge theory in the language of connections on principal bundles. We argue in favor of using either the affine bundle with the Poincar\'e group or, equivalently, the orthonormal frame bundle with the Lorentz group as the structure group. Following the framework of Trautman--where gauge symmetries are determined using the absolute elements--we set to identify the absolute elements and gauge symmetries of TEGR. The problem of a non-dynamical teleparallel connection raises the question of whether it should be treated as an absolute element. If so, the gauge group of TEGR is potentially some undetermined subgroup of the diffeomorphism group. On the other hand, if the connection is allowed to be non-dynamical but the only absolute element is taken to be the canonical 1-form of the frame bundle, we recover the whole diffeomorphism group as the gauge group of TEGR.</description>

      <title>Volume as an index of a subalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new way to understand the volume of certain subregions in the bulk of AdS spacetime by relating it to an algebraic quantity known as the index of inclusion. This index heuristically measures the relative size of a subalgebra $\mathcal{N}$ embedded within a larger algebra $\mathcal{M}$. According to subregion-subalgebra duality, bulk subregions are described by von Neumann algebras on the boundary. When a causally complete bulk subregion corresponds to the relative commutant $\mathcal{N}' \cap \mathcal{M}$ -- the set of operators in $\mathcal{M}$ that commute with $\mathcal{N}$ -- of boundary subalgebras, we propose that the exponential of the volume of the maximal volume slice of the subregion equals the index of inclusion. This ``volume-index'' relation provides a new boundary explanation for the growth of interior volume in black holes, reframing it as a change in the relative size of operator algebras. It offers a complementary perspective on complexity growth from the Heisenberg picture, and has a variety of other applications, including quantifying the relative size of algebras dual to the entanglement wedge and the causal wedge of a boundary region, as well as quantifying the violation of additivity of operator algebras in the large $N$ limit. Finally, it may offer insights into the volume growth of de Sitter space through the changes in North and South pole observer algebras in time.</description>

Abstract: For all $\alpha \in (0,1)$, we construct an explicit divergence-free vector field $V \in L^\infty([0,1],C^\alpha(\mathbb{T}^2))$ that exhibits universal anomalous (total) dissipation, accelerating dissipation enhancement, Richardson dispersion, anomalous regularization, and spatial intermittency. Additionally, we demonstrate the sharpness of the intermittent Obukhov-Corrsin regime for certain parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Efficient and simple Gibbs state preparation of the 2D toric code via duality to classical Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of polynomial-depth duality transformations, which relates two sets of operator algebras through a conjugation by a poly-depth quantum circuit, and make use of this to construct efficient Gibbs samplers for a variety of interesting quantum Hamiltonians as they are poly-depth dual to classical Hamiltonians. This is for example the case for the 2D toric code, which is demonstrated to be poly-depth dual to two decoupled classical Ising spin chains for any system size, and we give evidence that such dualities hold for a wide class of stabilizer Hamiltonians. Additionally, we extend the above notion of duality to Lindbladians in order to show that mixing times and other quantities such as the spectral gap or the modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality are preserved under duality.</description>

Abstract: We consider a model for internal waves described by a zero order pseudo-differential Hamiltonian $P$ damped by a second order viscosity term $i \nu Q$. Under Morse-Smale or similar weaker global conditions on the classical dynamics, we describe qualitatively the long-time behavior of solutions of the corresponding evolution equation with smooth forcing in a small $\nu$ regime. We show that dissipation effects arise no earlier than at the $t\sim \nu^{-1/3-}$ time scale.</description>

      <title>Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics I: Foundation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, termed Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics (NNET), which integrates reversible dynamics governed by the Nambu bracket with irreversible dynamics driven by entropy gradients. This framework is developed axiomatically and enables the description of far-from-equilibrium systems in which entropy can transiently decrease -- a regime difficult to handle within conventional approaches such as Onsager's linear response theory, Prigogine's General Evolution Criterion (GEC), or the GENERIC framework.
  As an illustrative example, we analyze a triangular chemical reaction system. We demonstrate that, without assuming detailed balance or linearity, two geometric conserved quantities naturally emerge: one associated with cyclic symmetry in the reaction space, and another that vanishes under symmetric reaction rates. This highlights the extended descriptive power of NNET and its capacity to unify cyclic dynamics and dissipation within a covariant structure. The generalization to higher-order nonlinear systems and applications to oscillatory or spiking non-equilibrium behavior will be discussed in subsequent papers.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Penrose cut-and-paste method: Null shells with pressure and energy flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cut-and-paste method is a procedure for constructing null thin shells by matching two regions of the same spacetime across a null hypersurface. Originally proposed by Penrose, it has so far allowed to describe purely gravitational and null-dust shells in constant-curvature backgrounds. In this paper, we extend the cut-and-paste method to null shells with arbitrary gravitational/matter content. To that aim, we first derive a locally Lipschitz continuous form of the metric of the spacetime resulting from the most general matching of two constant-curvature spacetimes with totally geodesic null boundaries, and then obtain the coordinate transformation that turns this metric into the cut-and-paste form with a Dirac-delta term. The paper includes an example of a null shell with non-trivial energy density, energy flux and pressure in Minkowski space.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript concerns the dynamical interactions between wind and water waves, which are characterized through two-phase free interface problems for the Euler equations. We provide a comprehensive derivation on the linearized problems of general two-phase flows. Then, we study the instability issues of perturbing waves around circular steady solutions, and we demonstrate a semi-circle result on the possible locations of unstable modes. We also present necessary conditions and sufficient ones for the instability of wind-perturbing water waves near Taylor-Couette flows.</description>

      <title>Linear F-manifolds, a duality and the generalized tangent bundle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linear F-manifold is an F-manifold (E, \circ , e) defined on the total space of a vector bundle \pi : E \rightarrow M for which the multiplication and unit field are linear tensor fields. We develop a systematic treatment of linear F-manifolds. Using an additional suitable connection on M, we define a duality between linear F-manifolds (with and without Euler fields) on E and the total space E^{*} of the dual vector bundle. Our main examples of linear F-manifolds are the tangent and cotangent prolongation. Motivated by the direct sum of tangent and cotangent prolongation, we define and investigate compatibility conditions between linear F-manifolds and the geometry of the generalized tangent bundle.</description>

      <title>Thermal aspects of the anomalous $\omega \to \infty$ limit of Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brans-Dicke gravity does not always reduce to General Relativity in the limit $\omega\to\infty$ for the coupling constant. This anomalous behavior is examined within the formalism of the first-order thermodynamics of scalar-tensor gravity. It is shown that this effect is linked to the non-vanishing nature of the chemical potential, in the Einstein frame formulation of the thermodynamic analogy, in the $\omega\to\infty$ limit.</description>

      <title>Localized states and skin effect around non-Hermitian impurities in tight-binding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the generalized Bloch theorem formalism of Alase {\it et al.} [{\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 117} 076804 (2016)] to analyze simple one-dimensional tight-binding lattice systems connected by Hermitian bonds (all with the same hopping parameter $t$), but containing one bond impurity which can be either Hermitian or non-Hermitian. We calculate the band structure, the bulk-boundary correspondence indicator ($D_L(\epsilon)$) and analyze the eigenvalues of the lattice translation operator ($z$), for each eigenstate. From the $z$ values the generalized Brillouin zone can be reconstructed. If the impurity is Hermitian (and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric), we find a parameter regime in which two localized edge states separate from the tight-binding band. We then simulate a non-Hermitian impurity by keeping hopping in one direction of the bond impurity the same as the rest of the tight-binding system, and varying only its reciprocal. Again, we find a region with localized edge states, but in this case the energy eigenvalues are purely imaginary. We also find that in this case the two zero energy eigenvectors coalesce, hence this system is an exceptional line. We then perform an interpolative scan between the above two scenarios and find that there is an intermediate region exhibiting a non-Hermitian skin effect. In this region a macroscopic fraction of states acquire complex energy eigenvalues and exhibit localization towards the impurity. Our numerical results are supported by a detailed analysis of the solutions of the boundary/impurity equation.</description>

      <title>A More Convex Ising Formulation of Max-3-Cut Using Higher-Order Spin Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are naturally expressed using variables that take on more than two discrete values. To solve such problems using Ising machines (IMs) - specialized analog or digital devices designed to solve COPs efficiently - these multi-valued integers must be encoded using binary spin variables. A common approach is one-hot encoding, where each variable is represented by a group of spins constrained so that exactly one spin is in the "up" state. However, this encoding introduces energy barriers: changing an integer's value requires flipping two spins and passing through an invalid intermediate state. This creates rugged energy landscapes that may hinder optimization. We propose a higher-order Ising formulation for Max-3-Cut, which is the smallest fundamental COP with multi-valued integer variables. Our formulation preserves valid configurations under single-spin updates. The resulting energy landscapes are smoother, and we show that this remains true even when the binary variables are relaxed to continuous values, making it well-suited for analog IMs as well. Benchmarking on such an IM, we find that the higher-order formulation leads to significantly faster solutions than the Ising baseline. Interestingly, we find that an empirical rescaling of some terms in the Ising formulation - a heuristic proposed in prior work - approaches the performance of the higher-order Ising formulation, underscoring the importance of empirical parameter tuning in COP encodings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the solution theory of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a concentrated nonlinearity on the torus. In particular, we establish existence and uniqueness of global energy-conserving solutions for small initial data in $H^1$. Our approach is based on two approximation schemes, namely the concentrated limit of a smoothed nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the inviscid limit of a concentrated complex Ginzburg--Landau equation. We also prove local well-posedness below the energy space. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous solution theory for a periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a concentrated nonlinearity.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by examples from physics and noncommutative geometry, given a generator $A$ of a Gibbs semigroup, we reexamine the relationship between the Schatten class of its resolvents and the behaviour of the norm-trace $\norm{e^{-tA}}_1\,$ when $t$ approaches zero. In addition to applying Tauberian results, we specifically investigate the compatibility of asymptotic behaviours with derivations and perturbations. Along the course of our study, we present a novel characterisation of Gibbs semigroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Floquet theory allows to map a time-periodic system of linear differential equations into an autonomous one. By looking at it in a geometrical way, we extend the theory to a class of non-autonomous non-periodic equations. This is obtained by considering a change of variables which depends on time in a non-trivial way, i.e. introducing gauge transformations, well known in fundamental Physics and Field Theory -- but which seems to have received little attention in this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exactly solvable Schr\"{o}dinger equations with the conventional shape-invariant potentials are known to be related with each other through point cannonical transformations. In this paper, we extend the idea to integral formulae called the SWKB integrals. By virtue of this, we derive extended forms of the SWKB quantization condition for certain classes of Natanzon potentials. We further demonstrate that the same idea can also be applied to obtain an exact quantization rule for a subclass of quantum systems with position-dependent effective masses, provided their solutions involve the classical orthogonal polynomials. Based on the findings, we conjecture about the implication of the exactness of the SWKB formula in relation to the classical orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Trans-Series in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many observables in quantum field theory can be expressed in terms of trans-series, in which one adds to the perturbative series a typically infinite sum of exponentially small corrections, due to instantons or to renormalons. Even after Borel resummation of the series in the coupling constant, one has to sum this infinite series of small exponential corrections. It has been argued that this leads to a new divergence, which is sometimes called the divergence of the OPE. We show that, in some interesting examples in quantum field theory, the series of small exponential corrections is convergent, order by order in the coupling constant. In particular, we give numerical evidence for this convergence property in the case of the free energy of integrable asymptotically free theories, which has been intensively studied recently in the framework of resurgence. Our results indicate that, in these examples, the Borel resummed trans-series leads to a well defined function, and there are no further divergences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the moduli space of Einstein structures in four dimensions is generally considered to be rigid so that Einstein metrics tend to be isolated modulo diffeomorphisms under infinitesimal Einstein deformations. We examine the rigidity of the Einstein structure by considering deformations of the round four-sphere. We show that any deviation from the standard metric of the round four-sphere (except for scaling) breaks the Einstein condition. This further supports the idea of rigidity. We analyze the Einstein structure of four-manifolds based on the irreducible decomposition of the self-dual structure of Einstein manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for evaluating analytical eigenfunctions of the finite Hartley transform. The approach is based on the use of $N=1/2$-supersymmetric quantum mechanics as a fundamental tool, which builds on the key observation that the Hartley transform commutes with the supercharge operator. Using the intertwining operator between the Hartley transform and the finite Hartley transform, our approach provides an overcomplete basis of eigenvectors expressed in terms of supersymmetric Hermite polynomials.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript concerns the dynamics of non-isentropic compressible Euler equations in a physical vacuum. We establish the Hadamard-style local well-posedness in low-regularity weighted Sobolev spaces, where the gas-vacuum interface is allowed to have unbounded curvature, demonstrating existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data. Additionally, we prove sharp a priori energy estimates and continuation criteria.
  The approach is based on the framework of Eulerian coordinates, avoiding the regularity issues of the flow map and the high nonlinearity induced by the Lagrangian transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical linearized gravity admits a dual formulation in terms of a higher-rank tensor field. Proposing a prescription for the instanton sectors of linearized gravity and its dual, we show that they may be quantum inequivalent in even dimensions. The duality anomaly is obtained by resolving the dual graviton theories into vector-valued $p$-form electrodynamics and is controlled by the Reidemeister torsion, Ray-Singer torsion and Euler characteristic of the cotangent bundle. Under the proposed instanton prescription the duality anomaly vanishes for an odd number of spacetime dimensions as a consequence of the celebrated Cheeger-M\"uller theorem. In the presence of a gravitational $\theta$-term, the partition function is a modular form in direct analogy to Abelian S-duality for Maxwell theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ion-acoustic waves in a dusty plasma are investigated where it is assumed that the ions follow a Cairns distribution and the electrons are Boltzmann distributed. Two theoretical methods are applied: Sagdeev pseudopotential analysis (SPA) and reductive perturbation theory (RPT). Since SPA incorporates all nonlinearities of the model it is the most accurate but deriving soliton profiles requires numerical integration of Poisson's equation. By contrast, RPT is a perturbation method which at second order yields the Gardner equation incorporating both the quadratic nonlinearity of the KdV equation and the cubic nonlinearity of the modified KdV equation. For consistency with the perturbation scheme the coefficient of the quadratic term needs to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the coefficient of the cubic term. Solving the Gardner equation yields an analytic expression of the soliton profile. Selecting an appropriate set of compositional parameters, the soliton solutions obtained from SPA and RPT are analyzed and compared.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called ``projective decomposition''. The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred canonical coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse square and inverse cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. From these solutions, a new set of orbit elements for Kepler-Coulomb dynamics is derived, along with their variational equations for arbitrary perturbations (singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion). Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the $J_2$ gravitational perturbation.</description>

      <title>Post-Hopf group algebras, Hopf group braces and Rota-Baxter operators on Hopf group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of Hopf group braces, post-Hopf group algebras and Rota-Baxter Hopf group algebras as important generalizations of Hopf brace, post Hopf algebra and Rota-Baxter Hopf algebras respectively. We also discuss their relationships. Explicitly under the condition of cocomutativity, Hopf group braces, post-Hopf group algebras could be mutually obtained, and Rota-Baxter Hopf group algebras could lead to Hopf group braces.</description>

      <title>Context-Dependent Time-Energy Uncertainty Relations from Projective Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for defining context-dependent time distributions in quantum systems using projective measurements. The time-of-flow (TF) distribution, derived from population transfer rates into a measurement subspace, yields a time--energy uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta \mathcal{T} \cdot \Delta H \geq \hbar / (6\sqrt{3}) \cdot \delta\theta$, where $\delta\theta$ quantifies net population transfer. This bound applies to arbitrary projectors under unitary dynamics and reveals that time uncertainty is inherently measurement-dependent. We demonstrate the framework with two applications: a general time-of-arrival (TOA)-energy uncertainty relation and a driven three-level system under detuned coherent driving. The TF framework unifies timing observables across spin, atomic, and matter-wave systems, and offers an experimentally accessible route to probing quantum timing in controlled measurements.</description>
