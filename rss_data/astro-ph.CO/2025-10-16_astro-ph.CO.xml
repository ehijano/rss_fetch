      <title>Probabilistic Inference of Cosmological Density Parameters from Synthetic Hubble Expansion Data of Varying SNR Using Diverse Artificial Neural Network Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper builds upon ParamANN's novel approach (S. Pal &amp; R. Saha 2024) of using ANNs to infer cosmological density parameters by determining optimal architecture for varying synthetic Hubble data SNRs in estimating the density parameters $\Omega_{m, 0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda, 0}$ across redshift values $z \in [0, 1]$. To generate the synthetic data, this study randomly sampled initial free parameter values at $z=0$ from theoretically motivated priors and evolved them backwards using the first Friedmann Equation to generate clean $H(z)$ curves. Then, this paper adds realistic noise of high, normal, and low SNR by sampling relative uncertainties from a Gaussian KDE on 47 real data observations compiled by A. Bouali et al. (2023). In the end, this study found that a RNN that uses BiLSTM is the most effective for high and normal SNR data across four quantitative metrics. On the other hand, a combination of convolution and recurrent layers that uses GRU performed the best for low SNR data across the same four metrics. A comparison between the results of this paper's ANN predictions and those of ParamANN shows that all architectures tested in this paper regardless of training SNR are statistically consistent within 1 standard deviation of ParamANN. However, most ANN results are not statistically consistent within 3 standard deviations of Planck Collaboration et al. (2020), showing a significant difference between ANN and the more traditional MCMC methods used by Planck collaboration.</description>

      <title>Revealing evolution of Dark Energy density from observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model--independent reconstruction of the normalized dark energy density function, $X(z) \equiv \rho_{\mathrm{de}}(z)/\rho_{\mathrm{de}}(0)$, derived directly from the DES-SN5YR Type~Ia supernova sample. The analysis employs an inversion formalism that relates the derivative of the distance modulus, $\mu^{\prime}(z)$, to the expansion history, allowing the data to determine the shape of $X(z)$ without assuming a specific equation--of--state or dark energy density parameterization.
  A statistically optimized binning of the supernova sample (using 17 intervals following the Freedman--Diaconis criterion and 34 following Scott's rule) ensures a stable estimation of $\mu^{\prime}(z)$ and a controlled propagation of uncertainties throughout the inversion process.
  The resulting $X(z)$ remains statistically consistent with a constant value within one standard deviation across the entire redshift range, showing no significant evidence for an evolving dark energy component at present. In a direct comparison among $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and the quadratic $X^2(z)$ parameterization -- where CPL and $X^2(z)$ each introduce two additional free parameters relative to $\Lambda$CDM -- the CPL model attains the best statistical agreement with the data, albeit only marginally and strictly within this restricted model set.
  These outcomes indicate that current observations are compatible with an almost constant dark energy density ($w \simeq -1$), while the inversion framework remains sensitive to subtle departures that forthcoming high--precision surveys could resolve.</description>

      <title>When Tiny Halos Stir Spacetime: Gravitational Waves from Fifth-Force Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter fermions interacting via attractive fifth forces mediated by a light mediator can form dark matter halos in the very early universe. We show that bound systems composed of these halos are capable of generating gravitational wave (GW) signals detectable today, even when the individual halos are very light. The Yukawa force dominates the dynamics of these halo binaries, rather than gravity. As a result, large GW signals can be produced at initially extremely high frequencies, which are then redshifted to frequency bands accessible to current or future GW observatories. In addition, the resulting GW signals carry distinctive features that enable future observations to distinguish them from conventional ones. Notably, even if only a tiny fraction of dark matter experiences strong fifth-force interactions, such effects provide a new avenue to discover self-interacting dark matter through GW observations.</description>

      <title>Strong Progenitor Age-bias in Supernova Cosmology. II. Alignment with DESI BAO and Signs of a Non-Accelerating Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) cosmology is based on the key assumption that the luminosity standardization process of Type Ia SNe remains invariant with progenitor age. However, direct and extensive age measurements of SN host galaxies reveal a significant (5.5{\sigma}) correlation between standardized SN magnitude and progenitor age, which is expected to introduce a serious systematic bias with redshift in SN cosmology. This systematic bias is largely uncorrected by the commonly used mass-step correction, as progenitor age and host galaxy mass evolve very differently with redshift. After correcting for this age-bias as a function of redshift, the SN dataset aligns more closely with the w0waCDM model recently suggested by the DESI BAO project from a combined analysis using only BAO and CMB data. This result is further supported by an evolution-free test that uses only SNe from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift range. When the three cosmological probes (SNe, BAO, CMB) are combined, we find a significantly stronger (&gt; 9{\sigma}) tension with the {\Lambda}CDM model than that reported in the DESI papers, suggesting a time-varying dark energy equation of state in a currently non-accelerating universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we describe the current state-of-the-art for numerical simulations of large-scale structure and galaxy formation. Numerical simulations play a central role in the preparation and the exploitation of large-scale galaxy surveys, in which galaxies are the fundamental observational objects. We first describe basic methods for collisionless N-body dynamics that enable us to model dark matter accurately by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations. We then discuss simple methods to populate dark matter halos with galaxies, such as Halo and Sub-halo Abundance Matching techniques and baryonification techniques for capturing baryonic effects on the matter distribution. We finally describe how to model the gas component by solving the Euler-Poisson equations, focusing on the foundational assumptions behind these equations, namely local thermo-dynamical equilibrium, and the nature of the truncation errors of the numerical scheme, namely numerical diffusion. We show a few examples of simulations of a Milky-Way-like halo without cooling, with cooling and with star formation. We finally describe different subgrid prescriptions recently developed to model star formation, supernovae feedback and active galactic nuclei and how they impact cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Global linear analysis of the magneto-thermal instability in a stratified spherical model of the intracluster medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The buoyancy stability properties of the ICM are modified because of the anisotropic transport of heat along the magnetic field lines. This feature gives rise to the MTI when the temperature gradient is aligned with the gravity, which occurs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Most previous linear analyses of the MTI adopted a local, Boussinesq approach. However, the conduction length, which sets the characteristic length scale of the MTI, might be a non-negligible fraction of the scale height in the ICM. We want to assess the impact of locality assumptions on the linear physics of the MTI. Another goal is to unveil the deeper connections between these global MTI modes and their MRI counterparts in accretion discs. Our third objective is to provide a new benchmark against which any numerical code implementing the Braginskii heat flux in spherical geometry can be tested. We perform a global linear analysis of the MTI in a spherical stratified model of the ICM. We use a combination of analytical results, corroborated by numerical results obtained with both a pseudo-spectral solver and IDEFIX, to better explain the physics of the global MTI modes. We obtain scaling laws and approximate expressions for the growth rates of the global modes. We show that the associated functions are confined within an inner region, limited by a turning point, where the mode is allowed to grow. The most unstable local MTI modes correspond to the portion of the global mode localised near the turning point. This phenomenology is similar to that of the global MRI modes. Finally, direct simulations successfully reproduce the global MTI modes and their growth rates, with errors smaller than 1%. Overall, this study provides us with new insights on the linear theory of the global MTI in the ICM, and a useful numerical test bench for any astrophysical fluid dynamics code embedding anisotropic heat flux.</description>

      <title>Examining a new form of non-standard dark matter using DESI DR2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a non-standard dark matter (NSDM) model in which the equation of state (EoS) of dark matter (DM) is parameterized as $w_{\rm dm} = w_2 a^2$, and this DM model is motivated by the idea that DM must become cold dark matter (CDM) in the neighborhood of the scale factor $a = 0$, which implies that both the EoS of DM, $w_{\rm dm}$, and its derivative with respect to the scale factor, ${\rm d}w_{\rm dm}/{\rm d}a$, vanish at $a = 0$. By incorporating the latest cosmological datasets -- including the Planck2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), together with three independent Type Ia Supernova datasets, namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus sample -- we constrain the $\Lambda w_2$DM, $ww_2$DM, and $w_0w_aw_2$DM models, which are constructed by replacing CDM with NSDM in the $\Lambda $CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models, respectively. We find that there is a preference for a negative DM EoS at more than the $3\sigma$ confidence level for the data combinations CMB+DESI+Union3 and CMB+DESI+DESY5. Moreover, for all data combinations, replacing CDM with NSDM in the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM models significantly reduces the probability of violating the null energy condition. Furthermore, both $ww_2$DM and $w_0w_aw_2$DM are favored over $\Lambda $CDM with a significance comparable to that of the $w_0w_a$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Probing Primordial black holes with the distortion of Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), arising from the incoherent superposition of numerous compact binary coalescences, serves as a powerful probe of both astrophysical populations and fundamental physics. In this work, we investigate the influence of gravitational lensing on the SGWB, focusing on primordial black holes (PBHs) as potential lenses. Assuming PBHs as dark matter candidates with a broad cosmic distribution, we show that their lensing optical depth can be significantly enhanced, producing pronounced effects with relative deviations at the 10^-1 level. By systematically varying the PBH mass (M_PBH) and abundance (f_PBH), we demonstrate that the mass predominantly determines the frequency-dependent diffraction features of the spectrum, while the abundance primarily amplifies the overall lensing-induced deviation. Although the SGWB from binary black holes has not yet been observed, our analytical results provide theoretical insight into the possible imprint of lensing on its spectrum and suggest that future detections could offer a novel avenue to constrain dark matter scenarios.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Exploring observational systematics in cluster cosmology -- a comprehensive analysis of cluster counts and clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of observational and modelling systematic effects on cluster number counts and cluster clustering and provides model prescriptions for their joint analysis, in the context of the \Euclid survey. Using 1000 \Euclid-like cluster catalogues, we investigate the effect of systematic uncertainties on cluster summary statistics and their auto- and cross-covariance, and perform a likelihood analysis to evaluate their impact on cosmological constraints, with a focus on the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and on the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$. Combining cluster clustering with number counts significantly improves cosmological constraints, with the figure of merit increasing by over 300\% compared to number counts alone. We confirm that the two probes are uncorrelated, and the cosmological constraints derived from their combination are almost insensitive to the cosmology dependence of the covariance. We find that photometric redshift uncertainties broaden cosmological posteriors by 20--30\%, while secondary effects like redshift-space distortions (RSDs) have a smaller impact on the posteriors -- 5\% for clustering alone, 10\% when combining probes -- but can significantly bias the constraints if neglected. We show that clustering data below $60\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc provides additional constraining power, while scales larger than acoustic oscillation scale add almost no information on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ parameters. RSDs and photo-$z$ uncertainties also influence the number count covariance, with a significant impact, of about 15--20\%, on the parameter constraints.</description>

      <title>Effects of primordial magnetic fields on 21 cm multifrequency angular power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic 21 cm line signal of neutral hydrogen provides the possibility to constrain the matter power spectrum. Primordial magnetic fields present before decoupling have an effect on the linear matter power spectrum. The redshifted 21 cm line signal is observed at different frequencies allowing to determine multifrequency angular power spectra. These are presented for cosmological models including the adiabatic, primordial curvature mode as well as the compensated magnetic mode for different values of the magnetic field parameters. For multifrequency angular power spectra frequency ranges have been set around central frequencies of uGMRT Band 3 data as well as MeerKAT L band data. For these signal-over-noise ratios are obtained as well as for SKA1-MID which is part of the currently under construction SKAO.</description>

      <title>Density reconstruction from biased tracers: Testing the equivalence principle through consistency relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistency relations of large-scale structure offer a unique and powerful test of the weak equivalence principle (EP) on cosmological scales. If the EP is violated, different tracers will undergo different accelerations in response to a uniform gravitational field, and this loss of universality manifests as a dipole with a characteristic $1/K$ scale dependence in the squeezed limit of the bispectrum. In this work we show that such a violation can be identified with a particular anti-symmetric {modulation} in the local cross-power spectrum of distinct tracers. Based on this observation, we propose to test the EP using quadratic estimators as a more practical alternative to the conventional approach of directly estimating the bispectrum. We apply our quadratic estimator to a DESI-like survey and forecast constraints on the overall amplitude of EP violation. Including mildly nonlinear scales in our reconstruction ($k_\mathrm{max}\simeq0.15\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), we find that our estimator is competitive with the more exhaustive direct bispectrum approach. This means surveys like DESI can already benefit from the quadratic estimator approach.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{SBi3PCF:}$ Simulation-based inference with the integrated 3PCF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $\texttt{SBi3PCF}$, a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework for analysing a higher-order weak lensing statistic, the integrated 3-point correlation function (i3PCF). Our approach forward-models the cosmic shear field using the $\texttt{CosmoGridV1}$ suite of N-body simulations, including a comprehensive set of systematic effects such as intrinsic alignment, baryonic feedback, photometric redshift uncertainty, shear calibration bias, and shape noise. Using this, we have produced a set of DES Y3-like synthetic measurements for 2-point shear correlation functions $\xi_{\pm}$ (2PCFs) and i3PCFs $\zeta_{\pm}$ across 6 cosmological and 11 systematic parameters. Having validated these measurements against theoretical predictions and thoroughly examined for potential systematic biases, we have found that the impact of source galaxy clustering and reduced shear on the i3PCF is negligible for Stage-III surveys. Furthermore, we have tested the Gaussianity assumption for the likelihood of our data vector and found that while the sampling distribution of the 2PCF can be well approximated by a Gaussian function, the likelihood of the combined 2PCF + i3PCF data vector including filter sizes of $90'$ and larger can deviate from this assumption. Our SBI pipeline employs masked autoregressive flows to perform neural likelihood estimation and is validated to give statistically accurate posterior estimates. On mock data, we find that including the i3PCF yields a substantial $63.8\%$ median improvement in the figure of merit for $\Omega_m - \sigma_8 - w_0$. These findings are consistent with previous works on the i3PCF and demonstrate that our SBI framework can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to analyse the i3PCF in wide-area weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Spatial Variations of Polarized Synchrotron Emission in the QUIJOTE MFI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarized synchrotron emission from ultra-relativistic electrons spiraling the Galactic magnetic field has become one of the most relevant emissions in the Interstellar medium these last years due to the improvement in the quality of low-frequency observations. One of the recent experiments designed to explore this emission is the QUIJOTE experiment.
  We aim to study the spatial variations of the synchrotron emission in the QUIJOTE MFI data, by dividing the sky into physically separated regions. For such task, we firstly use a novel component separation method based on artificial neural networks to clean the synchrotron maps. After training the network with simulations, we fit both $EE$ and $BB$ spectra by assuming a power-law model. Then, we give estimations for the index $\alpha_{S}$, the amplitude, and the ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes.
  When analyzing the real data, we found a clear spatial variation of the synchrotron properties along the sky at 11 GHz, obtaining a steeper index in the Galactic plane of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.1 \pm 0.3$ and $\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.1 \pm 0.4$ and a flatter one at high Galactic latitudes of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.05 \pm 0.2$ and $\alpha_{S}^{B} = -2.98 \pm 0.27$. We found average values at all sky of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.04 \pm 0.21$ and $\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.00 \pm 0.34$. Furthermore, after obtaining an average value of $A_{S}^{EE} = 3.31 \pm 0.08$ $\mu K^{2}$ and $A_{S}^{BB} = 0.93 \pm 0.02$ $\mu K^{2}$, we estimate a ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes of $A_{S}^{BB}/A_{S}^{EE} = 0.28 \pm 0.08$.
  Based on the results we conclude that, although neural networks seem to be valuable methods to apply on real ISM observations, combined analyses with Planck, WMAP and/or CBASS data are mandatory to reduce the contamination from QUIJOTE maps and then improve the accuracy of the estimations.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Electron Interactions Alter the Luminosity and Spectral Index of M87</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that cosmic-ray electron cooling through dark matter-electron scatterings contributes to the low radiative efficiency observed in radio-loud galaxies such as M87. Light dark matter can scatter efficiently off electrons in M87, lowering the observed bolometric luminosity compared to astrophysical expectations. This consideration allows us to probe previously unexplored regions of the parameter space of dark matter-electron interactions. We further model the cosmic-ray electron distribution by numerically solving a diffusion equation along the jet and find that efficient dark matter-electron interactions can induce a flattening of the spectral index at different distances from the central supermassive black hole, in better alignment with radio observations from M87.</description>

      <title>Strategy for identifying Vera C. Rubin Observatory kilonova candidates for targeted gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the observation of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and the associated kilonova AT2017gfo, the next joint gravitational-wave/optical kilonova has been highly anticipated. Overlapping observations between the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the international gravitational-wave detector network are expected soon. Wide-field survey facilities, such as Rubin, can serve dual roles in gravitational-wave astronomy: conducting dedicated optical counterpart searches following gravitational-wave triggers and, through surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), providing opportunities for fortuitous kilonova discoveries during routine operations. We use simulations to develop a strategy for identifying kilonova candidates observed by Rubin and processed by the Fink broker. These candidates can be used as astrophysical triggers for a targeted gravitational-wave search. We simulate kilonovae light-curves for the first year of Rubin with the latest observing strategy for the Wide-Fast-Deep and the Deep Drilling Fields. Assuming a kilonova rate of 250 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, we find that Rubin brokers should observe $\sim 4$ kilonovae per year with at least one alert above a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 within the gravitational-wave detector horizon ($\sim 350$ Mpc). Most of these will be faint, and detected 1-2 days following the neutron star merger. Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up will be limited to large telescopes. Using archival data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and our proposed selection criteria, we estimate a minimum contamination of at least 30 events per month from other transients and variables, even under our strictest selection criteria. A deep gravitational-wave search targeting Rubin kilonova candidates may lead to the next multi-messenger discovery.</description>

      <title>Probing the magneto-ionic medium of the Milky Way using pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are fundamental to the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) in spiral galaxies and are often separated into large-scale, regular ($\boldsymbol{B}$) and small-scale, random ($\boldsymbol{b}$) components. The thermal electron density, $n_{\rm e}$, can also be divided into large-scale, diffuse, $\langle n_{\rm e} \rangle$, and small-scale, clumpy, $\delta n_{\rm e}$, components. Estimating the properties of $b$ and $\delta n_{\rm e}$ from observations, even within the Milky Way, has long been challenging. This work addresses the challenge using pulsars, which probe the Milky Way's magneto-ionic medium. Using data of more than 1200 pulsars from the Australia Telescope National Facility pulsar catalogue, we combine dispersion (${\rm DM}$) and rotation (${\rm RM}$) measures with theoretical models to estimate both small- and large-scale properties of the Galactic magnetic field and thermal electron density. We find no significant correlation between the average parallel magnetic field strength, $\langle B_{\parallel} \rangle [\mu{\rm G}] = 1.232\,{\rm RM}\,[{\rm rad\,m^{-2}}]/{\rm DM}\,[{\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}]$, and pulsar distance. For pulsars within $20\,{\rm kpc}$, we estimate $|B| \approx 1.2\,\mu{\rm G}$ and $\langle n_{\rm e} \rangle \approx 0.05\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. More importantly, we determine correlation lengths of small-scale components, $\ell_{b} \approx 20$ -- $30\,{\rm pc}$ and $\ell_{\delta n_{\rm e}} \approx 250$ -- $300\,{\rm pc}$. At smaller distances, $B$ remains roughly constant, while $\langle n_{\rm e} \rangle$ increases and both length scales decrease. These results refine our understanding of fundamental scales in the magneto-ionic medium, aiding the interpretation of extragalactic ${\rm RM}$s and providing insights into the role of magnetic fields in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Protoclusters as Drivers of Cosmic Reionization: I. Bubble Overlap at Redshift z ~ 7 in LAGER-z7OD1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era Lyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing variance at redshift z ~ 7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field fluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we present new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~ 7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and Lyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha damping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard context of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min) = 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral patch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct sub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the nine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a modest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual ionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on an empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling galactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred intergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The errorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our results are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster.</description>

      <title>Some problems associated with the standardization of the light curve of type 1a supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the parameters used to standardize the luminosity of Type 1a supernovae in the SALT2 and SiFTO models are strongly dependent on the redshift z. Consequently, when standardized with increasing z, the average absolute magnitudes of Type 1a supernovae are artificially increased. This means that for a given apparent magnitude they are, on average, assigned larger distances than they actually are, creating the appearance of their recession with acceleration and requiring the introduction of the concept of antigravity (dark energy) to explain it. We also show that after standardization, Type 1a supernovae cease to be standard candles. We therefore argue that such a standardization is not suitable for measuring the distances to Type 1a supernovae, and hence the accelerating expansion of the Universe is called into question.</description>

      <title>Mass and spin coevolution of black holes inspiralling through dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In extreme/intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (E/IMRIs) embedded in dark-matter (DM) spikes, the secondary black hole can accrete collisionless particles from the surrounding halo. We study how the companion's spin controls this process, and the ensuing back-reaction on the magnitude and direction of the companion's spin vector. We find that higher spin suppresses the mass accretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down and secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane. Collisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin correlation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \simeq 2.8$, much larger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely independent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated spin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of rapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor the presence of dense DM environments, providing constraints complementary to those arising from dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>Unified Origin of Dirac Neutrino and Asymmetric Dark Matter Masses via a Dirac-Type Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple and unified framework that simultaneously explains the origins of light Dirac neutrino masses, asymmetric dark matter (ADM), and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. The model is based on an extended $U(1)_X$ Froggatt-Nielsen--like mechanism, which naturally generates suppressed Yukawa couplings and realizes a Dirac seesaw for neutrino masses. An additional $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry stabilizes the dark sector, where chiral fermions charged under $\mathbb{Z}_4$ serve as ADM candidates. Leptogenesis occurs through the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy Dirac neutrinos, where the generated asymmetry is shared between the visible and dark sectors due to exact lepton-number conservation. The same suppression mechanism that explains the smallness of neutrino masses also determines the GeV-scale ADM mass. Numerical studies demonstrate that a fully asymmetric DM scenario is realized, consistent with relic abundance, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and direct detection constraints. This framework provides an experimentally testable connection between neutrino physics, dark matter, and baryogenesis within an anomaly-free setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) are magnetic fields generated during the early universe. These fields are thought to be the seeds of extragalactic magnetic fields. The origin of PMFs is not well known. Further, if they are indeed sources of extragalactic fields, then there is a possibility that observations of extragalactic magnetic fields could provide insights into the primordial physics. With this motivation, we study the generation of the primordial magnetic field in the context of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In LQC, inflation is preceded by a quantum bounce. In this work, we consider an electromagnetic field coupled to the background as a test field and study its evolution through the bounce and through the subsequent inflationary phase. We investigate the power spectra generated in LQC and show that it is scale-dependent. We study the power spectra with different initial conditions, discuss equivalent forms of coupling functions, investigate backreaction, and compute the amount of primordial magnetic field which can be measured today. We conclude the article with a summary and discussion of the results.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity constraints with Planck ISW-lensing bispectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on modified gravity by including the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect from CMB lensing-CMB temperature cross-correlations, based on the latest Planck PR4 maps. Utilizing the Effective Field Theory of dark energy approach and adopting the $w_0w_a$CDM background cosmological model, we find that including the CMB ISW lensing cross-correlations tighten constraints on the modified gravity parameters by approximately $20\%$, reducing the viable parameter space by $40-80\%$. We derive constraints from Planck CMB, Planck and ACT CMB lensing, DESI DR1 BAO, CMB ISW-lensing, and type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data. The constraints on the EFT parameters controlling the kinetic braiding and non-minimal coupling are consistent with General Relativity (GR) at the $95\%$ CL. In particular, we obtain a bound on the kinetic braiding parameter, $c_B &lt; 1.2$ at $95\%$ CL. In the $w_0$-$w_a$ parameter space, our results imply a crossing of the phantom divide, $w=-1$. The modified gravity model shows a mild preference over $\Lambda$CDM at the $1.8\sigma$, $2.6\sigma$ and $3.2\sigma$ levels for the combinations with Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 supernova datasets. We find that using the latest $\texttt{HiLLiPoP}+\texttt{LoLLiPoP}$ likelihoods alleviates the departure of modified gravity parameters from the GR-values compared to results using {\it Planck} 2018 data. This paper underlines the importance of the ISW lensing probe in constraining late-time modifications of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14190v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the dipole anisotropy observed in the quasar distribution from the CatWISE2020 catalog. The catalog data shows a peak around $z\approx 1$, suggesting the presence of a large-scale dipole component. We explore the possibility that this dipole could be driven by primordial density fluctuations from modes that were superhorizon at the time of CMB decoupling but have since entered the horizon and become subhorizon. In particular, we consider the impact of adiabatic modes with wave numbers $k$ in the range $(10^{-4} - 4 \times 10^{-3})~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} $, corresponding to wavelength scales of several Gpc. Such modes can create large-scale density variations, likely causing anisotropies in the distribution of matter and, as a result, affecting the number density of observed quasars. We find that these can lead to a significant contribution to the dipole for sources up to redshifts of about 1, but are unable to explain the observed dipole. We also demonstrate that a superhorizon curvature perturbations mode, with a comoving wavenumber $k\lesssim0.3H_0$ can lead to a significant enhancement in the locally inferred Hubble constant. This effect offers a viable explanation for the observed discrepancy between local and CMB inferred measurements of $H_0$.</description>

      <title>A joint analysis of 3D clustering and galaxy x CMB-lensing cross-correlations with DESI DR1 galaxies</title>

Abstract: The spectroscopic data from DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) galaxies enables the analysis of 3D clustering by fitting galaxy power spectra and reconstructed correlation functions in redshift space. Given low measurements of the amplitude of structure from cosmic shear at $z\sim1$, redshift space distortions (RSD) + Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals from DESI galaxies combined with weak lensing can break degeneracies and provide a tight alternative constraint on the $z\sim1$ amplitude of structure. In this paper we perform joint analyses that combine full-shape + post-reconstruction information from the DESI DR1 BGS and LRG samples along with angular cross-correlations with Planck PR4 and ACT DR6 CMB lensing maps. We show that adding galaxy-lensing cross-correlations tightens clustering amplitude constraints, improving $\sigma_8$ uncertainties by $\sim 40\%$ over RSD+BAO alone. We also include angular galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-lensing spectra using photometric samples from the DESI Legacy Survey to further improve constraints. Our headline results are $\sigma_8 = 0.803\pm 0.017$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.3037\pm 0.0069$, and $S_8 = 0.808\pm 0.017$. Given DESI's preference for higher $\sigma_8$ compared to lower values from BOSS, we perform a catalog-level comparison of LRG samples from both surveys. We test sensitivity to dark energy assumptions by relaxing our $\Lambda$CDM prior and allowing for evolving dark energy via the $w_0-w_a$ parameterization. We find our $S_8$ constraints to be relatively unchanged despite a $~3.5\sigma$ tension with the cosmological constant model when combining with the Union3 supernova likelihood. Finally we test general relativity (GR) by allowing the gravitational slip parameter ($\gamma$) to vary, and find $\gamma = 1.17\pm0.11$ in mild ($\sim1.5\sigma$) tension with the GR value of $1.0$.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of dark energy and late-time cosmic expansion using the Weighted Function Regression method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\sigma$ CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities, examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE. Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim 2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1-2 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10514v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. Our analysis reveals that the predicted value of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ by the DESI DR2 LRG1 and LRG3+ELG1 datapoints deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction and from different supernova compilations. We find that analyzing the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers strongly affects the model predictions especially $\omega_0$, which shifts from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0&gt;-1$, $\omega_a&lt;0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a&lt;-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.</description>

      <title>Mass dependence of halo baryon fractions from the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We detect the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich imprint of peculiar motions of galaxy groups and clusters, using the photometric DESI Legacy Survey together with cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We develop a comprehensive forward model based on the AbacusSummit cosmological simulations: mock galaxy group catalogues and synthetic kSZ maps are generated, together with a reconstructed peculiar velocity field that allows for photo-$z$ errors, redshift-space distortions, and survey masks. We investigate possible contamination from the cosmic infrared background (CIB), finding that CIB effects are subdominant to the kSZ signal in the relevant ACT frequency channel. We then predict the kSZ signal expected when stacking CMB temperature maps around groups, taking account of their estimated radial velocity. Comparing the model with observations, we are able to constrain the total baryon fraction within haloes, as well as their internal gas profiles. We find evidence for mass dependence of the halo baryon fraction within the virial radius. The gas fraction in massive groups is consistent with the universal baryon fraction, but low-mass groups ($10^{12.5} \lesssim M\,/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot \lesssim 10^{14}$) are depleted to $0.21 \pm 0.06$ times the universal baryon fraction. We find this low virial baryon fraction to be consistent with an extended gas profile, for which the total baryon content reaches the universal value well beyond the virial radius. This conclusion is consistent with previous analyses using X-ray, kSZ, and weak lensing, and plausibly reflects energetic feedback processes from the galaxies in these haloes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Production and Baryogenesis in a Simple Left-Right model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The left-right model with the simplest Higgs structure has a $SU(2)_L$ doublet $H_L$, a $SU(2)_R$ doublet $H_R$, and a singlet $\sigma$ that couples to the doublets as $\sigma(|H_L|^2-|H_R|^2)$. The left-right symmetry has $H_L\leftrightarrow H_R$ and $\sigma\leftrightarrow-\sigma$. We study gravitational wave production and baryogenesis in the electroweak phase transitions in the model. For two benchmark points, $\sigma$ first gets a vev, followed by $H_R$ and then $H_L$. An interesting feature is that the vev of $H_L$ is initially much higher than its zero temperature value, leading to a more strongly first-order transition and higher frequency gravitational waves. An unusual benchmark point has the $\sigma$ vev at zero when the electroweak symmetry breaks. This results in both $H_L$ and $H_R$ vevs being equal and in the multi-TeV range. At a lower temperature, the $\sigma$ vev turns on, breaking the left-right symmetry and $H_L$ drops to its standard model value. Since the electroweak symmetry is broken at the multi-TeV scale, the frequency of gravitational waves will be much higher than usual. Baryogenesis is also discussed.</description>

      <title>20 GeV halo-like excess of the Galactic diffuse emission and implications for dark matter annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fifteen years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the halo region of the Milky Way (MW) are analyzed to search for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation. Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \le 60^\circ$, $10^\circ \le |b| \le 60^\circ$) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a spectral peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which contains non-template patches adjusted to match the observed map. The halo excess spectrum can be fitted by annihilation with a particle mass $m_\chi \sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and cross section $\langle \sigma \upsilon \rangle \sim$ (5-8)$\times 10^{-25} \ \rm cm^3 \, s^{-1}$ for the $b\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo'' remains feasible. The prospects for verification through future observations are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Extra-natural production of superheavy Kaluza-Klein particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge fields in extra compact dimensions can drive inflation in the four-dimensional (4D) non-compact spacetime, a scenario known as extra-natural inflation. A time-dependent gauge field configuration generates the electric field along the compact dimension, enabling the production of Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles charged under the field via the Schwinger effect. We construct the extra-natural inflation model within a five-dimensional (5D) quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework coupled to gravity including matter fields that generate the inflationary one-loop effective potential. In general, multiple charged fields can exist, and we show that KK particle production occurs under these conditions. Since KK momentum is conserved, the produced KK particles may become superheavy dark matter or dominate the universe, depending on the model parameters. Furthermore, we show that even when the gauge field acts not as the inflaton but as a spectator field, its post-inflationary oscillations, initiated when the Hubble friction becomes negligible, can also generate superheavy KK modes. This suggests that KK particle production is a generic outcome when gauge potentials along compact dimensions are light.</description>

      <title>Is the $\Lambda$CDM Model in Crisis?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present strong evidence for dynamical dark energy challenging the $\Lambda$CDM model. Several dark energy models are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, and BA, along with non-flat cosmologies accounting for potential spatial curvature. Our analysis supports a flat Universe ($\Omega_k \approx 0$). Using the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm, we analyze data from BAO of DESI DR2, Type Ia Supernovae, and CMB to constrain model parameters. We find strong evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, with deviations from $\Lambda$CDM favoring dynamical dark energy consistent with the Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$). We also derive upper bounds on $\sum m_\nu$ from CMB + DESI DR2. For $\Lambda$CDM we find $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.066~\text{eV}$, while for $\omega$CDM it is $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.075~\text{eV}$. In o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM the limits are $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.263~\text{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.520~\text{eV}$, respectively. For other models, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE, the upper limits range from $&lt; 0.043~\text{eV}$ to $&lt; 0.127~\text{eV}$. Constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\text{eff}}$, remain consistent with the standard value $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.044$ for all models. Bayesian evidence shows that combining DES-SN5Y and Union3 SNe Ia with CMB + DESI DR2 reveals deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, while no model reaches the $5\sigma$ threshold, some show $&gt; 3\sigma$ tensions with DES-SN5YR or Union3, hinting at cracks in the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>MESA-QUEST: Tracing the formation of direct collapse black hole seeds via quasi-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.</description>

      <title>False Alarm Rates in Detecting Gravitational Wave Lensing from Astrophysical Coincidences: Insights with Model-Independent Technique GLANCE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong lensing gravitational waves (GWs) due to intervening massive astrophysical systems between the source and an observer are an inevitable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which can produce multiple GW events in overlapping sky localization error. However, the confirmed detection of such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources of contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties. Robust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise contamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the astrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of unlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR) depending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed astrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have performed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated population of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\sim$ 0.01\% of the event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs of $\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter space of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over which the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW pair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique will be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW detectors, which can observe many more GW sources.</description>
