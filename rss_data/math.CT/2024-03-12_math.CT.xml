      <title>Quotient Category of a Multiring Category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce a tensor structure for the quotient category of an abelian monoidal category with biexact tensor product in order to make the canonical funtor be a monoidal functor. In this tensor product, we prove that the quotient category of a multiring category (resp. a multitensor category) is still a multiring category (resp. a multitensor category).</description>

      <title>Homotopical commutative rings and bispans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that commutative semirings in a cartesian closed presentable $\infty$-category, as defined by Groth, Gepner, and Nikolaus, are equivalent to product-preserving functors from the $(2,1)$-category of bispans of finite sets. In other words, we identify the latter as the Lawvere theory for commutative semirings in the $\infty$-categorical context. This implies that connective commutative ring spectra can be described as grouplike product-preserving functors from bispans of finite sets to spaces. A key part of the proof is a localization result for $\infty$-categories of spans, and more generally for $\infty$-categories with factorization systems, that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Sheaves of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a functorial presentation of the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $(n, r)$-categories for all $-2 \leq n\leq\infty$ and $0 \leq r\leq n+2$ baed on complete Segal space objects. In this definition, the equivalences of sheaves of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories are defined inductively, so we also provide a localisation at the coinductive equivalences to define the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $\omega$-categories as well. We prove that the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories and the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $\omega$-categories both define distributors over the underlying topos of sheaves of spaces. Moreover, we show that these distributors define terminal and initial fixed points with respect to the construction of complete Segal space objects in a distributor. We conclude with a sheafification result: the category of sheaves of $(n, r)$-categories over a site $\mathscr{C}$ can be presented as a strongly reflective localisation of $\mathbf{Fun}(\mathscr{C}^{\mathrm{op}}, \mathbf{Cat}_{(n, r)})$, where the localisation functor preserves fibre products over $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathscr{C})$, with the analogous result also holding for sheaves of $\omega$-categories.</description>

      <title>A Compositional Framework for First-Order Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization decomposition methods are a fundamental tool to develop distributed solution algorithms for large scale optimization problems arising in fields such as machine learning and optimal control. In this paper, we present an algebraic framework for hierarchically composing optimization problems defined on hypergraphs and automatically generating distributed solution algorithms that respect the given hierarchical structure. The central abstractions of our framework are operads, operad algebras, and algebra morphisms, which formalize notions of syntax, semantics, and structure preserving semantic transformations respectively. These abstractions allow us to formally relate composite optimization problems to the distributed algorithms that solve them. Specifically, we show that certain classes of optimization problems form operad algebras, and a collection of first-order solution methods, namely gradient descent, Uzawa's algorithm (also called gradient ascent-descent), and their subgradient variants, yield algebra morphisms from these problem algebras to algebras of dynamical systems. Primal and dual decomposition methods are then recovered by applying these morphisms to certain classes of composite problems. Using this framework, we also derive a novel sufficient condition for when a problem defined by compositional data is solvable by a decomposition method. We show that the minimum cost network flow problem satisfies this condition, thereby allowing us to automatically derive a hierarchical dual decomposition algorithm for finding minimum cost flows on composite flow networks. We implement our operads, algebras, and algebra morphisms in a Julia package called AlgebraicOptimization.jl and use our implementation to empirically demonstrate that hierarchical dual decomposition outperforms standard dual decomposition on classes of flow networks with hierarchical structure.</description>

      <title>Weakly globular double categories and weak units</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.11180v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly globular double categories are a model of weak $2$-categories based on the notion of weak globularity, and they are known to be suitably equivalent to Tamsamani $2$-categories. Fair $2$-categories, introduced by J. Kock, model weak $2$-categories with strictly associative compositions and weak unit laws. In this paper we establish a direct comparison between weakly globular double categories and fair $2$-categories and prove they are equivalent after localisation with respect to the $2$-equivalences. This comparison sheds new light on weakly globular double categories as encoding a strictly associative, though not strictly unital, composition, as well as the category of weak units via the weak globularity condition.</description>

      <title>Internal sums for synthetic fibered $(\infty,1)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give structural results about bifibrations of (internal) $(\infty,1)$-categories with internal sums. This includes a higher version of Moens' Theorem, characterizing cartesian bifibrations with extensive aka stable and disjoint internal sums over lex bases as Artin gluings of lex functors.
  We also treat a generalized version of Moens' Theorem due to Streicher which does not require the Beck--Chevalley condition.
  Furthermore, we show that also in this setting the Moens fibrations can be characterized via a condition due to Zawadowski.
  Our account overall follows Streicher's presentation of fibered category theory \`{a} la B\'{e}nabou, generalizing the results to the internal, higher-categorical case, formulated in a synthetic setting.
  Namely, we work inside simplicial homotopy type theory, which has been introduced by Riehl and Shulman as a logical system to reason about internal $(\infty,1)$-categories, interpreted as Rezk objects in any given Grothendieck--Rezk--Lurie $(\infty,1)$-topos.</description>

      <title>Homotopy type theory as internal languages of diagrams of $\infty$-logoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that certain diagrams of $\infty$-logoses are reconstructed in internal languages of their oplax limits via lex, accessible modalities, which enables us to use plain homotopy type theory to reason about not only a single $\infty$-logos but also a diagram of $\infty$-logoses. This also provides a higher dimensional version of Sterling's synthetic Tait computability -- a type theory for higher dimensional logical relations. To prove the main result, we establish a precise correspondence between the lex, accessible localizations of an $\infty$-logos and the lex, accessible modalities in the internal language of the $\infty$-logos. To do this, we also partly develop the Kripke-Joyal semantics of homotopy type theory in $\infty$-logoses.</description>

      <title>Modeling Model Predictive Control: A Category Theoretic Framework for Multistage Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is an optimal control technique which involves solving a sequence of constrained optimization problems across a given time horizon. In this paper, we introduce a category theoretic framework for constructing complex MPC problem formulations by composing subproblems. Specifically, we construct a monoidal category - called Para(Conv) - whose objects are Euclidean spaces and whose morphisms represent constrained convex optimization problems. We then show that the multistage structure of typical MPC problems arises from sequential composition in Para(Conv), while parallel composition can be used to model constraints across multiple stages of the prediction horizon. This framework comes equipped with a rigorous, diagrammatic syntax, allowing for easy visualization and modification of complex problems. Finally, we show how this framework allows a simple software realization in the Julia programming language by integrating with existing mathematical programming libraries to provide high-level, graphical abstractions for MPC.</description>

      <title>Parabolic induction in the homotopy category of pro-$p$ Iwahori-Hecke modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be the group of rational points of a split connected reductive group over a non-archimedean local field of residue characteristic $p$, and let $\mathcal{H}$ denote the pro-$p$ Iwahori-Hecke algebra of $G$ over a field of characteristic $p$. We study the parabolic induction functor for $\mathcal{H}$-modules in terms of the Gorenstein projective model structures introduced by Hovey. Let $\text{Ho}(\mathcal{H})$ denote the associated homotopy category of this model structure. We show that $\text{Ho}(\mathcal{H})$ and its thick subcategory generated by the essential images of finitely many parabolic induction functors are related via a recollement of triangulated categories. We then investigate the isomorphism classes of simple $\mathcal{H}$-modules in $\text{Ho}(\mathcal{H})$ and give a complete classification for simple supersingulars when $G=\mathrm{GL}_n$.</description>
