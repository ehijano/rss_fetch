      <title>Planning sustainable carbon neutrality pathways: accounting challenges experienced by organizations and solutions from industrial ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose : Planning a transition towards sustainable carbon neutrality at the organization level raises several accounting challenges. This paper aims to shed light on key challenges, highlight answers from current accounting standards and guidance, point out potential inconsistencies or limits, and outline potential solutions from the industrial ecology community through systemic environmental assessment tools, such as life cycle assessment (LCA) and environmentally-extended input-output (EEIO) analysis.
  Results and discussion: We propose a Measure-Reduce-Neutralize-Control sequence allowing organizations to plan their sustainable net-zero strategy, and discuss 24 accounting challenges occurring within this sequence. We then outline ways forward for organizations planning their carbon neutrality trajectory, pointing to existing resources, and for guidelines providers and the industrial ecology communities to address current limitations in the development of future accounting methods and guidelines. Overarching solutions to many accounting issues are to develop comprehensive, open-source, and high-quality life cycle inventory databases, to enable improved dynamic assessments and prospective LCA through integrated assessment models, to refine methods for assessing mineral scarcity and environmental impacts, the supply in some metals being expected to be a bottleneck to the energy transition, and to identify the appropriate climate metrics for planning sustainable carbon neutrality pathways at the organizational level.</description>

      <title>Understanding the environmental impacts of virgin aggregates: critical literature review and primary comprehensive Life Cycle Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the ever-growing massive consumption of aggregates, knowledge about their environmental footprint is limited. My literature review on virgin aggregate Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) highlighted many shortcomings, such as low-quality inputs and fragmented system boundaries, and estimated that gravel consumption is responsible for 0.17 to 1.8 percent of the global carbon footprint. I thus developed comprehensive LCAs, based on field data collected from quarries in Quebec producing annually 7 million tons of aggregates, representing different types of rocks, productions (mobile, fixed), and energies consumed, using ecoinvent 3.7 and TRACI characterization method. Results show that the often-forgotten blasting and machinery are major contributors to several impact categories, along with diesel consumption. The link between the nature of the rock and the environmental impacts of aggregates is demonstrated for the first time: the harder it is, the more exposive it requires, thus increasing the impacts. Moreover, the more abrasive the rock is, the faster it wears out machinery, generating higher maintenance that increases human and ecosystem toxicities. A pronounced sensitivity of the impacts to the electricity mix is also shown based on a scenario analysis carried on Europe, China, and different Canadian and American regions. Additionally, aggregate transportation to the consumer, modeled with tailored inventories, can more than double the impact of the aggregate at the gates of the quarry, with strong regional variability. In a near future, I call for considering consistent system boundaries in aggregate LCA, refining blasting, energy consumption, machinery manufacturing and maintenance, as well as customizing truck transportation models, for more reliable aggregate LCAs.</description>

      <title>A life cycle model for high-speed rail infrastructure: environmental inventories and assessment of the Tours-Bordeaux railway in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Method: a process-based LCA compliant with ISO 14040 and 14044 is performed. Construction stage LCIs rely on data collection conducted with the concessionaire of the HSR line combined with EcoInvent 3.1 inventories. Use and End-of-Life stages LCIs rest on expert feedback scenarios and field data. A set of 13 midpoint indicators is proposed to capture the diversity of the environmental damage: climate change, consumptions of primary energy and non-renewable resources, human toxicity and ecotoxicities, eutrophication, acidification, radioactive and bulk wastes, stratospheric ozone depletion and summer smog. Results: The study shows major contributions to environmental impact from rails (10-71%), roadbed (3-48%), and civil engineering structures (4-28%). More limited impact is noted from ballast (1-22%), building machines (0-17%), sleepers (4-11%), and power supply system (2-12%). The two last components, chairs and fasteners, have negligible impact (max. 1% and 3% of total contributions, respectively). Direct transportation can contribute up to 18% of total impact. The production and maintenance stages contribute roughly equally to environmental deterioration (resp. average of 62% and 59%). Because the End-of-Life (EoL) mainly includes recycling with environmental credit accounted for in our 100:100 approach, this stage has globally a positive impact (-9 to -98%) on all the impact categories except terrestrial ecotoxicity (58%), radioactive waste (11%) and ozone depletion (8%). Contribution analyses show that if concrete production is one of the important contributing process over the construction stage, primary steel production is unquestionably the most important process on all the impact categories over the entire life cycle.</description>

      <title>Advancing a responsible future quantum internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the status of the development of a responsible future quantum internet (QI). Through horizon scanning, domain expert trend analysis and guided workshops, we present a desired future (DF) conceptualized by stakeholders within the scope of the ethical, legal, societal aspects (ELSA) and policy implications (ELSPI) of the QI. We examine the alignment of the present situation and the DF of the QI ELSPI to the ideals of the 'ten principles for responsible quantum innovation' developed by [Mauritz Kop et al. 2024 Quantum Sci. Technol. 9 035013]. Most principles in the DF are well aligned to the ideal, except for the misalignment in 'intellectual property' (IP) and 'dual use', revealing the precarious balance of well intended policy suggestions and effective outcomes. Additionally, there is an overemphasis placed on the principal of societal relevance in the DF, risking overseeing other principles in the future steering of the ELSPI. The present situation is in moderate alignment with the principles, however trending to misalignment on IP and international collaboration due to QI commercialization and the push for geopolitical sovereignty. For continued success of a responsible quantum internet, we recommend further investigation on the prevention of dual use quantum internet applications, closer involvement of commercial entities in ELSPI ideation, continued recognition of base-layer technology research and stakeholder education on QI applications.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulations of Infection Spread in Indoor Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of infection spread in populations has received popular attention since the outbreak of Covid-19 and many statistical models have been developed. One of the interesting areas of research is short-time dynamics in confined, indoor environments. We have modeled this using a simple Monte Carlo scheme. Our model is generally applicable for the peer-to-peer transmission case, when the infection spread occurs only between an infected subject and a healthy subject with a certain probability, i.e., airborne and surface transmission is neglected. The probability of infection spread is incorporated using a simple exponential decay with distance between the subjects. Simulations are performed for the cases of (1) constant subject population and (2) variable subject population due to inflow/outflow. We specifically focus on the large fluctuations in the dynamics due to finite number of subjects. Results of our study may be useful to determine social-distancing guidelines in indoor contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to contextualise the current situation of gender inequality in the Brazilian society and, in particular, in science, and to show actions that try to minimise this situation and support girls who want to become scientists and women who are already in their careers. Historical and current data on the Brazilian reality are highlighted and show that social mishaps cannot be ignored and that the barriers faced by female science students, especially in the so-called STEM areas (hard sciences, technology, engineering and maths), can be a source of dropout. Some specific awards for female researchers are mentioned and projects that aim to show the challenges of the career and inspire future scientists are listed. The lack of gender equality must be a source of recurring discussions in academic environments and the obstacles faced by under-represented groups must be remembered and confronted if we want to move towards a fairer and more diverse Brazilian science.</description>

      <title>A New Generation of Energy-Economy Modeling at the U.S. Energy Information Administration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the rapid pace of energy system development, the time has come to reimagine the U.S. Government's capability to model the long-term evolution of the domestic and global energy system. As a primary custodian of these capabilities, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is embarking on the development of a long-term, modular, flexible, transparent, and robust modeling framework that can capture the key dynamics driving the energy system and economy under a wide range of future scenarios. This new capability will leverage the current state of the art in modeling to produce critical insight for researchers, decision makers, and the public. We describe the evolving demands on energy-economy modeling, the capacity and limitations of existing models, and the key features we see as necessary for addressing these demands in our new framework, which is under active development.</description>

      <title>Observing cities as a complex system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities are some of the most intricate and advanced creations of humanity. Most objects in cities are perfectly synchronised to coordinate activities like jobs, education, transportation, entertainment or waste management. Although each city has its characteristics, some commonalities can be observed across most cities, like issues related to noise, pollution, segregation and others. Further, some of these issues might be accentuated in larger or smaller cities. For example, with more people, a city might experience more competition for space so rents would be higher. The urban scaling theory gives a framework to analyse cities in the context of their size. New data for analysing urban scaling theory allow an understanding of how urban metrics change with their population size, whether they apply across most regions or if patterns correspond only to some country or region. Yet, reducing a city and all its complexity into a single indicator might simplify urban areas to an extent where their disparities and variations are overlooked. Often, the differences between the living conditions in different parts of the same city are bigger than the degree of variation observed between cities. For example, in terms of rent or crime, within-city variations might be more significant than between cities. Here, we review some urban scaling principles and explore ways to analyse variations within the same city.</description>

      <title>Meteorological assessment of vertical axis wind turbine energy generation potentials across two Swiss cities in complex terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind energy is the most mature renewable energy technology, however, its exploitation in cities is often met with skepticism. Thanks to their ability to operate effectively at low wind from any direction, vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) offer an attractive opportunity for wind energy harvesting in cities, but limited evidence exists on their potential in complex urban environments, and the role of different geographical settings, local meteorological conditions, and urban characteristics remains unclear. Here we use realistic Weather Research and Forecast model high-resolution wind speed simulations alongside representative VAWT power curves to quantify the range of micro-generation potentials at the annual, seasonal, and diurnal scale across two Swiss cities (Lausanne and Geneva) residing in complex terrain. Our results show that Lausanne generally experiences higher (+24%) wind speed than Geneva. Both cities present the greatest micro-generation potential during the summer months, although Lausanne shows non-negligible potential also during the wintertime. Wind speed is higher during the nighttime in Lausanne and during the daytime in Geneva, due to the different interaction between the local lake-breeze circulation and the synoptic flow. Simulated performance of case-study VAWTs is dominated by cut-in wind speed and power curve inflection point. On average, in 2022, an individual VAWT would have produced 2665 kWh of total annual electricity, equivalent to 16.5 square meters of photovoltaic panels. These results highlight the need for research on urban wind energy featuring detailed city-scale assessments that account for urban heterogeneities and regional circulation patters, to inform future planning investment and engineering development.</description>

      <title>Zero-determinant strategies in repeated continuously-relaxed games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed extension has played an important role in game theory, especially in the proof of the existence of Nash equilibria in strategic form games. Mixed extension can be regarded as continuous relaxation of a strategic form game. Recently, in repeated games, a class of behavior strategies, called zero-determinant strategies, was introduced. Zero-determinant strategies unilaterally enforce linear relations between payoffs, and are used to control payoffs of players. There are many attempts to extend zero-determinant strategies so as to apply them to broader situations. Here, we extend zero-determinant strategies to repeated games where action sets of players in stage game are continuously relaxed. We see that continuous relaxation broadens the range of possible zero-determinant strategies, compared to the original repeated games. Furthermore, we introduce a special type of zero-determinant strategies, called one-point zero-determinant strategies, which repeat only one continuously-relaxed action in all rounds. By investigating several examples, we show that some property of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria can be reinterpreted as a payoff-control property of one-point zero-determinant strategies.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework to explain non-Nash equilibrium strategic behavior in experimental games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional game theory assumes that players are perfectly rational. In a realistic situation, however, players are rarely perfectly rational. This bounded rationality is one of the main reasons why the predictions of Nash equilibrium in normative game theory often diverge from human behavior in real experiments. Motivated by the Boltzmann weight formalism, here we present a theoretical framework to predict the non-Nash equilibrium probabilities of possible outcomes in strategic games by focusing on the differences in expected payoffs of players rather than traditional utility metrics. In this model, bounded rationality is parameterized by assigning a temperature to each player, reflecting their level of rationality by interpolating between two decision-making regimes, i.e., utility maximization and equiprobable choices. Our framework predicts all possible joint strategies and is able to determine the relative probabilities for multiple pure or mixed strategy equilibria. To validate model predictions, by analyzing experimental data we demonstrated that our model can successfully explain non-Nash equilibrium strategic behavior in experimental games. Our approach reinterprets the concept of temperature in game theory, leveraging the development of theoretical frameworks to bridge the gap between the predictions of normative game theory and the results of behavioral experiments.</description>

      <title>Explosive opinion spreading with polarization and depolarization via asymmetric perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization significantly influences societal divisions across economic, political, religious, and ideological lines. Understanding these mechanisms is key to devising strategies to mitigate such divisions and promote depolarization. Our study examines how asymmetric opinion perception, modeled through nonlinear incidence terms, affects polarization and depolarization within structured communities. We demonstrate that such asymmetry leads to explosive polarization and causes a hysteresis effect responsible for abrupt depolarization. We develop a mean-field approximation to explain how nonlinear incidence results in first-order phase transitions and the nature of bifurcations. This approach also helps in understanding how opinions polarize according to underlying social network communities and how these phenomena intertwine with the nature of such transitions. Numerical simulations corroborate the analytical findings.</description>

      <title>Societal citations undermine the function of the science reward system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Citations in the scientific literature system do not simply reflect relationships between knowledge but are influenced by non-objective and societal factors. Citation bias, irresponsible citation, and citation manipulation are widespread and have become a serious and growing problem. However, it has been difficult to assess the consequences of mixing societal factors into the literature system because there was no observable literature system unmixed with societal factors for comparison. In this paper, we construct a mathematical theorem network, representing a logic-based and objective knowledge system, to address this problem. By comparing the mathematical theorem network and the scientific citation networks, we find that these two types of networks are significantly different in their structure and function. In particular, the reward function in citation networks is impaired: The scientific citation network fails to provide more recognition for more disruptive results, while the mathematical theorem network can achieve. We develop a network generation model that can create two types of links$\unicode{x2014}$logical and societal$\unicode{x2014}$to account for these differences. The model parameter $q$, which we call the human influence factor, can control the number of societal links and thus regulate the degree of mixing of societal factors in the networks. Under this design, the model successfully reproduces the differences among real networks. These results suggest that the presence of societal factors undermines the function of the scientific reward system. To improve the status quo, we advocate for reforming the reference list format in papers, urging journals to require authors to separately disclose logical references and social references.</description>

This paper introduces Laplacian Eigenvector Centrality (LEC), a novel framework for network analysis based on spectral graph theory and the eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix. A distinctive feature of LEC is its adjustable parameter, the LEC order, which enables researchers to control and assess the scope of centrality measurement using the Laplacian spectrum. Using random graph models, LEC demonstrates robustness and scalability across diverse network structures. We connect LEC to equilibrium responses to external shocks in an economic model, showing how LEC quantifies agents' roles in attenuating shocks and facilitating coordinated responses through quadratic optimization. Finally, we apply LEC to the study of microfinance diffusion, illustrating how it complements classical centrality measures, such as eigenvector and Katz-Bonacich centralities, by capturing distinctive aspects of node positions within the network.</description>

Abstract: Following the emergence of quantum computing, the subsequent quantum revolution will be that of interconnecting individual quantum computers at global level. In the same way that classical computers only realised their full potential with the emergence of the internet, a fully realised quantum internet is the next stage of evolution for quantum computation. This work examines in detail how the quantum internet would evolve in practice, focusing not only on the technology itself but also on the implications it will have economically and politically. We present both original ideas, as well as an extensive review of relevant and related background material. This work begins with a description of classical networks before introducing the key concepts behind quantum networks, such as quantum internet protocols, quantum cryptography, and cloud quantum computing. The work is divided into technical sections (requiring only a basic knowledge of the notation of quantum mechanics), for those interested in mathematical details, as well as non-technical sections for those seeking a more general understanding. We target this work very broadly at quantum and classical computer scientists, classical computer systems, software and network engineers, physicists, economists, artists, musicians, and those just generally curious about the future of quantum technologies and what they might bring to humanity.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics in bounded confidence models with manipulative agents: Moving the Overton window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the opinion dynamics under the influence of manipulative agents. This type of agents is characterized by the fact that their opinions follow a trajectory that does not respond to the dynamics of the model, although it does influence the rest of the normal agents. Simulation has been implemented to study how one manipulative group modifies the natural dynamics of some opinion models of bounded confidence. It is studied what strategies based on the number of manipulative agents and their common opinion trajectory can be carried out by a manipulative group to influence normal agents and attract them to their opinions. In certain weighted models, some effects are observed in which normal agents move in the opposite direction to the manipulator group. Moreover, the conditions which ensure the influence of a manipulative group on a group of normal agents over time are also established for the Hegselmann-Krause model.</description>

      <title>Critical fragility in socio-technical systems</title>

Abstract: Socio-technical systems, where technological and human elements interact in a goal-oriented manner, provide important functional support to our societies. Here we draw attention to the underappreciated concept of timeliness -- i.e., system elements being available at the right place at the right time -- that has been ubiquitously and integrally adopted as a quality standard in the \textit{modus operandi\/} of socio-technical systems. We point out that a variety of incentives, often reinforced by competitive pressures, prompt system operators to myopically optimize for efficiencies, running the risk of inadvertently taking timeliness to the limit of its operational performance, correspondingly making the system critically fragile to perturbations by pushing the entire system towards the proverbial `edge of a cliff'. Invoking a stylized model for operational delays, we identify the limiting operational performance of timeliness, as a true critical point, where the smallest of perturbations can lead to a systemic collapse. Specifically for firm-to-firm production networks, we suggest that the proximity to \textit{critical fragility\/} is an important ingredient for understanding the fundamental ``excess volatility puzzle'' in economics. Further, in generality for optimizing socio-technical systems, we propose that critical fragility is a crucial aspect in managing the trade-off between efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>A call for frugal modelling: two case studies involving molecular spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13618v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of $&gt;4$ orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of $\simeq 50$. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.</description>

      <title>Webpage Views as a Proxy for Angler Pressure and Effort: Insights from Bayesian Networks</title>

Abstract: Reliable angler activity data inform fisheries management. Traditionally, such data are gathered through surveys, but an innovative cost-effective approach involves utilizing online platforms and smartphone applications. These citizen-sourced data were reported to correlate with conventional survey information. However, the nature of this correlation--whether direct or mediated by intermediate variables--remains unclear. We applied BNs to data from conventional surveys, the Angler's Atlas website, the MyCatch smartphone application, and environmental data across Alberta and Ontario, Canada, to detect probabilistic dependencies. Using Bayesian model averaging, we quantified the strength of connections between variables. Waterbody webpage views were directly related to daily and weekly-aggregated boat counts in Ontario (51\% and 100\% probability) and to weekly-aggregated creel survey-reported fishing duration in Alberta (100\%). This highlights the value of citizen-sourced data in providing unique insights beyond meteorological factors, with online interest serving as a potentially reliable proxy for angler pressure and effort.</description>

      <title>Controlling noisy herds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling multi-agent systems is a persistent challenge in organismal, robotic and social collectives, especially when agents exhibit stochastic indecisiveness -- frequently switching between conflicting behavioral rules. Here, we investigate the control of such noisy indecisive collectives through the lens of century-old sheepdog trials, where small groups of sheep exhibit unpredictable switching between fleeing and following behaviors. Unlike cohesive large flocks, these small indecisive groups are difficult to control, yet skilled dog-handler teams excel at both herding and precisely splitting them (shedding) on demand. Using a stochastic model, we introduce two central parameters -- pressure (stimulus intensity) and lightness (response isotropy) -- to simulate and quantify herding and shedding dynamics. Surprisingly, we find that stochastic indecisiveness, typically perceived as a challenge, can be leveraged as a critical tool for efficient control, enabling controlled herding and splitting of noisy groups. Building on these insights, we develop the Indecisive Swarm Algorithm (ISA) for artificial agents and benchmark its performance against standard algorithms, including the Averaging-Based Swarm Algorithm (ASA) and the Leader-Follower Swarm Algorithm (LFSA). ISA minimizes control energy in trajectory-following tasks, outperforming alternatives under noisy conditions. By framing these results within a stochastic temporal network framework, we show that even with a probabilistic description of the future dynamics, network restructuring (temporality) enhances control efficiency in a specific class of control problems. These insights establish a scalable framework for controlling noisy, behavior-switching collectives, with applications in swarm robotics, cellular engineering, opinion dynamics, and temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Beautimeter: Harnessing GPT for Assessing Architectural and Urban Beauty based on the 15 Properties of Living Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beautimeter is a new tool powered by generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technology, designed to evaluate architectural and urban beauty. Rooted in Christopher Alexander's theory of centers, this work builds on the idea that all environments possess, to varying degrees, an innate sense of life. Alexander identified 15 fundamental properties, such as levels of scale and thick boundaries, that characterize living structure, which Beautimeter uses as a basis for its analysis. By integrating GPT's advanced natural language processing capabilities, Beautimeter assesses the extent to which a structure embodies these 15 properties, enabling a nuanced evaluation of architectural and urban aesthetics. Using ChatGPT, the tool helps users generate insights into the perceived beauty and coherence of spaces. We conducted a series of case studies, evaluating images of architectural and urban environments, as well as carpets, paintings, and other artifacts. The results demonstrate Beautimeter's effectiveness in analyzing aesthetic qualities across diverse contexts. Our findings suggest that by leveraging GPT technology, Beautimeter offers architects, urban planners, and designers a powerful tool to create spaces that resonate deeply with people. This paper also explores the implications of such technology for architecture and urban design, highlighting its potential to enhance both the design process and the assessment of built environments.

      <title>Topological analysis of brain dynamical signals indicates signatures of seizure susceptibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epilepsy is known to drastically alter brain dynamics during seizures (ictal periods), but its effects on background (non-ictal) brain dynamics remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we analyzed an in-house dataset of brain activity recordings from epileptic zebrafish, focusing on two controlled genetic conditions across two fishlines. After using machine learning to segment and label recordings, we applied time-delay embedding and Persistent Homology -- a noise-robust method from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) -- to uncover topological patterns in brain activity. We find that ictal and non-ictal periods can be distinguished based on the topology of their dynamics, independent of genetic condition or fishline, which validates our approach. Remarkably, within a single wild-type fishline, we identified topological differences in non-ictal periods between seizure-prone and seizure-free individuals. These findings suggest that epilepsy leaves detectable topological signatures in brain dynamics even outside of ictal periods. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of TDA as a quantitative framework to screen for topological markers of epileptic susceptibility, with potential applications across species.</description>

      <title>Structural Changes and Percolation Transition in Networks after Aging Processes</title>

Abstract: In social networking services, users constantly change, and the network structure changes simultaneously. As the network structure changes, so does the word-of-mouth within it. To study how information transfer on the network changes with the aging of the network, we investigated the relation of the structure and the percolation in the aged networks. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barab\'{a}si model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We introduced two tunable parameters, the deleting parameter $\alpha$ and the adding parameter $\beta$, and observed the aging behavior for the various parameter sets. We found that the network did not reach its steady state depending on the parameters. We also found that when the network is stable, there is a parameter region where the degree distribution changes from power-law to exponential decay. We performed the percolation analyses and found that the behavior of the percolation probability changes simultaneously with changes in the network's structure. This study is expected to help control network structure in steady-state aged networks.</description>

      <title>The Norwegian-Polish CCS Network: A Case Study in Bilateral Collaboration for European Climate Action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the face of escalating climate change, achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from hard-to-abate industrial sectors is imperative. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) represents an essential technological advancement to achieve sustainable decarbonization. This manuscript reports on the bilateral CCS network between Norway and Poland, designed and implemented to leverage their capabilities to expedite technology deployment via mutual cooperation and accelerate CCS initiatives targeted to member states' challenges across Europe, aiming for a meaningful contribution to climate goals. Norway is renowned for its operational acumen, as demonstrated by landmark projects like Sleipner and Snohvit, and its forward-looking initiatives, such as the open-source cross-border Northern Lights project, which offer advanced infrastructure and expertise. Conversely, Poland, characterized by its coal-dependent economy and the challenge of decarbonizing extensive industrial emissions, presents a significant geological CO2 storage potential, estimated at over 15.5 gigatonnes. This study delves into the potential synergies derived from collaborative endeavors in academic education, research and development, industrial implementation, regulatory coherence, and public engagement. By underscoring the reciprocal benefits of such partnership, the study underscores the indispensable role of bilateral cooperation in harnessing CCS's capabilities to meet the EU's ambitious climate objectives, paving the way toward a sustainable and low-carbon future. Additionally, it outlines a scalable model for fostering and supporting broader bilateral and multi-lateral collaborations, emphasizing the pivotal role of interconnected networks in shaping effective global climate action strategies.</description>

      <title>Network compression with configuration models and the minimum description length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random network models, constrained to reproduce specific statistical features, are often used to represent and analyze network data and their mathematical descriptions. Chief among them, the configuration model constrains random networks by their degree distribution and is foundational to many areas of network science. However, configuration models and their variants are often selected based on intuition or mathematical and computational simplicity rather than on statistical evidence. To evaluate the quality of a network representation, we need to consider both the amount of information required to specify a random network model and the probability of recovering the original data when using the model as a generative process. To this end, we calculate the approximate size of network ensembles generated by the popular configuration model and its generalizations, including versions accounting for degree correlations and centrality layers. We then apply the minimum description length principle as a model selection criterion over the resulting nested family of configuration models. Using a dataset of over 100 networks from various domains, we find that the classic Configuration Model is generally preferred on networks with an average degree above ten, while a Layered Configuration Model constrained by a centrality metric offers the most compact representation of the majority of sparse networks.</description>
