      <title>LLM Content Moderation and User Satisfaction: Evidence from Response Refusals in Chatbot Arena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM safety and ethical alignment are widely discussed, but the impact of content moderation on user satisfaction remains underexplored. To address this, we analyze nearly 50,000 Chatbot Arena response-pairs using a novel fine-tuned RoBERTa model, that we trained on hand-labeled data to disentangle refusals due to ethical concerns from other refusals due to technical disabilities or lack of information. Our findings reveal a significant refusal penalty on content moderation, with users choosing ethical-based refusals roughly one-fourth as often as their preferred LLM response compared to standard responses. However, the context and phrasing play critical roles: refusals on highly sensitive prompts, such as illegal content, achieve higher win rates than less sensitive ethical concerns, and longer responses closely aligned with the prompt perform better. These results emphasize the need for nuanced moderation strategies that balance ethical safeguards with user satisfaction. Moreover, we find that the refusal penalty is notably lower in evaluations using the LLM-as-a-Judge method, highlighting discrepancies between user and automated assessments.</description>

      <title>A Decision-Based Heterogenous Graph Attention Network for Multi-Class Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A promising tool for addressing fake news detection is Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, most existing GNN-based methods rely on binary classification, categorizing news as either real or fake. Additionally, traditional GNN models use a static neighborhood for each node, making them susceptible to issues like over-squashing. In this paper, we introduce a novel model named Decision-based Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (DHGAT) for fake news detection in a semi-supervised setting. DHGAT effectively addresses the limitations of traditional GNNs by dynamically optimizing and selecting the neighborhood type for each node in every layer. It represents news data as a heterogeneous graph where nodes (news items) are connected by various types of edges. The architecture of DHGAT consists of a decision network that determines the optimal neighborhood type and a representation network that updates node embeddings based on this selection. As a result, each node learns an optimal and task-specific computational graph, enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of the fake news detection process. We evaluate DHGAT on the LIAR dataset, a large and challenging dataset for multi-class fake news detection, which includes news items categorized into six classes. Our results demonstrate that DHGAT outperforms existing methods, improving accuracy by approximately 4% and showing robustness with limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preference Enabled Graph Embedding Generation under Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph embedding generation techniques aim to learn low-dimensional vectors for each node in a graph and have recently gained increasing research attention. Publishing low-dimensional node vectors enables various graph analysis tasks, such as structural equivalence and link prediction. Yet, improper publication opens a backdoor to malicious attackers, who can infer sensitive information of individuals from the low-dimensional node vectors. Existing methods tackle this issue by developing deep graph learning models with differential privacy (DP). However, they often suffer from large noise injections and cannot provide structural preferences consistent with mining objectives. Recently, skip-gram based graph embedding generation techniques are widely used due to their ability to extract customizable structures. Based on skip-gram, we present SE-PrivGEmb, a structure-preference enabled graph embedding generation under DP. For arbitrary structure preferences, we design a unified noise tolerance mechanism via perturbing non-zero vectors. This mechanism mitigates utility degradation caused by high sensitivity. By carefully designing negative sampling probabilities in skip-gram, we theoretically demonstrate that skip-gram can preserve arbitrary proximities, which quantify structural features in graphs. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under structural equivalence and link prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Is social media hindering or helping Academic Performance? A case study of Walter Sisulu University Buffalo City Campus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms are popular among higher education students and have seen increased usage for academic purposes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, excessive use of social media can negatively impact students' academic performance. This preliminary study examines social media's impact on students' academic performance at Walter Sisulu University (WSU), Buffalo City campus. Using a positivist paradigm and a quantitative approach, randomly sampled data were collected from 71 students through a survey to identify trends and generate preliminary insights. Results indicate that while social media can facilitate academic work, it predominantly acts as a distraction, negatively affecting academic performance, particularly for first-year students. Notably, 84.5% of the students spend more than four hours daily on social media, and 39.4% agree that it negatively impacts their assignment completion. The study underscores the need for students to balance their social media use and academic responsibilities, highlighting the importance of this issue. Recommendations for achieving this balance, such as adopting time management strategies and integrating social media into teaching methodologies, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Deep Overlapping Community Search via Subspace Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Overlapping Community Search (OCS) identifies nodes that interact with multiple communities based on a specified query. Existing community search approaches fall into two categories: algorithm-based models and Machine Learning-based (ML) models. Despite the long-standing focus on this topic within the database domain, current solutions face two major limitations: 1) Both approaches fail to address personalized user requirements in OCS, consistently returning the same set of nodes for a given query regardless of user differences. 2) Existing ML-based CS models suffer from severe training efficiency issues. In this paper, we formally redefine the problem of OCS. By analyzing the gaps in both types of approaches, we then propose a general solution for OCS named Sparse Subspace Filter (SSF), which can extend any ML-based CS model to enable personalized search in overlapping structures. To overcome the efficiency issue in the current models, we introduce Simplified Multi-hop Attention Networks (SMN), a lightweight yet effective community search model with larger receptive fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ML-based study of overlapping community search. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of SMN within the SSF pipeline, achieving a 13.73% improvement in F1-Score and up to 3 orders of magnitude acceleration in model efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Disentangling, Amplifying, and Debiasing: Learning Disentangled Representations for Fair Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for graph representation learning in various domains, such as social media and healthcare. However, they often suffer from fairness issues due to inherent biases in node attributes and graph structure, leading to unfair predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel GNN framework, DAB-GNN, that Disentangles, Amplifies, and deBiases attribute, structure, and potential biases in the GNN mechanism. DAB-GNN employs a disentanglement and amplification module that isolates and amplifies each type of bias through specialized disentanglers, followed by a debiasing module that minimizes the distance between subgroup distributions. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that DAB-GNN significantly outperforms ten state-of-the-art competitors in terms of achieving an optimal balance between accuracy and fairness. The codebase of DAB-GNN is available at https://github.com/Bigdasgit/DAB-GNN</description>

      <title>CausalMob: Causal Human Mobility Prediction with LLMs-derived Human Intentions toward Public Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale human mobility exhibits spatial and temporal patterns that can assist policymakers in decision making. Although traditional prediction models attempt to capture these patterns, they often interfered by non-periodic public events, such as disasters and occasional celebrations. Since regular human mobility patterns are heavily affected by these events, estimating their causal effects is critical to accurate mobility predictions. Although news articles provide unique perspectives on these events in an unstructured format, processing is a challenge. In this study, we propose a causality-augmented prediction model, called CausalMob, to analyze the causal effects of public events. We first utilize large language models (LLMs) to extract human intentions from news articles and transform them into features that act as causal treatments. Next, the model learns representations of spatio-temporal regional covariates from multiple data sources to serve as confounders for causal inference. Finally, we present a causal effect estimation framework to ensure event features remain independent of confounders during prediction. Based on large-scale real-world data, the experimental results show that the proposed model excels in human mobility prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Scam Detection for Ethereum Smart Contracts: Leveraging Graph Representation Learning for Secure Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the increasing abuse of fraudulent activities that result in significant financial and reputational harm, Ethereum smart contracts face a significant problem in detecting fraud. Existing monitoring methods typically rely on lease code analysis or physically extracted features, which suffer from scalability and adaptability limitations. In this study, we use graph representation learning to observe purchase trends and find fraudulent deals. We can achieve powerful categorisation performance by using innovative machine learning versions and transforming Ethereum invoice data into graph structures. Our method addresses label imbalance through SMOTE-ENN techniques and evaluates models like Multi-Layer Perceptron ( MLP ) and Graph Convolutional Networks ( GCN). Experimental results show that the MLP type surpasses the GCN in this environment, with domain-specific assessments closely aligned with real-world assessments. This study provides a scalable and efficient way to improve Ethereum's ecosystem's confidence and security.</description>
