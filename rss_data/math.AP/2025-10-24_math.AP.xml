Abstract: We provide counterexamples to uniqueness of solutions as well as a priori Calder\'on-Zygmund estimates for solutions below $L^2$ using convex integration argument for equations of the type $$ \text{div} (A (\nabla u)) = 0 \quad \text{in } \mathbb{B}^2, $$ where $A: \mathbb{R}^{2} \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is smooth, uniformly elliptic and has essentially linear growth, but fails to be monotone.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness for a class of parabolic equations with singular-degenerate coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of linear parabolic equations with measurable coefficients in divergence form whose volumetric heat capacity coefficients are assumed to be in some Muckenhoupt class of weights. As such, the coefficients can be degenerate, singular, or both degenerate and singular. A class of weighted parabolic cylinders with a non-homogeneous quasi-distance function, and a class of weighted parabolic Sobolev spaces intrinsically suitable for the class of equations are introduced. Under some smallness assumptions on the mean oscillations of the coefficients, regularity estimates, existence, and uniqueness of weak solutions in the weighted Sobolev spaces are proved. To achieve the results, we apply the level-set method introduced by Caffarelli and Peral. Several weighted inequalities and a version of weighted Aubin-Lions compactness theorem for sequences in weighted parabolic Sobolev spaces are established.</description>

      <title>Time-periodic solutions to the cubic wave equation: an elementary constructive approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an elementary proof of existence of infinite family of time-periodic solutions to the one-dimensional nonlinear cubic wave equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. It relies on the first order perturbative expansion and uses the Banach contraction principle to show existence of nearby solutions. In contrast to the previous results, this approach provides us explicit information about the frequencies and structures of the obtained solutions.</description>

      <title>Existence and qualitative properties of ground state solutions for the Schr\"{o}dinger-Bopp-Podolsky system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the existence and related properties of solutions to the Schr\"{o}dinger-Bopp-Podolsky system, which reduces to a nonlinear and nonlocal partial differential equation describing a Schr\"{o}dinger field coupled with its electromagnetic field in Bopp-Podolsky theory under purely electrostatic conditions. Firstly, by applying the mountain-pass lemma, we obtain the existence of nontrivial solutions. Then, through some estimates of the ground state energy, we prove the existence of ground state solutions. By exploring the relationship between solutions and paths associated with critical points, we further demonstrate that the obtained solutions are ground states of mountain-pass type. Additionally, the positivity, radial symmetry, rotational invariance, and exponential decay of the ground state solutions are considered. Finally, in the radial case, we explore the asymptotic behavior of the obtained solutions with respect to $a$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic issue for fractional laplacian on long cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the asymptotic behavior of weak solutions to certain elliptic and parabolic problems involving the fractional $p$-Laplacian in cylindrical domains that become unbounded in one direction. The nonlocal nature of the operator describing the equations creates several technical difficulties in treating problems of this type. The main results, obtained within a nonlocal abstract framework, extend and complement related properties established in the local setting.</description>

      <title>Qualitative Behavior of Solutions to a Forced Nonlocal Thin-Film Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional nonlocal degenerate fourth-order parabolic equation with inhomogeneous forces relevant to hydraulic fracture modeling. Employing a regularization scheme, modified energy/entropy methods, and novel differential inequality techniques, we establish global existence and long-time behavior results for weak solutions under both time-dependent and time-independent inhomogeneous forces. Specifically, for the time-dependent force $S(t, x)$, we prove that the solution converges in $H^s (\Omega )$ to $\bar{u}_0+\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_0^t \int_\Omega S(r, x)\, dxdr $, where $\bar{u}_0=\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_{\Omega}u_{0}(x)\,dx$ is the spatial average of the initial data. For the time-independent force $S(x)$, we prove that the difference between the weak solution and the linear function $\bar{u}_0 + \frac{t}{|\Omega|}\int_\Omega S(x)\, dx$ remains uniformly bounded in $H^s (\Omega )$.</description>

      <title>On an Analytical Criterion for Detecting Intermittent Turbulent Behaviour of Solutions of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A main question in the study of partial differential equations is the following: how do we understand the nature of the solutions and, in particular, how do we determine if a given solution shows turbulent or non-turbulent behaviour? Being able to answer such a question would be a major advance in the comprehension of the nature of turbulence. In this paper we focus on the case of intermittent turbulence and provide an analytical criterion, based on the crest factor, which captures the essential feature of the solutions. By computing the crest factor for the solutions of some classical equations, both linear and nonlinear, we illustrate the capability of the criterion for discerning between solutions exhibiting time-intermittent turbulence behaviour and solutions which either are not turbulent or show statistically stationary turbulence, like, for example, in the case described by Kolmogorov's theory.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of a composite wave to the Cauchy problem of 1-D full compressible Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compressible Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn system models the motion of a mixture of two macroscopically immiscible viscous compressible fluids. In this paper, we are concerned with the large time behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem of the one-dimensional full compressible Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn system. If the Riemann problem of the corresponding Euler system admits a solution which is a linear combination of 1-rarefaction wave and 3-rarefaction wave, we proved that a global strong solution to the compressible Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn system exists uniquely and converges to the above composite wave as time goes to infinity, provided that the adiabatic exponent $\gamma$ is closed to $1$. Here the initial perturbations except for the temperature function of the fluid, and the strength of rarefaction waves can be arbitrarily large. The proof is given by an elementary energy method that takes into account the effect of the phase field variable $\chi(t,x)$ and the complexity of nonlinear waves.</description>

Abstract: We apply a continuous data assimilation method to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system governing the evolution of a compressible, rotating and thermally driven fluid. A rigorous proof of the tracking property is given in the asymptotic regime of low Mach and high Rossby and Froude numbers. Large data in the framework of weak solutions are considered.</description>

      <title>Energy Decay in Measure Time: HUM Observability, Product-Exponential Envelopes, and GCC Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for impulsive exposure patterns there is no uniform exponential energy law in wall-clock time t, which explains why past t-based unifications of continuous damping with impulses fail. We therefore replace t by a measure-valued clock, sigma, that aggregates absolutely continuous exposure and atomic doses within a single Lyapunov ledger. On this ledger we prove an observability-dissipation principle in the sense of the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM): there exists a structural constant c_sigma &gt; 0 such that the energy decays at least at a product-exponential rate with respect to sigma. When sigma = t, the statement reduces to classical exponential stabilization with the same constant. For the damped wave under the Geometric Control Condition (GCC), the constant is calibrated by the usual observability and geometric factors. The framework yields a monotonicity principle ("more sigma-mass implies faster decay") and unifies intermittent regimes where quiescent intervals are punctuated by impulses. As robustness, secondary to the main contribution, the same decay law persists under structure-compatible discretizations and along compact variational limits; a stochastic extension supplies expectation and pathwise envelopes via the compensator. The contribution is a qualitative dynamics backbone: observability implies sigma-exponential decay with sharp constants.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantitative stability estimates for Alexandrov's Soap Bubble Theorem via Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type interpolation inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper provides optimal quantitative stability estimates for the celebrated Alexandrov's Soap Bubble Theorem within the class of $C^{k,\alpha}$ domains, for any $k \ge 1$ and $0 &lt; \alpha \le 1$, by leveraging Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type interpolation inequalities.
  Optimal estimates of uniform closeness to a ball are established for $L^r$ deviations of the mean curvature from being constant, for any $r\ge 2$ (more generally, for any $r&gt;1$ such that $r\ge (2N-2)/(N+1)$).
  For $r&gt;\frac{N-1}{2}$, the stability profile is linear, thus returning the existing results established in the literature through computations for nearly spherical sets. Surprisingly, all the stability estimates for $r\ge \frac{N-1}{2}$, for which the profile is not linear, are new; even in the particular case $r=2$ (which has been extensively studied, since it is a case of interest for several critical applications), the sharp stability profile that we obtain is new. Interestingly, we also prove that the (non-linear) profile for $r \ge \frac{N-1}{2}$ improves as $k$ becomes larger to such an extent that it becomes formally linear as $k$ goes to $\infty$.
  Finally, for any $r$, we show that all our estimates are optimal for any $k \ge 1$ and $0&lt; \alpha \le 1$, by providing explicit examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove local H\"older continuity for non negative, locally bounded, local weak solutions to the class of doubly nonlinear parabolic equations $\partial_t (u_q) - \text{div} (|Du|^{p-2} Du) = 0$ for $p &gt; 2$, $ 0 &lt; q &lt; p-1$. The proof relies on expansion of positivity results combined with the study of an alternative (related to DeGiorgi-type lemmas) and an exponential shift which allows us to deal with the intrinsic geometry associated to the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parameterized elliptic systems on symmetric domains with additional system symmetries. We prove the existence of continua of nontrivial solutions bifurcating from the constant branch determined by a critical point of the potential, without assuming nondegeneracy, via the degree for equivariant gradient maps. Our assumptions are formulated in terms of the right-hand side. When the domain is a compact symmetric space, the bifurcating solutions break symmetry at every nonzero level. Under additional assumptions on the right-hand side, the continua are unbounded.</description>

      <title>On dissipative turbulent solutions to the compressible anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations in unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Abbatiello, Feireisl and Novotn\'y, we prove the global existence of dissipative turbulent solution for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with anisotropic viscous stress tensor on unbounded domain. Our work complements the result of Bresch and Jabin, where the authors used the new compactness method to prove the existence of a weak solution to the same system in $\mathbb{T}^3$. By virtue of the concept of dissipative turbulent solutions, we are able to relax assumptions on the anisotropic tensor coefficients and the pressure law coefficient. We point out that we establish the existence result on a large class of unbounded domains, which is more conform to geophysical context. We also prove the weak-strong uniqueness property of acquired dissipative turbulent solutions.</description>

      <title>Non-optimal domains for the helicity maximisation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [J. Cantarella, D. DeTurck, H. Gluck and M. Teytel, J. Math. Phys. 41:5615 (2000)] the helicity isoperimetric problem which asks to find a smooth domain of fixed volume which maximises Biot-Savart helicity among all other smooth domains of fixed volume was initiated. It was shown that if an optimal domain exists, all of its boundary components must be tori.
  The present work extends these results by establishing additional geometric constraints which optimal domains, if they exist, must satisfy. This allows to rule out the optimality of a broad class of solid tori. The existence of optimal domains remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Homogenization, dimension reduction and linearization of thin elastic plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the homogenization, dimension reduction, and linearization of a composite plate subjected to external loading within the framework of non-linear elasticity problem. The total elastic energy of the problem is of order $\sim h^2\varepsilon^{2a+3}$, where $a\geq1$. The paper is divided into two parts: The first part presents the simultaneous homogenization, dimension reduction and linearization ($(\varepsilon,h)\to(0,0)$) of a composite plate without any coupling assumption of $\varepsilon$ and $h$. The second part consists of the rigorous derivation of linearized elasticity as a limit of non-linear elasticity with small deformation and external loading conditions. The results obtained demonstrate that the limit energy remains unchanged when the first linearization ($h\to 0$) is performed, followed by simultaneous homogenization dimension reduction ($\varepsilon\to0$) and when both limits approach zero simultaneously, i.e. $(\varepsilon,h)\to (0,0)$. The exact form of the limit energy(s) is obtained through the decomposition of plate deformations and plate displacements. By using the $\Gamma$-convergence technique, the existence of a unique solution for the limit linearized homogenized energy problem is demonstrated. These results are then extended to certain periodic perforated plates.</description>

      <title>Weak sequential stability of solutions to a nonisothermal kinetic model for incompressible dilute polymeric fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the mathematical analysis of a class of thermodynamically consistent kinetic models for nonisothermal flows of dilute polymeric fluids, based on the identification of energy storage mechanisms and entropy production mechanisms in the fluid under consideration. The model involves a system of nonlinear partial differential equations coupling the unsteady incompressible temperature-dependent Navier--Stokes equations to a temperature-dependent generalization of the classical Fokker--Planck equation and an evolution equation for the absolute temperature. Sequences of smooth solutions to the initial-boundary-value problem, satisfying the available bounds that are uniform with respect to the given data of the model, are shown to converge to a global-in-time large-data weak solution that satisfies an energy inequality, where the absolute temperature satisfies a renormalized variational inequality, implying weak sequential stability of the mathematical model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a model of dynamic crack growth in viscoelastic material, where the damping term depends on the history of the deformation. The model is based on a dynamic energy dissipation balance and on a maximal dissipation condition. Our main result is an existence theorem in dimension two under some a priori regularity constraints on the cracks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the recently published work "Modeling of radiating curved cables via coupled telegrapher's and Maxwell's equations", which introduces a model for the interaction between electromagnetic fields and radiating (possibly curved) cables, we analyze the qualitative properties of the resulting dynamical system. The model features inputs and outputs given by the currents and voltages at the cable ends, while the state comprises the corresponding distributions along the cables and the electromagnetic fields in the surrounding domain. We show that the autonomous dynamics (i.e., with zero input) generate a strongly continuous semigroup and establish sufficient conditions for well-posedness, meaning continuous dependence of the state and output trajectories on the inputs and initial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to study the convergence of solutions in three-dimensional nonlinear elastodynamics for a thin rod as its cross section shrinks to zero for displacements that are comparable to the small radius of the rod. Assuming the existence of solutions and proper control of the torsional velocity, we show how these converge to the solutions of an effective dimensionally reduced model which is a version of the the time dependent von K\'arm\'an equations for a one-dimensional rod. In the presence of high-frequency torsional vibrations, energy can dissipate in the limit and we obtain additional contributions in the limiting equations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the inverse problem of determining an unknown time-dependent source term in a semilinear pseudo-parabolic equation with variable coefficients and a Dirichlet boundary condition. The unknown source term is recovered from additional measurement data expressed as a weighted spatial average of the solution. By employing Rothe's time-discretisation method, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution under a smallness condition on the problem data. We also present a numerical scheme for computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nonrelativistic limit and qualitative properties of bound-state solutions for the nonlinear Dirac equation (NLDE) defined on noncompact quantum graphs: \[ -i c \frac{d}{d x} \sigma_1 \psi+m c^2 \sigma_3 \psi-\omega \psi=g(|\psi|) \psi, \quad \text { in } \mathcal{G} \] where \( g : \mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R} \) is a continuous nonlinear function, \( c&gt;0 \) represents the speed of light, \( m&gt;0 \) is the particle's mass, \( \omega\in\mathbb{R} \) is related to the frequency, \( \sigma_1 \) and \( \sigma_3 \) denote the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathcal{G}\) is a noncompact quantum graph. We establish the existence of bound-state solutions to the NLDE on \(\mathcal{G}\), and prove that these solutions converge toward the corresponding bound-state solutions of a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) in the nonrelativistic limit (i.e., as the speed of light \( c \to \infty \)) for particles of small mass. Furthermore, we prove uniform boundedness and exponential decay properties of the NLDE solutions, uniformly in \( c \), thereby offering insight into their asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Large field problem in coercive singular PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a priori estimates for singular differential equations of the form \[ \mathcal{L} \phi = P(\phi,\nabla\phi) + f(\phi,\nabla\phi)\xi \] where $P$ is a polynomial, $f$ is a sufficiently well-behaved function, and $\xi$ is an irregular distribution such that the equation is subcritical. The differential operator $\mathcal L$ is either a derivative in time, in which case we interpret the equation using rough path theory, or a heat operator, in which case we interpret the equation using regularity structures. Our only assumption on $P$ is that solutions with $\xi=0$ exhibit coercivity. Our estimates are local in space and time, and independent of boundary conditions.
  One of our main results is an abstract estimate that allows one to pass from a local coercivity property to a global one using scaling, for a large class of equations. This allows us to reduce the problem of deriving a priori estimates to the case when $\xi$ is small.</description>

      <title>First Critical Field in the pinned three-dimensional Ginzburg--Landau Model: A matching upper bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study of the first critical field $H_{c_1}$ for extreme type-II superconductors governed by the three-dimensional magnetic Ginzburg--Landau functional with a pinning term $a_\varepsilon$, as introduced in our previous work [arXiv:2507.10915]. Building upon the lower bound for $H_{c_1}$ and the characterization of the Meissner solution, we now establish a matching upper bound for $H_{c_1}$, thereby identifying its leading-order behavior. This result confirms the sharpness of the previously derived lower bound and further elucidates the connection between the onset of vorticity and a weighted variant of the \emph{isoflux problem}. Our argument is prompted by the upper bound construction we developed in [arXiv:2510.14910], based on the Biot--Savart law.</description>

      <title>Quantitative classification of potential Navier-Stokes singularities beyond the blow-up time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{hou}, Hou gave a compelling numerical candidate for a singular solution of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. We pioneer classifications of potentially singular solutions, motivated by the issue of investigating the viability of numerical candidates.For approximately axisymmetric initial data, we give the first quantitative classification of potentially singular solutions at \textit{any} given time in the region of potential blow-up times. Moreover, the quantitative bounds in the vicinity of any potential blow-up time are in principle amenable to numerical testing. To achieve this, we establish improved quantitative regions of regularity for approximately axisymmetric initial data, which may be of independent interest. Together with improved quantitative energy estimates from \cite{TB24}, this allows us to get a quantitative lower bound in the vicinity of a blow-up time by implementing the strategy of \cite{BP21}, which is a physical space analogue of Tao's strategy \cite{Ta21} for producing quantitative estimates for critically bounded solutions. To obtain a quantitative lower bound on the solution at any time in the region of potential blow-up times, we recursively apply quantitative Carleman inequality arguments from \cite{Ta21}. This necessitates careful bookkeeping to avoid exponential losses and to ensure that all forward-in-time iterations of (localized) vorticity concentration remain within the region of quantitative regularity of the solution.</description>

      <title>Ill-Posedness of the 2D Euler Equations in a Logarithmically Refined Critical Sobolev Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their seminal work, Bourgain and Li establish strong ill-posedness of the 2D Euler equations for initial velocity in the critical Sobolev space $H^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$. In this work, we extend those results by demonstrating strong ill-posedness in logarithmically regularized spaces which are strictly contained in $H^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ and which contain $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for all $s&gt;2$. These spaces are constructed via application of a fractional logarithmic derivative to the critical Sobolev norm. We show that if the power $\alpha$ of the logarithmic derivative satisfies $\alpha\leq 1/2$, then the 2D Euler equations are strongly ill-posed.</description>

      <title>A Weakly Nonlinear Theory for Pattern Formation in Structured Models with Localized Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured models, such as PDEs structured by age or phenotype, provide a setting to study pattern formation in heterogeneous populations. Classical tools to quantify the emergence of patterns, such as linear and weakly nonlinear analyses, pose significant mathematical challenges for these models due to sharply peaked or singular steady states. Here, we present a weakly nonlinear framework that extends classical tools to structured PDE models in settings where the base state is spatially uniform, but exponentially localized in the structured variable. Our approach utilizes WKBJ asymptotics and an analysis of the Stokes phenomenon to systematically resolve the solution structure in the limit where the steady state tends to a Dirac-delta function. To demonstrate our method, we consider a chemically structured (nonlocal) model of motile bacteria that interact through quorum sensing. For this example, our analysis yields an amplitude equation that governs the solution dynamics near a linear instability, and predicts a pitchfork bifurcation. From the amplitude equation, we deduce an effective parameter grouping whose sign determines whether the pitchfork bifurcation is subcritical or supercritical. Although we demonstrate our framework for a specific example, our techniques are broadly applicable.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Stationary Solutions to McKean-Vlasov Equations with Applications to Noisy Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle. Our main contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions of the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic system of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit characterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a function space. This framework provides a transparent description of local bifurcations, characterizing their periodicity, and resonance structures, while accommodating singular potentials. We derive analytic expressions that characterize the emergence, form and shape (supercritical, critical, subcritical or transcritical) of bifurcations involving possibly multiple Fourier modes and connect them with discontinuous phase transitions. We also characterize, under suitable assumptions, the detailed structure of the stationary bifurcating solutions that are accurate upto an arbitrary number of Fourier modes. At the global level, we establish regularity and concavity properties of the free energy landscape, proving existence, compactness, and coexistence of globally minimizing stationary measures, further identifying discontinuous phase transitions with points of non-differentiability of the minimum free energy map. As an application, we specialize the theory to the Noisy Mean-Field Transformer model, where we show how changing the inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ affects the geometry of the infinitely many bifurcations from the uniform measure. We also explain how increasing $\beta$ can lead to a rich class of approximate multi-mode stationary solutions which can be seen as `metastable states'. Further, a sharp transition from continuous to discontinuous (first-order) phase behavior is observed as $\beta$ increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a unique continuation problem for the wave equation given data in a volumetric subset of the space time domain. In the absence of data on the lateral boundary of the space-time cylinder we prove that the solution can be continued with H\"older stability into a certain proper subset of the space-time domain. Additionally, we show that unique continuation of the solution to the entire space-time cylinder with Lipschitz stability is possible given the knowledge of a suitable finite dimensional space in which the trace of the solution on the lateral boundary is contained. These results allow us to design a finite element method that provably converges to the exact solution at a rate that mirrors the stability properties of the continuous problem.</description>

Abstract: This short survey article stems from recent progress on critical cases of stochastic evolution equations in variational formulation with additive, multiplicative or gradient noises. Typical examples appear as the limit cases of the stochastic porous medium equation, stochastic fast- and super fast-diffusion equations, self-organized criticality, stochastic singular $p$-Laplace equations, and the stochastic total variation flow, among others. We present several different notions of solutions, results on convergence of solutions depending on a parameter, and homogenization. Furthermore, we provide some references hinting at the recent progress in regularity results, long-time behavior, ergodicity, and numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>The global nonlinear stability of Minkowski spacetime with self-gravitating massive Dirac fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Einstein-Dirac system for a massive field, which describes the evolution of self-gravitating massive spinor fields, and we investigate the global evolution problem, when the initial data set is sufficiently close to data describing a spacelike, asymptotically Euclidean slice of the Minkowski spacetime. We establish the gauge-invariant nonlinear stability of such fields, namely the existence of a globally hyperbolic development, which remains asymptotic to Minkowski spacetime in future timelike, null, and spacelike directions. Previous results on this problem have been limited to the Einstein-Dirac system in the massless case. Our analysis follows the asymptotically hyperboloidal-Euclidean framework introduced by LeFloch and Y. Ma for the massive Klein-Gordon-Einstein system. The structure specific to spinor fields and the Dirac equation necessitates significantly new elements in the proof. In contrast with prior approaches, our treatment of spinor fields and the Dirac equation is gauge-invariant, relying on the formalism of Lorentz Clifford algebras, principal fiber bundles, etc. Our analysis is carried out with the metric expressed in light-bending wave coordinates, as we call them. This leads us to the study of a global existence problem for a system of wave equations with constraints and a Klein-Gordon-type equations. We derive L2 estimates for the Dirac equation and its coupling with the Einstein equations, along with $pointwise estimates. New Sobolev inequalities are proven for spinor fields in a gauge-invariant manner in the hyperboloidal-Euclidean foliation. The nonlinear coupling between the massive Dirac equation and the Einstein equations is investigated, and we establish a hierarchy of estimates, which distinguish between translations, rotations, and boosts.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Approximation of Weak Solutions to Time Dependent Maxwell's Equations with $L^2$-Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Maxwell's equations in conducting media with perfectly conducting boundary conditions on Lipschitz domains, allowing rough material coefficients and $L^2$-data. Our first contribution is a direct proof of well-posedness of the first-order weak formulation, including solution existence and uniqueness, an energy identity, and continuous dependence on the data. The argument uses interior-in-time mollification to show uniqueness while avoiding reflection techniques. Existence is via the well-known Galerkin method (cf.~Duvaut and Lions \cite[Eqns.~(4.31)--(4.32), p.~346; Thm.~4.1]{GDuvaut_JLLions_1976a}). For completeness, and to make the paper self-contained, a complete proof has been provided.
  Our second contribution is a structure-preserving semi-discrete finite element method based on the N\'ed\'elec/Raviart--Thomas de Rham complex. The scheme preserves a discrete Gauss law for all times and satisfies a continuous-in-time energy identity with stability for nonnegative conductivity. With a divergence-free initialization of the magnetic field (via potential reconstruction or constrained $L^2$ projection), we prove convergence of the semi-discrete solutions to the unique weak solution as the mesh is refined. The analysis mostly relies on projector consistency, weak-* compactness in time-bounded $L^2$ spaces, and identification of time derivatives in dual spaces.</description>

      <title>A Gevrey class semigroup, exponential decay and Lack of analyticity for a system formed by a Kirchhoff-Love plate equation and the equation of a membrane-like electric network with indirect fractional damping</title>

      <description>arXiv:1908.04826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emphasis in this paper is on the Coupled System of a Kirchhoff-Love Plate Equation with the Equation of a Membrane-like Electrical Network, where the coupling is of higher order given by the Laplacian of the displacement velocity $\gamma\Delta u_t$ and the Laplacian of the potential electric field $\gamma\Delta v_t $, here only one of the equations is conservative, and the other has dissipative properties. The mechanism was dissipative is given by an intermediate damping $(-\Delta)^\theta v_t$ between the potential electric $\theta=0$ (frictional damping) and the Laplacian of the electric potential for $\theta=1$ (damping Kelvin Voigt). We show that $S(t)=e^{\mathbb{B}t}$ is not analytic for $\theta\in [0, 1[$ and analytic for $\theta=1$, however $S(t)=e^{\mathbb{B}t}$ decays exponentially for $0\leq \theta \leq 1$ and $S(t)$ is of Gevrey sharp class $s&gt;\frac{1}{\theta}$ when the parameter $\theta$ lies in the interval $]0,1[$.</description>

      <title>Invariant Gibbs dynamics for two-dimensional fractional wave equations in negative Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a fractional nonlinear wave equations (fNLW) with a general power-type nonlinearity, on the two-dimensional torus. Our main goal is to construct invariant global-in-time Gibbs dynamics for a renormalized fNLW. We first construct the Gibbs measure associated with this equation by using the variational approach of Barashkov and Gubinelli. We then prove almost sure local well-posedness with respect to Gibbsian initial data, by exploiting the second order expansion. Finally, we extend solutions globally in time using Bourgain's invariant measure argument.</description>

      <title>Convergence of layer potentials and Riemann-Hilbert problem on extension domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of layer potential operators for the harmonic transmission problem over a sequence of converging two-sided extension domains. Consequently, the Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators, Calder{\'o}n projectors, and associated Neumann series converge in this setting. As a result, we generalize the notion of Cauchy integrals and, in a sense, of Hilbert transforms for a class of extension domains. Our approach relies on dyadic approximations of arbitrary open sets, considering convergence in terms of characteristic functions, Hausdorff distance, and compact sets.</description>

      <title>Mean oscillation conditions for nonlinear equation and regularity results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider general nonlinear elliptic equations of the form \[ \mathrm{div}\, A(x,Du) = 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega, \] where $ A:\Omega \times \Rn \to \Rn $ satisfies a quasi-isotropic $(p,q)$-growth condition, which is equivalent to the point-wise uniform ellipticity of $A$. We establish sharp and comprehensive mean oscillation conditions on $A(x,\xi)$ with respect to the $x$ variable to obtain $C^1$- and $W^{1,s}$-regularity results. The results provide new conditions even in the standard $p$-growth case with coefficient $\div(a(x)|Du|^{p-2}Du)=0$. Also included are variable exponent growth with and without perturbation as well as borderline double-phase growth and double-phase growth with a coefficient.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions to mixed dispersion nonlinear Schr\"odinger system with coupled nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence of normalized solutions for the following biharmonic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \Delta^2u+\alpha_{1}\Delta u+\lambda u=\beta r_{1}|u|^{r_{1}-2}|v|^{r_{2}} u &amp; \text { in } \mathbb{R}^{N}, \\ \Delta^2v+\alpha_{2}\Delta v+\lambda v=\beta r_{2}|u|^{r_{1}}|v|^{r_{2}-2} v &amp; \text { in } \mathbb{R}^{N}, \\ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}} (u^{2}+v^{2})\ud x=\rho^{2}, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Delta^2u=\Delta(\Delta u)$ is the biharmonic operator, $\alpha_{1}$, $\alpha_{2}$, $\beta&gt;0$, $r_{1}$, $r_{2}&gt;1$, $N\geq 1$. $\rho^2$ stands for the prescribed mass, and $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ arises as a Lagrange multiplier. Such single constraint permits mass transformation in two materials. When $r_{1}+r_{2}\le 2+\frac{8}{N}$, we obtain a dichotomy result with respect to the mass for the existence of nontrivial ground states. Especially when $\alpha_1=\alpha_2$, the ground state exists for all $\rho&gt;0$ if and only if $r_1+r_2&lt;\min\left\{\max\left\{4, 2+\frac{8}{N+1}\right\}, 2+\frac{8}{N}\right\}$. When $r_{1}+r_{2}\in\left(2+\frac{8}{N}, \frac{2N}{(N-4)^{+}}\right)$ and $N\geq 2$, we obtain the existence of radial nontrivial mountain pass solution for sufficiently small $\rho&gt;0$.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the following attraction-repulsion chemotaxis system with nonlocal logistic source and sublinear productions \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{rrll} &amp;&amp;u_t = d_1 \Delta u-\chi \nabla\cdot(u^k \nabla v)+\xi \nabla\cdot(u^k \nabla w)+ \mu u^m \left(1-\int_\Omega u(x,t){\rm d}x\right),\qquad &amp;x\in\Omega,\, t&gt;0,\\ &amp;&amp;v_t = d_2 \Delta v-\alpha v+f(u), &amp;x\in\Omega,\, t&gt;0,\\ &amp;&amp;w_t = d_3 \Delta w-\beta w+f(u), &amp;x\in\Omega,\, t&gt;0,\\ &amp;&amp;\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial\nu} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial\nu} = 0, &amp;x\in\partial\Omega,\, t&gt;0,\\ &amp;&amp;u(x,0) = u_0, \quad v(x,0)=v_0, \quad w(x,0)=w_0,&amp;x\in\Omega, \end{array} \right. \] in an open, bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 2$ with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$. Assume the parameters $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_3$, $\chi$, $\xi$, $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\mu$ are positive constants, initial data $(u_0, v_0, w_0)$ are nonnegative and the function $f(u)\leq K u^l\in C^1([0, \infty))$ for some $K, l&gt;0$. Under appropriate conditions on the parameter $k$, $l$ and $m$ we show that the above problem admits a unique globally bounded classical solution.</description>

      <title>Non-autonomous semilinear fractional evolution equations: well-posedness and ultracontractivity results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a time-fractional semilinear parabolic abstract Cauchy problem for a time-dependent sectorial operator $A(t)$ which satisfies the Acquistapace-Terreni conditions. We first prove local existence results for the mild solution of the problem at hand. Then we prove, under suitable assumptions on the initial datum, that the solution is also global in time. This is achieved by proving ultracontractivity estimates for the fractional evolution families associated with the operator $A(t)$.</description>

      <title>Fine dissipative properties of Euler solutions with measure first derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fine properties of bounded weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equations whose first derivatives, or only some combinations of them, are Radon measures. As consequences we obtain elementary proofs of the local energy conservation for solutions in BV and BD, without relying on the freedom in choosing the convolution kernel appearing in the approximation of the dissipation. The argument heavily exploits the form of the Euler nonlinearity and it does not apply to the linear transport equations, where the renormalization property for BD vector fields is an open problem. The methods also yields to nontrivial conclusions when only the vorticity is assumed to be a measure.</description>

      <title>The Feynman propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields on radiative asymptotically flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a large class of asymptotically flat spacetimes which includes radiative perturbations of Minkowski space, we define a distinguished global Feynman propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields by means of the microlocal approach to non-elliptic Fredholm theory, working in the de,sc-pseudodifferential algebra due to Sussman. We extend the limiting absorption principle (the "$i\varepsilon$ prescription" for the Feynman propagator) to this setting. Motivated by the complicated Hamilton flow structure arising in this problem, we also prove a new localized radial point estimate in the spirit of Haber-Vasy which, under appropriate nondegeneracy assumptions, allows one to propagate microlocal regularity into a single radial point belonging to a larger radial set which can be a source, sink, or saddle for the Hamilton flow.</description>
