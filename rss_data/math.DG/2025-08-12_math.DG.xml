      <title>Linear and nonlinear stability for the Bach flow, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the linear stability of a gauge-modified version of the Bach flow on any complete manifold (M, h) of constant curvature. This involves some intricate calculations to obtain spectral bounds, and in particular introduces a higher order generalization of the well-known Koiso identity. We also prove nonlinear stability for the Bach flow if (M, h) is hyperbolic space, and more generally any Poincar\'e-Einstein space sufficiently close to h. In the forthcoming Part II of this project, we study the nonlinear stability question if M is either compact or else noncompact and flat, since those cases require different considerations involving a center manifold.</description>

      <title>Generalized moment maps, reduction and complex quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce the concept of momentumly closed forms. A nondegenerate momentumly closed two-form defines a moment map that generalizes the classical notion associated with symplectic forms. We then develop an extended theory of moment maps within this broader framework. More specifically, we establish the convexity property of the generalized moment map, construct the corresponding reduction space, and analyze the Kirwan-Ness stratification. Additionally, we prove a variant of the Darboux-Weinstein theorem for momentumly closed two-forms.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Zermelo navigation with tacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the time- and position-dependent Zermelo navigation problem within the framework of Lorentz-Finsler geometry. Since the initial work of E. Zermelo, the task is to find the time-minimizing trajectory between two regions for a moving object whose speed profile depends on time, position and direction. We give a step-by-step review of the classical formulation of the problem, where the geometric shape generated by the velocity vectors -- the speed profile indicatrix -- is strongly convex at each point. We derive new global results for the cases where the indicatrix field is only time-dependent. In such (meso-scale realistic) cases, Zermelo navigation exhibits particularly favorable properties that have not been previously explored, making them especially appealing for both theoretical and numerical investigations. Moreover, motivated by real-world phenomena and examples, we obtain novel results for non-convex (or multi-convex) navigation, i.e. when the indicatrices fail to be convex. In this new setting -- which is not unlike the corresponding Finsler setting for Snell's law -- optimal paths may involve so-called tacking, which stems from discontinuous shifts of direction of motion. The tacking behaviour thus results in zig-zag trajectories, as observed in time-optimal sailboat navigation and surprisingly also in the flight paths of far-ranging seabirds. Finally, we provide new efficient computational algorithms and illustrate the use of them to solve the Zermelo navigation (boundary value) problem, i.e. to find numerically the time-minimizing trajectory between two fixed points in the general non-convex setting.</description>

      <title>Long time behavior of a class of non-homogeneous anisotropic fully nonlinear curvature flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of non-homogeneous anisotropic fully nonlinear curvature flows in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. More precisely, we consider a hypersurface $M$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ deformed by a flow along its unit normal with its speed $f(r)\sigma_k^\alpha$ where $\sigma_k$ is the $k$-th elementary symmetric polynomial of $M$'s principle curvatures, $r$ is the distance of the point on $M$ to the origin, $f$ is a smooth nonnegative function on $[0,\infty)$ and $\alpha &gt; 0$. Under some suitable conditions on $f$, we prove that starting from a star-shaped and $k$-convex hypersurface, the flow exists for all time and converges smoothly to a sphere after normalization. In particular, we generalize the results in \cite{li2022asymptotic}.</description>

      <title>Refined behavior description of the normalized Ricci flow on homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the problems of preserving the Ricci curvature positivity on homogeneous spaces under the normalized Ricci flow (NRF). We found out infinitely many generalized Wallach spaces (GWS) on which the positivity of the Ricci curvature of metrics is preserved when evolved by the NRF. Analogously, the number of GWS is infinite as well, when the positivity of the Ricci curvature can be lost. We also obtain some refinements to our previous results devoted to the case of coincided parameters. A series of examples is discussed.</description>

      <title>Holonomy of the Obata connection on 2-step hypercomplex nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the holonomy of the Obata connection on 2-step hypercomplex nilmanifolds. By explicitly computing the curvature tensor, we determine the conditions under which the Obata connection is flat, showing that this depends on the nilpotency step of each complex structure. In particular, we show that the holonomy algebra of the Obata connection is always an abelian subalgebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(n, \mathbb{H})$: to establish this, we prove the $\mathbb{H}$-solvable conjecture for 2-step hypercomplex nilmanifolds. Furthermore, we provide new examples of $k$-step nilpotent hypercomplex nilmanifolds, with arbitrary $k$, which are not Obata flat.</description>

      <title>Applications of Weak Metric Structures to Non-Symmetrical Gravitational Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear connections satisfying the Einstein metricity condition are important in the study of generalized Riemannian manifolds $(M,G=g+F)$, where the symmetric part $g$ of $G$ is a non-degenerate $(0,2)$-tensor, and $F$ is the skew-symmetric part. Such structures naturally arise in spacetime models in theoretical physics, where $F$ can be defined as an almost complex or almost contact metric (a.c.m.) structure. In the paper, we first study more general models, where $F$ has constant rank and is based on weak metric structures (introduced by the second author and R.~Wolak), which generalize almost complex and a.c.m. structures. We consider linear connections with totally skew-symmetric torsion that satisfy both the Einstein metricity condition and the $A$-torsion condition, where $A$ is a skew-symmetric (1,1)-tensor adjoint to~$F$. In the almost Hermitian case, we prove that the manifold with such a connection is weak nearly K\" ahler, the torsion is completely determined by the exterior derivative of the fundamental 2-form and the Nijenhuis tensor, and the structure tensors are parallel, while in the weak a.c.m. case, the contact distribution is involutive, the Reeb vector field is Levi-Civita parallel, and the structure tensors are also parallel with respect to both connections.
  For rank$(F)=\dim M$, we apply weak almost Hermitian structures to fundamental results (by the first author and S. Ivanov) on generalized Riemannian manifolds and prove that the manifold equipped with an Einstein's connection is a weighted product of several nearly K\"ahler manifolds.
  For~rank$(F)&lt;\dim M$ we apply weak almost Hermitian and weak a.c.m. structures and obtain splitting results for generalized Riemannian manifolds equipped with Einstein's connections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find new examples of normal forms for oriented Riemannian 4-manifolds by generalizing the Hodge star-Einstein condition. These normal forms include curvature-distinguished metrics; they also generalize Berger's result on the nonnegativity of the Euler characteristic, as well as the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study certain Banach spaces of analytic functions on which a left-invertible multiplication operator acts. It turns out that, under natural conditions, its left inverse is a Cowen-Douglas operator. We investigate how the analytic continuations of functions from an invariant subspace of this Cowen-Douglas operator relate to the spectrum of its restriction to that subspace.</description>

      <title>Conditional non-linear stability of Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes in the full subextremal range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the stability of Kerr-de Sitter black holes, in the full subextremal range, as solutions of the vacuum Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant under the assumption that mode stability holds for these spacetimes. The method is similar to the (unconditional) proof in the slowly rotating case by Hintz and Vasy. The key novelties are the implementation of constraint damping in the full subextremal range as well as the verification of a subprincipal symbol condition at the trapped set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the genericity of ergodic probability measures for the geodesic flow on non-positively curved Riemannian manifolds. We demonstrate that the existence of an open isometric embedding of a product manifold with a factor isometric to $S^1$ implies that the closure of the set of ergodic measures does not encompass all invariant measures, thus the genericity of ergodic probability measures fails. Our findings notably provide an answer to an open question concerning a specific example of 3-manifold attributed to Heintze.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After reviewing manifold optimization techniques in applications like MIMO communication systems, phased array beamforming, radar, and control theory, we observed that the Complex Circle Manifold (CCM) is widely employed, yet its foundational relations and equations lack a rigorous, self-contained derivation in the literature. This paper provides a systematic and rigorous proof of CCM's key properties, including its tangent space and Riemannian gradient operations, with explicit connections to real-world optimization problems. Our work aims to serve as a unified reference for researchers and practitioners applying CCM Manifold Optimization.</description>

      <title>Interior instability of naked singularities of a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the $k$-self-similar naked singularity solutions of the spherically symmetric Einstein--Scalar field system are unstable to black hole formation under perturbations that are totally supported in the interior region, in all regularities strictly below the threshold. The instability below the threshold is also established for exterior perturbations. We also show that general naked singularity solutions are unstable under interior BV perturbations, which provides a new insight into understanding the weak cosmic censorship conjecture for this model. In contrast to all previous results on the exterior instability of naked singularities (and even trapped surface formation), where only a single incoming null cone is considered, the novel approach to proving the interior instability is analyzing a family of incoming null cones becoming more and more singular.</description>

      <title>Counting Salem numbers arising from arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between Salem numbers and short geodesics has been fruitful in quantitative studies of arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds, particularly in dimensions 2 and 3. In this article, we push these connections even further. The primary goals are: (1) to bound the proportion of Salem numbers of degree up to $n+1$ in the commensurability class of classical arithmetic lattices in any odd dimension $n$; (2) to improve lower bounds for the strong exponential growth of averages of multiplicities in the geodesic length spectrum of non-compact arithmetic orbifolds. In order to accomplish these goals, we bound, for a fixed square-free integer $D$, the count of Salem numbers with minimal polynomial $f$ satisfying $f(1)f(-1)=-D$ in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}/\mathbb{Q}^{\times 2}$. To do this, we make use of results on the distribution of Salem numbers, as well as classical methods for counting Pythagorean triples and Gauss' lattice-counting argument. To this end, we give a generalization of the count of Pythagorean triples and provide an elementary proof which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Bounds to the mean curvature of leaves of CMC foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13772v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this present paper is to bring the results proved by Barbosa, Kenmotsu and Oshikiri (1991) and its ideas to a perspective where the Ricci curvature is bounded from below. For instance, for a foliation by CMC hypersurfaces on a compact (without boundary) Riemannian manifold $M^{n+1}$ with Ricci curvature bounded from below by $-nK_0\leq 0$ and such that the mean curvature $H$ of the leaves of the foliation satisfies $|H|\geq \sqrt{K_0}$, we prove that $|H|\equiv \sqrt{K_0}$ and all the leaves are totally umbilical. This gives, in particular, a generalization for the result proved by Barbosa, Kenmotsu and Oshikiri (1991), where the above result was proved in the case $K_0=0$. We also obtain a proof of the following: for a foliation by CMC hypersurfaces on a compact (without boundary) Riemannian manifold $M$ with Ricci curvature bounded from below by $-nK_0\leq 0$, the mean curvature $H$ of the leaves of the foliation satisfies $|H|\leq \sqrt{K_0}$. Furthermore, if the foliation contains a leaf $L$ whose absolute mean curvature is $|H_L|=\sqrt{K_0}$, then either $K_0=0$ and all the leaves of $\mathfrak{F}$ are totally geodesic, or $K_0&gt;0$ and there is a totally umbilical leaf.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the extremal stratification of an Alexandrov space introduced by Perelman-Petrunin is a CS stratification in the sense of Siebenmann. We also show that every space of directions of an Alexandrov space without proper extremal subsets is homeomorphic to a sphere. In the polyhedral case, the same holds for every iterated space of directions.</description>

Abstract: We show that under a lower Ricci curvature bound and an upper diameter bound, a torus admits a finite-sheeted covering space with volume bounded from below and diameter bounded from above. This partially recovers a result of Kloeckner and Sabourau, whose original proof contains a serious gap that currently lacks a resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the holomorphic parabolic geometries on compact complex manifolds of general type. We accomplish this by bounding the numerical dimension of any smooth projective variety in terms of geometric invariants of the flag variety model of any holomorphic parabolic geometry on that variety. Along the way, we uncover foliations and fibrations on smooth projective varieties that admit holomorphic parabolic geometries.</description>

      <title>Moduli of K3 families over $\mathbb{P}^1$ and complex-hyperk\"ahler metrics induced by deformed twistor cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We answer a question posed independently by Fels-Huckleberry-Wolf and Looijenga concerning the geometric meaning of small deformations of twistor cycles in the K3 period domain. These are shown to induce complex-hyperk\"ahler metrics on members of the families via Penrose's Non-linear Graviton construction. On the way to proving this result, we construct a Hausdorff fine moduli space for families of marked K3 surfaces over smooth rational curves in the K3 period domain. Over an open subset containing all twistor cycles we construct a family of such families, which is a universal small deformation for every twistor family. Whenever possible, we extend the results to higher-dimensional irreducible holomorphic-symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fluids via matrix hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2-D) incompressible, inviscid fluids produce fascinating patterns of swirling motion. How and why the patterns emerge are long-standing questions, first addressed in the 19th century by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and Kelvin. Countless researchers have since contributed to innovative techniques and results. Yet, the overarching problem of swirling 2-D motion and its long-time behavior remains largely open. Here we shed light on this problem via a link to isospectral matrix flows. The link is established through V. Zeitlin's beautiful model for the numerical discretization of Euler's equations in 2-D. When considered on the sphere, Zeitlin's model offers deep connections between 2-D hydrodynamics and unitary representations of the rotation group. Consequently, it provides a dictionary that maps hydrodynamical concepts to matrix Lie theory, which in turn gives connections to matrix factorizations, random matrices, and integrability theory, for example. Results about finite-dimensional matrices can then be transferred to infinite-dimensional fluids via quantization theory, which is here used as an analysis tool (albeit traditionally describing the limit between quantum and classical physics). We demonstrate how the dictionary is constructed and how it unveils techniques for 2-D hydrodynamics. We also give accompanying convergence results for Zeitlin's model on the sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two negatively curved metric spaces are iso-length-spectral if they have the same multisets of lengths of closed geodesics. A well-known paper by Sunada provides a systematic way of constructing iso-length-spectral surfaces that are not isometric. In this paper, we construct examples of iso-length-spectral surface amalgams that are not isometric, generalizing Buser's combinatorial construction of Sunada's surfaces. We find both homeomorphic and non-homeomorphic pairs. Finally, we construct a noncommensurable pair with the same weak length spectrum, the length set without multiplicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any given submersion $\pi:X\to B$ with closed, oriented and spin$^c$ fibers of even dimension, equipped with a Riemannian and differential spin$^c$ structure, we apply the Atiyah-Singer-Gorokhovsky-Lott approach to the local family index theorem without the kernel bundle assumption to construct an analytic index $\textrm{ind}^a_k$ in odd $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ $K$-theory at the cocycle level. This is achieved by associating to every cocycle $(\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{F}, \alpha)$ of the odd $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ $K$-theory group of $X$ a cocycle $\textrm{ind}^a_k(\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{F}, \alpha)$ of the odd $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ $K$-theory group of $B$. We also prove a Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck-type formula in odd $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ $K$-theory, which expresses the Cheeger-Chern-Simons form of $\textrm{ind}^a_k(\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{F}, \alpha)$ in terms of that of $(\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{F}, \alpha)$. Furthermore, we show that the analytic index $\textrm{ind}^a_k$ and the Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck-type formula in odd $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ $K$-theory refine the underlying geometric bundle of the analytic index and the Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck theorem in $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ $K$-theory, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the intertwining differential operators between vector bundles over the real projective space of dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is twofold. One is to classify and construct $SL(3,\mathbb{R})$-intertwining differential operators between vector bundles over the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^2$. It turns out that two kinds of operators appear. We call them Cartan operators and PRV operators. The second objective is then to study the representations realized on the kernel of those operators both in the smooth and holomorphic setting. A key machinery is the BGG resolution. In particular, by exploiting some results of Davidson-Enright-Stanke and Enright-Joseph, the irreducible unitary highest weight modules of $SU(1,2)$ at the (first) reduction points are classified by the image of Cartan operators and kernel of PRV operators.</description>

      <title>SVarM: Linear Support Varifold Machines for Classification and Regression on Geometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite progress in the rapidly developing field of geometric deep learning, performing statistical analysis on geometric data--where each observation is a shape such as a curve, graph, or surface--remains challenging due to the non-Euclidean nature of shape spaces, which are defined as equivalence classes under invariance groups. Building machine learning frameworks that incorporate such invariances, notably to shape parametrization, is often crucial to ensure generalizability of the trained models to new observations. This work proposes \textit{SVarM} to exploit varifold representations of shapes as measures and their duality with test functions $h:\mathbb{R}^n \times S^{n-1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. This method provides a general framework akin to linear support vector machines but operating instead over the infinite-dimensional space of varifolds. We develop classification and regression models on shape datasets by introducing a neural network-based representation of the trainable test function $h$. This approach demonstrates strong performance and robustness across various shape graph and surface datasets, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>Exactness, Cohomology, and Uniqueness in First-Order Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the solvability of first-order differential equations and the topology of the underlying domain through the lens of de\,Rham cohomology. We analyze the conditions under which a closed 1-form associated with a first-order ODE admits a global potential, thereby reducing the problem to the exactness of differential forms. While it is well known that exactness is guaranteed on simply connected domains, we show that triviality of the first de\,Rham cohomology group is the more fundamental requirement for global integrability and uniqueness of solutions. In particular, we demonstrate that certain non-simply connected manifolds, such as the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, still support global solutions due to the vanishing of $H^1_{\text{dR}}$. By explicitly constructing examples on $\mathbb{RP}^2$ and comparing them with domains like $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}$, we illustrate how topological obstructions manifest analytically as non-uniqueness or multi-valued behavior. We further discuss the correspondence between integrating factors and the trivialization of cohomology classes, drawing connections to classical symmetry methods and potential theory. This synthesis of geometric, topological, and analytic perspectives provides a unifying framework for understanding the global behavior of first-order ODEs beyond local existence theorems.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and positivity of Hawking quasi-local energy on area-constrained critical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key test for any quasi-local energy in general relativity is that it be nonnegative and satisfy a rigidity property; if it vanishes, the region enclosed is flat. We show that the Hawking energy, when evaluated on its natural area-constrained critical surfaces, henceforth called "Hawking surfaces", satisfies both properties under the dominant energy condition. In the time-symmetric case, where Hawking surfaces coincide with area-constrained Willmore surfaces, we extend positivity and rigidity to include electric charge, a nonzero cosmological constant, and higher dimensions. In the fully dynamical (non-time-symmetric) case, we establish the first nonnegativity and rigidity theorems for the Hawking energy in this general setting. These results confirm the Hawking energy consistency with basic physical principles and address several longstanding ambiguities and criticisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the volume-distance-ratio (VDR) asymptote at the past timelike boundary point for spatially flat FLRW spacetime with scale factor $a(t) = t^{\alpha}$, and spatially hyperbolic FLRW spacetime with scale factor $a(t) = a_0 t^{\alpha}$. We employ the spacetime inextendibility criteria via the volume-distance-ratio asymptote to deduce their inextendibility. We show that for spatial dimensions greater than $2$, there exists at least one critical exponent $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for which the VDR asymptote along the $\Sigma_t$-orthogonal geodesic equals the Minkowski value.</description>
