      <title>Bulk-Edge Correspondence for Finite Two-dimensional Ergodic Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we rigorously prove the bulk-edge correspondence for finite two-dimensional ergodic disordered systems. Specifically, we focus on the short-range Hamiltonians with ergodic disordered on-site potentials. We first introduce the bulk and edge indices, which are both well-defined within the Aizenman-Molchanov mobility gap. On the one hand, the bulk index is the sum of the Hall conductance, which is a well-studied quantized topological number, and an additional contribution from the bulk-localized modes as a consequence of the Anderson localization. On the other hand, the edge index, which characterizes the averaged angular momentum of waves in the mobility gap, is uniquely associated with finite systems. Our main result proves that as the sample size tends to infinity, the edge index converges to the bulk index almost surely. Our findings provide a rigorous foundation for the bulk-edge correspondence principle for finite disordered systems. The existence of the Aizenman-Molchanov mobility gap is proved by the geometric decoupling method, introduced by Aizenman and Molchanov [Comm. Math. Phys., 1993], under a rational assumption on the distribution of the random potential. For completeness, all assumptions are checked on a prototypical model for (quantum) anomalous Hall physics.</description>

      <title>Reducibility of Cartesian product quantum graph equipped with group action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Cartesian product quantum graph $\Gamma_{n_1}\Box\Gamma_{n_2}$ with standard vertex conditions, and complete the decomposition of Hilbert space $L^2(\Gamma_{n_1}\Box\Gamma_{n_2})$ and the Laplacian $\mathscr{H}$ on it by employing the relevant theories of group representation. The concept of $\Gamma_{n_1}\Box\Gamma_{n_2}$ equipped with the action of the cyclic group $G_{n_1}\times G_{n_2}$ is defined through the introduction of periodic quantum graph and cyclic groups. We also constructed its quotient graph and accomplish the decomposition of its secular determinant. Furthermore, under the condition that $\gcd(n_1,n_2)=1$, it can be regarded as equivalent to a circulant graph $C_{n_1n_2}(n_1,n_2)$. This work also provides a new method for the construction of isospectral graphs.</description>

      <title>Near-critical Ising, sine-Gordon at the free fermion point, and bosonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the continuous correlations of the near-critical Ising model in two dimensions with plus boundary conditions, and prove that doubled correlation functions of primary fields (spin, disorder, fermions, energy) in the Ising model are given by correlation functions of the sine-Gordon model at the free fermion point. This is an instance of bosonization.
  The main ideas involve analyticity of correlation functions in a mass parameter in finite volume and proving that in a perturbative regime, the Taylor coefficients of the correlation functions match due to known bosonization results for the critical Ising model in terms of the Gaussian free field.
  The main techniques on the Ising side involve construction and precise estimates of certain massive holomorphic functions while on the sine-Gordon side, we control an iterated Mayer expansion with techniques going back to Brydges and Kennedy.</description>

      <title>The reversed "von Karman/Brazier effect" and a compendiary analytical solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the present study is to offer some accurate analytical formulae for the evaluation of the here defined reversed "von Karman/Brazier's effect", which may appear at first sight anomalous and has previously been noticed and successively explained using both Finite Element analyses and approximate analytical formulations. The proposed analytical formulae, based on the previous contribution of one of the present authors and on the Donnell's equations for cylindrical shells can be helpful in emphasizing the possible impact that some arrangements may have in various fields and especially in offshore engineering and can assist design calculations.</description>

      <title>A new group of transformations related to the Kullback-Leibler and R\'enyi divergences and universal classes of monotone measures of statistical complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a family of transformations, named \textit{divergence transformations}, interpolating between any pair of probability density functions sharing the same support. We prove the remarkable property that the whole family of Kullback-Leibler and R\'enyi divergences evolves in a monotone way with respect to the transformation parameter. Moreover, fixing the reference density, we show that the divergence transformations enjoy a group structure and can be derived through the algebraic conjugation of the recently introduced differential-escort transformations and their relative counterparts.
  This algebraic structure allows us to deform any density function in such a way its divergence with respect a fixed reference density might also increase as much as possible. We also establish the monotonicity of composed measures involving the proper Kullback-Leibler and R\'enyi divergences as well as other recently introduced relative measures of moment and Fisher types.
  As applications, an approximation scheme of general density functions by simple functions is provided. In addition, we give a number of analytical and numerical examples of interest in both regimes of increasing and decreasing divergence.</description>

      <title>An asymptotically compatible bond-based peridynamics with Gaussian kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel bond-based peridynamic model that utilizes a Gaussian kernel function. Previous peridynamic models, when directly discretized, have exhibited a lack of asymptotically compatibility with their corresponding local elastic solutions. Additionally, these models have faced challenges in accurately computing the volume of intersecting regions between the horizon of the material point and its neighboring cells. These difficulties in numerical simulations within peridynamics have spurred numerous efforts to develop corrective numerical methods. While such corrective methods have addressed certain issues, they remain complex to formulate and computationally intensive. Instead of addressing these challenges through modified numerical discretization, this paper presents a novel approach: bond-based peridynamics with a Gaussian kernel . This model replaces the bounded kernel function commonly used in existing peridynamic models with an unbounded Gaussian kernel function. Through direct meshfree discretization, we demonstrate that the solution of the proposed model , without the need for compatibility correction or volume correction, aligns with the corresponding local elastic solution. Furthermore, we derive the relevant material parameters based on energy equivalence to an elastic continuum model. Building upon this foundation, we propose a damage model and a linearized version of the proposed peridynamic model. We validate our proposed model through simulations of 2D smooth problems, demonstrating its convergence and accuracy. Finally, we assess the applicability of our approach to realistic scenarios by predicting displacements caused by a 2D plate with pre-existing cracks and replicating high-velocity impact results from the Kalthoff-Winkler experiments.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of solutions in high-energy x-ray based `eigenstrain tomography' and other inverse eigenstrain problems: Counter examples and necessary conditions for well-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstrain tomography combines diffraction-based strain measurement with elasticity theory to reconstruct full three-dimensional residual stress fields within solids. Notwithstanding a number of recent examples, the uniqueness of such reconstructions has not yet been clearly established. In this paper, we examine the underlying inverse problem in detail and construct explicit counterexamples demonstrating non-uniqueness for a recent implementation of x-ray eigenstrain tomography involving reconstruction from a single measured component of strain. We follow on to explore minimum conditions for well-posedness and conclude that the full elastic strain tensor within an isotropic sample can be uniquely reconstructed from three measured components; specifically the three shear components, or the three diagonal components. We further prove two key results related to eigenstrain reconstruction in a general sense; 1. That any possible residual stress field can be generated by a diagonal eigenstrain and 2. That residual stress fields exist that cannot be generated by isotropic eigenstrains. Together, these findings establish rigorous minimum experimental and computational requirements for well-posed eigenstrain tomography techniques and inverse eigenstrain problems in general.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Poisson brackets for the Camassa--Holm peakons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish quadratic Poisson brackets for the generalized Camassa--Holm peakon structure introduced in \cite{AFR23}. The calculation is based on the halving of the spectral parameter dependent $r$-matrix used to define the linear Poisson structure of this model. This quadratic structure, together with the linear one, establish the bi-Hamiltonian structure of the generalized Camassa--Holm peakon model. \\ When the deformation parameter tends to $\pm2$, the spectral parameter dependence drops out, and we recover the linear and quadratic Poisson structure of the Camassa--Holm peakon model. \\ When the spectral parameter tends to the fixed points of the involution defining the halving, we recover the Ragnisco--Bruschi deformation of the Camassa--Holm peakon model, thereby establishing its quadratic Poisson structure.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Koopman-von Neumann equations, their superpositions, orthogonality and uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formulation brings classical mechanics to Hilbert space, but many techniques familiar from quantum mechanics remain missing. One would hope to solve eigenvalue problems, obtain orthonormal eigenstates of Hermitian operators and ascribe meaning to a coherent superposition of states, among other things. Here we consider the general KvN equation for a classical probability amplitude and show that its so-called gauge freedom allows the separation of variables. The amenability to Hilbert-space methods of the resulting KvN solutions is investigated. We construct superpositions from differently-gauged Liouvillian eigenstates, and find an orthonormal set among them. We find that some separable solutions describe the canonical ensemble with temperature related to the separation constant. Classical uncertainty relations arise naturally in the KvN formalism. We discuss one between the dynamical time and the Liouvillian in terms of the statistical description of classical systems.</description>

      <title>The Arf-Brown-Kervaire invariant on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a lattice formulation of the Arf-Brown-Kervaire (ABK) invariant which takes values in $\mathbb{Z}_8$. Compared to the standard $\mathbb{Z}$-valued index, the ABK invariant is more involved in that it arises in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on two-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, and its definition contains an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues that requires proper regularization. We employ the massive Wilson Dirac operator, with and without domain-walls, on standard two-dimensional square lattices, and use its Pfaffian for the definition. Twisted boundary conditions and cross-caps, which reverse the orientation, are introduced to realize nontrivial topologies equipped with nontrivial $\mathrm{Pin}^{-}$ structures of Majorana fermions. We verify numerically (and partly analytically) that our formulation on a torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane (as well as its triple connected sum), and two types of M\"obius strip reproduces the known values in continuum theory.</description>

      <title>A review on combinatorial approach to aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a combinatorial approach to discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has been progressively developed. In this work, we review its achievements up to the present moment, focusing on the practical aspects and discussing its limitations. First, we present the assumptions and combinatorial foundations of the approach, which are based on direct counting of the system states, in contrast to the previous approaches of Smoluchowski and Marcus--Lushnikov. A method to obtain combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and the corresponding standard deviation is described by solving the simplest example of a constant kernel. Then, we extend consideration to a number of kernels (e.g., additive, product, linear--chain, condensation), which were recently solved by explicitly finding the number of internal states of the cluster of a given size. Next, we show that theoretical predictions for any given kernel may be obtained with no need to find an explicit solution but using a recursive expression. We exploit this opportunity to present the use of combinatorial expressions to solve kernels related to the real processes of aerosol growth and planetesimal formation. At this point, a comparison to numerical results appears. Other potential application fields are indicated, including dust agglomeration and polymer growth. Finally, issues related to the varying precision of the theoretical predictions are summarized. In the last section, we propose open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present different characterizations of the notion of irreducibility for Quantum Markov Semigroups (QMSs) and investigate its relationship with other relevant features of the dynamics, such as primitivity, positivity improvement and relaxation; in particular, we show that irreducibility, primitivity and relaxation towards a faithful invariant density are equivalent when the semigroup admits an invariant density. Moreover, in the case of uniformly continuous QMSs, we present several useful ways of checking irreducibility in terms of the operators appearing in the generator in GKLS form. Our exposition is as much self-contained as possible, we present some well known results with elementary proofs (collecting all the relevant literature) and we derive new ones. We study both finite and infinite dimensional evolutions and we remark that many results only require the QMS to be made of Schwarz maps.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann to Lindblad: Classical and Quantum Approaches to Out-of-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems play a central role in contemporary nanoscale technologies, including molecular electronics, quantum heat engines, quantum computation and information processing. A major theoretical challenge is to construct dynamical models that are simultaneously consistent with classical thermodynamics and complete positivity. In this work, we develop a framework that addresses this issue by extending classical stochastic dynamics to the quantum domain. We begin by formulating a generalized Langevin equation in which both friction and noise act symmetrically on the two Hamiltonian equations. From this, we derive a generalized Klein-Kramers equation expressed in terms of Poisson brackets, and we show that it admits the Boltzmann distribution as its stationary solution while satisfying the first and second laws of thermodynamics along individual trajectories. Applying canonical quantization to this classical framework yields two distinct quantum master equations, depending on whether the friction operators are taken to be Hermitian or non-Hermitian. By analyzing the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the conditions under which these equations reduce to a Lindblad-type generator. Our results demonstrate that complete positivity is ensured only when friction and noise are included in both Hamiltonian equations, thus fully justifying the classical construction. Moreover, we find that the friction coefficients must satisfy the same positivity condition in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian formulations, revealing a form of universality that transcends the specific operator representation. The formalism offers a versatile tool for deriving quantum versions of the thermodynamic laws and is directly applicable to a wide class of nonequilibrium nanoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Black Holes, far from Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As in thermodynamics, the celebrated first law of black hole mechanics relates infinitesimal changes in the properties of nearby equilibrium states of black holes (without reference to any physical process that causes the transition). The second law is a qualitative statement that the area of an event horizon cannot decrease under appropriate physical assumptions. These laws are generalized. The new first law applies to black holes in general relativity that can be arbitrarily far from equilibrium and refers to \emph{finite} changes that occur due to \emph{physical processes}. The new second law is a \emph{quantitative} statement that relates the change in the dynamical horizon area with the flux of energy falling into the black hole in a physical process.6</description>

Abstract: Motivated by some previously known facts from mathematical and physics literature, we explore certain relations between 3-dimensional topological gauge theories with continuous and finite gauge groups, commonly known as Chern-Simons (CS) and Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories, respectively. Specifically, we consider the continuous and finite gauge groups to be the same algebraic group over the complex numbers and a finite field, respectively. In this paper, we focus on the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ example and consider the relationship on the level of the corresponding partition functions on closed 3-manifolds. Mathematically, these are Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev and DW invariants. We find that the asymptotics of the DW theory when the number of elements of the finite field is large recovers the leading asymptotics of the CS theory at large level when the 3-manifold contains no hyperbolic components. As a byproduct, we develop efficient techniques to count the number of points over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ of $\mathrm{SL}(2)$ representation varieties of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds, possibly with weights pulled back from a chosen class in $H^3(\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{F}_q),\mathrm{U}(1))$.</description>

      <title>Spaces of states of the two-dimensional O(n) and Potts models</title>

Abstract: We determine the spaces of states of the two-dimensional $O(n)$ and $Q$-state Potts models with generic parameters $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ as representations of their known symmetry algebras. While the relevant representations of the conformal algebra were recently worked out, it remained to determine the action of the global symmetry groups: the orthogonal group for the $O(n)$ model, and the symmetric group $S_Q$ for the $Q$-state Potts model.
  We do this by two independent methods. First we compute the twisted torus partition functions of the models at criticality. The twist in question is the insertion of a group element along one cycle of the torus: this breaks modular invariance, but allows the partition function to have a unique decomposition into characters of irreducible representations of the global symmetry group.
  Our second method reduces the problem to determining branching rules of certain diagram algebras. For the $O(n)$ model, we decompose representations of the Brauer algebra into representations of its unoriented Jones--Temperley--Lieb subalgebra. For the $Q$-state Potts model, we decompose representations of the partition algebra into representations of the appropriate subalgebra. We find explicit expressions for these decompositions as sums over certain sets of diagrams, and over standard Young tableaux.
  We check that both methods agree in many cases. Moreover, our spaces of states are consistent with recent bootstrap results on four-point functions of the corresponding CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper unites two research lines. The first involves finding categorical models of quantum programming languages and their type systems. The second line concerns the program of quantization of mathematical structures, which amounts to finding noncommutative generalizations (also called quantum generalizations) of these structures. Using a quantization method called discrete quantization, which essentially amounts to the internalization of structures in a category of von Neumann algebras and quantum relations, we find a noncommutative generalization of $\omega$-complete partial orders (cpos), called quantum cpos. Cpos are central in domain theory, and are widely used to construct categorical models of programming languages. We show that quantum cpos have similar categorical properties to cpos and are therefore suitable for the construction of categorical models for quantum programming languages, which is illustrated with some examples. For this reason, quantum cpos may form the backbone of a future quantum domain theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14811v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the cyclic representations $\Omega_{rs}$ of $ U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ at $q^N=1$ that depend upon two points $r,s$ in the chiral Potts algebraic curve. We show how $\Omega_{rs}$ is related to the tensor product $\rho_r\otimes \bar{\rho}_s$ of two representations of the upper Borel subalgebra of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$. This result is analogous to the factorization property of the Verma module of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ at generic-$q$ in terms of two q-oscillator representation of the Borel subalgebra - a key step in the construction of the Q-operator. We construct short exact sequences of the different representations and use the results to construct Q operators that satisfy TQ relations for $q^N=1$ for both the 6-vertex and $\tau_2$ models.</description>

Abstract: In this review paper, we demonstrate that several classes of point processes in a locally compact Polish space $X$ appear as the joint spectral measure of a rigorously defined particle density of a representation of the canonical anticommutation relations (CAR) or the canonical commutation relations (CCR) in a Fock space. For these representations of the CAR/CCR, the vacuum state on the corresponding $*$-algebra is quasi-free. The classes of point process that arise in such a way include determinantal and permanental point processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-dimensional models of critical non-intersecting loops, there are $\ell$-leg fields that insert $\ell\in\mathbb{N}^*$ open loop segments, and diagonal fields that change the weights of closed loops. We conjecture an exact formula for 3-point functions of such fields on the sphere. In the cases of diagonal or spinless 2-leg fields, the conjecture agrees with known results from Conformal Loop Ensembles.
  We numerically compute 3-point functions in loop models on cylindrical lattices, using transfer matrix techniques. The results agree with the conjecture in almost all cases. We attribute the few discrepancies to difficulties that can arise in our lattice computation when the relevant modules of the unoriented Jones-Temperley--Lieb algebra have degenerate ground states.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations for the boundary-driven zero-range process on graphs: microscopic versus macroscopic approach and a theory of non-reversible resistor-like networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the joint large deviation rate functional in the limit of large time for the current flowing through the edges of a finite graph on which a boundary-driven system of stochastic particles evolves with zero-range dynamics.This generalizes one-dimensional results previously obtained with different approaches; our alternative techniques illuminate various connections and complementary perspectives. In particular, we here use a variational approach to derive the rate functional by contraction from a level 2.5 large deviation rate functional. We perform an exact minimization and finally obtain the rate functional as a variational problem involving a superposition of cost functions for each edge. The contributions from different edges are not independent since they are related by the values of a potential function on the nodes of the graph. The rate functional on the graph is a microscopic version of the continuous rate functional predicted by the macroscopic fluctuation theory, and we indeed show a convergence in the scaling limit. If we split the graph into two connected regions by a cutset and are interested just in the current flowing through the cutset, we find that the result is the same as that of an effective system composed of only one effective edge (as happens at macroscopic level and is expected also for other models). The characteristics of this effective edge are related to the ``capacities'' of the graph and can be obtained by a reduction using elementary transformations as in electrical networks; specifically, we treat components in parallel, in series, and in $N$-star configurations (reduced to effective complete $N$-graphs). Our reduction procedure is directly related to the reduction to the trace process and, since the dynamics is in general not reversible, it is also closely connected to the theory of non-reversible electrical networks.</description>

      <title>Normal forms of elliptic automorphic Lie algebras and Landau-Lifshitz type of equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present normal forms of elliptic automorphic Lie algebras with dihedral symmetry of order 4, which arise naturally in the context of Landau-Lifshitz type of equations. These normal forms provide a transparent description and allow a classification of such Lie algebras over $\mathbb{C}$. Using this perspective, we show that a Lie algebra introduced by Uglov, as well as the hidden symmetry algebra of the Landau-Lifshitz equation by Holod, are both isomorphic to an elliptic $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$-current algebra. Furthermore, we realise the Wahlquist-Estabrook algebra of the Landau-Lifshitz equation in terms of elliptic automorphic Lie algebras. This construction reveals that, as complex Lie algebras, it is isomorphic to the direct sum of an $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$-current algebra and the two-dimensional abelian Lie algebra $\mathbb{C}^2$. Finally, we explicitly implement the automorphic Lie algebra framework in the context of an $n$-component generalisation of the Landau-Lifshitz equation by Golubchik and Sokolov in the case of $n=3$.</description>

Abstract: We prove Hawking's singularity theorem for spacetime metrics of local Lipschitz regularity. The proof rests on (1) new estimates for the Ricci curvature of regularising smooth metrics that are based upon a quite general Friedrichs-type lemma and (2) the replacement of the usual focusing techniques for timelike geodesics -- which in the absence of a classical ODE-theory for the initial value problem are no longer available -- by a worldvolume estimate based on a segment-type inequality that allows one to control the volume of the set of points in a spacelike surface that possess long maximisers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time crystals are many-body systems whose ground state spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry and thus exhibits long-range spatiotemporal order and robust periodic motion. Using hydrodynamics, we have recently shown how an $m$th-order external packing field coupled to density fluctuations in driven diffusive fluids can induce the spontaneous emergence of time-crystalline order in the form of $m$ rotating condensates, which can be further controlled and modulated. Here we analyze this phenomenon at the microscopic level in a paradigmatic model of particle diffusion under exclusion interactions, a generalization of the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process with a configuration-dependent field called the time-crystal lattice gas. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize the nonequilibrium phase transition to these complex time-crystal phases for different values of $m$, including the order parameter, the susceptibility and the Binder cumulant, from which we measure the critical exponents, which turn out to be within the Kuramoto universality class for oscillator synchronization. We also elucidate the condensates density profiles and velocities, confirming along the way a scaling property predicted for the higher-order condensate shapes in terms of first-order ones, discussing also novel possibilities for this promising route to time crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a regularised Fermi projection of the Hamiltonian of the massless Dirac equation at Fermi energy zero. The matrix-valued symbol of the resulting operator is discontinuous in the origin. For this operator, we prove Szeg\H{o}-type asymptotics with the spatial cut-off domains given by $d$-dimensional cubes. For analytic test functions, we obtain a $d$-term asymptotic expansion and provide an upper bound of logarithmic order for the remaining terms. This bound does not depend on the regularisation. In the special case that the test function is given by a polynomial of degree less or equal than three, we prove a $(d+1)$-term asymptotic expansion with an error term of constant order. The additional term is of logarithmic order and its coefficient is independent of the regularisation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate hidden symmetries in minimally coupled scalar field cosmology within the FLRW universe, and a perfect fluid with and without interaction to the scalar field. We show that for an exponential potential there exists a set of canonical transformations through which the cosmological field equations can be recast in the form of a free particle in flat space. Based on this equivalence, we construct a mapping that generates cosmological solutions with interaction terms, corresponding to a chameleon mechanism. Finally, we discuss how this class of canonical transformations can relate the solution spaces of different cosmological models, such as of the scalar field and of the $\Lambda$-Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Diffusion as a Signature of Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While classical chaos is defined via a system's sensitive dependence on its initial conditions (SDIC), this notion does not directly extend to quantum systems. Instead, recent works have established defining both quantum and classical chaos via the sensitivity to adiabatic deformations and measuring this sensitivity using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP). Building on this formalism, we introduce the ``observable drift" as a probe of chaos in generic, non-Hamiltonian, classical systems. We show that this probe correctly characterizes classical systems that exhibit SDIC as chaotic. Moreover, this characterization is consistent with the measure-theoretic definition of chaos via weak mixing. Thus, we show that these two notions of sensitivity (to changes in initial conditions and to adiabatic deformations) can be probed using the same quantity, and therefore, are equivalent definitions of chaos. Numerical examples are provided via the tent map, the logistic map, and the Chirikov standard map.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Backgrounds and Background Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we describe how the study of backgrounds for general quantum systems can be formulated in terms of the representation theory of abstract $C^*$ algebras. We illustrate our general framework through two example systems: superconductivity and perturbative quantum gravity. In both cases, spontaneously broken symmetries imply the existence of unitarily inequivalent Hilbert spaces that play the role of distinct backgrounds relative to which observables are measured. Background independence can be realized by gauging the broken symmetry; extending the algebra of observables for the theory to include new physical processes that intertwine between these disjoint representations. From the point of view of the background independent theory, different backgrounds have an interpretation as different vacuum expectation values of these intertwining operators. In superconductivity, the intertwiners are intimately related to the Josephson effect. In gravity, they are related to geometric fluctuations. We explain how this framework is connected to recent work on generalized symmetries and algebraic extensions. To this end, we close with some remarks about how the operator algebra of a closed universe may arise from a generalized symmetry associated with an algebraic extension of the causal wedge by appealing to subregion-subalgebra duality.</description>

Abstract: We present an analytical many-body formalism for systems of spherical particles carrying arbitrary free charge distributions and interacting in a polarizable electrolyte solution, that we model within the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann framework. Building on the detailed spectral analysis of the associated nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators developed in our companion study arXiv:2512.08684, we construct exact explicit expansions of the electrostatic potential and energy in ascending orders of Debye screening thereby obtaining systematic "screening-ranged" series for potentials and energies. These screening-ranged expansions provide a unified and tractable description of many-body electrostatics. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by showing how it generalizes and improves upon both classical and modern methods, enabling rigorous treatment of heterogeneously charged systems (such as Janus particles) and accurate modeling of higher-order phenomena (such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, like-charge attraction) as well as yielding many-body generalizations to analytical explicit results previously known only in the two-body setting.</description>
