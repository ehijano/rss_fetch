      <title>A numerical algorithm for solving the coupled Schr\"odinger equations using inverse power method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse power method is a numerical algorithm to obtain the eigenvectors of a matrix. In this work, we develop an iteration algorithm, based on the inverse power method, to numerically solve the Schr\"odinger equation that couples an arbitrary number of components. Such an algorithm can also be applied to the multi-body systems. To show the power and accuracy of this method, we also present an example of solving the Dirac equation under the presence of an external scalar potential and a constant magnetic field, with source code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Physics Calculations with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an unprecedented ability to perform complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific reasoning. We demonstrate that with carefully designed prompts, LLMs can accurately carry out key calculations in research papers in theoretical physics. We focus on a broadly used approximation method in quantum physics: the Hartree-Fock method, requiring an analytic multi-step calculation deriving approximate Hamiltonian and corresponding self-consistency equations. To carry out the calculations using LLMs, we design multi-step prompt templates that break down the analytic calculation into standardized steps with placeholders for problem-specific information. We evaluate GPT-4's performance in executing the calculation for 15 research papers from the past decade, demonstrating that, with correction of intermediate steps, it can correctly derive the final Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian in 13 cases and makes minor errors in 2 cases. Aggregating across all research papers, we find an average score of 87.5 (out of 100) on the execution of individual calculation steps. Overall, the requisite skill for doing these calculations is at the graduate level in quantum condensed matter theory. We further use LLMs to mitigate the two primary bottlenecks in this evaluation process: (i) extracting information from papers to fill in templates and (ii) automatic scoring of the calculation steps, demonstrating good results in both cases. The strong performance is the first step for developing algorithms that automatically explore theoretical hypotheses at an unprecedented scale.</description>

      <title>Selected non-orthogonal configuration interaction with compressed single and double excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing both dynamic and static correlation accurately is a primary goal in electronic structure theory. Non-orthogonal configuration interaction (NOCI) is a versatile tool for treating static correlation, offering chemical insights by combining diverse reference states. Nevertheless, achieving quantitative accuracy requires the inclusion of missing dynamic correlation. This work introduces a framework for compressing orthogonal single and double excitations into an NOCI of a much smaller dimension. This compression is repeated with each Slater determinant in a reference NOCI, resulting in another NOCI that includes all its single and double excitations (NOCISD), effectively recovering the missing dynamic correlations from the reference. This compressed NOCISD is further refined through a selection process using metric and energy tests (SNOCISD). We validate the effectiveness of SNOCISD through its application to the dissociation of the nitrogen molecule and the hole-doped two-dimensional Hubbard model at various interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequential Computing: a quadratic run time advantage for all algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of computer called a quantum frequential computer. They harness quantum properties in a different way to conventional quantum computers to generate a quadratic computational run time advantage for all algorithms as a function of the power consumed. They come in two variants: type 1 can process classical algorithms only while type 2 can also process quantum ones. In a type-1 quantum frequential computer, only the control is quantum, while in a type 2 the logical space is also quantum. We also prove that a quantum frequential computer only requires a classical data bus to function. This is useful, because it means that only a relatively small part of the overall architecture of the computer needs to be quantum in a type-1 quantum frequential computer in order to achieve a quadratic run time advantage. As with classical and conventional quantum computers, quantum frequential computers also generate heat and require cooling. We also characterise these requirements.</description>

      <title>End-to-end variational quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing quantum correlations can enable sensing beyond the classical limits of precision, with the realization of such sensors poised for transformative impacts across science and engineering. Real devices, however, face the accumulated impacts of noise effects, architecture constraints, and finite sampling rates, making the design and success of practical quantum sensors challenging. Numerical and theoretical frameworks that support the optimization and analysis of imperfections from one end of a sensing protocol through to the other (i.e., from probe state preparation through to parameter estimation) are thus crucial for translating quantum advantage into widespread practice. Here, we present an end-to-end variational framework for quantum sensing protocols, where parameterized quantum circuits and neural networks form trainable, adaptive models for quantum sensor dynamics and estimation, respectively. The framework is general and can be adapted towards arbitrary qubit architectures, as we demonstrate with experimentally-relevant ans\"atze for trapped-ion and photonic systems, and enables to directly quantify the impacts that noisy state preparation/measurement and finite data sampling have on parameter estimation. End-to-end variational frameworks can thus underpin powerful design and analysis tools for realizing quantum advantage in practical, robust sensors.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum programming with PennyLane Lightning on HPC platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce PennyLane's Lightning suite, a collection of high-performance state-vector simulators targeting CPU, GPU, and HPC-native architectures and workloads. Quantum applications such as QAOA, VQE, and synthetic workloads are implemented to demonstrate the supported classical computing architectures and showcase the scale of problems that can be simulated using our tooling. We benchmark the performance of Lightning with backends supporting CPUs, as well as NVidia and AMD GPUs, and compare the results to other commonly used high-performance simulator packages, demonstrating where Lightning's implementations give performance leads. We show improved CPU performance by employing explicit SIMD intrinsics and multi-threading, batched task-based execution across multiple GPUs, and distributed forward and gradient-based quantum circuit executions across multiple nodes. Our data shows we can comfortably simulate a variety of circuits, giving examples with up to 30 qubits on a single device or node, and up to 41 qubits using multiple nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential tools for accelerating accurate large-scale atomistic simulations and crystal structure predictions. The polynomial MLPs, which are described by polynomial rotational invariants, have been systematically developed for many elemental and alloy systems. This study presents an efficient procedure for enumerating global minimum and metastable structures using robust polynomial MLPs. To develop MLPs that can handle the structure enumeration, performing random structure searches and updating MLPs are iteratively repeated. The current procedure is systematically applied to the elemental systems of As, Bi, Ga, In, La, P, Sb, Sn, and Te, with many local minimum structures competing with the global minimum structure in terms of energy. This procedure will significantly accelerate global structure searches and expand their search space.</description>

      <title>SCINE -- Software for Chemical Interaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The software for chemical interaction networks (SCINE) project aims at pushing the frontier of quantum chemical calculations on molecular structures to a new level. While calculations on individual structures as well as on simple relations between them (\textit{e.g.}, as given by an intrinsic reaction coordinate) have become routine in chemistry, new developments have pushed the frontier in the field to high-throughput calculations. Chemical relations may be created by a search for specific molecular properties in a molecular design attempt or they can be defined by a set of elementary reaction steps that form a chemical reaction network. The software modules of SCINE have been designed to facilitate such studies. The features of the modules are (i) general applicability of the applied methodologies ranging from electronic structure (no restriction to specific elements of the periodic table) to microkinetic modeling (with little restrictions on molecularity), full modularity so that SCINE modules can also be applied as stand-alone programs or be exchanged for external software packages that fulfill a similar purpose (to increase options for computational campaigns and to provide alternatives in case of tasks that are hard or impossible to accomplish with certain programs), (ii) high stability and autonomous operations so that control and steering by an operator is as easy as possible, and (iii) easy embedding into complex heterogeneous environments for molecular structures taken individually or in the context of a reaction network. A graphical user interface unites all modules and ensures interoperability. All components of the software have been made available open source and free of charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized composite dynamics (GCD) framework is presented for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). It leverages synergies of various simple collision operators to model complex physical processes. The framework is validated by recovering semi-permeable fluid flow methods. It provides mathematical justification for the incorporation of forces, addressing a gap in the literature. The versatility of this framework is demonstrated by analyzing a flux boundary condition. The GCD framework opens innovative possibilities for simulating complex physical processes using LBM.</description>

      <title>Fast and robust method for screened Poisson lattice Green's function using asymptotic expansion and Fast Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the lattice Green's function (LGF) of the screened Poisson equation on a two-dimensional rectangular lattice. This LGF arises in numerical analysis, random walks, solid-state physics, and other fields. Its defining characteristic is the screening term, which defines different regimes. When its coefficient is large, we can accurately approximate the LGF with an exponentially converging asymptotic expansion, and its convergence rate monotonically increases with the coefficient of the screening term. To tabulate the LGF when the coefficient is not large, we derive a one-dimensional integral representation of the LGF. We show that the trapezoidal rule can approximate this integral with exponential convergence, and we propose an efficient algorithm for its evaluation via the Fast Fourier Transform. We discuss applications including computing the LGF of the three-dimensional Poisson equation with one periodic direction and the return probability of a two-dimensional random walk with killing.</description>

      <title>Operator Learning Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general framework for quantum many-body simulations called the operator learning renormalization group (OLRG). Inspired by machine learning perspectives, OLRG is a generalization of Wilson's numerical renormalization group and White's density matrix renormalization group, which recursively builds a simulatable system to approximate a target system of the same number of sites via operator maps. OLRG uses a loss function to minimize the error of a target property directly by learning the operator map in lieu of a state ansatz. This loss function is designed by a scaling consistency condition that also provides a provable bound for real-time evolution. We implement two versions of the operator maps for classical and quantum simulations. The former, which we call the Operator Matrix Map, can be implemented via neural networks on classical computers. The latter, which we call the Hamiltonian Expression Map, generates device pulse sequences to leverage the capabilities of quantum computing hardware. We illustrate the performance of both maps for calculating time-dependent quantities in the quantum Ising model Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: A new computational method to solve the hyperbolic (Vlasov) equation coupled to the elliptic (Poisson-like) equation at the polar axis is proposed. It is shown that the value of a scalar function at the polar axis can be predicted by its neighbouring values based on the continuity condition. This continuity condition systematically solves the pole problems including the singular factor 1/r in the hyperbolic equation and the inner boundary in the elliptic equation. The proposed method is applied to the global gyrokinetic simulation of the tokamak plasma with the magnetic axis included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI) technique offers unique insights into the nanoscale world, enabling the reconstruction of 3D structures with a nanoscale resolution achieved through computational phase reconstruction from measured scattered intensity maps. Computational demands of 3D CXDI, however, limit its real-time application in experimental settings. This work presents a carousel phase retrieval algorithm (CPRA) that enables the real-time, high-resolution reconstruction of computationally complex 3D objects. CPRA is based on representing the 3D reconstruction problem as a set of 2D reconstructions of projected images corresponding to different experimentally collected angles via the Fourier slice theorem. Consistency between the 2D reconstructed images is based on an iterative procedure, in which each 2D reconstruction accounts for the adjacent 2D reconstructed images in a periodic (carousel) manner. Demonstrations on complex systems, including a lithium-rich layered oxide particle and a Staphylococcus aureus biological cell, demonstrate that CPRA significantly enhances the reconstruction quality and enables the reconstruction process to be completed in real time during experiment.</description>

Abstract: We report a detailed study of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in helium. When comparing predictions from a single-active-electron model with those from all-electron simulations, such as ATTOMESA and R-matrix with time-dependence, which can include different numbers of states in the close-coupling expansion, it seems imperative to generate absolute numbers for the HHG spectrum in a well-defined framework. While qualitative agreement in the overall frequency dependence of the spectrum, including the cut-off frequency predicted by a semi-classical model, can be achieved by many models in arbitrary units, only absolute numbers can be used for benchmark comparisons between different approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exact exchange and correlation contributions are known to crucially affect electronic states, which in turn govern covalent bond formation and breaking in chemical species. Empirically averaging the exact exchange admixture and the amount of correlation over configurational and compositional degrees of freedom, hybrid density functional approximations (DFAs) have been widely successful, yet have fallen short to reach explicitly correlated high level quantum chemistry accuracy in general. Using quantum machine learning, we have adaptified hybrid DFAs by generating optimal admixture ratios of exact exchange or of correlation "on the fly", specifically for any chemical compound. Adaptive exchange in the PBE0 hybrid DFA yields atomization energies sufficiently accurate to effectively cure the infamous spin gap problem in DFT, and also improves electron densities, and HOMO-LUMO gaps in organic molecules. Using adaptive PBE0, we revised the entire QM9 data set presenting more accurate quantum properties that include, on average, stronger covalent binding, larger band-gaps, more localized electron densities, and slightly larger dipole-moments. Adaptive PBE correlation (in conjunction with 100% HF exchange) also affords much improved atomization energies, and even enables covalent bond dissociation.</description>
