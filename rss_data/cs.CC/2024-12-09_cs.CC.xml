      <title>Reduction from the partition problem: Dynamic lot sizing problem with polynomial complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we reduce an instance of the partition problem to a dynamic lot sizing problem in polynomial time, and show that solving the latter problem solves the former problem. We further show that the instance of the partition problem can be solved using polynomial number of addition, multiplication and sort operations in input data using the reduction.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the set of zero-noise limits measures of perturbed cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We add small random perturbations to a cellular automaton and consider the one-parameter family $(F_\epsilon)_{\epsilon&gt;0}$ parameterized by $\epsilon$ where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is the level of noise. The objective of the article is to study the set of limiting invariant distributions as $\epsilon$ tends to zero denoted $\Ml$. Some topological obstructions appear, $\Ml$ is compact and connected, as well as combinatorial obstructions as the set of cellular automata is countable: $\Ml$ is $\Pi_3$-computable in general and $\Pi_2$-computable if it is uniformly approached. Reciprocally, for any set of probability measures $\mathcal{K}$ which is compact, connected and $\Pi_2$-computable, we construct a cellular automaton whose perturbations by an uniform noise admit $\mathcal{K}$ as the zero-noise limits measure and this set is uniformly approached. To finish, we study how the set of limiting invariant measures can depend on a bias in the noise. We construct a cellular automaton which realizes any connected compact set (without computable constraints) if the bias is changed for an arbitrary small value. In some sense this cellular automaton is very unstable with respect to the noise.</description>

      <title>CMSO-transducing tree-like graph decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that given a graph G we can CMSO-transduce its modular decomposition, its split decomposition and its bi-join decomposition. This improves results by Courcelle [Logical Methods in Computer Science, 2006] who gave such transductions using order-invariant MSO, a strictly more expressive logic than CMSO. Our methods more generally yield C2MSO-transductions of the canonical decomposition of weakly-partitive set systems and weakly-bipartitive systems of bipartitions.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Bootstrapping of Hitting Sets for Algebraic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.06323v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $ \newcommand{\inparen}[1]{\left( #1 \right)} \newcommand{\pfrac}[2]{\inparen{\frac{1}{2}}} \newcommand{\ilog}[1]{\log^{\circ #1}} \newcommand{\F}{\mathbb{F}} $The Polynomial Identity Lemma (also called the "Schwartz--Zippel lemma") states that any nonzero polynomial $f(x_1,\ldots, x_n)$ of degree at most $s$ will evaluate to a nonzero value at some point on any grid $S^n \subseteq \F^n$ with $|S| &gt; s$. Thus, there is an explicit hitting set for all $n$-variate degree-$s$, size-$s$ algebraic circuits of size $(s+1)^n$.
  In this paper, we prove the following results:
  $\bullet$ Let $\epsilon &gt; 0$ be a constant. For a sufficiently large constant $n$, and all $s &gt; n$, if we have an explicit hitting set of size $(s+1)^{n-\epsilon}$ for the class of $n$-variate degree-$s$ polynomials that are computable by algebraic circuits of size $s$, then for all large $s$, we have an explicit hitting set of size $s^{\exp(\exp (O(\log^\ast s)))}$ for $s$-variate circuits of degree $s$ and size $s$.
  That is, if we can obtain a barely non-trivial exponent (a factor-$s^{\Omega(1)} $ improvement) compared to the trivial $(s+1)^{n}$-size hitting set even for constant-variate circuits, we can get an almost complete derandomization of PIT.
  $\bullet$ The above result holds when "circuits" are replaced by "formulas" or "algebraic branching programs."
  This extends a recent surprising result of Agrawal, Ghosh and Saxena (STOC 2018, PNAS 2019) who proved the same conclusion for the class of algebraic circuits, if the hypothesis provided a hitting set of size at most $\inparen{s^{n^{0.5 - \delta}}}$ (where $\delta&gt; 0$ is any constant). Hence, our work significantly weakens the hypothesis of Agrawal, Ghosh and Saxena to only require a slightly non-trivial saving over the trivial hitting set, and also presents the first such result for algebraic formulas.</description>

      <title>Shrinkage under Random Projections, and Cubic Formula Lower Bounds for $\mathsf{AC}^0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\newcommand{\ACz}{\mathbf{AC}^0}$ H\r{a}stad showed that any De Morgan formula (composed of AND, OR and NOT gates) shrinks by a factor of $\tilde{O}(p^{2})$ under a random restriction that leaves each variable alive independently with probability $p$ [SICOMP, 1998]. Using this result, he gave an $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{3})$ formula size lower bound for the Andreev function, which, up to lower order improvements, remains the state-of-the-art lower bound for any explicit function.
  In this paper, we extend the shrinkage result of H\r{a}stad to hold under a far wider family of random restrictions and their generalization -- random projections. Based on our shrinkage results, we obtain an $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{3})$ formula size lower bound for an explicit function computable in $\ACz$. This improves upon the best known formula size lower bounds for $\ACz$, that were only quadratic prior to our work. In addition, we prove that the KRW conjecture [Karchmer et al., Computational Complexity 5(3/4), 1995] holds for inner functions for which the unweighted quantum adversary bound is tight. In particular, this holds for inner functions with a tight Khrapchenko bound.
  Our random projections are tailor-made to the function's structure so that the function maintains structure even under projection -- using such projections is necessary, as standard random restrictions simplify $\ACz$ circuits. In contrast, we show that any De Morgan formula shrinks by a quadratic factor under our random projections, allowing us to prove the cubic lower bound.
  Our proof techniques build on H\r{a}stad's proof for the simpler case of balanced formulas. This allows for a significantly simpler proof at the cost of slightly worse parameters. As such, when specialized to the case of $p$-random restrictions, our proof can be used as an exposition of H\r{a}stad's result.</description>

      <title>On a class of interdiction problems with partition matroids: complexity and polynomial-time algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a class of linear matroid interdiction problems, where the feasible sets for the upper-level decision-maker (referred to as a leader) and the lower-level decision-maker (referred to as a follower) are induced by two distinct partition matroids with a common weighted ground set. Unlike classical network interdiction models where the leader is subject to a single budget constraint, in our setting, both the leader and the follower are subject to several independent capacity constraints and engage in a zero-sum game. While the problem of finding a maximum weight independent set in a partition matroid is known to be polynomially solvable, we prove that the considered bilevel problem is $NP$-hard even when the weights of ground elements are all binary. On a positive note, it is revealed that, if the number of capacity constraints is fixed for either the leader or the follower, then the considered class of bilevel problems admits several polynomial-time solution schemes. Specifically, these schemes are based on a single-level dual reformulation, a dynamic programming-based approach, and a greedy algorithm for the leader.</description>

      <title>Perfect sampling from rapidly mixing Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that efficient approximate sampling algorithms, combined with a slow exponential time oracle for computing its output distribution, can be combined into constructing efficient perfect samplers, which sample exactly from a target distribution with zero error upon termination. This extends a classical reduction of Jerrum, Valiant and Vazirani, which says that for self-reducible problems, deterministic approximate counting can be used to construct perfect samplers. We provide two surprisingly simple constructions, and our perfect samplers run in polynomial time both in expectation and with high probability.
  An overwhelming amount of efficient approximate sampling algorithms are based on Markov chains. Informally, we show that any Markov chains with absolute spectral gap $\gamma$ can be converted into a perfect sampler with expected time $O\left(\frac{1}{\gamma}\ln\frac{|\Omega|}{\pi_{*}}\right)$, where $\pi_{*}$ is the minimum probability in the stationary distribution. This is also the best possible bound for mixing time to achieve approximate sampling from a spectral gap, and we are able to do perfect sampling in the same time bound in expectation.
  We also highlight a number of applications where we either get the first perfect sampler up to the uniqueness regime (roughly speaking, everywhere except where NP-hardness results are known), or the fastest perfect sampler known to date. Remarkably, we are able to get the first perfect sampler for perfect matchings of bipartite graphs based on the celebrated Jerrum-Sinclair-Vigoda algorithm.</description>
