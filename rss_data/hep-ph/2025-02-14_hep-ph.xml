      <title>Multimessenger Astronomy Beyond the Standard Model: New Window from Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic (ULB) fields with mass $m_{\phi} \ll 1$ eV often arise in theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). If such fields exist, violent astrophysical events that result in emission of gravitational wave, photon, or neutrino signals could also produce bursts of high-density relativistic ULB fields. Detection of such ULB fields in terrestrial or space-based laboratories correlated with other signals from transient astrophysical events opens a novel avenue for multimessenger astronomy. We show that quantum sensors are particularly well-suited to observe emitted scalar and pseudoscalar axion-like ULB fields coupled to SM. We demonstrate that multimessenger astronomy with ULB fields is possible even when accounting for matter screening effects.</description>

      <title>Flipped Rotating Axion Non-minimally Coupled to Gravity: Baryogenesis and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the co-genesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be achieved through the rotation of an axion-like particle, driven by a flip in the vacuum manifold's direction at the end of inflation. This can occur if the axion has a periodic non-minimal coupling to gravity, while preserving the discrete shift symmetry. In non-oscillating inflation models, after inflation there is typically a period of kination (with $w = 1$). In this case, it is shown that the vacuum manifold of the axion is flipped and the axion begins rotating in field space, because it can slide across the decreasing potential barrier as in Ricci reheating. Such a rotating axion can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through spontaneous baryogenesis, while at later epochs it can oscillate as dark matter. The period of kination makes the primordial gravitational waves (GW) generated during inflation sharply blue-tilted which constrains the parameter space due to GW overproduction, while being testable by next generation CMB experiments. As a concrete example, we show that such a cogenesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be realized for the axion as the Majoron in the Type-I seesaw setup, predicting mass ranges for the Majoron below sub eVs, with right-handed neutrino mass above $\mathcal{O}(10^{8})$ GeV. We also show that in order to avoid fragmentation of the axion condensate during the rotation, we require the non-minimal coupling \mbox{$\xi \sim (f/m_P)^2 $} or somewhat larger, where $f$ is the axion decay constant.</description>

      <title>Conversions in two-component dark sectors: a phase space level analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversions between the states in the dark sector affect not only their number densities but also their momentum distributions. In this work we study a phenomenologically motivated two-component dark matter scenario, based on the Coy Dark Matter model, in order to quantify the effect of conversions on departure from kinetic equilibrium and consequently the relic abundance. We perform a detailed numerical analysis at the level of the phase space distributions of dark sector particles, implementing all the relevant processes, including conversions, elastic scatterings and annihilations. Focusing on the parameter regions that lead to the observed relic abundance and provide a good fit to the Galactic Centre excess, we find that departure from kinetic equilibrium can alter the predictions for the total abundance by more than $100\%$, while in most of the interesting parameter space being in the range from around $-20\%$ to $50\%$. The effect on each dark matter constituent separately can be much larger, even up to an order of magnitude, which can significantly affect the expected present-day gamma ray flux, and consequently phenomenology of the model.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Gauge Ambiguities for DUNE Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The de Forest prescription for handling off-shell initial states in the impulse approximation for lepton-nucleus scattering breaks gauge invariance. We discuss existing methods to address this problem and handle the form factor scale ambiguity. We demonstrate that the irreducible differences between the prescriptions are significant compared to the precision expected of next-generation accelerator neutrino experiments. A novel approach directly using the off-shell currents is proposed as a systematically improvable alternative.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy from Time Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze a scalar field model which gives rise to stable bound states in field space characterized by nonzero motion that breaks the underlying time translation symmetry of its Hamiltonian, known as time crystals. We demonstrate that an ideal fluid made up of these time crystals behaves as phantom dark energy characterized by an equation of state $w \le -1$, speed of sound squared $c_{s}^{2} &gt; 0$, and nonnegative energy density $\rho \ge 0$.</description>

      <title>Probing Gluon Shadowing in Heavy Nuclei through Bayesian Reweighting of J/$\psi$ Photoproduction in Ultra-Peripheral Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gluon distribution in nuclei plays a pivotal role in understanding quantum chromodynamics (QCD) under extreme nuclear environments, yet remains poorly constrained compared to quark distributions. Coherent \jpsi photoproduction in ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions ($\gamma + A \rightarrow \mathrm{J}/\psi + A$) provides a unique solution to this challenge, serving as a sensitive probe of nuclear gluon densities. In this study, we perform Bayesian reweighting on the EPPS21 and nCTEQ15 sets of nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDF) by incorporating coherent \jpsi photoproduction measurements from both RHIC and LHC. The Bayesian-reweighted gluon modification factors $\mathrm{R_g^{A}}(x, Q^2 = 2.4\ \mathrm{GeV}^2)$ reveal pronounced nuclear shadowing in the Pb nuclei, with $\mathrm{R_g^{\mathrm{Pb}}} \approx 0.60$ at $x = 10^{-4}$, while simultaneously achieving a great reduction of the uncertainties in the density of the gluon across the critical Bjorken-$x$ range $10^{-5} &lt; x &lt; 10^{-3}$ compared to initial predictions of the nPDF. This work establishes coherent \jpsi photoproduction as a precision tool for gluon nPDF extraction, overcoming traditional deep-inelastic scattering limitations through perturbative QCD-calibrated probes. The constrained nPDFs demonstrate improved consistency with the experimental data across collider energies, particularly in the shadowing-dominated regime.</description>

      <title>Precision tools for the simulation of double-Higgs production via vector-boson fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two precision tools for the simulation of Higgs-pair production via vector-boson fusion in the kappa framework for the parameterization of non-standard Higgs couplings. A new implementation of the process is developed in the framework of the POWHEG BOX program that can be used to provide predictions at the next-to-leading order (NLO) of QCD matched to parton showers (PS). In addition, the existing proVBFHH program for the computation of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD and next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections is extended to account for values of the Higgs couplings different from the expectation of the Standard Model. We systematically compare and analyse predictions obtained with the two programs and find that the NLO+PS predictions provide a good approximation of the NNLO results for observables of the tagging jets and Higgs bosons. The results turn out to be very sensitive to the values of the modified Higgs couplings.</description>

      <title>Double Higgs Production in Vector Boson Fusion at NLO QCD in HEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to Higgs boson pair production in vector boson fusion, including the leading operators in the framework of Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT). The corresponding calculation is based on an automated interface between the Monte Carlo event generator Whizard and the one-loop amplitude generator GoSam. The QCD corrections also include non-factorising diagrams and diagrams of Higgs-Strahlung type, thus going beyond the structure function approach. We find that some constellations of anomalous couplings, while being well within the current experimental constraints, can have a significant impact on the shape of typical observables for this process.</description>

      <title>Rare $W \to B_c + \gamma$ decay up to the NNLO and NLL accuracy in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed theoretical study of the rare radiative decay of the $W$ boson into a $B_c$ meson and an on-shell photon. The decay amplitude is described by two independent form factors, which are calculated up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD within the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization formalism. Since the two typical energy scales, the $W$-boson mass $m_W$ and the $B_c$-meson mass $m_{B_c}$, involved in the process are widely separated, large logarithms of $m_W^2/m_{B_c}^2$ present in the NRQCD short-distance coefficients are also resummed to all orders in $\alpha_s$ up to the next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, by employing the light-cone factorization approach. Taking into account all these corrections, we then perform a phenomenological exploration of this rare decay. It is found that, relative to the leading-order result, the decay width of the process is reduced by the next-to-leading-order and NNLO corrections, with a net effect of $\sim19\%$ and of $\sim31\%$, respectively. Furthermore, the NLL resummation can considerably alter the fixed-order NRQCD predictions, especially for the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ correction. We also find that the radiative corrections increase the renormalization scale dependence of the branching fraction, which is however significantly reduced by the NLL resummation. The dependence of the branching fraction on the heavy-quark masses $m_{b,c}$ is also investigated, which shows a monotonic decrease (increase) with $m_c$ ($m_b$).</description>

      <title>Spectral diversity in collisional neutrino-flavor conversion: flavor equipartition or swap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum kinetics of neutrinos are known to potentially change the classical neutrino radiation field in high-energy astrophysical sources such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers. However, the mixing phenomena still have open issues in the nonlinear dynamics and the asymptotic states, particularly for recently discovered collision-induced flavor conversion. In this paper, we investigate linear and nonlinear dynamics of collisional neutrino-flavor conversion (CFC) with multi-energy neutrino gases through numerical simulations, demonstrating that the asymptotic states dramatically change depending on unstable modes dominating the system. In one unstable mode, high-energy neutrinos reach a flavor equipartition, but low-energy neutrinos return back to almost their initial states. In contrast, in the other one, rather low-energy neutrinos achieve a full flavor swap, but high-energy neutrinos undergo less flavor conversion. We clarify the distinct spectral behaviors in two different ways based on stability analysis and flavor pendulum. Our result suggests that CFC with flavor swap can become crucial at deeper radii with low electron fraction and requires more detailed theoretical modeling of neutrino quantum kinetics.</description>

      <title>Emergent large flavor mixing from canonical and inverse seesaws?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the canonical seesaw mechanism provides a most natural qualitative interpretation of tiny masses for the three active neutrinos, it offers no explanation for their large flavor mixing effects. The latter can be regarded as an emergent consequence of this mechanism, in which case we are left with an intriguing cross seesaw framework in the mass basis of all the six Majorana neutrinos. To lower the mass scales of heavy neutrinos, one is motivated to invoke the inverse seesaw mechanism but has to pay the price for a fine-tuned cancellation between its two sets of new degrees of freedom, in which case the largeness of active flavor mixing is an emergent phenomenon as well. A comparison between the approximate seesaw relations in the flavor basis and those exact ones in the mass basis is also made.</description>

      <title>Power corrections to the production of a color-singlet final state in hadron collisions in the N-jettiness slicing scheme at NLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute next-to-leading power corrections in the zero-jettiness variable for the production of colorless final states at hadron colliders at next-to-leading order in QCD. To assess if the process-independence of leading power contributions can be extended, we attempt to construct generic expansions of phase spaces and matrix elements squared through next-to-leading power in the zero-jettiness. We highlight challenges associated with the collinear limit, where universality no longer holds at the subleading power, making the result process-dependent. We show that quantities that need to be calculated in the collinear limit can be obtained using Berends-Giele currents, enabling computation of power corrections to high-multiplicity final states. As a concrete example, we apply our method to compute power corrections in the zero-jettiness for lepton pair as well as multi-photon production in $q \bar q$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Non-renormalizable grand unification utilizing the leptoquark mechanism of neutrino mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a non-supersymmetric, non-renormalizable grand unified theory whose particle content is that of the Georgi-Glashow model augmented only by scalars from the \textbf{10} and \textbf{35} representations. A prediction of our model is a color sextet, weak isodoublet whose mass lies at 1 TeV (10 TeV) and that does not couple to Standard Model fermions at tree level. The leptoquark mechanism through which Majorana neutrinos radiatively acquire their masses relates the neutrino mass matrix to that of the down-type quarks. A consequence of this relation and perturbativity of coupling constants is the upper bound of $2.5 \times 10^{15}$ GeV on the masses of the scalar leptoquarks $S_1^*$ and ${\widetilde R}_{2}$. Electroweak mixing of these leptoquarks induces a B-L violating decay of the proton which indirectly contrains the mass of ${\widetilde R}_{2}$ to be greater than $2.1 \times 10^9$ GeV. We find the grand unification scale to exceed $1.4 \times 10^{16}$ GeV in all scenarios considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in research and experimentation have led to the identification of numerous exotic states in particle physics. Each new discovery not only sparks excitement for future findings but also fuels interest in uncovering additional unknown states. Motivated by this perspective and the recent identification of both standard and exotic hadrons with an increasing number of heavy quarks, this study conducts a spectroscopic analysis of possible pentaquark candidates with spin-parity $\frac{1}{2}^-$, and quark content of $cccb\bar{c}$ and $bbbc\bar{b}$. The masses of these states are calculated by considering the relevant Lorentz structures, including $\slashed{p}$ and $\mathbbm{1}$, yielding the following results, respectively: for the $P_{(4cb)}$ state, $m_{P_{(4cb)}} = 11388.30 \pm 107.79$~MeV and $m_{P_{(4cb)}} = 11368.30 \pm 112.68$~MeV, and for the $P_{(4bc)}$ state, $m_{P_{(4bc)}} = 20998.30 \pm 121.52$~MeV and $m_{P_{(4bc)}} = 20990.50 \pm 125.87$~MeV. Additionally, the current coupling constants of these states to the vacuum, which are essential for analyzing their potential decay modes, are also provided in this study.</description>

Abstract: We present a machine-learning-based workflow to model an unbinned likelihood from its samples. A key advancement over existing approaches is the validation of the learned likelihood using rigorous statistical tests of the joint distribution, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the joint distribution. Our method enables the reliable communication of experimental and phenomenological likelihoods for subsequent analyses. We demonstrate its effectiveness through three case studies in high-energy physics. To support broader adoption, we provide an open-source reference implementation, nabu.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Masses and Phenomenology in Nnaturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that $N$naturalness scenarios have an intrinsic mechanism to suppress neutrino masses. As in other infrared neutrino mass models like extra-dimensional theories or many species theories, the large number of mixing partners is responsible for the neutrino mass suppression. It is shown how neutrino mass matrices arise in $N$naturalness models and the resulting neutrino mixing is analyzed. The first result is that a totally democratic coupling among the different sectors like in the original models is already ruled out by the fact that neutrinos are not massless. In the case where the sector couplings deviate from the intersector ones a tower of additional neutrino mass eigenstates appears whose difference between the squared masses, $\Delta m_{ij}^2$, is determined fully by the theory. The resulting phenomenology of such a tower is investigated and the unique signals in neutrino oscillation experiments, neutrino mass measurements, and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments are discussed. This opens the door for terrestrial tests of $N$naturalness whose phenomenology was so far focused on Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI-assisted Optimization for Feynman Integral Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to optimizing the reduction of Feynman integrals using integration-by-parts identities. By developing a priority function through the FunSearch algorithm, which combines large language models and genetic algorithms, we achieve significant improvements in memory usage and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods. Our approach demonstrates substantial reductions in the required seeding integrals, making previously intractable integrals more manageable. Tested on a variety of Feynman integrals, including one-loop and multi-loop cases with planar and non-planar configurations, our method demonstrates remarkable scalability and adaptability. For reductions of certain Feynman integrals with many dots and numerators, we observed an improvement by a factor of 3058 compared to traditional methods. This work provides a powerful and interpretable framework for optimizing IBP reductions, paving the way for more efficient and practical calculations in high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the constraints on superluminal neutrino Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) parameters from the observation of the ultra-high-energy event KM3-230213A by KM3NeT collaboration in cases of linear $n=1$ and quadratic $n=2$ LIV scenarios. Assuming extragalactic origin of the event, we obtain the constraints on LIV mass scale $\Lambda_{n=1} = 5.4 \times 10^{30}\, \mbox{GeV}$ and $\Lambda_{n=2} = 3.5 \times 10^{19}\, \mbox{GeV}$ from the absence of neutrino splitting.</description>

      <title>Cosmological phase transitions from the functional measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how competitive gravitational wave detectors can be to current and near-future colliders in probing a model where the new physics is completely encapsulated in a modified scalar sector. For this, we study a model where an additional logarithmic term arises in the scalar potential due to a non-trivial path integral measure, which is constructed using effective field theory. This new term alters the dynamics of cosmological phase transitions and could lead to potentially detectable gravitational waves from the early Universe. Our results confirm the expectation that the intensity of such spectrum is highly correlated to the scalar field's self-coupling, and that gravitational wave experiments could therefore be used to probe these couplings with an accuracy competitive with the projected sensitivity of near-future colliders.</description>

      <title>$B\to K\sf{+}invisible$, dark matter, and $CP$ violation in hyperon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the Belle II Collaboration has reported a measurement of the $B^+\to K^+\nu\bar\nu$ rate that is higher than the standard-model expectation. Since the emitted neutrinos are unobserved, the excess could be due to the $B^+$ decaying into a $K^+$ and a dark-matter pair. We entertain this possibility in a two-Higgs-doublet model supplemented with a real singlet scalar boson acting as the dark matter. This model also accommodates strangeness-changing interactions providing new sources of $CP$ violation which can affect hyperon and kaon nonleptonic transitions. We find that the resulting $CP$ violation in the hyperon sector can be significant, reaching the current empirical bounds, after taking into account constraints from kaon mixing and decay and from dark-matter relic-density data and direct searches including the Migdal effect. We demonstrate that the hyperon and kaon processes are complementary probes of this new-physics scenario. Its prediction for sizable hyperon $CP$ violation is potentially testable in ongoing experiments, such as BESIII, Belle II, and LHCb, and in next-generation ones like PANDA and at the Super Tau Charm Facility.</description>

      <title>Conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop: Backreaction in the in-in formalism and Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the superhorizon-limit curvature perturbations are conserved at one-loop level in single-field inflation models with a transient non-slow-roll period. We take the spatially-flat gauge, where the backreaction plays a crucial role for the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations unless the counter terms are tuned. We calculate the backreaction with the in-in formalism. In addition, we explicitly show the renormalization of the UV divergences with the counter terms.</description>

      <title>Internal color contributions to flux tube entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work arXiv:2410.00112, we introduced and computed entanglement entropy of the color flux tube (FTE$^2$) between a heavy quark-antiquark pair in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory. Our numerical results suggest that FTE$^2$ can be partitioned into a component corresponding to transverse vibrations of the flux tube and an internal color entropy. Further, motivated by analytical (1+1)D calculations, and SU(2) (2+1)D Yang-Mills numerical results, we argued that the internal entropy takes the form $\langle F\rangle\log(N_c)$, with $\langle F\rangle$ the number of times, on average, that the flux tube crossed a boundary between region $V$ and its complement. We extend here our FTE$^2$ study to consider different geometries of region $V$, varying the number of boundary crossings, and number of colors. Our preliminary results support the conjectured form of the internal entropy, albeit with noteworthy subtleties relating to the partial/full intersections of the flux tube with the region $V$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-parity ($C\!P$) violation in the tau-charm energy region is a promising area for sensitive tests of Standard Model (SM) predictions and searches for new, beyond the SM physics. A future Tau-Charm Facility that operates at center-of-mass energies between 2.0 and 7.0 GeV, with a peak luminosity of $0.5\times10^{35}$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, would provide huge numbers of hadrons and tau ($\tau$) leptons that are produced in low-background environments and with well understood kinematic properties. In this report, prospects for unique studies of $C\!P$ violation in the decay of charmed hadrons, and in the production and decay of hyperons and $\tau$ leptons at a next-generation tau-charm facility are discussed. In addition, opportunities for improved tests of $CPT$ invariance test in $K^{0}-\bar{K}^{0}$ mixing are presented.</description>

      <title>Searching for axion dark matter gegenschein of the Vela supernova remnant with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions are one of the leading dark matter candidates. If we are embedded in a Milky Way dark matter halo comprised of axions, their stimulated decay would enable us to observe a counterimage (``axion gegenschein") with a frequency equal to half the axion mass in the opposite direction of a bright radio source. This spectral line emission will be broadened to $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim \sigma_d/c \sim 10^{-3}$ due to the velocity dispersion of dark matter, $\sigma_d$. In this pilot study, we perform the first search for the expected axion gegenschein image of Vela supernova remnant (SNR) with 26.4 hours of effective ON-OFF data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) L-band (1.0 - 1.5~GHz) 19-beam receiver. Our null detection limits the axion-photon coupling strength to be $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ in the mass ranges of $8.7\,\mu\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 9.44\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ and $10.85\,\mu\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 12.01\,\mu\mathrm{eV} $. These results provide a stronger constraint on $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ in this axion mass range than the current limits obtained by the direct search of axion decay signal from galaxy clusters which uses FAST observations, but is a factor of $\sim 3$ times weaker than the current CAST limit.Based on our observation strategy, data processing methods, and results, the expected sensitivity will reach $\sim 10^{-11}\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ with $\sim 2000$ hours of observation in the future.</description>

      <title>A First Look at Quartic-in-Spin Binary Dynamics at Third Post-Minkowskian Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the conservative and radiation-reaction contributions to classical observables in the gravitational scattering between a spinning and a spinless black hole to the fourth order in spin and third order in the gravitational constant. The conservative results are obtained from two-loop amplitudes for the scattering process of a massive scalar with a massive spin-$s$ field $(s=0, 1, 2)$ minimally coupled to gravity, employing the recently introduced spin interpolation method to resolve all spin-Casimir terms. The two-loop amplitude exhibits a spin-shift symmetry in both probe limits, which we conjecture to be a sign of yet unknown integrability of Kerr orbits through the quartic order in spin and to all orders in the gravitational constant. We obtain the radial action from the finite part of the amplitude and use it to compute classical observables, including the impulse and spin kick. This is done using the recently introduced covariant Dirac brackets, which allow for the computation of classical scattering observables for general (non-aligned) spin configurations. Finally, employing the radiation-reaction amplitude proposed by Alessio and Di Vecchia, together with the Dirac brackets, we obtain radiation-reaction contributions to observables at all orders in spin and beyond the aligned-spin limit. We find agreement with known results up to the quadratic order in spin for both conservative and radiation-reaction contributions. Our results advance the state of the art in the understanding of spinning binary dynamics in general relativity and demonstrate the power and simplicity of the Dirac bracket formalism for relating scattering amplitudes to classical observables.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for a CP broken deconfined phase at $\theta =\pi$ in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory through simulations at imaginary $\theta$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of the spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills at $\theta=\pi$, which has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we provide a numerical evidence that the CP symmetry is indeed spontaneously broken at low temperature and it gets restored above the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, which is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the situation predicted in the large-$N$ limit. We avoid the severe sign problem by performing simulations at imaginary $\theta$. We obtain the critical temperature of the CP restoration and that of deconfinement at $\theta=\pi$ by analytic continuation, which leads to the above conclusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculating the action and the interaction Hamiltonian at higher orders in cosmological perturbation theory is a cumbersome task. We employ the formalism of EFT of inflation in models of single field ultra slow-roll inflation and obtain a non-perturbative result for the Hamiltonian in terms of the Goldstone field $\pi$. To complete the dictionary, a non-linear relation between the curvature perturbations and $\pi$ is presented. Equipped with these non-linear results, we calculate the higher order loop corrections in USR models which are employed for PBHs formation. It is shown that the loop corrections on long CMB scales increase rapidly with the number of loop $L$ and the setup will go out of perturbative control at the four-loop level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-luminosity Super $\tau$-Charm Factory (STCF) will be a crucial facility for charm-physics research, particularly for the precise measurement of electroweak parameters, measuring $D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixing parameters, investigating Charge-Parity (CP) violation within the charm sector, searching for the rare and forbidden decays of charmed hadrons, and addressing other foundational questions related to charmed hadrons. With the world's largest charm-threshold data, the STCF aims to achieve high sensitivity in studying the strong phase of neutral $D$ mesons using quantum correlation, complementing studies at LHCb and Belle II, and contributing to the understanding of CP violations globally. The STCF will also enable world-leading precision in measuring the leptonic decays of charmed mesons and baryons, providing constraints on the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix and strong-force dynamics. Additionally, the STCF will explore charmed hadron spectroscopy. The advanced detector and clean experimental environment of the STCF will enable unprecedented precision, help address key challenges in the Standard Model, and facilitate the search for potential new physics.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relation between higher-dimensional gauge theories and stochastic gravitational wave (GW) spectrums caused by their potential. It is known that the higher-dimensional gauge theories can induce the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the gauge symmetry. If the spontaneous symmetry breaking induces the first-order phase transition, the stochastic GW can be observed in future interferometers. Through our numerical calculations, we reveal that distinctive parameters in the theories, like the compact scale, can change the GW spectrums dynamically. We also discuss the verifiability of the theories through the GW observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, there has been a growing trend in the field of high-energy physics (HEP), in both its experimental and phenomenological studies, to incorporate machine learning (ML) and its specialized branch, deep learning (DL). This review paper provides a thorough illustration of these applications using different ML and DL approaches. The first part of the paper examines the basics of various particle physics types and establishes guidelines for assessing particle physics alongside the available learning models. Next, a detailed classification is provided for representing Jets that are reconstructed in high-energy collisions, mainly in proton-proton collisions at well-defined beam energies. This section covers various datasets, preprocessing techniques, and feature extraction and selection methods. The presented techniques can be applied to future hadron-hadron colliders (HHC), such as the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) and the future circular collider - hadron-hadron (FCChh). The authors then explore several AI techniques analyses designed specifically for both image and point-cloud (PC) data in HEP. Additionally, a closer look is taken at the classification associated with Jet tagging in hadron collisions. In this review, various state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in ML and DL are examined, with a focus on their implications for HEP demands. More precisely, this discussion addresses various applications in extensive detail, such as Jet tagging, Jet tracking, particle classification, and more. The review concludes with an analysis of the current state of HEP using DL methodologies. It highlights the challenges and potential areas for future research, which are illustrated for each application.</description>

      <title>Probing flavored regimes of leptogenesis with gravitational waves from cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic strings radiate detectable gravitational waves in models featuring high-scale symmetry breaking, e.g., high-scale leptogenesis. In this Letter, for the first time, we show that different flavored regimes of high-scale leptogenesis can be tested with the spectral features in cosmic string-radiated gravitational waves. This is possible if the scalar field that makes right-handed neutrinos massive is feebly coupled to the Standard Model Higgs. Each flavored regime, sensitive to low-energy neutrino experiments, leaves a marked imprint on the gravitational waves spectrum. A three-flavor and a two-flavor regime could be probed by a characteristic fall-off of the gravitational wave spectrum at the LISA-DECIGO-ET frequency bands with preceding scale-invariant amplitudes bounded from above and below. We present Gravitational Waves windows for Flavored Regimes of Leptogenesis (GWFRL) testable in the upcoming experiments. We also provide the first construction of a leptogenesis framework where a testable distinction of flavor regimes is possible without constraining the flavor structure of the theory.</description>

      <title>Dark symmetry implication for right-handed neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the long-standing issues of neutrino mass and dark matter can be manifestly solved in a dark gauge symmetry $U(1)_D$ that transforms nontrivially only for three right-handed neutrinos $\nu_{1,2,3R}$ -- the counterparts of known left-handed neutrinos. This theory assigns $\nu_{1,2,3R}$ dark charge to be $D=0$, $-1$, and $+1$, respectively, in order for anomaly cancelation. Additionally, it imposes an inert Higgs doublet $\eta$ and two Higgs singlets $\xi,\phi$ with dark charge $D=+1$, $-1$, and $+2$, respectively. That said, the dark symmetry is broken by $\phi$ (by two units) down to a dark parity $P_D=(-1)^D$, for which $\nu_{2,3R}$ and $\eta,\xi$ are odd, whereas all other fields are even due to $D=0$. The lightest of these odd fields is stabilized by $P_D$, responsible for dark matter. Neutrino masses are generated by a scotoseesaw scheme, in which the seesaw part is mediated by $\nu_{1R}$, while the scotogenic part is mediated by $\nu_{2,3R}$, for which the hierarchy of atmospheric and solar neutrino mass splittings is explained.</description>

      <title>Dancing with invisible partners: Three-body exchanges with primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The abundance of massive primordial black holes has historically been constrained by dynamical probes. Since these objects can participate in hard few-body scattering processes, they can readily transfer energy to stellar systems, and, in particular, can disrupt wide binaries. However, disruption is not the only possible outcome of such few-body processes. Primordial black holes could also participate in exchange processes, in which one component of a binary system is ejected and replaced by the black hole itself. In this case, the remaining object in the binary would dynamically appear to have an invisible companion. We study the rate of exchange processes for primordial black holes as a component of dark matter and evaluate possible mechanisms for detecting such binaries. We find that many such binaries plausibly exist in the Solar neighborhood, and show that this process can account for observed binary systems whose properties run counter to the predictions of isolated binary evolution.</description>

      <title>QCD-sourced tachyonic phase transition in a supercooled Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel gravitational wave production mechanism in the context of quasi-conformal Standard Model extensions, which provide a way to dynamically generate the electroweak scale. In these models, the cosmic thermal history is modified by a substantial period of thermal inflation, potentially supercooling the Universe below the QCD scale. The exit from supercooling is typically realized through a strong, first-order phase transition. By employing the classically conformal $U(1)_{\tiny\rm B-L}$ model as a representative example, we show that a large parameter space exists where bubble percolation is inefficient. In this case, the top quark condensate triggers a tachyonic phase transition driven by classical rolling of the new scalar field towards the true vacuum. As the field crosses a region where its effective mass is negative, long-wavelength scalar field fluctuations are exponentially amplified, preheating the supercooled Universe. We study the dynamics of this scenario and estimate the peak of the associated gravitational wave signal, which is detectable by future observatories in almost the entire available parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic method to derive the chiral kinetic theory from the Wigner equations based on quantum field theory order by order. We take special effort to derive the chiral kinetic theory in seven-dimensional phase space from the eight-dimensional chiral kinetic theory. We give the seven-dimensional chiral kinetic theory up to second order of semiclassical expansion. We find some new second-order contributions compared with other approaches.</description>

      <title>Generalised Antenna Functions for Higher-Order Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the definition, the construction and the implementation of \textit{generalised antenna functions} for final-state radiation up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO) in QCD. Generalised antenna functions encapsulate the singular behaviour of unresolved emissions when these occur within multiple hard radiators and not just two of them, as for traditional antenna functions. The construction of such objects is possible thanks to the recently proposed algorithm for building \textit{idealised antenna functions} from a target set of infrared limits. Generalised antenna functions bring major simplifications in the assemblage of subtraction terms in the context of the antenna scheme at NNLO and beyond, as well as a substantial computational speedup of higher-order calculations. We discuss in detail the improvements on the formal and practical side for the computation of the NNLO correction to three-jet production at electron-positron colliders, providing a thorough numerical validation of the newly proposed scheme. For this calculation one can expect almost an order of magnitude speedup with respect to the original implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focusing on the recent measurements of the scattering processes $\bar{\Lambda} p \rightarrow \bar{\Lambda} p$ and $\Lambda p \rightarrow \Lambda p$ reported by BESIII, we offer a dynamical interpretation of the differences in the measured total and differential cross sections for both processes. This discrepancy arises because the $u$-channel contribution is forbidden for $\bar{\Lambda} p \rightarrow \bar{\Lambda} p$ but allowed for $\Lambda p \rightarrow \Lambda p$. Additionally, we examine the enhancement effect in the forward angle region of the differential cross section for $\bar{\Lambda} p$ elastic scattering, attributed to the $t$-channel contribution. This work serves as a test to the scattering mechanism involved in these reactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are three scalar nonets in the Particle Data Group (PDG), one of which includes [$a_0(980), K_0^*(700)$], another includes [$a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430)$], and the third includes [$a_0(1710), K_0^*(1950)$]. Motivated by Ref.[1], we examine an alternative mixing mechanism that could potentially explain the small mass difference between the $a_0 (1450)$ and $K_0^* (1430)$. According to the tetraquark mixing model, two types, distinguished by their color-spin structures, are necessary to describe the tetraquark structure of the two nonets containing [$a_0(980), K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430)$]. Considering the color-spin structures, we argue that the mixing mechanism generating $a_0(1450)$ and $K_0^* (1430)$ on the one hand, and $a_0(1710)$ and $K_0^* (1950)$ on the other hand might be relevant for resolving the small mass difference. We also discuss the limitations of other mixing mechanisms that generate the two nonets involving [$a_0(980),K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$] or [$a_0(980),K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1710)$, $K_0^* (1950)$]</description>

Abstract: We revisit the notion of nuclear parton-to-pion fragmentation functions at next-to-leading order accuracy as an effective description of hadroproduction in nuclear environments such as in semi-inclusive lepton-nucleus deep-inelastic scattering and in single inclusive proton-nucleus collisions. We assess their viability in the face of very precise data collected for the latter at the CERN-LHC over the past decade as well as recent measurements of the former carried out by the CLAS experiment at JLab.</description>

      <title>Unitarity bounds with subthreshold and anomalous cuts for $b$-hadron decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a generalisation of the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) parametrization. Most form factors (FFs) in $b$-hadron decays exhibit additional branch cuts -- namely subthreshold and anomalous branch cuts -- beyond the ``standard'' unitarity cut. These additional cuts cannot be adequately accounted for by the BGL parametrization. For instance, these cuts arise in the FFs for $B\to D^{(*)}$, $B\to K^{(*)}$, and $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda$ processes, which are particularly relevant from a phenomenological standpoint. We demonstrate how to parametrize such FFs and derive unitarity bounds in the presence of subthreshold and/or anomalous branch cuts. Our work paves the way for a wide range of new FF analyses based solely on first principles, thereby minimising systematic uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: The ongoing Run 3 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is substantially increasing the luminosity delivered to the experiments during Run 1 and Run 2. The advent of the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC (Run 4 to 6), as well as the improvements to all detectors, will allow for the collection of an unprecedented amount of data in the next decade. This opens the possibility of performing measurements which have been limited by the smallness of the available data samples. This is the case of multi-differential studies of $J/\psi$, as well as of $\Upsilon$ excited states, in exclusive diffractive photon-induced interactions. Here, we present predictions for the cross-sections of these processes utilising the dipole amplitude from the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation solved in the target rapidity and including the full impact-parameter dependence. Cross-sections are computed as a function of the photon--proton centre-of-mass energy as well as a function of Mandelstam-$t$. Ratios of cross-sections for different states and for the same state at different Mandelstam-$t$ values are also presented. The contribution to these observables of the non-linear terms in the BK equation is discussed.</description>

Abstract: The observation of the Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) process using reactor antineutrinos offers a unique opportunity to probe the Standard Model and explore Beyond the Standard Model scenarios. This study reports on the latest results from the CONUS+ experiment conducted at the Leibstadt nuclear power plant (KKL), Switzerland. The CONUS collaboration reports $395 \pm 106$ events detected from reactor antineutrinos with an exposure of 347 kg$\cdot$days, utilizing high-purity germanium detectors operated at sub-keV thresholds. A $\chi^2$-based statistical analysis was performed on these results, incorporating systematic uncertainties. This analysis was used to extract the weak mixing angle, establish a limit on the neutrino magnetic moment, and impose constraints on neutrino non-standard interactions using reactor antineutrinos. The results confirm the potential of CE$\nu$NS experiments in the study of fundamental neutrino properties and probing new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel quark mass matrix texture-pair with five free parameters, which fits the four quark mass ratios $m_s/m_b$, $m_d/m_b$, $m_c/m_t$, $m_u/m_t$, and the four CKM quark mixing observables. The matrices each have one texture zero, but the main innovation here is a ``geometric'' ansatz exploiting a pair of small complex expansion parameters, based on the geometry of the Unitarity Triangle. The fit to the observables is in good agreement with current experimental values renormalised to $\sim\!\!10^4$ TeV, and offers decisive tests against future high-precision measurements of the unitarity triangle angles at the weak scale. We identify two novel symmetries of these mass matrices which explain the phenomenologically-successful relations $\alpha\equiv\phi_2\simeq\pibytwo$ and $\beta\equiv\phi_1\simeq\pibyeight$.</description>

      <title>Weyl conformal geometry vs Weyl anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl conformal geometry is a gauge theory of scale invariance that naturally brings together the Standard Model (SM) and Einstein gravity. The SM embedding in this geometry is possible without new degrees of freedom beyond SM and Weyl geometry, while Einstein gravity is generated by the broken phase of this symmetry. This follows a Stueckelberg breaking mechanism in which the Weyl gauge boson becomes massive and decouples, as discussed in the past (arXiv:1812.08613, 1904.06596, 2104.15118). However, Weyl anomaly could break explicitly this gauge symmetry, hence we study it in Weyl geometry. We first note that in Weyl geometry {\it metricity} can be restored with respect to a new differential operator ($\hat \nabla$) that also enforces a Weyl-covariant formulation. This leads to a metric-like Weyl gauge invariant formalism that enables one to do quantum calculations directly in Weyl geometry, rather than use a Riemannian (metric) geometry picture. The result is the Weyl-covariance in $d$ dimensions of all geometric operators ($\hat R$, etc) {\it and} of their derivatives ($\hat\nabla_\mu\hat R$, etc), including the Euler-Gauss-Bonnet term. A natural, Weyl-invariant dimensional regularisation of quantum corrections exists and Weyl gauge symmetry is then maintained and manifest at the quantum level, in $d$ dimensions. This is related to a non-trivial current of this symmetry, the divergence of which cancels the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The "usual" Weyl anomaly and Riemannian geometry are recovered in the (spontaneously) broken phase. The relation to holographic Weyl anomaly is discussed.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Polyakov Loop for QCD with Twelve Massless Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12203v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider continuum-formulation QCD in four dimensions with twelve massless fundamental quark flavors. Splitting the SU(\(N\)) gauge field into background and fluctuation parts, we use well-developed techniques to calculate the one-loop effective action for the theory. We find that for constant self-dual background field-strength tensor the notorious infrared divergences of the effective action cancel between gauge and matter sectors if the number of massless quark flavors is exactly . The ultraviolet divergencies of the effective action are non-perturbatively renormalized with a \b{eta}-function that matches the known perturbative result in the high energy limit. The resulting UV- and IR-finite effective action possesses a non-trivial saddle which has lower free energy than the perturbative vacuum, and for which the expectation value of the Polyakov loop vanishes. Inclusion of finite temperature effects points to the presence of a first-order phase transition to the perturbative vacuum with a calculable critical temperature.</description>

      <title>First Result for Dark Matter Search by WINERED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identity of dark matter has been a mystery in astronomy, cosmology, and particle theory for about a century. Bessho, Ikeda, and Yin (2022), three of the current authors, proposed using the state-of-the-art infrared spectrographs, including WINERED at $6.5$m Magellan Clay telescope and NIRSpec at James Webb Space Telescope, as efficient detectors for the indirect detection of dark matter with the mass around eV by measuring the line photons from the dark matter two body decays. Applying this concept, we have performed spectrographic observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) Leo V and Tucana II using WINERED by utilizing an object-sky-object nodding observation technique for background subtraction. We present the first result from this dark matter search. Employing zero consistent flux data after the sky subtraction, we have established one of the most stringent limits to date on dark matter decaying into line photons in the mass range of $1.8-2.7\,$eV. Our data can also be applied to constrain other spectra of photons from the dSphs.</description>

      <title>BOSS Constraints on Massive Particles during Inflation: The Cosmological Collider in Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive particles leave imprints on primordial non-Gaussianity via couplings to the inflaton, even despite their exponential dilution during inflation: practically, the Universe acts as a Cosmological Collider. We present the first dedicated search for spin-zero particles using BOSS redshift-space galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles, as well as Planck CMB non-Gaussianity data. We demonstrate that some Cosmological Collider models are well approximated by the standard equilateral and orthogonal parametrization; assuming negligible inflaton self-interactions, this facilitates us translating Planck non-Gaussianity constraints into bounds on Collider models. Many models have signatures that are not degenerate with equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussianity and thus require dedicated searches. Here, we constrain such models using BOSS three-dimensional redshift-space galaxy clustering data, focusing on spin-zero particles in the principal series (i.e. with mass $m\geq 3H/2$) and constraining their couplings to the inflaton at varying speed and mass, marginalizing over the unknown inflaton self-interactions. This is made possible through an improvement in Cosmological Bootstrap techniques and the combination of perturbation theory and halo occupation distribution models for galaxy clustering. Our work sets the standard for inflationary spectroscopy with cosmological observations, providing the ultimate link between physics on the largest and smallest scales.</description>

      <title>$Ab$-$initio$ nucleon-nucleon correlations and their impact on high energy $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating nucleon-nucleon correlations inherent to the strong nuclear force is one of the core goals in nuclear physics research. We showcase the unique opportunities offered by collisions of $^{16}$O nuclei at high-energy facilities to reveal detailed many-body properties of the nuclear ground state. We interface existing knowledge about the geometry of $^{16}$O coming from \textit{ab-initio} calculations of nuclear structure with transport simulations of high-energy $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions. Bulk observables in these processes, such as the elliptic flow or the fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum, are found to depend significantly on the input nuclear model and to be sensitive to realistic clustering and short-range repulsive correlations, effectively opening a new avenue to probe these features experimentally. This finding demonstrates collisions of oxygen nuclei as a tool to elucidate initial conditions of small collision systems while fostering connections with effective field theories of nuclei rooted in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>Binary neutron star mergers as the source of the highest energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are produced in binary neutron star mergers. This scenario can account for the heretofore inexplicable narrow rigidity range of UHECRs, because the jets of BNS mergers are generated by a gravitationally-driven dynamo and thus are nearly identical due to the narrow range of BNS masses. Observed UHECRs with energies well beyond 100 EeV can be explained as $r$-process nuclei, without invoking an exotic source class. Evidence for this mechanism, and its prediction of coincidences between neutrinos above 10 PeV and gravitational waves, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Study of $k$-essence Model: Dynamical System Analysis and Observational Constraints from Latest Type Ia Supernova and BAO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain the parameters of the $k$-essence scalar field model with inverse square and exponential potentials using data sets including Pantheon+SHOES and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) of Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from SDSS and DESI surveys, and direct measurements of the Hubble parameter and redshift obtained from the differential age method (CC). We also provide a brief perspective on the dynamical evolution of both models and derive stability constraints on the model parameters, which are then used to set appropriate priors. We adopt a Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best fit the data. A comprehensive analysis in light of observational data shows that the $k$-essence model fits well across all data combinations. However, according to the BIC criterion, the $\Lambda$CDM model provides a slightly better fit compared to the $k$-essence model.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Imaging of Pion using Lattice QCD: Generalized Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report a lattice calculation of $x$-dependent valence pion generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness with multiple values of the momentum transfer $-t$. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1$ gauge ensemble of highly improved staggered quarks with Wilson-Clover valence fermion. The lattice spacing is 0.04 fm, and the pion valence mass is tuned to be 300 MeV. We determine the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes of the quasi-GPD matrix elements for both symmetric and asymmetric momenta transfers with similar values and show the equivalence of both frames. Then, focusing on the asymmetric frame, we utilize a hybrid scheme to renormalize the quasi-GPD matrix elements obtained from the lattice calculations. After the Fourier transforms, the quasi-GPDs are then matched to the light-cone GPDs within the framework of large momentum effective theory with improved matching, including the next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative corrections, and leading renormalon and renormalization group resummations. We also present the 3-dimensional image of the pion in impact-parameter space through the Fourier transform of the momentum transfer $-t$.</description>

      <title>Negative neutrino masses as a mirage of dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest cosmological constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses depend on prior physical assumptions about the mass spectrum. To test the accordance of cosmological and laboratory constraints in the absence of such priors, we introduce an effective neutrino mass parameter that extends consistently to negative values. For the $\Lambda$CDM model, we analyze data from Planck, ACT, and DESI and find a $2.8-3.3\sigma$ tension with the constraints from oscillation experiments. Motivated by recent hints of evolving dark energy, we analyze the $w_0w_a$ and mirage dark energy models, showing that they favour larger masses consistent with laboratory data, respectively $\sum m_{\nu,\mathrm{eff}} = 0.06_{-0.10}^{+0.15}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $\sum m_{\nu,\mathrm{eff}} = 0.04_{-0.11}^{+0.15}\,\mathrm{eV}$ (both at 68%).</description>

      <title>New insights into the analytic structure of correlation functions via kinetic theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The way a relativistic system approaches fluid dynamical behaviour can be understood physically through the signals that will contribute to its linear response to perturbations. What these signals are is captured in the analytic structure of the retarded correlation function. The non-analyticities can be grouped into three types based on their dimension in the complex frequency plane. In this paper, we will use kinetic theory to find how we can calculate their corresponding signals. In the most general case of a system with particles that have a continuum of thermalization rates, we find that a non-analytic region appears. To calculate its signal, we introduce the non-analytic area density that describes the properties of this region, and we construct a method to calculate it. Further, to take into account the ambiguity present in signal analysis, following from manipulations of the non-analyticities, we will identify two specific choices called pictures with interesting analytic properties and compare in what scenarios each picture is most useful.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and non-repeaters. However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas non-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, 5 of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings improve our understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and non-repeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.</description>

      <title>Seeking the nearest neutron stars using a new local electron density map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a compelling testing ground for gravity, nuclear dynamics, and physics beyond the Standard Model, and so it will be useful to locate the neutron stars nearest to Earth. To that end, we revisit pulsar distance estimates extracted from the dispersion measure of pulsar radio waves scattering on electrons. In particular, we create a new electron density map for the local kiloparsec by fitting to parallax measurements of the nearest pulsars, which complements existing maps that are fit on the Galactic scale. This ``near-Earth'' electron density map implies that pulsars previously estimated to be 100-200 pc away may be as close as tens of parsecs away, which motivates a parallax-based measurement campaign to follow-up on these very-near candidate pulsars. Such nearby neutron stars would be valuable laboratories for testing fundamental physics phenomena, including several late-stage neutron star heating mechanisms, using current and forthcoming telescopes. We illustrate this by estimating the sensitivities of the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope and Thirty Meter Telescope to neutron stars heated by dark matter capture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a lower bound on the sensitivity of generic mechanical and electromagnetic gravitational wave detectors. We consider both classical and quantum detection schemes, although we focus on the former. Our results allow for a simple reproduction of the sensitivities of a variety of experiments, including optical interferometers, resonant bars, optomechanical sensors, and electromagnetic conversion experiments. In the high-frequency regime, all detection schemes we consider can be characterised by their stored electromagnetic energy and the signal transfer function, which we provide. We discuss why high-frequency gravitational wave searches are especially difficult and primordial gravitational wave backgrounds might not be detectable above the sensitivity window of existing interferometers.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal flow decorrelations in small collision systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed analysis of longitudinal flow decorrelations in light ion collisions at both Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider(LHC) energies, focusing on various \textit{ab-initio} models of oxygen structure. We identify that the correlator $V_{2\Delta}$ effectively differentiates between the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) structure and other models, such as Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT) and the Projected Generator Coordinate Method (PGCM), revealing similar behaviors between the latter two. By utilizing the isolated non-spherical components, we highlight significant negative contributions in the structure generated by VMC compared to the other configurations. Additionally, we show that employing decorrelation $r_2$ to mitigate non-flow effects proves beneficial in identifying various modeled structures. We further examine flow decorrelations across different systems, including d+Au and O+O collisions at 200 GeV, as well as Ne+Ne and O+O collisions at 6.37 TeV, indicating a hierarchy in decorrelations that underscores the complexity of these interactions. Our findings emphasize that the role of asymmetry in d+Au collisions and its impact on flow correlations is mitigated by the correlator $V_{2\Delta} (\eta, \eta_{\text{ref}} )$. Additionally, our analysis of flow angle decorrelations shows diverse distributions of $\cos(2\Delta\psi_2)$ vs. overall flow magnitude in d+Au collisions compared to those in other collision systems, as indicated by the mean value of $\cos(2\Delta\psi_2)$.</description>

      <title>Extended Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy: Ghost Condensate Dark Energy with Sextic Dispersion Relation in de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our studies of the ghost condensate (GC) with sixth-order dispersion relation. Contrary to the GC with quartic dispersion relation, we find that the correction to the Newtonian potential explicitly depends on the space and time dependence of matter density. At late times when the Newtonian potential becomes time-independent, one obtains similar oscillatory behavior at the distance $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{M^2}$, but this time at the time scale $\frac{M^4}{M_\textrm{Pl}^3}$, where $M^2$ is the ghost field velocity. We also show that the speed of gravitational wave is modified in a frequency dependent manner at momenta close to $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{\sqrt{|\sigma_1|}}$, where $\sigma_1$ is the coefficient of $\gamma^{ij} \nabla_i K_{lr} \nabla_j K^{lr}$ operator in the unitary gauge action.</description>
