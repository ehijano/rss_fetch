      <title>Supporting SEN\'{C}OTEN Language Documentation Efforts with Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SEN\'{C}OTEN language, spoken on the Saanich peninsula of southern Vancouver Island, is in the midst of vigorous language revitalization efforts to turn the tide of language loss as a result of colonial language policies. To support these on-the-ground efforts, the community is turning to digital technology. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology holds great promise for accelerating language documentation and the creation of educational resources. However, developing ASR systems for SEN\'{C}OTEN is challenging due to limited data and significant vocabulary variation from its polysynthetic structure and stress-driven metathesis. To address these challenges, we propose an ASR-driven documentation pipeline that leverages augmented speech data from a text-to-speech (TTS) system and cross-lingual transfer learning with Speech Foundation Models (SFMs). An n-gram language model is also incorporated via shallow fusion or n-best restoring to maximize the use of available data. Experiments on the SEN\'{C}OTEN dataset show a word error rate (WER) of 19.34% and a character error rate (CER) of 5.09% on the test set with a 57.02% out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate. After filtering minor cedilla-related errors, WER improves to 14.32% (26.48% on unseen words) and CER to 3.45%, demonstrating the potential of our ASR-driven pipeline to support SEN\'{C}OTEN language documentation.</description>

      <title>Pronunciation Deviation Analysis Through Voice Cloning and Acoustic Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for detecting mispronunciations by analyzing deviations between a user's original speech and their voice-cloned counterpart with corrected pronunciation. We hypothesize that regions with maximal acoustic deviation between the original and cloned utterances indicate potential mispronunciations. Our method leverages recent advances in voice cloning to generate a synthetic version of the user's voice with proper pronunciation, then performs frame-by-frame comparisons to identify problematic segments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in pinpointing specific pronunciation errors without requiring predefined phonetic rules or extensive training data for each target language.</description>

      <title>EditGen: Harnessing Cross-Attention Control for Instruction-Based Auto-Regressive Audio Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate leveraging cross-attention control for efficient audio editing within auto-regressive models. Inspired by image editing methodologies, we develop a Prompt-to-Prompt-like approach that guides edits through cross and self-attention mechanisms. Integrating a diffusion-based strategy, influenced by Auffusion, we extend the model's functionality to support refinement edits, establishing a baseline for prompt-guided audio editing. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach by incorporating MUSICGEN, a pre-trained frozen auto-regressive model, and propose three editing mechanisms, based on Replacement, Reweighting, and Refinement of the attention scores. We employ commonly-used music-specific evaluation metrics and a human study, to gauge time-varying controllability, adherence to global text cues, and overall audio realism. The automatic and human evaluations indicate that the proposed combination of prompt-to-prompt guidance with autoregressive generation models significantly outperforms the diffusion-based baseline in terms of melody, dynamics, and tempo of the generated audio.

      <title>Improving Neural Pitch Estimation with SWIPE Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have become the dominant technique for accurate pitch and periodicity estimation. Although a lot of research has gone into improving network architectures and training paradigms, most approaches operate directly on the raw audio waveform or on general-purpose time-frequency representations. We investigate the use of Sawtooth-Inspired Pitch Estimation (SWIPE) kernels as an audio frontend and find that these hand-crafted, task-specific features can make neural pitch estimators more accurate, robust to noise, and more parameter-efficient. We evaluate supervised and self-supervised state-of-the-art architectures on common datasets and show that the SWIPE audio frontend allows for reducing the network size by an order of magnitude without performance degradation. Additionally, we show that the SWIPE algorithm on its own is much more accurate than commonly reported, outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised neural pitch estimators.</description>

      <title>FasTUSS: Faster Task-Aware Unified Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-Frequency (TF) dual-path models are currently among the best performing audio source separation network architectures, achieving state-of-the-art performance in speech enhancement, music source separation, and cinematic audio source separation. While they are characterized by a relatively low parameter count, they still require a considerable number of operations, implying a higher execution time. This problem is exacerbated by the trend towards bigger models trained on large amounts of data to solve more general tasks, such as the recently introduced task-aware unified source separation (TUSS) model. TUSS, which aims to solve audio source separation tasks using a single, conditional model, is built upon TF-Locoformer, a TF dual-path model combining convolution and attention layers. The task definition comes in the form of a sequence of prompts that specify the number and type of sources to be extracted. In this paper, we analyze the design choices of TUSS with the goal of optimizing its performance-complexity trade-off. We derive two more efficient models, FasTUSS-8.3G and FasTUSS-11.7G that reduce the original model's operations by 81\% and 73\% with minor performance drops of 1.2~dB and 0.4~dB averaged over all benchmarks, respectively. Additionally, we investigate the impact of prompt conditioning to derive a causal TUSS model.</description>

      <title>Grammatical Structure and Grammatical Variations in Non-Metric Iranian Classical Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we introduce a symbolic dataset composed of non-metric Iranian classical music, and algorithms for structural parsing of this music, and generation of variations. The corpus comprises MIDI files and data sheets of Dastgah Shour from Radif Mirza Abdollah, the foundational repertoire of Iranian classical music. Furthermore, we apply our previously-introduced algorithm for parsing melodic structure (Kanani et al., 2023b)to the dataset. Unlike much Western music, this type of non-metric music does not follow bar-centric organisation. The non-metric organisation can be captured well by our parsing algorithm. We parse each tune (Gusheh) into a grammar to identify motifs and phrases. These grammar representations can be useful for educational and ethnomusicological purposes. We also further develop a previously-introduced method of creating melodic variations (Kanani et al., 2023b). After parsing an existing tune to produce a grammar, by applying mutations to this grammar, we generate a new grammar. Expanding this new version yields a variation of the original tune. Variations are assessed by a domain-expert listener. Additionally, we conduct a statistical analysis of mutation with different representation setups for our parsing and generation algorithms. The overarching conclusion is that the system successfully produces acceptable variations post-mutation. While our case study focuses on Iranian classical music, the methodology can be adapted for Arabic or Turkish classical music.</description>

      <title>Parsing Musical Structure to Enable Meaningful Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel rule-based approach for generating music by varying existing tunes. We parse each tune to find the Pathway Assembly (PA) [ 1], that is a structure representing all repetitions in the tune. The Sequitur algorithm [2 ] is used for this. The result is a grammar. We then carry out mutation on the grammar, rather than on a tune directly. There are potentially 19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of the grammar that can be applied to the grammars. The system employs one of the mutations randomly in this step to automatically manipulate the grammar. Following the mutation, we need to expand the grammar which returns a new tune. The output after 1 or more mutations will be a new tune related to the original tune. Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple mutations. Edit distances, structural complexity and length of the tunes are used to show how a tune is changed after multiple mutations. In addition, the size of effect of each mutation type is analyzed. As a final point, we review the musical aspect of the output tunes. It should be noted that the study only focused on generating new pitch sequences. The study is based on an Irish traditional tune dataset and a list of integers has been used to represent each tune's pitch values.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Transfer Learning for Data-Driven Sound Source Reconstruction in Near-Field Acoustic Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a transfer learning framework for sound source reconstruction in Near-field Acoustic Holography (NAH), which adapts a well-trained data-driven model from one type of sound source to another using a physics-informed procedure. The framework comprises two stages: (1) supervised pre-training of a complex-valued convolutional neural network (CV-CNN) on a large dataset, and (2) purely physics-informed fine-tuning on a single data sample based on the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral. This method follows the principles of transfer learning by enabling generalization across different datasets through physics-informed adaptation. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by transferring a pre-trained model from a rectangular plate dataset to a violin top plate dataset, where it shows improved reconstruction accuracy compared to the pre-trained model and delivers performance comparable to that of Compressive-Equivalent Source Method (C-ESM). Furthermore, for successful modes, the fine-tuned model outperforms both the pre-trained model and C-ESM in accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The availability of smart devices leads to an exponential increase in multimedia content. However, advancements in deep learning have also enabled the creation of highly sophisticated Deepfake content, including speech Deepfakes, which pose a serious threat by generating realistic voices and spreading misinformation. To combat this, numerous challenges have been organized to advance speech Deepfake detection techniques. In this survey, we systematically analyze more than 200 papers published up to March 2024. We provide a comprehensive review of each component in the detection pipeline, including model architectures, optimization techniques, generalizability, evaluation metrics, performance comparisons, available datasets, and open source availability. For each aspect, we assess recent progress and discuss ongoing challenges. In addition, we explore emerging topics such as partial Deepfake detection, cross-dataset evaluation, and defences against adversarial attacks, while suggesting promising research directions. This survey not only identifies the current state of the art to establish strong baselines for future experiments but also offers clear guidance for researchers aiming to enhance speech Deepfake detection systems.</description>

      <title>ReverbMiipher: Generative Speech Restoration meets Reverberation Characteristics Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reverberation encodes spatial information regarding the acoustic source environment, yet traditional Speech Restoration (SR) usually completely removes reverberation. We propose ReverbMiipher, an SR model extending parametric resynthesis framework, designed to denoise speech while preserving and enabling control over reverberation. ReverbMiipher incorporates a dedicated ReverbEncoder to extract a reverb feature vector from noisy input. This feature conditions a vocoder to reconstruct the speech signal, removing noise while retaining the original reverberation characteristics. A stochastic zero-vector replacement strategy during training ensures the feature specifically encodes reverberation, disentangling it from other speech attributes. This learned representation facilitates reverberation control via techniques such as interpolation between features, replacement with features from other utterances, or sampling from a latent space. Objective and subjective evaluations confirm ReverbMiipher effectively preserves reverberation, removes other artifacts, and outperforms the conventional two-stage SR and convolving simulated room impulse response approach. We further demonstrate its ability to generate novel reverberation effects through feature manipulation.</description>

      <title>Mixture of LoRA Experts with Multi-Modal and Multi-Granularity LLM Generative Error Correction for Accented Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite substantial improvements in ASR, performance tends to degrade when faced with adverse conditions such as speaker accents. Generative error correction (GER) leverages the rich linguistic knowledge and exceptional reasoning ability of LLMs, significantly outperforming typical LM methods. However, it lacks specificity in accented speech scenarios. In this study, we leverage GER to improve the accuracy of transcription predictions by addressing the two primary features of accented speech recognition. To fully leverage pronunciation information, we propose the multi-modal GER, which integrates pronunciation information from the speech modality, and the multi-granularity GER, which incorporates fine-grained phoneme-level information related to pronunciation. These two methods enable the LLM to utilize the pronunciation information of accented speech and the semantic information from word-level hypotheses for accurate transcription predictions through LoRA fine-tuning. On the one hand, we employ a three-stage training strategy to train separate multi-modal GER models for each accent to obtain mono-accent LoRA experts. By adopting our proposed HDMoLE method, which incorporates hierarchical routing and dynamic thresholds within the mixture of LoRA experts, we effectively merge multiple mono-accent LoRA experts within a single multi-modal GER to overcome the challenges posed by accent diversity. On the other hand, multi-granularity GER leverages the N-best word-level and phoneme-level hypotheses generated by the HDMoLE model to predict the final accented speech transcriptions. Experimental results on the multi-accent English dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods. Our methods achieve a remarkable relative WER reduction of 67.35% compared to the Whisper-large-v3 baseline.</description>
