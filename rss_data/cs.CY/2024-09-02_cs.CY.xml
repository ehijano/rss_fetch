      <title>Navigating Governance Paradigms: A Cross-Regional Comparative Study of Generative AI Governance Processes &amp; Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies evolve at an unprecedented rate, global governance approaches struggle to keep pace with the technology, highlighting a critical issue in the governance adaptation of significant challenges. Depicting the nuances of nascent and diverse governance approaches based on risks, rules, outcomes, principles, or a mix across different regions around the globe is fundamental to discern discrepancies and convergences and to shed light on specific limitations that need to be addressed, thereby facilitating the safe and trustworthy adoption of GenAI. In response to the need and the evolving nature of GenAI, this paper seeks to provide a collective view of different governance approaches around the world. Our research introduces a Harmonized GenAI Framework, "H-GenAIGF," based on the current governance approaches of six regions: European Union (EU), United States (US), China (CN), Canada (CA), United Kingdom (UK), and Singapore (SG). We have identified four constituents, fifteen processes, twenty-five sub-processes, and nine principles that aid the governance of GenAI, thus providing a comprehensive perspective on the current state of GenAI governance. In addition, we present a comparative analysis to facilitate the identification of common ground and distinctions based on the coverage of the processes by each region. The results show that risk-based approaches allow for better coverage of the processes, followed by mixed approaches. Other approaches lag behind, covering less than 50% of the processes. Most prominently, the analysis demonstrates that among the regions, only one process aligns across all approaches, highlighting the lack of consistent and executable provisions. Moreover, our case study on ChatGPT reveals process coverage deficiency, showing that harmonization of approaches is necessary to find alignment for GenAI governance.</description>

      <title>Advance Real-time Detection of Traffic Incidents in Highways using Vehicle Trajectory Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant number of traffic crashes are secondary crashes that occur because of an earlier incident on the road. Thus, early detection of traffic incidents is crucial for road users from safety perspectives with a potential to reduce the risk of secondary crashes. The wide availability of GPS devices now-a-days gives an opportunity of tracking and recording vehicle trajectories. The objective of this study is to use vehicle trajectory data for advance real-time detection of traffic incidents on highways using machine learning-based algorithms. The study uses three days of unevenly sequenced vehicle trajectory data and traffic incident data on I-10, one of the most crash-prone highways in Louisiana. Vehicle trajectories are converted to trajectories based on virtual detector locations to maintain spatial uniformity as well as to generate historical traffic data for machine learning algorithms. Trips matched with traffic incidents on the way are separated and along with other trips with similar spatial attributes are used to build a database for modeling. Multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boost, and Artificial Neural Network models are used to detect a trajectory that is likely to face an incident in the downstream road section. Results suggest that the Random Forest model achieves the best performance for predicting an incident with reasonable recall value and discrimination capability.</description>

      <title>Addressing Information Asymmetry in Legal Disputes through Data-Driven Law Firm Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal disputes are on the rise, contributing to growing litigation costs. Parties in these disputes must select a law firm to represent them, however, public rankings of law firms are based on reputation and, we find, have little correlation with actual litigation outcomes, giving parties with more experience and inside knowledge an advantage. To enable litigants to make informed decisions, we present a novel dataset of 310,876 U.S. civil lawsuits and we apply an algorithm that generalizes the Bradley-Terry model to assess law firm effectiveness. We find that our outcome-based ranking system better accounts for future performance than traditional reputation-based rankings, which often fail to reflect future legal performance. Moreover, this predictability decays to zero as the number of interactions between law firms increases, providing new evidence to the long-standing debate about whether litigation win rates approach 50\% as information asymmetry diminishes. By prioritizing empirical results, our approach aims to provide a more equitable assessment of law firm quality, challenging existing prestige-focused metrics, and levels the playing field between litigants.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Impact of Generative AI Using an Agent-Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems have transformed various industries by autonomously generating content that mimics human creativity. However, concerns about their social and economic consequences arise with widespread adoption. This paper employs agent-based modeling (ABM) to explore these implications, predicting the impact of generative AI on societal frameworks. The ABM integrates individual, business, and governmental agents to simulate dynamics such as education, skills acquisition, AI adoption, and regulatory responses. This study enhances understanding of AI's complex interactions and provides insights for policymaking. The literature review underscores ABM's effectiveness in forecasting AI impacts, revealing AI adoption, employment, and regulation trends with potential policy implications. Future research will refine the model, assess long-term implications and ethical considerations, and deepen understanding of generative AI's societal effects.</description>

      <title>GeoAI in resource-constrained environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes spatially aware Artificial Intelligence, GeoAI, tailored for small organizations such as NGOs in resource constrained contexts where access to large datasets, expensive compute infrastructure and AI expertise may be restricted. We furthermore consider future scenarios in which resource-intensive, large geospatial models may homogenize the representation of complex landscapes, and suggest strategies to prepare for this condition.</description>

      <title>From "Made In" to Mukokuseki: Exploring the Visual Perception of National Identity in Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People read human characteristics into the design of social robots, a visual process with socio-cultural implications. One factor may be nationality, a complex social characteristic that is linked to ethnicity, culture, and other factors of identity that can be embedded in the visual design of robots. Guided by social identity theory (SIT), we explored the notion of "mukokuseki," a visual design characteristic defined by the absence of visual cues to national and ethnic identity in Japanese cultural exports. In a two-phase categorization study (n=212), American (n=110) and Japanese (n=92) participants rated a random selection of nine robot stimuli from America and Japan, plus multinational Pepper. We found evidence of made-in and two kinds of mukokuseki effects. We offer suggestions for the visual design of mukokuseki robots that may interact with people from diverse backgrounds. Our findings have implications for robots and social identity, the viability of robotic exports, and the use of robots internationally.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Social Norms in Generative Agent Societies: Principles and Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08251v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social norms play a crucial role in guiding agents towards understanding and adhering to standards of behavior, thus reducing social conflicts within multi-agent systems (MASs). However, current LLM-based (or generative) MASs lack the capability to be normative. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, named CRSEC, to empower the emergence of social norms within generative MASs. Our architecture consists of four modules: Creation &amp; Representation, Spreading, Evaluation, and Compliance. This addresses several important aspects of the emergent processes all in one: (i) where social norms come from, (ii) how they are formally represented, (iii) how they spread through agents' communications and observations, (iv) how they are examined with a sanity check and synthesized in the long term, and (v) how they are incorporated into agents' planning and actions. Our experiments deployed in the Smallville sandbox game environment demonstrate the capability of our architecture to establish social norms and reduce social conflicts within generative MASs. The positive outcomes of our human evaluation, conducted with 30 evaluators, further affirm the effectiveness of our approach.
