      <title>The Importance of Aqueous Metabolites in the Martian Subsurface for Understanding Habitability, Organic Chemical Evolution, and Potential Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous metabolites in terrestrial subsurface environments provide critical analog frameworks for assessing the habitability of Martian subsurface ice. On Earth, they play critical roles in sustaining microbial life within soils, permafrost, and groundwater environments and their availability shape microbial community compositions, activity, and adaptability to changes in environmental conditions, enabling communities to persist over millennial timescales. The counterpart to aqueous-soluble organics is the insoluble organic matter pool that makes up the largest portion of organic matter in natural samples and includes most types of organic signatures indicative of biological processes. Employing a range of sample preparation, molecular separation, detection, and imaging techniques enables the characterization of both labile (i.e., soluble and reactive) and recalcitrant (i.e., insoluble, non-reactive; include macromolecules) organic pools. Multiple orthogonal analytical modalities strengthen interpretations of signatures that we associate with biology as we know it and don't know it, by constraining possible abiotic sources, validating measurements across distinct techniques, and ensuring flexibility to interrogate diverse organic chemistries encountered in Martian subsurface environments. This holistic triage approach aligns with the priorities articulated in the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group's Search for Life -Science Analysis Group (SFL-SAG) Charter for a medium-class Mars mission focused on extant life detection.</description>

      <title>SYCL for Energy-Efficient Numerical Astrophysics: the case of DPEcho</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy awareness and efficiency policies are gaining more attention, over pure performance (time-to-solution) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) when comparing the possibilities offered by accelerated systems. But in a field such as numerical astrophysics, which is struggling with code refactorings for GPUs, viable porting paths have to be shown before first. After summarizing the status and recurring problems of astrophysical code accelerations, we highlight how the field would benefit from portable, vendor-agnostic GPU portings. We then employ the DPEcho SYCL benchmark to compare raw performance and energy efficiency for heterogeneous hardware on a realistic application, with the goal of helping computational astrophysicists and HPC providers make informed decisions on the most suitable hardware. Aside from GPUs showing higher efficiency, we argue on the more informative nature of energy-aware KPIs, in that they convey the specific device performance in a data-driven way. We also present a convenient, flexible and cross-platform energy-measuring pipeline. Finally, we contextualize our results through measures with different compilers, presenting device (at the cores) versus node (at the plug) energy and comparing DPEcho with the High- Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark.</description>

      <title>Identifying Habitable Exoplanets with Radio Telescopes on the Lunar Farside</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for habitable conditions beyond Earth is a top priority in astrophysics. The discovery of habitable exoplanets beyond our solar system will require a suite of instruments providing long-term monitoring for detection (e.g. with space and ground-based radial velocity observations), spectroscopic characterization of atmospheric and surface properties, and eventually deep chronograph-aided observations from e.g. JWST, Roman Space Telescope, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Detection of exoplanet magnetospheres is necessary to identify the most promising targets for follow-up characterization of biosignatures with these assets, and to provide an ensemble of objects for studies of magnetospheric conditions and atmospheric composition. Only observations of low-frequency radio emission will distinguish exoplanet magnetospheres (Hallinan et al. 2021). In this white paper, we present the two lunar radio array concepts under development that would be suitable to detect these exoplanet radio emissions. In addition, we also discuss the human exploration needed prior to construction of such lunar radio arrays while highlighting preferred candidate sites (Krolikowski &amp; Elvis 2024) for the radio telescope.</description>

      <title>The high-speed X-ray camera on AXIS: design and performance updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AXIS, a Probe mission concept now in a Phase A study, will provide transformative studies of high-energy astrophysical phenomena thanks to its high-resolution X-ray spectral imaging. These capabilities are enabled by improvements to the mirror design that greatly increase the X-ray throughput per unit mass; and to the detector system, which operates more than an order of magnitude faster than heritage instruments while maintaining excellent spectral performance. We present updates to the design of the AXIS High-Speed Camera, a collaborative effort by MIT, Stanford University, the Pennsylvania State University, and the Southwest Research Institute. The camera employs large-format MIT Lincoln Laboratory CCDs that feature multiple high-speed, low-noise output amplifiers and an advanced single-layer polysilicon gate structure for fast, low-power clock transfers. A first lot of prototype CCID100 CCDs has completed fabrication and will soon begin X-ray performance testing. The CCDs are paired with high-speed, low-noise ASIC readout chips designed by Stanford to provide better performance than conventional discrete solutions at a fraction of the power consumption and footprint. Complementary Front-End Electronics employ state-of-the-art digital video waveform capture and advanced signal processing to further deliver low noise at high speed. The Back-End Electronics provide high-speed identification of candidate X-ray events and transient monitoring that relays fast alerts of changing sources to the community. We highlight updates to our parallel X-ray performance test facilities at MIT and Stanford, and review the current performance of the CCD and ASIC technology from testing of prototype devices. These measurements achieve excellent spectral response at the required readout rate, demonstrating that we will meet mission requirements and enable AXIS to achieve world-class science.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Phase-Unwrapping Methods for Adaptive Optics Wavefront Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced wavefront sensors (WFS) are essential for enabling new science cases for telescopes that utilize adaptive optics (AO) systems. While complex field WFS -- those that estimate the electric field phase and amplitude through interference or diffraction effects -- can achieve extraordinary sensitivity compared to existing devices, they typically reconstruct the wrapped phase of the measured wavefront, which must then be unwrapped for correction by continuous-surface deformable mirrors (DM). Another requirement is that the phase function must be unwrapped within 1 millisecond or faster for real-time AO operations. Using simulations of atmospheric turbulence that follow a Kolmogorov spectrum, we study four prevalent and mature phase unwrapping methods: Fast2D, Zernike Gradient (Zernike), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and Least Squares Principle Value (LSPV). In this paper, we examine the strengths and limitations of each method. In particular, we consider performance with and without a binary circular aperture boundary that defines the edge of monolithic telescopes.</description>

      <title>Development and testing of integrated readout electronics for next generation SiSeRO (Single electron Sensitive Read Out) devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first generation of Single electron Sensitive Read Out (SiSeRO) amplifiers, employed as on-chip charge detectors for charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have demonstrated excellent noise and spectral performance: a responsivity of around 800 pA per electron, an equivalent noise charge (ENC) of 3.2 electrons root mean square (RMS), and a full width half maximum (FWHM) energy resolution of 130 eV at 5.9 keV for a readout speed of 625 Kpixel/s. Repetitive Non Destructive Readout (RNDR) has also been demonstrated with these devices, achieving an improved ENC performance of 0.36 electrons RMS after 200 RNDR cycles. In order to mature this technology further, Stanford University, in collaboration with MIT Kavli Institute and MIT Lincoln Laboratory, are developing new SiSeRO detectors with improved geometries that should enable greater responsivity and improved noise performance. These include CCD devices employing arrays of SiSeRO amplifiers to optimize high speed, low noise RNDR readout and a proof-of-concept SiSeRO active pixel sensor (APS). To read out these devices, our team has developed a compact, 8-channel, fast, low noise, low power application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) denoted the Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC) that includes an experimental drain current readout mode intended for SiSeRO devices. In this paper, we present results from the first tests of SiSeRO CCD devices operating with MCRC readout, and our designs for next generation SiSeRO devices.</description>

      <title>Fast, low noise CCD systems for future strategic x-ray missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future strategic X-ray missions, such as the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) and those targeted by the Great Observatories Maturation Program (GOMaP), require fast, low-noise X-ray imaging spectrometers. To achieve the speed and noise capabilities required by such programs, the X-ray Astronomy and Observational Cosmology (XOC) Group at Stanford, in collaboration with the MIT Kavli Institute (MKI) and MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL), is developing readout systems that leverage the high speed, low noise, and low power consumption of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) devices. Here, we report the energy resolution and noise performance achieved using MIT-LL AXIS prototype charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors in conjunction with Stanford-developed Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC) ASICs. Additionally, we present a new sampling method for simultaneous optimization of the output gate (OG), reset gate (RG), and reset drain (RD) biases which, in combination with new integrated fast summing well (SW) and RG clock operation modes, enables the data rates required of future X-ray telescopes.</description>

      <title>Ground calibration plans for the AXIS high speed camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), an astrophysics NASA probe mission currently in phase A, will provide high-throughput, high-spatial resolution X-ray imaging in the 0.3 to 10 keV band. We report on the notional ground calibration plan for the High Speed Camera on AXIS, which is being developed at the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research using state-of-the-art CCDs provided by MIT Lincoln Laboratory in combination with an integrated, high-speed ASIC readout chip from Stanford University. AXIS camera ground calibration draws on previous experience with X-ray CCD focal plans, in particular Chandra/ACIS and Suzaku/XIS, utilizing mono-energetic X-ray line sources to measure spectral resolution and quantum efficiency. Relative quantum efficiency of the CCDs will be measured against an sCMOS device, with known absolute calibration from synchrotron measurements. We walk through the envisioned CCD calibration pipeline and we discuss the observatory-level science and calibration requirements and how they inform the camera calibration.</description>

      <title>Design, development, and commissioning of a flexible test setup for the AXIS prototype detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) is one of two candidate mission concepts selected for Phase-A study for the new NASA Astrophysics Probe Explorer (APEX) mission class, with a planned launch in 2032. The X-ray camera for AXIS is under joint development by the X-ray Astronomy and Observational Cosmology (XOC) Group at Stanford, the MIT Kavli Institute (MKI), and MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL). To accelerate development efforts and meet the AXIS mission requirements, XOC has developed a twin beamline testing system, capable of providing the necessary performance, flexibility, and robustness. We present design details, simulations, and performance results for the newer of the two beamlines, constructed and optimized to test and characterize the first full-size MIT-LL AXIS prototype detectors, operating with the Stanford-developed Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC) integrated readout electronics system. The XOC X-ray beamline design is forward-looking and flexible, with a modular structure adaptable to a wide range of detector technologies identified by the Great Observatories Maturation Program (GOMAP) that span the X-ray to near-infrared wavelengths.</description>

Abstract: REDWOODS on ShaneAO at Lick Observatory implements a second-stage, 3-sided reflective pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS), which, under low-light conditions, offers an improved signal-to-noise ratio for deformable mirror commands to correct dynamic atmospheric aberrations. We modeled the REDWOODS limiting natural guide star magnitude. We also investigated performance tradeoffs between two PWFS modes that are available to REDWOODS, one with higher bandwidth error and another with higher aliasing error. We also implemented an experimental setup to image one of the REDWOODS PWFS masks.</description>

      <title>Abundance Diagnostics from Slitless Imaging Spectrometer: A Proof-of-Concept for MaGIXS-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elemental abundance diagnostics in the solar corona are crucial for understanding energy transport, plasma heating, and magnetic activity. Most earlier imaging-spectroscopic studies have relied on slit-based spectrometers, which offer high spectral resolution but are limited in spatiotemporal coverage and temperature diagnostics. In contrast, slitless spectrographs like the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) produce overlapping spatial-spectral data (overlappograms) to enable wide-field imaging spectroscopy with broader temperature coverage. However, extracting elemental abundances from overlappogram data remains inherently challenging due to spatial and spectral confusion. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept technique for elemental abundance diagnostics from overlappograms, demonstrating its feasibility with simulated MaGIXS-2 observations.</description>

      <title>SuryaBench: Benchmark Dataset for Advancing Machine Learning in Heliophysics and Space Weather Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a high resolution, machine learning-ready heliophysics dataset derived from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), specifically designed to advance machine learning (ML) applications in solar physics and space weather forecasting. The dataset includes processed imagery from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), spanning a solar cycle from May 2010 to July 2024. To ensure suitability for ML tasks, the data has been preprocessed, including correction of spacecraft roll angles, orbital adjustments, exposure normalization, and degradation compensation. We also provide auxiliary application benchmark datasets complementing the core SDO dataset. These provide benchmark applications for central heliophysics and space weather tasks such as active region segmentation, active region emergence forecasting, coronal field extrapolation, solar flare prediction, solar EUV spectra prediction, and solar wind speed estimation. By establishing a unified, standardized data collection, this dataset aims to facilitate benchmarking, enhance reproducibility, and accelerate the development of AI-driven models for critical space weather prediction tasks, bridging gaps between solar physics, machine learning, and operational forecasting.</description>

      <title>Surya: Foundation Model for Heliophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14112v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heliophysics is central to understanding and forecasting space weather events and solar activity. Despite decades of high-resolution observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), most models remain task-specific and constrained by scarce labeled data, limiting their capacity to generalize across solar phenomena. We introduce Surya, a 366M parameter foundation model for heliophysics designed to learn general-purpose solar representations from multi-instrument SDO observations, including eight Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) channels and five Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) products. Surya employs a spatiotemporal transformer architecture with spectral gating and long--short range attention, pretrained on high-resolution solar image forecasting tasks and further optimized through autoregressive rollout tuning. Zero-shot evaluations demonstrate its ability to forecast solar dynamics and flare events, while downstream fine-tuning with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) shows strong performance on solar wind forecasting, active region segmentation, solar flare forecasting, and EUV spectra. Surya is the first foundation model in heliophysics that uses time advancement as a pretext task on full-resolution SDO data. Its novel architecture and performance suggest that the model is able to learn the underlying physics behind solar evolution.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing Star-Formation Research and the Power of Participatory Science</title>

Abstract: We review participatory science programs that have contributed to the understanding of star formation. The Milky Way Project (MWP), one of the earliest participatory science projects launched on the Zooniverse platform, produced the largest catalog of ``bubbles'' associated with feedback from hot young stars to date, and enabled the identification of a new class of compact star-forming regions (SFRs) known as ``yellowballs'' (YBs). The analysis of YBs through their infrared colors and catalog cross-matching led to discovering that YBs are compact photodissociation regions generated by intermediate- and high-mass young stellar objects embedded in clumps that range in mass from 10 - 10,000 solar masses and luminosity from 10 - 1,000,000 solar luminosities. The MIRION catalog, assembled from 6176 YBs identified by citizen scientists, increases the number of candidate intermediate-mass SFRs by nearly two orders of magnitude. Ongoing work utilizing data from the Spitzer, Herschel and WISE missions involves analyzing infrared color trends to predict physical properties and ages of YB environments. Methods include applying summary statistics to histograms and color-color plots as well as SED fitting. Students in introductory astronomy classes contribute toward continued efforts refining photometric measurements of YBs while learning fundamental concepts in astronomy through a classroom-based participatory science experience, the PERYSCOPE project. We also describe an initiative that engaged seminaries, family groups, and interfaith communities in a wide variety of science projects on the Zooniverse platform. This initiative produced important guidance on attracting audiences that are underserved, underrepresented, or apprehensive about science.</description>

      <title>Barium isotopic ratios in metal-poor stars: calibrating the method with globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the nucleosynthesis processes behind heavy-element enrichment in stellar atmospheres is challenging. It typically relies on comparing observed abundance-to-iron ratios with theoretical predictions relative to the Sun, but this method is prone to uncertainty due to limitations of classical 1D hydrostatic models. One promising but still underexplored approach is to measure the isotopic composition of stellar atmospheres by focusing on elements that have both slow (s)-process and rapid (r)-process contributions. While the study of total elemental abundances offers a simplified view, isotopic ratios are directly linked to the underlying nucleosynthesis processes. Our aim is to provide a reliable method for quantifying the contributions of the s- and r-processes to barium in stellar atmospheres. This is achieved by determining barium isotopic ratios using 1D atmospheric models in combination with a carefully calibrated microturbulence, based on the comparison between subordinate and resonance Ba lines. In this initial study, we use member stars of the globular cluster NGC 6752 to calibrate the microturbulence ($v_{mic}$) value for both subordinate and resonance barium lines across different stellar evolutionary stages. This allows us to provide a reliable estimate of $v_{mic}$ that can be applied to accurately determine barium abundances and isotopic ratios in stars ranging from the main sequence to the upper red giant branch. The $v_{mic}$ scale adapted for barium subordinate lines is consistent with that derived from 3D model atmospheres, and thus the $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$-log $g$ dependent relations of the later can be used safely. The $v_{mic}$ for the resonance line at $\lambda$4934 Angstrom -- for the determination of the isotopic ratio -- is higher, and depends on the equivalent width (EW). We provide calibrated relations between $v_{mic}$ and EW for measuring isotopic ratios.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical or Terrestrial: Machine learning classification of gravitational-wave candidates using multiple-search information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-latency gravitational-wave alerts provide the greater multi-messenger community with information about the candidate events detected by the International Gravitational-Wave Network (IGWN). Prompt release of data products such as the sky localization, false alarm rate (FAR), and $p_\mathrm{astro}$ values allow astronomers to make informed decisions on which candidate gravitational-wave events merit target of opportunity (ToO) follow-up. However, false alarms, often referred to as "glitches", where a gravitational-wave candidate, or trigger, is the result of terrestrial noise, are an inherent part of gravitational-wave searches. In addition, with the presence of multiple gravitational-wave searches, different searches may have varying assessments of the significance of a given trigger. As a complement to quantities such as $p_\mathrm{astro}$, we provide a Machine Learning (ML) based approach to determining whether candidate events are astrophysical or terrestrial in nature, specifically a classifier that utilizes information provided by multiple low-latency search pipelines in its feature space. This classifier has a performance an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.96 and accuracy of 0.90 on the Mock Data Challenge training set and an AUC of 0.93 and accuracy of 0.86 on events from the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO)'s and Advanced Virgo (AdVirgo)'s third observing run (O3).</description>

      <title>The Roman Space Telescope as a Planetary Defense Asset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, slated to launch in October 2026, will serve a critical role in the characterization and threat assessment of near-Earth Objects (NEOs), thus contributing to national and international planetary defense objectives. Operating from the Earth-Sun L2 point and observing in the near-infrared, Roman has the high sensitivity and high spatial resolution needed to measure the physical properties, compositions, and orbital trajectories of NEOs in order to understand their physical nature and potential hazards to Earth. Roman's planetary defense capabilities complement those of two wide-field survey missions: the now operational ground-based Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the upcoming space-based NEO Surveyor. Rubin, observing in visible light, will discover over 100,000 NEOs. NEO Surveyor, observing in the mid-infrared where NEO thermal emission peaks, will detect 200,000-300,000 NEOs, some as small as ~20 meters in diameter. With investment in developing the pipeline infrastructure required to extract information from moving target streaks, Roman will be able to observe NEOs down to the smallest sizes in order to improve our measurements of NEO orbits by 2-3 orders of magnitude, enable accurate diameter and albedo estimates in conjunction with NEO Surveyor, and reveal the spectral types and bulk compositions of the smallest NEOs. Together, these three US-led facilities will operate across the electromagnetic spectrum to form a comprehensive planetary defense network.</description>

      <title>The Prime Focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME): First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the description of the instruments and the first results of the PRime-focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME). PRIME is the first dedicated near-infrared (NIR) microlensing survey telescope located at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Sutherland, South Africa. Among its class, it offers one of the widest fields of view in the NIR regime. PRIME's main goals are (1) To study planetary formation by measuring the frequency and mass function of planets. In particular, we compare results from the central Galactic bulge (GB), accessible only in the NIR by PRIME, with those from the outer GB by optical surveys. (2) To conduct concurrent observations with NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope. Due to the different lines of sight between the ground and space, we detect slight variations in light curves, known as ``Space-based parallax." This effect allows us to measure the mass of lens systems and their distance from the Earth. It is the only method to measure the mass of the free-floating planets down to Earth-mass. We begin the GB survey in February 2024 and analyzed images through June 1, 2025, identifying 486 microlensing candidates and over a thousand variable stars, including Mira variables, which are useful to study the Galactic structure. We issue real-time alerts for follow-up observations, supporting exoplanet searches, and the chemical evolution studies in the GB. During the off-bulge season, we conduct an all-sky grid survey and Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations of transients, including gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other science.</description>

      <title>Machine learning revolution for exoplanet direct imaging detection: transformer architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directly imaging exoplanets is a formidable challenge due to extreme contrast ratios and quasi-static speckle noise, motivating the exploration of advanced post-processing methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise, their inherent limitations in capturing long-range dependencies in image sequences hinder their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that combines a CNN feature extractor with a Transformer encoder to leverage temporal information, modeling the signature of a planet's coherent motion across an observation sequence. We first validated the model on a purely synthetic dataset, where it demonstrated excellent performance. While the final metrics varied slightly between training runs, our reported trial achieved 100.0% accuracy, a 100.0% F1-score, and a position accuracy of 0.72 pixels, showing strong results on this specific test case in comparison to traditional methods like median subtraction and PCA-KLIP. To assess its viability on realistic data, we retrained the model on a semi-synthetic dataset created by injecting planet signals into actual high-contrast imaging observations of the TW Hya protoplanetary disk from JWST. The model successfully identified the injected signals with high confidence, confirming its ability to function amidst complex, correlated noise and bright disk features. This work serves as a successful proof-of-concept, demonstrating that a CNN-Transformer architecture holds significant promise as a fast, accurate, and automated method for exoplanet detection in the large datasets expected from current and future high-contrast imaging instruments.</description>

      <title>Identification and Denoising of Radio Signals from Cosmic-Ray Air Showers using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio pulses generated by cosmic-ray air showers can be used to reconstruct key properties like the energy and depth of the electromagnetic component of cosmic-ray air showers. Radio detection threshold, influenced by natural and anthropogenic radio background, can be reduced through various techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an effective way to lower the threshold. We developed two CNNs: a classifier to distinguish radio signal waveforms from background noise and a denoiser to clean contaminated radio signals. Following the training and testing phases, we applied the networks to air-shower data triggered by scintillation detectors of the prototype station for the enhancement of IceTop, IceCube's surface array at the South Pole. Over a four-month period, we identified 554 cosmic-ray events in coincidence with IceTop, approximately five times more compared to a reference method based on a cut on the signal-to-noise ratio. Comparisons with IceTop measurements of the same air showers confirmed that the CNNs reliably identified cosmic-ray radio pulses and outperformed the reference method. Additionally, we find that CNNs reduce the false-positive rate of air-shower candidates and effectively denoise radio waveforms, thereby improving the accuracy of the power and arrival time reconstruction of radio pulses.</description>

      <title>Revealing Io's Surface using JWST-NIRISS Aperture Masking Interferometry and Neural Network Deconvolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Io is one of Jupiter's largest moons and the most volcanically active body in the Solar System. Its very active surface has hot spots produced by volcanic eruptions popping up at seemingly random locations and times. Characterizing the complex surface of Io requires the highest angular resolution available. This work presents the analysis of Aperture Masking Interferometric observations (at 4.3 um) of Io taken with the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. These are the first space-based infrared interferometric observations of a Solar System body ever taken. For complex extended objects like Io, the traditional visibility extraction algorithms from interferograms suffer from limitations. Here, new deconvolution methods based on Neural Networks allowed us to obtain reliable images from which a detailed analysis of the volcanically active surface of this moon was performed. Our study characterizes the loci and brightness of several unresolved volcanoes on the surface of Io, as well as the extended emission observed. We identified the brightest eruption (I_4.3um = 33 +/- 4.3 GW/um), referred to as V1, within an area to the North-East of Seth Patera (129.4 +/- 0.8 deg. W. Longitude, 1.5 +/- 0.7 deg. S. Latitude). Its projected speed (V_T = 86 +/- 34 m/s) is consistent with the rotational speed of Io. Additionally, six fainter volcanoes were identified and characterized. Complementary ground-based images, taken with the Keck II telescope, allowed us to benchmark the deconvolved Aperture Masking Interferometric images, showing consistency. Finally, we highlight the importance of characterizing Io's surface with long-term monitoring at high-angular resolution.</description>

Abstract: The detection of high-energy tau neutrinos remains a critical challenge in neutrino astronomy, limited by inadequate angular resolution and sensitivity in current detectors like IceCube and KM3NeT. We present a modular water Cherenkov detector prototype optimized for tau-neutrino-induced extensive air showers (EAS) in the 1-100 PeV range, leveraging canyon terrain for natural cosmic-ray shielding. Laboratory validation demonstrates this prototype design has high detection efficiency (&gt;99%) and timing resolution (&lt;2 ns) on MIP particles, enabling precise tau-neutrino-induced EAS reconstruction for future study. The results establish a foundation of a low-cost, scalable neutrino observatory, advancing flavor ratio measurements and cosmic-ray origin problems.</description>

      <title>Modeling tails of escaping gas in exoplanet atmospheres with Harmonica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanets that reside close to their host stars, and therefore receive substantial amounts of X-ray and ultraviolet radiation, are prone to suffer from strong atmospheric escape. This can lead to the creation of an envelope of escaping gas along the planet's orbital trajectory, often referred to as a tail. When transiting in front of their host star, these tails can not only produce larger depths in the transit light curves, but also introduce significant asymmetries between ingress and egress. Using the publicly available software Harmonica, we present a method to model the light curves of transiting planets surrounded by extended envelopes of escaping gas, and subsequently infer the shape and size of the latter. We apply this method to the JWST NIRISS/SOSS observations of HAT-P-18b, which show pronounced helium tail features in its spectroscopic light curve of the metastable helium triplet at 10830 \r{A}. Our model reveals that, in order to fit the observed light curve of HAT-P-18b, the planet must possess a trailing helium tail of $15.79^{+1.14}_{-1.05}$ planetary radii. We carry out injection-recovery tests to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. We demonstrate that, with sufficient precision, we would be able to fit a multi-layer envelope to the data, which would provide insight into the relative radial variations in the opacity profile.</description>

      <title>EECT: an Eccentricity Evolution Consistency Test to distinguish eccentric gravitational-wave signals from eccentricity mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eccentric compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are expected to be observed in current and future gravitational-wave (GW) detector networks. However, it has been recently pointed out that a number of other physical and beyond-GR effects, could imitate, or be mimicked by, eccentric CBCs. In this work, we propose a conceptually simple but powerful method to directly confirm or reject the eccentric hypothesis, without needing to compare the hypothesis with the plethora of other possible hypotheses. The key idea is that while spurious non-zero values of eccentricity, at some reference frequency, could be acquired when a non-eccentric CBC with additional physical/beyond-GR effects is recovered with an eccentric CBC waveform model, the {\it evolution} of eccentricity with frequency will in general not be mimicked. We accordingly formulate an eccentricity evolution consistency test (EECT). The method compares the eccentricity recovered at some low frequency value (e.g, $10$ Hz), evolved to higher frequencies assuming GR, with eccentricities recovered at those same higher frequencies. Discrepancy between the two eccentricities at any reference frequency would violate EECT and indicate the presence of a mimicker. As a proof of concept, assuming a few eccentric CBC systems, quasi-circular CBCs with additional physics mimicking eccentricity, and an O4-like three-detector-network configuration, we demonstrate that our proposed method is indeed able to reject mimickers at $\geq 68\%$ confidence, while ensuring that truly eccentric CBCs satisfy EECT.</description>

      <title>Understanding Radiation Flow in a Stochastic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation flow through an inhomogeneous medium is critical in a wide range of physics and astronomy applications from transport across cloud layers on the earth to the propagation of supernova blast-waves producing UV and X-ray emission in supernovae. This paper reviews the current state of the art in the modeling of inhomogeneous radiation transport, subgrid models developed to capture this often-unresolved physics, and the experiments designed to improve our understanding of these models. We present a series of detailed simulations (both single-clump and multi-clump conditions) probing the dependence on the physical properties of the radiation front (e.g. radiation energy) and material characteristics (specific heat, opacity, clump densities). Unless the radiation pressure is high, the clumps will heat and then expand, effectively cutting off the radiation flow. The expanding winds can also produce shocks that generates high energy emission. We compare our detailed simulations with some of the current subgrid prescriptions, identifying some of the limitations of these current models.</description>

      <title>Tools for High Precision Photometry from Wide-Field Color Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present AstroWISP: a collection of image processing tools for source extraction, background determination, point spread function/pixel response function fitting, and aperture photometry. AstroWISP is particularly well-suited for working with detectors featuring a Bayer mask (an array of microfilters applied to each detector pixel to allow color photography), such as consumer DSLR cameras. Such detectors pose significant challenges for existing tools while offering a much cheaper alternative to specialized devices. As a result, consumer DSLR cameras with Bayer masks are often underutilized for precision photometry. \astrowisp{} addresses this limitation in an effort to democratize precision photometry and support broader community participation in research. We demonstrate that our tools produce high-precision photometry from such images, enabling the use of such devices for detecting exoplanet transits. We package our tools for all major operating systems to ensure accessibility for amateur astronomers.</description>

      <title>Test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity: galactic white-dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upcoming space-based gravitational-wave detectors will be sensitive to millions and resolve tens of thousands of stellar-mass binary systems at mHz frequencies. The vast majority of these will be double white dwarfs in our Galaxy. The greatest part will remain unresolved, forming an incoherent stochastic foreground signal. Using state-of-the-art Galactic models for the formation and evolution of binary white dwarfs and accurate LISA simulated signals, we introduce a test for foreground Gaussianity and stationarity, building on methods available for ground-based detectors. We explain the observed non-stationarity with a new analytical modulation induced by the LISA constellation motion and the intrinsic anisotropy of the source distribution. By demodulating the foreground signal, we reveal a deviation from Gaussianity in the 2-10 mHz frequency band. Our finding is crucial to design faithful data models: the proposed method serves as a diagnostic and estimation tool to flag and model deviations, respectively. Neglecting them would introduce systematic biases on individual sources and astrophysical foregrounds parameter estimation, ultimately leading to inaccurate interpretation of the LISA data.</description>

      <title>A neural network for estimating compact binary coalescence parameters of gravitational-wave events in real time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-latency pipelines analyzing gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence events rely on matched filter techniques. Limitations in template banks and waveform modeling, as well as non-stationary detector noise cause errors in signal parameter recovery, especially for events with high chirp masses. We present a quantile regression neural network model that provides dynamic bounds on key parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, and total mass. We test the model on various synthetic datasets and real events from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave transient GTWC-3 catalog. We find that the model accuracy is consistently over 90% across all the datasets. We explore the possibility of employing the neural network bounds as priors in online parameter estimation. We find that they reduce by 9% the number of likelihood evaluations. This approach may shorten parameter estimation run times without affecting sky localizations.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG LXVIII. Characterization of the outer substellar companion around HD 72659 with a multi-technique approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Before discovering the first exoplanets, the Radial Velocity (RV) method had been used for decades to discover binary stars. Despite significant advancements in this technique, it is limited by the intrinsic mass-inclination degeneracy that can be broken when combining RVs with astrometry, which allows us to determine the orbital inclination, or direct imaging, from which we can estimate the true mass of the target. HD 72659 is a solar analog known to host a gas giant on a $\sim 10$-yr orbit and a massive outer companion. This work aims to confirm HD 72659 c, which was recently announced using data from HIRES and HARPS spectrographs in combination with Gaia's astrometric data. We monitored HD 72659 with HARPS-N in the framework of the GAPS project since 2012. We now combined our 91 spectra with literature data and Gaia DR3 high-precision astrometry to constrain the mass and the orbit of this object ($M_{\rm c} \sim 19$ $M_{\rm J}$, $a \sim 21$ au) that falls in the Brown Dwarf desert. Moreover, we analyzed our high-resolution imaging observation taken with SPHERE, but since the target was not detected, we could only derive upper limits on its mass. We characterize the orbital parameters of HD 72659 c, confirming the literature mass of this object but finding a period twice as high as previously reported, and we also refine the parameters of planet b with reduced uncertainties compared to previous works. Finally, we analyze and discuss the dynamic configuration of this system, finding that the Kozai-Lidov mechanism may be at work.</description>

      <title>Modeling of non-rotating neutron stars in 5D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the modeling of anisotropic magnetized static neutron stars within the framework of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (5D EGB) gravity. While Einstein's gravity has traditionally been employed to examine neutron stars, recent observational advancements have revealed its limitations in accurately describing high-mass astronomical objects-particularly in predicting or explaining certain observed neutron star masses. In response, this research seeks to address the limitations of Einstein's gravity in characterizing high-mass neutron stars by modifying the gravitational action and incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. This term holds significant dynamical relevance in higher dimensions, particularly within the context of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity explored in this study, thereby providing a more realistic description of gravitational phenomena under extreme conditions. By deriving the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and utilizing the AV18 potential, we analyze the profiles of metric functions, density and pressure, gradients of density and pressure, the anisotropic function and its trace, mass-function and compactness, the mass-radius curve, surface redshift function, equation of state parameters, and radial and tangential sound speeds. Additionally, stability factors, adiabatic indices, and energy conditions are examined. The results indicate that all conditions are satisfied for specific values of the coupling constant, confirming the physical stability of the model. Furthermore, higher dimensions enhance resistance to gravitational collapse, resulting in an increase in the maximum mass predicted by the proposed model. Ultimately, calculations show that the modified Buchdahl inequality is satisfied as well.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive spectroscopic reference of the solar system and its application to exoplanet direct imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a calibrated database of reflectance spectra for the solar system planets (i.e., Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) and for Titan, spanning from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. We considered data collected over 60 years of planetary observations, employing a broad range of geometries and facilities (spacecraft and ground-based observatories). To correct for differences in observational geometries and data quality, we adopted a two-step calibration process that standardized each spectrum to the planet's geometric albedo values and corrected for planetary heterogeneity and calibration effects. The calibrated datasets were then combined across wavelengths, leading to a reference composite reflectance spectrum for each planet. As a test of this spectral library for exoplanetary research, we simulated direct imaging observations of the Proxima Centauri and HD 219134 systems as solar system analogs, as well as the solar system at a distance of 10 parsecs. We also explored the detection limitations of direct imaging instruments imposed by the inner and outer working angles for Earth and Jupiter-like exoplanets as a function of system distance. Additionally, we used the visible light portion of the results to produce realistic color reconstructions of each planet. Standardizing reflectance spectra in this work improves our baseline for interpreting new reflected light observations of exoplanets through comparative planetology. This spectral library can then serve as a calibrated and validated reference in the modeling and preparation for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with future direct imaging missions and for astronomical studies of the solar system.</description>
