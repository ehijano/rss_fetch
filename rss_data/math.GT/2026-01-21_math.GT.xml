      <title>Open book decompositions with page a four-punctured sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study contact structures supported by open book decompositions whose pages are four-punctured spheres. The paper is split into two parts. In the first part, we find infinitely many overtwisted, right-veering monodromies on the four-punctured sphere. This is done using the techniques developed by Ito-Kawamuro in the papers arXiv:1112.5874, arXiv:1310.6404. Although most of the monodromies that we show are overtwisted are pseudo-Anosov, we are also able to classify precisely which reducible monodromies on the four-punctured sphere are tight. In the second part of the paper, we reprove part of a result of Lekili arXiv:1008.3529 by classifying which reducible mondromies have non-zero Heegaard Floer invariant. This is done by using the bordered contact invariants of Min-Varvarezos arXiv:2410.05511.</description>

      <title>On the second homology of the genus 3 hyperelliptic Torelli group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $s$ be a fixed hyperelliptic involution of the closed, oriented genus $g$ surface $\Sigma_g$. The hyperelliptic Torelli group $\mathcal{SI}_g$ is the subgroup of the mapping class group $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_g)$ consisting of elements that act trivially on $\mathrm{H}_1(\Sigma_g;\mathbb{Z})$ and commute with $s$. It is generated by Dehn twists about $s$-invariant separating curves, and its cohomological dimension is $g-1$. In this paper we study the top homology group $\mathrm{H}_2(\mathcal{SI}_3;\mathbb{Z})$. For each pair of disjoint $s$-invariant separating curves there is a naturally associated abelian cycle in $\mathrm{H}_2(\mathcal{SI}_3;\mathbb{Z})$; we call such cycles \emph{simple}. We show that simple abelian cycles are in bijection with orthogonal (with respect to the intersection form) splittings of $\mathrm{H}_1(\Sigma_3;\mathbb{Z})$ satisfying a simple algebraic condition, and prove that these abelian cycles are linearly independent in $\mathrm{H}_2(\mathcal{SI}_3;\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>A diagrammatic approach to the three-page index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-page index $\alpha_3(L)$ is an invariant that measures the complexity of representing a link $L$ in a three-page book. It is known that $\alpha_3(L)$ admits a linear upper bound in terms of the crossing number, with equality realized by the Hopf link.
  In this paper, we investigate the equality case of this bound from a diagrammatic viewpoint. Starting from a reduced link diagram, we construct three-page presentations via binding circles arising as boundaries of suitable contractible subcomplexes of the induced cell decomposition of the $2$-sphere. This approach allows a refined control of the number of arcs in the resulting three-page presentation.
  As a consequence, we prove that for any non-split, nontrivial link $L$ other than the Hopf link, \[ \alpha_3(L)\le 3c(L)-1, \] and hence characterize completely the links for which $\alpha_3(L)=3c(L)$.</description>

      <title>Fiber-preserving and orientation-reversing involutions of Seifert fibered 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fiber-preserving, orientation-reversing involutions on orientable Seifert fibered 3-manifolds and the conditions on a manifold for admissibility of such involutions. We construct a class $\Psi$ of fiber-preserving, orientation-reversing involutions that act trivially on the base. Each element of $\Psi$ is obtained by extending a product involution across Seifert pieces of type $V(2,2;-1)$ - a solid torus with three fibers filled according to Seifert invariants $(2,1)$, $(2,1)$, and $(1,-1)$. We show that $\Psi$ forms a single conjugacy class under fiber-preserving diffeomorphisms. Our main result establishes that any fiber-preserving, orientation-reversing involution factors as $\psi\circ g$, where $g$ is fiber-preserving and orientation-preserving and $\psi\in\Psi$, thus reducing the problem to the previously known orientation-preserving case. Through the orientable base-space double covering, we further extend the classification to manifolds with non-orientable base orbifold.</description>

      <title>Classification of invariant tight contact structures on the 3-space, -ball and -sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove some classification results for tight contact structure in the 3-space, -ball and -sphere that are invariant with respect to some arbitrary involution, that is conjugated to the standard rotation around the x-axis. Unlike the classical scenario, a new integral torsion appears, dictating a splitting between equivalence classes. These tools could be useful fur future classification results regarding strongly invertible Legendrian knots.</description>

      <title>On spaces of embeddings of circles in surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the space of embeddings of finitely many circles that bound disks in non-positively curved surfaces. We index the connected components of this space with finite rooted trees and show that the connected components are classifying spaces of the ``braided" automorphism groups of the associated trees. An intermediate step to proving these results is to construct a strong deformation retract onto the subspace of geometric circles; moreover, this strong deformation retraction is equivariant with respect to transformations of the surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Brownian loop measure on hyperbolic surfaces for Brownian motion with a constant killing rate. We compute the mass of Brownian loops with killing in a free homotopy class and then relate the total mass of loops in all essential homotopy classes to the Selberg zeta function when the surface is geometrically finite. As an application, we provide a probabilistic interpretation of different notions of regularized determinants of Laplacian, in both the compact and infinite-area cases.</description>

      <title>An algebro-geometric perspective on the topology of moduli spaces of differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentials on Riemann surfaces correspond to translation surfaces with conical singularities, and affine transformations acting on them preserve the orders of these singularities. This viewpoint allows the moduli spaces of differentials to appear in various guises across many areas, including algebraic geometry, dynamical systems, combinatorial enumeration, and mathematical physics. Over the past few decades, remarkable progress has been made in computing invariants of these moduli spaces, classifying linear subvarieties, understanding degenerations and compactifications, and developing intersection theory on these spaces. Despite these advances, our understanding of the topology of moduli spaces of differentials remains limited, and many fundamental questions are still open. In this survey, we aim to present, from an algebro-geometric perspective, the known results and open problems concerning the topology of moduli spaces of differentials, as well as their connections to other aspects of the field, with the hope of inspiring further developments in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Universality of the Basilica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish universality of the fat Basilica Julia set $J(z^2-\frac34)$ in conformal dynamics in the following sense: $J(z^2-\frac34)$ is quasiconformally equivalent to the fat Basilica Julia set of any polynomial as well as to the limit set of any geometrically finite closed surface Bers boundary group. We thus obtain the first example of a connected rational Julia set, not homeomorphic to the circle or the sphere, that is quasiconformally equivalent to a Kleinian limit set. It follows that any geometrically finite Bers boundary limit set is conformally removable. Other consequences of this universality result include quasi-symmetric uniformization of polynomial fat Basilicas by round Basilicas, and the existence of infinitely many non-commensurable uniformly quasi-symmetric surface subgroups of the Basilica quasi-symmetry group. We apply our techniques to cuspidal Basilica Julia sets arising from Schwarz reflections and cubic polynomials, yielding further universality classes. We also show that the standard Basilica Julia set $J(z^2-1)$ is the archbasilica in the David hierarchy.</description>

      <title>New Topological Restrictions For Spaces With Nonnegative Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain new topological restrictions for complete Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and RCD(0,n) spaces. Our main results are a Betti number rigidity theorem which answers a question open since work of M.-T. Anderson in 1990, and a vanishing theorem for the simplicial volume generalizing a theorem of M. Gromov from 1982. Combining such results we obtain a new proof of the classification of noncompact 3-manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, originally due to G. Liu in 2011, which extends to the synthetic setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the separability complex, a one-complex associated to a finite regular cover of the rose and show that it is connected if and only if the fundamental group of the associated cover is generated by its intersection with the set of elements in proper free factors of $\mathbf{F}_n$. The separability complex admits an action of $\mathrm{Out}(\mathbf{F}_n)$ by isometries if the associated cover corresponds to a characteristic subgroup of $\mathbf{F}_n$. We prove that the separability complex of the rose has infinite diameter and is nonhyperbolic, implying it is not quasi-isometric to the free splitting complex or the free factor complex. As a consequence, we obtain that the Cayley graph of $\mathbf{F}_n$ with generating set consisting of all primitive elements of $\mathbf{F}_n$ is nonhyperbolic.</description>

Abstract: In the search for transverse-universal knots in the standard contact structure on $\mathbb{S}^3$, we present a classification of the transverse twist knots with maximal self-linking number, that admit only overtwisted contact branched covers. As a direct consequence, we obtain an infinite family of transverse knots in $(\mathbb{S}^3,\xi_{std})$ that are not transverse-universal, although they are universal in the topological sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fibrations of the projective model for the symmetric space associated with $\text{SL}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ by codimension $2$ projective subspaces, or pencils of quadrics. In particular we show that if such a smooth fibration is equivariant with respect to a representation of a closed surface group, the representation is quasi-isometrically embedded, and even Anosov if the pencils in the image contain only non-degenerate quadrics. We use this to characterize maximal representations among representations of a closed surface group into $\text{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ by the existence of an equivariant continuous fibration of the associated symmetric space, satisfying an additional technical property. These fibrations extend to fibrations of the projective structures associated to maximal representations by bases of pencils of quadrics.</description>

      <title>A preorder on the set of links with applications to symmetric unions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a link $L$ in the $3$-sphere, the $\pi$-orbifold group $G^\mathrm{orb}(L)$ is defined as a quotient of the link group of $L$. When there exists an epimorphism $G^\mathrm{orb}(L)\to G^\mathrm{orb}(L')$, we denote this by $L\succeq L'$ and explore the relationships between the two links. Specifically, we prove that if $L\succeq L'$ and $L$ is a Montesinos link with $r$ rational tangles $(r\geq 3)$, then $L'$ is either a Montesinos link with at most $r+1$ rational tangles or a certain connected sum. We further show that if $L$ is a small link, then there are only finitely many links $L'$ satisfying $L\succeq L'$. In contrast, if $L$ has determinant zero, then $L\succeq L'$ for every $2$-bridge link $L'$. Our main applications concern symmetric unions of knots. In particular, we provide a criterion showing that a given knot does not admit a symmetric union presentation.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the Roger-Yang skein algebra of the annulus with two interior punctures, $ \mathcal S^{RY}(\Sigma_{0, 2, 2})$, and show there is a surjective homomorphism from this algebra to the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of the closed torus. Using this homomorphism, we characterize the irreducible, finite-dimensional representations of $ \mathcal S^{RY}(\Sigma_{0, 2, 2})$, showing that they can be described by certain complex data and that the correspondence is unique if certain polynomial conditions are satisfied. We also use the relationship with the skein algebra of the torus to compute structural constants for a bracelets basis for $ \mathcal S^{RY}(\Sigma_{0, 2, 2})$, giving evidence for positivity.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Legendrian and Legendrian Simplicity of Links in 3-Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct infinite families of non-simple isotopy classes of links in overtwisted contact structures on $S^1$-bundles over surfaces. These examples include: (1) a pair of Legendrian links that are not Legendrian isotopic, but which are isotopic as framed links, homotopic as Legendrian immersed multi-curves, and have Legendrian-isotopic components and (2) a pair of Legendrian links that are not Legendrian isotopic, but are isotopic as framed links, homotopic as Legendrian immersed multi-curves, and which are link-homotopic as Legendrian links. Moreover, we construct examples showing that both of these non-simplicity phenomena can occur in the same smooth isotopy class. To construct these examples, we develop the theory of links transverse to a nowhere-zero vector field in a 3-manifold, and construct analogous examples in the category of links transverse to a vector field.</description>

      <title>Quantum Heegaard diagrams and knot Floer Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a knot presented as a braid closure, we construct a unified intersection model for the Alexander and Jones polynomials of the knot via what we call quantum Heegaard diagrams. These diagrams are obtained by stabilising the disc model of the first author, which we show are doubly-pointed Heegaard diagrams of the knot together with an additional set of base points. We identify the Alexander grading in the disc model with the Alexander grading in the Heegaard diagram. As the Lagrangian intersection Floer homology of the Heegaard tori in the symmetric power of the Heegaard surface is knot Floer homology, we can view knot Floer homology as a natural categorification of the Alexander polynomial arising from the disc model.
  The additional base points let us define a new grading on the intersection between the Heegaard tori, which we call quantum Alexander grading. Combining this with the classical Alexander grading, we define a two-variable graded intersection between the Heegaard tori that recovers the Jones and Alexander polynomials as two specialisations of coefficients. The resulting intersection formula for the Jones polynomial opens up a potential avenue to obtaining a new geometric categorification of the Jones polynomial.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity via Geodesic Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:1504.06863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geodesic $g$ is Morse, for every $L \geq 1, A \geq 0$ there exists a $C=C_g(L,A)$ such that any $(L,A)$-quasi-geodesic connecting two points on $g$ stays $C$-close to $g$. The Morse lemma implies that in a hyperbolic space every geodesic is Morse. Here we prove the converse: If a homogeneous proper geodesic space is such that for every geodesic $g$ and every $L\geq 1, A \geq 0$ there exists a constant $C=C_g(L,A)$ such that any $(L,A)$-quasi-geodesic between any two points on $g$ stays $C$-close, then the space is hyperbolic. This applies in particular to infinite groups in which all geodesics are Morse.</description>

      <title>Functional dimension of feedforward ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the parameterized family of functions representable by fully-connected feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation function is precisely the class of piecewise linear functions with finitely many pieces. It is less well-known that for every fixed architecture of ReLU neural network, the parameter space admits positive-dimensional spaces of symmetries, and hence the local functional dimension near any given parameter is lower than the parametric dimension. In this work we carefully define the notion of functional dimension, show that it is inhomogeneous across the parameter space of ReLU neural network functions, and continue an investigation - initiated in [14] and [5] - into when the functional dimension achieves its theoretical maximum. We also study the quotient space and fibers of the realization map from parameter space to function space, supplying examples of fibers that are disconnected, fibers upon which functional dimension is non-constant, and fibers upon which the symmetry group acts non-transitively.</description>

      <title>Non-hyperbolic 3-manifolds and 3D field theories for 2D Virasoro minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using 3D-3D correspondence, we construct 3D dual bulk field theories for general Virasoro minimal models $M(P,Q)$. These theories correspond to Seifert fiber spaces $S^2 ((P,P-R),(Q,S),(3,1))$ with two integers $(R,S)$ satisfying $PS-QR =1$. In the unitary case, where $|P-Q|=1$, the bulk theory has a mass gap and flows to a unitary topological field theory (TQFT) in the IR, which is expected to support the chiral Virasoro minimal model at the boundary under an appropriate boundary condition. For the non-unitary case, where $|P-Q|&gt;1$, the bulk theory flows to a 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 superconformal field theory, whose topologically twisted theory supports the chiral minimal model at the boundary. We also provide a concrete field theory description of the 3D bulk theory using $T[SU(2)]$ theories. Our proposals are supported by various consistency checks using 3D-3D relations and direct computations of various partition functions.</description>

      <title>Elementary equivalence and diffeomorphism groups of smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds, with $M$ closed and connected. If the $C^r$--diffeomorphism group of $M$ is elementarily equivalent to the $C^s$--diffeomorphism group of $N$ for some $r,s\in[1,\infty)\cup\{0,\infty\}$, then $r=s$ and $M$ and $N$ are $C^r$--diffeomorphic. This strengthens a previously known result by Takens and Filipkiewicz, which asserts that for integer regularities, a group isomorphism between diffeomorphism groups of closed manifolds necessarily arises from a diffeomorphism of the underlying manifolds. We prove an analogous result for groups of diffeomorphisms preserving smooth volume forms, in dimension at least two.</description>

      <title>Analytic Theory on the Space of Blaschke Products: Simultaneous Uniformization and Pressure Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study complex analytic aspects of the moduli space $\Bcal_d^{fm}$ of degree $d\ge2$ fixed-point-marked Blaschke products. We define a complex structure on $\Bcal_d^{fm}$ and prove the simultaneous uniformization theorem for fixed-point-marked quasi-Blaschke products. As an application, we show that the pressure semi-norms on the space of Blaschke products are non-degenerate outside of the super-attracting locus $\mathcal{SA}^{fm}_d$, which is a codimension-1 subspace of $\Bcal^{fm}_d$.</description>

      <title>Finite generation of abelianizations of the genus 3 Johnson kernel and the commutator subgroup of the Torelli group for $\mathrm{Out}(F_3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_g^b$ be a compact oriented surface of genus $g$ with $b$ boundary components, where $b\in\{0,1\}$. The Johnson kernel $\mathcal{K}_g^b$ is the subgroup of the mapping class group $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_g^b)$ generated by Dehn twists about separating simple closed curves. Let $F_n$ be a free group with $n$ generators. The Torelli group for $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ is the subgroup $\mathrm{IO}_n\subset\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ consisting of all outer automorphisms that act trivially on the abelianization of $F_n$. Long standing questions are whether the groups $\mathcal{K}_g^b$ and $[\mathrm{IO}_n,\mathrm{IO}_n]$ or their abelianizations $(\mathcal{K}_g^b)^{\mathrm{ab}}$ and $[\mathrm{IO}_n,\mathrm{IO}_n]^{\mathrm{ab}}$ are finitely generated for $g\ge3$ (respectively, $n\ge3$). During the last 15 years, these questions were answered positively for $g\ge4$ and $n\ge4$, respectively. Nevertheless, the cases of $g=3$ and $n=3$ remained completely unsettled. In this paper, we prove that the abelianizations $(\mathcal{K}_3^b)^{\mathrm{ab}}$ and $[\mathrm{IO}_3,\mathrm{IO}_3]^{\mathrm{ab}}$ are finitely generated. Our approach is based on a new general sufficient condition for a module over a Laurent polynomial ring to be finitely generated as an abelian group.</description>

      <title>Higher property T and below-rank phenomena of lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. We explore higher property T as an abstract group-theoretic property. In particular, we provide new operator-algebraic characterizations of higher property T. Then we turn to lattices in semisimple Lie groups. We relate higher property T to other cohomological, rigidity and geometric phenomena below the real rank. The second part outlines a conjectural framework that unifies these aspects and reviews recent advances.</description>
