      <title>Graph Products of Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagine three Rubik's Cubes arranged in a row, linked such that any move on the left or right cube also applies to the middle one, and moves on the middle cube affect all three simultaneously. If each cube is individually solvable, can all three be solved together in this configuration? This question motivates a natural generalization of the Lights Out Puzzle, exploring the synergy between graph theory and group theory.
  The classic Lights Out Puzzle is played on a $5 \times 5$ grid where each square is either "on" or "off." Clicking a square toggles its state and that of its neighbors, and the objective is to turn all squares "off." A related question, solvable using linear algebra over $\mathbb{F}_2$, the finite field of 2 elements, asks which states are possible to achieve starting from the all-on state. Here, we vastly generalize the setting in two ways: (1) the states are allowed to be the elements of a group $G$, where "clicking" is done by selecting an element $g \in G$ and multiplying all affected squares on the right by $g$, and (2) we not only allow square grids, but any graph $\Gamma$, where clicking a vertex $v$ affects $v$ and all adjacent vertices.
  Starting with the identity element $e \in G$ for all vertices, the totality of all achievable state configurations forms a group $G^{\Gamma}$. This group generalizes parallel products of group actions and provides a rich structure for analysis. For many graphs, which we term "RA" (reducible to abelian), the problem reduces - regardless of $G$ - to a linear algebra question over $\mathbb{Z}$ (the integers). We discuss a chain of five different subgroups consisting of commutators; the largest two are equal precisely when the graph is RA. Interestingly, while most graphs appear to be RA, we show the odd-dimensional cube graphs $Q_{2n+1}$ are not.</description>

      <title>Global determinism of completely regular semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power semigroup of a semigroup $ S $ is the semigroup of all nonempty subsets of $ S $ equipped with the naturally defined multiplication. A class $\mathcal{K} $ of semigroups is globally determined if any two members of $ \mathcal{K} $ with isomorphic globals are themselves isomorphic. The global determinability for various classes of semigroups has attracted some attention during the past 50 years. In this paper we prove that the class of all completely regular semigroups is globally determined. This is an extension and generalization of a series of related results obtained by some other mathematicians.</description>

      <title>Counting lifts of irreducible Brauer characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime, and suppose that $G$ is a $p$-solvable group and $\varphi\in {\rm IBr}(G)$ has vertex $Q$. In 2011, Cossey, Lewis and Navarro proved that the number of lifts of $\varphi$ is at most $|Q:Q'|$ whenever $Q$ is normal in $G$. In this paper, we present an explicit description of the set of lifts of $\varphi$ with a given vertex pair $(Q,\delta)$ under a weaker condition on $Q$, and thus generalize their result.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic construction of some extremal $p$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $p$-group $G$ is called *ab-maximal* if $|H : H'| &lt; |G:G'|$ for every proper subgroup $H$ of $G$. Similarly, $G$ is called *$d$-maximal* if $d(H) &lt; d(G)$ for every proper subgroup $H$ of $G$, where $d(H)$ is the minimal number of generators of $H$. If $G$ is ab-maximal then $|G:G'| \ge p^3 |G'|$, while if $G$ is $d$-maximal and $p \ne 2$ then $|G:G'| \ge p^2 |G'|$. Answering questions of Gonz\'alez-S\'anchez--Klopsch and Lisi--Sabatini, for all $p$ we construct infinitely many ab-maximal $p$-groups of class $2$ with $|G:G'| = p^3 |G'|$, and infinitely many $d$-maximal $p$-groups of class $2$ with $|G:G'| = p^2 |G'|$. The construction is probabilistic and based on the degeneracy of random alternating bilinear maps on subspaces. It is notable however that in the ab-maximal case we do not have a high-probability result but rather in a suitable sense the proportion of class-$2$ groups with $|G:G'| = p^n$ and $|G'| = p^{n-3}$ that are ab-maximal is close to $1/e$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over each nontrivial finite group $G$, there exists a finite system of equations having no solutions in larger finite groups but having a solution in a periodic group containing $G$. We prove several similar facts about amenable, orderable, locally indicable, solvable, nilpotent, and other classes of groups. As a byproduct, we also show that any amalgam of two countable periodic groups with finite intersection embeds into a periodic group, thereby answering a 1960 question of B. Neumann in the countable case.</description>

      <title>Some characterizations of weak left braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generalizations of skew left braces, weak left braces were introduced recently by Catino, Mazzotta, Miccoli and Stefanelli to study ceratin special degenerate set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. In this note, as analogues of the notions of regular subgroups of holomorph of groups and Gamma functions on groups, we propose the notions of good inverse subsemigroups and Gamma functions associated to Clifford semigroups, respectively, by which weak left braces are characterized. Moreover, symmetric, $\lambda$-homomorphic and $\lambda$-anti-homomorphic weak left braces are introduced and the algebraic structures of these weak left braces are given.</description>

      <title>A note on Frobenius quotient for prime-power divisor of the exponent of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $n$ be any prime-power divisor of ${\rm exp}(G)$, the exponent of $G$. Frobenius' theorem indicates that $|\{g\in G\mid g^n=1\}|=f_n\cdot n$ for some positive integer $f_n$. We call $f_n$ a Frobenius quotient of $G$ for $n$. Let $\mathcal{F}_{pp}(G)=\{f_n\mid n$ is any prime-power divisor of ${\rm exp}(G)$$\}$ and ${\rm mf}_{pp}(G)$ be the maximum Frobenius quotient in $\mathcal{F}_{pp}(G)$. In this paper, we provide a complete classification of finite group $G$ with ${\rm mf}_{pp}(G)\leq q$, where $q$ is the smallest prime divisor of $|G|$.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on the group of formal diffeomorphisms of the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a strictly positively graded finitely generated infinite-dimensional real Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. It has a well-defined Lie group $\overline{\mathbf{G}}$, which is an inverse limit of finite-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups (a pro-unipotent group). Generally, representations (even finite-dimensional representations) of $\mathfrak{g}$ and actions of $\mathfrak{g}$ on manifolds do not admit liftings to $\overline{\mathbf{G}}$. There is a canonically defined dense subgroup $\mathbf{G}^\circ\subset \overline{\mathbf{G}}$ with a stronger (Polish) topology, which admits lifting of representations of $\mathfrak{g}$ in finite-dimensional spaces (and, more generally, of representations of $\mathfrak{g}$ by bounded operators in Banach spaces). We describe this completion for the group $\overline{\mathbf{Diff}}$ of formal diffeomorphisms of the line, i.e., substitutions of the form $x\mapsto x+ p(x)$, where $p(x)=a_2 x^2+\dots$ are formal series, and show that the group $\mathbf{Diff}^\circ$ consists of series with subfactorial growth of coefficients.</description>

      <title>Verified Certificates via SAT and Computer Algebra Systems for the Ramsey R(3, 8) and R(3, 9) Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ramsey problem R(3, k) seeks to determine the smallest value of n such that any red/blue edge coloring of the complete graph on n vertices must either contain a blue triangle (3-clique) or a red clique of size k. Despite its significance, many previous computational results for the Ramsey R(3, k) problem such as R(3, 8) and R(3, 9) lack formal verification. To address this issue, we use the software MATHCHECK to generate certificates for Ramsey problems R(3, 8) and R(3, 9) (and symmetrically R(8, 3) and R(9, 3)) by integrating a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver with a computer algebra system (CAS). Our SAT+CAS approach significantly outperforms traditional SAT-only methods, demonstrating a significant improvement in runtime. For instance, our SAT+CAS approach solves R(8, 3) sequentially in 18.5 hours, while a SAT-only approach using the state-of-the-art CaDiCaL solver times out after 7 days. Additionally, in order to be able to scale to harder Ramsey problem like R(9, 3) we further optimized our SAT+CAS tool using a parallelized cube-and-conquer approach. Our results provide the first independently verifiable certificates for these Ramsey numbers, ensuring both correctness and completeness of the exhaustive search process of our SAT+CAS tool.</description>

      <title>Automorphism group schemes of lattice vertex operator algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a positive definite even lattice and a commutative ring, there is a standard construction of a lattice vertex algebra over the commutative ring, and this is promoted to a vertex operator algebra when the determinant of the lattice is invertible. We describe the groups of automorphisms of these vertex algebras and vertex operator algebras as affine group schemes, showing in particular that each is an extension of an explicitly described split reductive group of ADE type by the outer automorphism group of the lattice.</description>

      <title>There Is An Equivalence Relation Whose von Neumann Algebra Is Not Connes Embeddable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MIP$^*$=RE [Ji+22] was used to prove the existence of a non Connes embeddable tracial von Neumann algebra. Recently, similar ideas were used in [Bow+24, BCV24] to give a negative solution to the Aldous-Lyons conjecture: there is a non co-sofic IRS on any non-abelian free group. We define a notion of hyperlinearity for an IRS and show that there is a non co-hyperlinear IRS on any non-abelian free group, which reproves the main results of [Bow+24, BCV24]. As a corollary, we prove that there is a relation whose von Neumann algebra is not Connes embeddable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.05380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homeomorphism groups of generalized Wa\.zewski dendrites act on the infinite countable set of branch points of the dendrite and thus have a nice Polish topology. In this paper, we study them in the light of this Polish topology. The group of the universal Wa\.zewski dendrite $D_\infty$ is more characteristic than the others because it is the unique one with a dense conjugacy class. For this group $G_\infty$, we show some of its topological properties like existence of a comeager conjugacy class, the Steinhaus property, automatic continuity and the small index subgroup property. Moreover, we identify the universal minimal flow of $G_\infty$. This allows us to prove that point-stabilizers in $G_\infty$ are amenable and to describe the universal Furstenberg boundary of $G_\infty$.</description>

      <title>Biclosed sets, quasitrivial semigroups and oriented matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00943v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of biclosed sets in an irreducible root system of type $A_n$ and the set of quasitrivial semigroup structures on a set with $n+1$ elements. Inspired by this correspondence, we first generalize this bijection to give a semigroup structural characterization of the biclosed sets in a standard parabolic subset. Secondly, we define an index for an arbitrary subset of the root system of type $A_n$ which measures how far it is from being biclosed. We show that such an index equals to the associativity index of the associated quasitrivial magma. Thirdly, we define type $B_n$ quasitrivial semigroups which are in bijective with the type $B_n$ biclosed sets. Finally, we use the identification of certain biclosed sets with total preorders to give a purely combinatorial proof that a root system of type $A$ has an oriented matroid structure.</description>

The topics range from an introduction of Cayley and Schreier graphs to Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth and amenability. We discuss the ping-pong lemma, quasi-isometries, growth of groups, hyperbolicity, and other related notions. The book is based on graduate courses and can be used for such a course or for independent study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{Nil}$ be the class of nilpotent groups. This article explores the finiteness of meta and para-$\mathfrak{Nil}$-Hamiltonian groups or their derived subgroups when these groups contain a soluble subgroup of finite index or a non-nilpotent (or insoluble) subgroup of finite order respectively.</description>

      <title>Determining PSL(2,11) Via A Same-size Conjugacy Class Set With Almost Distinct Conjugacy Class Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove if G is a finite simple group with same-size conjugacy class set, U(G) = {1, rq, 4rq, 8pq, 8pr}, where p, q, r are prime numbers, then G is isomorphic to PSL(2, l), where l is prime greater than 7. In particular, if this group with previous conditions has at most two conjugacy classes of each size, then G is isomorphic to PSL(2, 11).</description>

      <title>Vanishing Elements of Prime Power Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An element $x$ in a finite group $G$ is said to be \textit{vanishing} if some (complex) irreducible character of $G$ takes value $0$ at $x$. In this article, we prove that every finite simple group, except $\mathrm{SL}_2(4)$ and $\mathrm{SL}_2(8)$, contains a vanishing element of prime power order whose conjugacy class size is divisible by three distinct primes. We use this result to prove that if $p$ is a prime, which does not divide the conjugacy class size of any vanishing element of prime power order in $G$, then $G$ has normal $p$-complement and abelian Sylow $p$-subgroup; this generalizes a result of Dolfi et al. ($2010$). We also prove that in a non-solvable finite group $G$, if the conjugacy class size of all the vanishing elements of prime power order has at most two distinct prime divisors, then $G/\mathrm{Sol}(G)$ is a direct product of mutually isomorphic simple groups among $\mathrm{SL}_2(4)$ and $\mathrm{SL}_2(8)$. ($\mathrm{Sol}(G)$ is the largest normal solvable subgroup of $G$.) This generalizes a result of Robati ($2020$).</description>

      <title>Neighborhoods, connectivity, and diameter of the nilpotent graph of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nilpotent graph of a group $G$ is the simple and undirected graph whose vertices are the elements of $G$ and two distinct vertices are adjacent if they generate a nilpotent subgroup of $G$. Here we discuss some topological properties of the nilpotent graph of a finite group $G$. Indeed, we characterize finite solvable groups whose closed neighborhoods are nilpotent subgroups. Moreover, we study the connectivity of the graph $\Gamma(G)$ obtained removing all universal vertices from the nilpotent graph of $G$. Some upper bounds to the diameter of $\Gamma(G)$ are provided when $G$ belongs to some classes of groups.</description>

      <title>Typical Ramsey properties of the primes, abelian groups and other discrete structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a matrix $A$ with integer entries, a subset $S$ of an abelian group and $r \in \mathbb N$, we say that $S$ is $(A,r)$-Rado if any $r$-colouring of $S$ yields a monochromatic solution to the system of equations $Ax=0$. A classical result of Rado characterises all those matrices $A$ such that $\mathbb N$ is $(A,r)$-Rado for all $r \in \mathbb N$. R\"odl and Ruci\'nski and Friedgut, R\"odl and Schacht proved a random version of Rado's theorem where one considers a random subset of $[n]:=\{1,\dots,n\}$ instead of $\mathbb N$.
  In this paper, we investigate the analogous random Ramsey problem in the more general setting of abelian groups. Given a sequence $(S_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ of finite subsets of abelian groups, let $S_{n,p}$ be a random subset of $S_n$ obtained by including each element of $S_n$ independently with probability $p$. We are interested in determining the probability threshold $\hat p:=\hat p(n)$ such that
  $$\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb P [ S_{n,p} \text{ is } (A,r)\text{-Rado}]= \begin{cases} 0 &amp;\text{ if } p=o(\hat p); \\ 1 &amp;\text{ if } p=\omega(\hat p). \end{cases}$$
  Our main result, which we coin the random Rado lemma, is a general black box to tackle problems of this type. Using this tool in conjunction with a series of supersaturation results, we determine the probability threshold for a number of different cases. A consequence of the Green-Tao theorem is the van der Waerden theorem for the primes: every finite colouring of the primes contains arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions. Using our machinery, we obtain a random version of this result. We also prove a novel supersaturation result for $S_n:=[n]^d$ and use it to prove an integer lattice generalisation of the random version of Rado's theorem. Various threshold results for abelian groups are also given.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Minimal Faithful Permutation Degree for Fitting-free Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the complexity of computing the minimal faithful permutation degree for groups without abelian normal subgroups. When our groups are given as quotients of permutation groups, we establish that this problem is in $\textsf{P}$. Furthermore, in the setting of permutation groups, we obtain an upper bound of $\textsf{NC}$ for this problem. This improves upon the work of Das and Thakkar (STOC 2024), who established a Las Vegas polynomial-time algorithm for this class in the setting of permutation groups.</description>
