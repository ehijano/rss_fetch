      <title>The quotients of the $p$-adic group ring of a cyclic group of order $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify, up to isomorphism, the $\mathbb{Z}_pG$-modules of rank $1$ (i.e., the quotients of $\mathbb{Z}_pG$) for $G$ cyclic of order $p$, where $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is the ring of $p$-adic integers. This allows us in particular to determine effectively the quotients of $\mathbb{Z}_pG$ which are cohomologically trivial over $G$. There are natural zeta functions associated to $\mathbb{Z}_pG$ for which we give an explicit formula.</description>

      <title>On $n$-isoclinism of skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isoclinism was introduced by Hall and is an important concept in group theory. More generally, there is the notion of $n$-isoclinism for every natural number $n$. Recently, Letourmy and Vendramin (2023) extended the notions of isoclinism and also stem groups to the setting of skew braces. In this paper, we shall propose two analogs of $n$-isoclinism and $n$-stem groups for skew braces. We shall prove that for the ``weak" version, analogous to the case of groups, weak $n$-isoclinism implies weak $(n+1)$-isoclinism.</description>

      <title>The speed of random walks on semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct, for each real number $0\leq \alpha \leq 1$, a random walk on a finitely generated semigroup whose speed exponent is $\alpha$. We further show that the speed function of a random walk on a finitely generated semigroup can be arbitrarily slow, yet tending to infinity. These phenomena demonstrate a sharp contrast from the group-theoretic setting. On the other hand, we show that the distance of a random walk on a finitely generated semigroup from its starting position is infinitely often larger than a non-constant universal lower bound, excluding a certain degenerate case.</description>

      <title>Quotients of Poisson boundaries, entropy, and spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poisson boundary is a measurable $\Gamma$-space canonically associated with a group $\Gamma$ and a probability measure $\mu$ on it. The collection of all measurable $\Gamma$-equivariant quotients, known as $\mu$-boundaries, of the Poisson boundary forms a partially ordered set, equipped with a strictly monotonic non-negative function, known as Furstenberg or differential entropy.
  In this paper we demonstrate the richness and the complexity of this lattice of quotients for the case of free groups and surface groups and rather general measures. In particular, we show that there are continuum many unrelated $\mu$-boundaries at each, sufficiently low, entropy level, and there are continuum many distinct order-theoretic cubes of $\mu$-boundaries.
  These $\mu$-boundaries are constructed from dense linear representations $\rho:\Gamma\to G$ to semi-simple Lie groups, like $\PSL_2(\bbC)^d$ with absolutely continuous stationary measures on $\hat\bbC^d$.</description>

      <title>Commutator subalgebra of the Lie algebra associated with a right-angled Coxeter group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the graded Lie algebra $L(RC_K)$ associated with the lower central series of a right-angled Coxeter group $RC_K$. We prove that its commutator subalgebra is a quotient of the polynomial ring over an auxiliary Lie subalgebra $N_K$ of the graph Lie algebra $L_K$, and conjecture that the quotient map is an isomorphism. The epimorphism is defined in terms of a new operation in the associated Lie algebra, which corresponds to the squaring and has an analogue in homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Groups with finitely many long commutators of maximal order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a group $G$ and elements $x_1,x_2,\dots, x_\ell\in G$, the commutator of the form $[x_1,x_2,\dots, x_\ell]$ is called a commutator of length $\ell$. The present paper deals with groups having only finitely many commutators of length $\ell$ of maximal order. We establish the following results.
  Let $G$ be a residually finite group with finitely many commutators of length $\ell$ of maximal order. Then $G$ contains a subgroup $M$ of finite index such that $\gamma_\ell(M)=1$. Moreover, if $G$ is finitely generated, then $\gamma_\ell(G)$ is finite.
  Let $\ell,m,n,r$ be positive integers and $G$ an $r$-generator group with at most $m$ commutators of length $\ell$ of maximal order $n$. Suppose that either $n$ is a prime power, or $n=p^{\alpha}q^{\beta}$, where $p$ and $q$ are odd primes, or $G$ is nilpotent. Then $\gamma_\ell(G)$ is finite of $(m,\ell,r)$-bounded order and there is a subgroup $M\le G$ of $(m,\ell,r)$-bounded index such that $\gamma_\ell(M)=1$.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of uniformly random permutation representations of surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a closed orientable surface of genus at least two. Consider the composition of a uniformly random element of $\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,S_n)$ with the $(n-1)$-dimensional irreducible representation of $S_n$. We prove the strong convergence in probability as $n\to\infty$ of this sequence of random representations to the regular representation of $\Gamma$.
  As a consequence, for any closed hyperbolic surface $X$, with probability tending to one as $n\to\infty$, a uniformly random degree-$n$ covering space of $X$ has near optimal relative spectral gap -- ignoring the eigenvalues that arise from the base surface $X$.
  To do so, we show that the polynomial method of proving strong convergence can be extended beyond rational settings.
  To meet the requirements of this extension we prove two new kinds of results. First, we show there are effective polynomial approximations of expected values of traces of elements of $\Gamma$ under random homomorphisms to $S_n$. Secondly, we estimate the growth rates of probabilities that a finitely supported random walk on $\Gamma$ is a proper power after a given number of steps.</description>

      <title>Iwasawa theory and the representations of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, I develop a representation-theoretic refinement of the Iwasawa theory of finite Cayley graphs. Building on analogies between graph zeta functions and number-theoretic L-functions, I study $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-towers of Cayley graphs and the asymptotic growth of their Jacobians. My main result establishes that the Iwasawa polynomial associated to such a tower admits a canonical factorization indexed by the irreducible representations of the underlying group. This leads to the definition of representation-theoretic Iwasawa polynomials, whose properties are studied.</description>

      <title>Invariants of Handlebody-Links and Spatial Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $G-$family of quandles is an algebraic construction which was proposed by A. Ishii, M. Iwakiri, Y. Jang, K. Oshiro in 2013. The axioms of these algebraic systems were motivated by handlebody-knot theory. In the present work we investigate possible constructions which generalise $G-$family of quandles and other similar constructions (for example, $Q-$ and $(G,*,f)-$families of quandles). We provide the necessary conditions under which the resulting object (called an $(X,G,{*_g},f,\otimes,\oplus)-$system) gives a colouring invariant of knotted handlebodies. We also discuss several other modifications of the proposed construction, providing invariants of spatial graphs with an arbitrary (finite) set of values of vertex valency. Besides, we consider several examples which in particular showcase the differences between spatial trivalent graph and handlebody-link theories.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov spectrum via boundary theory I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Lyapunov spectrum for measurable cocycles
  over an ergodic pmp system taking values in semi-simple real Lie groups.
  We prove simplicity of the Lyapunov spectrum and its continuity
  under certain perturbations for a class systems that includes many
  familiar examples.
  Our framework uses some soft qualitative assumptions, and does not
  rely on symbolic dynamics.
  We use ideas from boundary theory
  that appear in the study of super-rigidity to deduce our results.
  This gives a new perspective even on the most studied case of random
  matrix products.
  The current paper introduces the general framework and contains the proofs
  of the main results and some basic examples.
  In a follow up paper we discuss further examples.</description>

      <title>Periodic approximation of topological Lyapunov exponents and the joint spectral radius for cocycles of mapping classes of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cocycles taking values in the mapping class group of closed surfaces and investigate their leading topological Lyapunov exponent. Under a natural closing property, we show that the top topological Lyapunov exponent can be approximated by periodic orbits. We also extend the notion of the joint spectral radius to this setting, interpreting it via the exponential growth of curves under iterated mapping classes. Our approach connects ideas from ergodic theory, Teichm\"uller geometry, and spectral theory, and suggests a broader framework for similar results.</description>

      <title>Kernels in measurable cohomology for transitive actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a connected semisimple Lie group $G$, Monod has recently proved that the measurable cohomology of the $G$-action $H^*_m(G \curvearrowright G/P)$ on the Furstenberg boundary $G/P$, where $P$ is a minimal parabolic subgroup, maps surjectively on the measurable cohomology of $G$ through the evaluation on a fixed basepoint. Additionally, the kernel of this map depends entirely on the invariant cohomology of a maximal split torus. In this paper we show a similar result for a fixed subgroup $L&lt;P$ such that the stabilizer of almost every pair of points in $G/L$ is compact. More precisely, we show that the cohomology of the $G$-action $H^p_m(G \curvearrowright G/L)$ maps surjectively onto $H^p_m(G)$ with a kernel isomorphic to $H^{p-1}_m(L)$. Examples of such groups are given either by any term of the derived series of the unipotent radical $N$ of $P$ or by a maximal split torus $A$. We conclude the paper by computing explicitly some cocycles on quotients of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{K})$ for $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15504v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study both the Submonoid Membership problem and the Rational Subset Membership problem in finitely generated nilpotent groups. We give two reductions with important applications. First, Submonoid Membership in any nilpotent group can be reduced to Rational Subset Membership in smaller groups. As a corollary, we prove the existence of a group with decidable Submonoid Membership and undecidable Rational Subset Membership, confirming a conjecture of Lohrey and Steinberg. Second, the Rational Subset Membership problem in $H_3(\mathbb Z)$ can be reduced to the Knapsack problem in the same group, and is therefore decidable. Combining both results, we deduce that the filiform $3$-step nilpotent group has decidable Submonoid Membership.</description>

      <title>Around first-order rigidity of Coxeter groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By the work of Sela, for any free group $F$, the Coxeter group $W_ 3 = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \ast \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \ast \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ is elementarily equivalent to $W_3 \ast F$, and so Coxeter groups are not closed under elementary equivalence among finitely generated groups. In this paper we show that if we restrict to models which are generated by finitely many torsion elements (finitely torsion-generated), then we can recover striking rigidity results. Our main result is that if $(W, S)$ is a Coxeter system whose irreducible components are either spherical, or affine or (Gromov) hyperbolic, and $G$ is finitely torsion-generated and elementarily equivalent to $W$, then $G$ is itself a Coxeter group. This combines results of the second author et al. from [MPS22, PS23] with the following main hyperbolic result: if $W$ is a Coxeter hyperbolic group and $G$ is $\mathrm{AE}$-equivalent to $W$ and finitely torsion-generated, then $G$ belongs to a finite collection of Coxeter groups (modulo isomorphism). Furthermore, we show that there are two hyperbolic Coxeter groups $W$ and $W'$ which are non-isomorphic but $\mathrm{AE}$-equivalent. We also show that, on other hand, if we restrict to certain specific classes of Coxeter groups then we can recover the strongest possible form of first-order rigidity, which we call first-order torsion-rigidity, namely the Coxeter group $W$ is the only finitely torsion-generated model of its theory. Crucially, we show that this form of rigidity holds for the following classes of Coxeter groups: even hyperbolic Coxeter groups and free products of one-ended or finite hyperbolic Coxeter groups. We conjecture that the same kind of phenomena occur for the whole class of Coxeter groups. In this direction, we prove that if $W$ and $W'$ are even Coxeter groups which are elementarily equivalent, then they are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Embedding groups into boundedly acyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the \s{\phi}-labeled Thompson groups and the twisted Brin--Thompson groups are boundedly acyclic. This allows us to prove several new embedding results for groups. First, every group of type $F_n$ embeds quasi-isometrically into a boundedly acyclic group of type $F_n$ that has no proper finite index subgroups. This improves a result of Bridson and a theorem of Fournier-Facio--L\"oh--Moraschini. Second, every group of type $F_n$ embeds quasi-isometrically into a $5$-uniformly perfect group of type $F_n$. Third, using Belk--Zaremsky's construction of twisted Brin--Thompson groups, we show that every finitely generated group embeds quasi-isometrically into a finitely generated boundedly acyclic simple group. We also partially answer some questions of Brothier and Tanushevski regarding the finiteness property of $\phi$-labeled Thompson group $V_\phi(G)$ and $F_\phi(G)$.</description>

      <title>Translation-like actions by $\mathbb{Z}$, the subgroup membership problem, and Medvedev degrees of effective subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every infinite, locally finite, and connected graph admitsa translation-like action by $\mathbb{Z}$, and that this action can be takento be transitive exactly when the graph has either one or two ends.The actions constructed satisfy $d(v,v\ast 1)\leq3$ for every vertex$v$. This strengthens a theorem by Brandon Seward. We also study the effective computability of translation-like actionson groups and graphs. We prove that every finitely generated infinitegroup with decidable word problem admits a translation-like actionby $\mathbb{Z}$ which is computable, and satisfies an extra condition whichwe call decidable orbit membership problem. As a nontrivial application of our results, we prove that for everyfinitely generated infinite group with decidable word problem, effectivesubshifts attain all $\Pi_{1}^{0}$ Medvedev degrees. This extends a classification proved by Joseph Miller for $\mathbb{Z}^{d},$ $d\geq1$.</description>

      <title>Quasimorphisms on the group of density preserving diffeomorphisms of the M\"{o}bius band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of quasimorphisms on groups of homeomorphisms of manifolds has been extensively studied under various regularity conditions, such as smooth, volume-preserving, and symplectic. However, in this context, nothing is known about groups of `area'-preserving diffeomorphisms on non-orientable manifolds.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of groups of density-preserving diffeomorphisms on non-orientable manifolds.
  Here, the density is a natural concept that generalizes volume without concerning orientability. We show that the group of density-preserving diffeomorphisms on the M\"obius band admits countably many unbounded quasimorphisms which are linearly independent. Along the proof, we show that groups of density preserving diffeomorphisms on compact, connected, non-orientable surfaces with non-empty boundary are weakly contractible.</description>

      <title>From disc patterns in the plane to character varieties of knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an experimental study of groups generated by reflections in planar patterns of tangent circles, we describe some methods for constructing and studying representation spaces of holonomy groups of infinite volume hyperbolic $3$-manifolds that arise from unknotting tunnels of links. We include full descriptions of our computational methods, which were guided by simplicity and generality rather than by being particularly efficient in special cases. This makes them easy for non-experts to understand and implement to produce visualisations that can suggest conjectures and support algebraic calculations in the character variety. Throughout, we have tried to make the exposition clear and understandable for graduate students in geometric topology and related fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to show that the fundamental group of any smooth complex algebraic variety cannot be realized as a lattice of any simply connected nilpotent Lie group whose Lie algebra is $p$-filiform Lie algebra such that neither abelian nor $2$-step nilpotent. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition for a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension up to $6$ not to be isomorphic to the fundamental group of any smooth complex algebraic variety.</description>
