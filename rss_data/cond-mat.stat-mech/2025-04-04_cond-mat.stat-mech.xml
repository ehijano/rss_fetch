      <title>Intermittent shot noise generating 1/f fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the rate of shot noise is controlled by on-off states we speak of intermittent shot noise. The on-off states lead to alternately occurring clusters of events and intermissions, respectively. We derive the power spectrum of the intermittent shot noise by applying the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. Besides reduced shot noise, we obtain excess noise, which depends on the parameters of the on-off states. We calculate the excess noise for power-law distributed on-states; within the scaling region, the excess noise is excellently approximated by C/f^b. The behavior of the slope b and of the amplitude C in dependence of the on-off times is investigated. For large scaling regions we find a preference for a pure 1/f shape. Finally, we regard the variance of events occurring within a time interval. In the presence of 1/f fluctuations, the variance of counts attains extreme values which are accompanied by an extreme property of slope b.</description>

      <title>Monitored Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced ``sharpening'' phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known charge-sharpening transition for diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.</description>

      <title>Universal efficiency boost in prethermal quantum heat engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat engines near the adiabatic limit typically assume a working medium at thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body systems often showcase conservation laws that hinder thermalization, leading to prethermalization in exotic stationary phases. This work explores whether prethermalization enhances or reduces engine efficiency. We investigate Otto cycles in quantum systems with varying numbers of conserved quantities. We find that additional conservation laws reduce efficiency at positive temperatures, but enhance it in regimes of negative temperatures. Our findings stem from general thermodynamic inequalities for infinitesimal cycles, and we provide evidence for integrable models undergoing finite cycles using the theoretical framework of Generalized Hydrodynamics. The relevance of our results for quantum simulators is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gibbs states are locally Markovian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Markov property entails the conditional independence structure inherent in Gibbs distributions for general classical Hamiltonians, a feature that plays a crucial role in inference, mixing time analysis, and algorithm design. However, much less is known about quantum Gibbs states. In this work, we show that for any Hamiltonian with a bounded interaction degree, the quantum Gibbs state is locally Markov at arbitrary temperature, meaning there exists a quasi-local recovery map for every local region. Notably, this recovery map is obtained by applying a detailed-balanced Lindbladian with jumps acting on the region. Consequently, we prove that (i) the conditional mutual information (CMI) for a shielded small region decays exponentially with the shielding distance, and (ii) under the assumption of uniform clustering of correlations, Gibbs states of general non-commuting Hamiltonians on $D$-dimensional lattices can be prepared by a quantum circuit of depth $e^{O(\log^D(n/\epsilon))}$, which can be further reduced assuming certain local gap condition. Our proofs introduce a regularization scheme for imaginary-time-evolved operators at arbitrarily low temperatures and reveal a connection between the Dirichlet form, a dynamic quantity, and the commutator in the KMS inner product, a static quantity. We believe these tools pave the way for tackling further challenges in quantum thermodynamics and mixing times, particularly in low-temperature regimes.</description>

      <title>On the Clustering of Conditional Mutual Information via Dissipative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional mutual information (CMI) has recently attracted significant attention as a key quantity for characterizing quantum correlations in many-body systems. While it is conjectured that CMI decays rapidly in finite-temperature Gibbs states, a complete and general proof remains elusive. Previous work addressed this problem in the high-temperature regime using cluster expansion techniques [T. Kuwahara, K. Kato, F.G.S.L. Brand\~ao, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 220601 (2020)]; however, flaws in the proof have been pointed out, and the method does not provide a uniformly convergent expansion at arbitrarily high temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate that the cluster expansion approach indeed fails to converge absolutely, even at any high-temperatures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach to proving the spatial decay of CMI. Our method leverages the connection between CMI and quantum recovery maps, specifically utilizing the Fawzi-Renner theorem. We show that such recovery maps can be realized through dissipative dynamics, and by analyzing the locality properties of these dynamics, we establish the exponential decay of CMI in high-temperature regimes. As a technical contribution, we also present a new result on the perturbative stability of quasi-local Liouvillian dynamics. Our results indicate that, contrary to common intuition, high-temperature Gibbs states can exhibit nontrivial mathematical structure, particularly when multipartite correlations such as CMI are considered.</description>

      <title>Exact characterization of anisotropic properties in confined hard-sphere systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) system of hard spheres confined within a cylindrical pore so narrow that only nearest-neighbor interactions are possible. By mapping the Q1D system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse mixture of nonadditive hard rods, we obtain exact thermodynamic and structural properties, including the radial distribution function, which had remained elusive in previous studies. We derive analytical expressions for limiting cases, such as small pore diameters, virial coefficients, and extreme pressures. Additionally, we identify a transition in the anisotropic pressure components, where the transverse pressure surpasses the longitudinal one at high densities if the pore diameter exceeds a critical threshold. Finally, we analyze spatial correlations in particle arrangements and fluctuations in radial positioning, providing insight into the emergence of ordering in confined systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution over Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist several initiatives worldwide to deploy quantum key distribution (QKD) over existing fibre networks and achieve quantum-safe security at large scales. To understand the overall QKD network performance, it is required to transition from the analysis of individual links, as done so far, to the characterization of the network as a whole. In this work, we undertake this study by embedding QKD protocols on complex networks, which correctly model the existing fiber networks. We focus on networks with trusted nodes and on continuous-variable (CV) schemes, which have much higher key rates than their discrete-variable (DV) counterparts. In the effective CV network, however, many of the unique properties of complex networks, such as small-worldness and the presence of hubs, are lost due to the fast decay of the key rate with physical distance for CV systems. These properties can be restored when considering a hybrid network consisting of both CV and DV protocols, achieving at the same time high average rate and inter-connectivity. Our work opens the path to the study of QKD complex networks in existing infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Finite steady-state current defies non-Hermitian many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian many-body localization (NH MBL) has emerged as a possible scenario for stable localization in open systems, as suggested by spectral indicators identifying a putative transition for finite system sizes.
  In this work, we shift the focus to dynamical probes, specifically the steady-state spin current, to investigate transport properties in a disordered, non-Hermitian XXZ spin chain. Through exact diagonalization for small systems and tensor-network methods for larger chains, we demonstrate that the steady-state current remains finite and decays exponentially with disorder strength, showing no evidence of a transition up to disorder values far beyond the previously claimed critical point. Our results reveal a stark discrepancy between spectral indicators, which suggest localization, and transport behavior, which indicates delocalization. This highlights the importance of dynamical observables in characterizing NH MBL and suggests that traditional spectral measures may not fully capture the physics of non-Hermitian systems.
  Additionally, we observe a non-commutativity of limits in system size and time, further complicating the interpretation of finite-size studies. These findings challenge the existence of NH MBL in the studied model and underscore the need for alternative approaches to understand localization in non-Hermitian settings.</description>

      <title>Optimal first-passage times of active Brownian particles under stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the first-passage-time (FPT) properties of an active Brownian particle under stochastic resetting to its initial configuration, comprising its position and orientation, to reach an absorbing wall in two dimensions. Coupling a perturbative approach for low P\'eclet numbers, measuring the relative importance of self-propulsion with respect to diffusion, with the renewal framework for the stochastic resetting process, we derive analytical expressions for the survival probability, the FPT probability density, and the associated low-order moments. Depending on their initial orientation, the minimal mean FPT for active particles to reach the boundary can both decrease and increase relative to the passive counterpart. The associated optimal resetting rates depend non-trivially on the initial distance to the boundary due to the intricate interplay of resetting, rotational Brownian noise, and active motion.</description>

      <title>Self-bound monolayer crystals of ultracold polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physics of ultracold dipolar molecules using path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and construct the complete phase diagram extending from weak to strong interactions and from small to mesoscopic particle numbers. Our calculations predict the formation of self-bound quantum droplets at interaction strengths lower than previously anticipated. For stronger interactions, the droplet continuously loses superfluidity as correlations develop, and is eventually found to undergo a transition to a crystalline monolayer that remains self-bound without external confinement. The spontaneous formation of such two-dimensional phases from a three-dimensional quantum gas is traced back to the peculiar anisotropic form of the dipole-dipole interaction generated by microwave-dressing of rotational molecular states. For sufficiently large particle numbers, crystallization takes place for comparably low interaction strengths that do not promote two-body bound states and should thus be observable in ongoing experiments without limitations from three-body recombination.</description>

      <title>Learning quantum Gibbs states locally and efficiently</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the Hamiltonian underlying a quantum many-body system in thermal equilibrium is a fundamental task in quantum learning theory and experimental sciences. To learn the Gibbs state of local Hamiltonians at any inverse temperature $\beta$, the state-of-the-art provable algorithms fall short of the optimal sample and computational complexity, in sharp contrast with the locality and simplicity in the classical cases. In this work, we present a learning algorithm that learns each local term of a $n$-qubit $D$-dimensional Hamiltonian to an additive error $\epsilon$ with sample complexity $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{e^{\mathrm{poly}(\beta)}}{\beta^2\epsilon^2}\right)\log(n)$. The protocol uses parallelizable local quantum measurements that act within bounded regions of the lattice and near-linear-time classical post-processing. Thus, our complexity is near optimal with respect to $n,\epsilon$ and is polynomially tight with respect to $\beta$. We also give a learning algorithm for Hamiltonians with bounded interaction degree with sample and time complexities of similar scaling on $n$ but worse on $\beta, \epsilon$. At the heart of our algorithm is the interplay between locality, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition, and the operator Fourier transform at arbitrary temperatures.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic entanglement lightcone from eigenstate correlations in the many-body localised phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the operator entanglement of the time-evolution operator through the framework of eigenstate correlations. Focusing on strongly disordered quantum many-body systems in the many-body localised (MBL) regime, we analyse the operator entanglement across various spatiotemporal cuts, revealing the logarithmic lightcone of entanglement spreading. We demonstrate that this logarithmic lightcone arises directly from a hierarchy of energyscales and lengthscales encoded in eigenstate correlations. By characterising the statistics of these hierarchical scales, we develop a microscopic theory for the spatiotemporal structure of entanglement spreading in MBL systems -- without invoking phenomenological constructs such as $\ell$-bits. This approach reveals the fundamental connection between eigenstate correlations and the emergent entanglement structure in MBL systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general method for calculating R\'enyi entropies in the ground state of a one-dimensional critical system with mixed open boundaries, for an interval starting at one of its ends. In the conformal field theory framework, this computation boils down to the evaluation of the correlation function of one twist field and two boundary condition changing operators in the cyclic orbifold. Exploiting null-vectors of the cyclic orbifold, we derive ordinary differential equations satisfied by these correlation functions. In particular, we obtain an explicit expression for the second R\'enyi entropy valid for any diagonal minimal model, but with a particular set of mixed boundary conditions. In order to compare our results with numerical data for the Ising and three-state Potts critical chains, we also identify and compute the leading finite size corrections.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity shapes inference in biological reactions driven by a latent trajectory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many natural phenomena are quantified by counts of observable events, from the annihilation of quasiparticles in a lattice to predator-prey encounters on a landscape to spikes in a neural network. These events are triggered at random intervals, when an underlying, often unobserved and therefore latent, dynamical system occupies a set of reactive states within its phase space. We show how the ergodicity of this latent dynamical system, i.e. existence of a well-behaved limiting stationary distribution, constrains the statistics of the reaction counts. This formulation makes explicit the conditions under which the counting process approaches a limiting Poisson process, a subject of debate in the application of counting processes to different fields. We show that the overdispersal relative to this limit encodes properties of the latent trajectory through its hitting times. These results set bounds on how information about a latent process can be inferred from a local detector, which we explore for two biophysical scenarios. First, in estimating an animal's activity level by how often it crosses a detector, we show how the mean count can fail to give any information on movement parameters, which are encoded in higher order moments. Second, we show how the variance of the inter-reaction time sets a fundamental limit on how precisely the size of a population of trajectories can be inferred by a detector, vastly generalizing the Berg-Purcell limit for chemosensation. Overall, we develop a flexible theoretical framework to quantify inter-event time distributions in reaction-diffusion systems that clarifies existing debates in the literature and explicitly shows which properties of latent processes can be inferred from observed reactions.</description>

      <title>Entropy alternatives for equilibrium and out of equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel entropy-related function, \textit{non-repeatability}, designed to capture dynamical behaviors in complex systems. Its normalized form, \textit{mutability}, has been previously applied in statistical physics as a dynamical entropy measure. To present the scope and advantages of these quantities, we analyze two distinct systems: (a) Monte Carlo simulations of magnetic moments on a square lattice and (b) seismic time series from the United States Geological Survey catalog. Both systems are well-established in the literature, serving as robust benchmarks. Shannon entropy is employed as a reference point to assess the similarities and differences with the proposed measures. A key distinction lies in the sensitivity of non-repeatability and mutability to the temporal ordering of data, which contrasts with traditional entropy definitions. Moreover, \textit{sorted mutability} -- the mutability computed from a reordered data version -- reveals additional insights into the critical behavior of the systems under study.</description>

      <title>Diffusive hydrodynamics of hard rods from microscopics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive exact equations governing the large-scale dynamics of hard rods, including diffusive effects that go beyond ballistic transport. Diffusive corrections are the first-order terms in the hydrodynamic gradient expansion and we obtain them through an explicit microscopic calculation of the dynamics of hard rods. We show that they differ significantly from the prediction of Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics, as the correct hydrodynamics description is instead given by two coupled equations, giving respectively the evolution of the one point functions and of the connected two-point correlations. The resulting equations are time-reversible and reduce to the usual Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations in the limit of near-equilibrium evolution. This represents the first exact microscopic calculation showing how ballistic dynamics generates long-range correlations, in agreement with general results from the recently developed ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, and showing how such long range-correlations directly affect the diffusive hydrodynamic terms, in agreement with, and clarifying, recent related results.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds on the Universal Lindblad Equation in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors due to several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation keep small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of the accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body thermal machines enabled by atom-atom correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05266v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-particle correlations, characterized by Glauber's second-order correlation function,play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Controlling measurement-induced phase transitions with tunable detector coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07918v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

      <title>Phases and phase transition in Grover's algorithm with systematic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While limitations on quantum computation by Markovian environmental noise are well-understood in generality, their behavior for different quantum circuits and noise realizations can be less universal. Here we consider a canonical quantum algorithm - Grover's algorithm for unordered search on $L$ qubits - in the presence of systematic noise. This allows us to write the behavior as a random Floquet unitary, which we show is well-characterized by random matrix theory (RMT). The RMT analysis enables analytical predictions for phases and phase transitions of the many-body dynamics. We find two separate transitions. At moderate disorder $\delta_{c,\mathrm{gap}}\sim L^{-1}$, there is a ergodicity breaking transition such that a finite-dimensional manifold remains non-ergodic for $\delta &lt; \delta_{c,\mathrm{gap}}$. Computational power is lost at a much smaller disorder, $\delta_{c,\mathrm{comp}} \sim L^{-1/2}2^{-L/2}$. We comment on relevance to non-systematic noise in realistic quantum computers, including cold atom, trapped ion, and superconducting platforms.</description>

      <title>Tensor tree learns hidden relational structures in data to construct generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the tensor tree network with the Born machine framework, we propose a general method for constructing a generative model by expressing the target distribution function as the amplitude of the quantum wave function represented by a tensor tree. The key idea is dynamically optimizing the tree structure that minimizes the bond mutual information. The proposed method offers enhanced performance and uncovers hidden relational structures in the target data. We illustrate potential practical applications with four examples: (i) random patterns, (ii) QMNIST handwritten digits, (iii) Bayesian networks, and (iv) the pattern of stock price fluctuation pattern in S&amp;P500. In (i) and (ii), the strongly correlated variables were concentrated near the center of the network; in (iii), the causality pattern was identified; and in (iv), a structure corresponding to the eleven sectors emerged.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Observation of Quantum Darwinism and the Origin of Classicality with Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? For instance, what makes two people, each absorbing an independent fraction of photons scattered from this screen or paper, agree on the observation of the text written here? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this emergence of classicality by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality we perceive. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of the foundational framework of quantum Darwinism and the accompanying underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a separate quantifier for classicality, originating a computationally and experimentally inexpensive method to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.</description>
