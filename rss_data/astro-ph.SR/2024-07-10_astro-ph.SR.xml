      <title>Once a Triple, Not Always a Triple: The Evolution of Hierarchical Triples that Yield Merged Inner Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than half of all main-sequence (MS) stars have one or more companions, and many of those with initial masses &lt;8 M$_\odot$ are born in hierarchical triples. These systems feature two stars in a close orbit (the inner binary) while a tertiary star orbits them on a wider orbit (the outer binary). In hierarchical triples, three-body dynamics combined with stellar evolution drives interactions and, in many cases, merges the inner binary entirely to create a renovated `Post-Merger Binary' (PMB). By leveraging dynamical simulations and tracking binary interactions, we explore the outcomes of merged triples and investigate whether PMBs preserve signatures of their three-body history. Our findings indicate that in 26-54% of wide double WD binaries (s&gt;100 au), the more massive white dwarf (WD) is a merger product, implying that these DWD binaries were previously triples. Overall, we estimate that $44\pm14\%$ of observed wide DWDs originated in triple star systems and thereby have rich dynamical histories. Additionally, our results suggest that the separations of inner and outer binaries are uncorrelated at birth, providing insights into stellar formation processes. We also examine MS+MS and MS+Red Giant mergers manifesting as Blue Straggler stars (BSSs). These PMBs have orbital configurations and ages similar to most observed BSS binaries. While the triple+merger formation channel can explain the observed chemical abundances, moderate eccentricities, and companion masses in BSS binaries, it likely only accounts for $\sim$20-25% of BSSs. Meanwhile, we predict that the majority of observed single BSSs formed as collisions in triples and harbor long-period (&gt;10 yr) companions. Furthermore, both BSS binaries and DWDs exhibit signatures of WD birth kicks.</description>

      <title>MUSE spectroscopy of the high abundance discrepancy planetary nebula NGC 6153</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) The Abundance Discrepancy problem in planetary nebulae (PNe) has long puzzled astronomers. NGC6153, with its high Abundance Discrepancy Factor (ADF~10), provides an opportunity to understand the chemical structure and ionisation processes by constructing detailed emission line maps and examining variations in electron temperature and density. We used the MUSE spectrograph to acquire IFU data covering the wavelength range 4600-9300 \AA\ with a spatial sampling of 0.2 arcsec and spectral resolutions ranging from R = 1600-3500. We created emission line maps for 60 lines and two continuum regions. We developed a tailored methodology for the analysis of the data, including correction for recombination contributions to auroral lines and the contributions of different plasma phases. Our analysis confirmed the presence of a low-temperature plasma component in NGC6153. We find that electron temperatures derived from recombination line/continuum diagnostics are significantly lower than those derived from collisionally excited lines diagnostics. Ionic chemical abundance maps were constructed, considering the weight of the cold plasma phase in the HI emission. Adopting this approach, we found ionic abundances that could be up to 0.2 dex lower for those derived from CELs and up to 1.1 dex higher for those derived from RLs than in the case of an homogeneous HI emission. The Abundance Contrast Factor (ACF) between both plasma components was defined, with values, on average, 0.9 dex higher than the ADF. Different methods for calculating ionisation correction factors (ICFs) yielded consistent results. Our findings emphasize that accurate chemical abundance determinations in high-ADF PNe must account for multiple plasma phases.</description>

      <title>The Anomalous Acceleration of PSR J2043+1711: Long-Period Orbital Companion or Stellar Flyby?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the rate of change of its orbital period, PSR J2043+1711 has a substantial peculiar acceleration of 3.5 $\pm$ 0.8 mm/s/yr, which deviates from the acceleration predicted by equilibrium Milky Way models at a $4\sigma$ level. The magnitude of the peculiar acceleration is too large to be explained by disequilibrium effects of the Milky Way interacting with orbiting dwarf galaxies ($\sim$1 mm/s/yr), and too small to be caused by period variations due to the pulsar being a redback. We identify and examine two plausible causes for the anomalous acceleration: a stellar flyby, and a long-period orbital companion. We identify a main-sequence star in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and Pan-STARRS DR2 with the correct mass, distance, and on-sky position to potentially explain the observed peculiar acceleration. However, the star and the pulsar system have substantially different proper motions, indicating that they are not gravitationally bound. However, it is possible that this is an unrelated star that just happens to be located near J2043+1711 along our line of sight (chance probability of 1.6\%). Therefore, we also constrain possible orbital parameters for a circumbinary companion in a hierarchical triple system with J2043+1711; the changes in the spindown rate of the pulsar are consistent with an outer object that has an orbital period of 80 kyr, a companion mass of 0.3 $M_\odot$ (indicative of a white dwarf or low-mass star), and a semi-major axis of 2000 AU. Continued timing and/or future faint optical observations of J2043+1711 may eventually allow us to differentiate between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the Northward Shift of the Heliospheric Current Sheet at the End of Solar Cycle 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since solar cycle 16, the { heliospheric} current sheet (HCS) has been found to be shifted southward during the late declining to minimum phase. However, this trend is broken at the end of solar cycle 24. In this paper, we analyze the shift of the HCS by using information obtained from coronal model and insitu data provide by the near-Earth OMNI database and the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). Coronal potential field source surface (PFSS) modeling results show that the northward shift is established at the beginning of 2018 and remains stable for about two years. Interplanetary magnetic field data obtained from and within 1 au also support the northward shift, as the southern polarity T appears more frequently than the northern polarity A between 2018-2020. Both model results and insitu observation obtained by PSP imply that the HCS shift is established in the corona, and then propagates into the heliosphere. The quadrupole term still has a significant influence on the formation of the HCS shift.</description>

      <title>Grids of stellar models with rotation VIII: Models from 1.7 to 500 $M_\odot$ at metallicity $Z = 10^{-5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grids of stellar evolution models with rotation using the Geneva stellar evolution code (Genec) have been published for a wide range of metallicities. We introduce the last remaining grid of Genec models, with a metallicity of $Z=10^{-5}$. We study the impact of this extremely metal-poor initial composition on various aspects of stellar evolution, and compare it to the results from previous grids at other metallicities. We provide electronic tables that can be used to interpolate between stellar evolution tracks and for population synthesis. Using the same physics as in the previous papers of this series, we computed a grid of stellar evolution models with Genec spanning masses between 1.7 and 500 $M_\odot$, with and without rotation, at a metallicity of $Z=10^{-5}$. Due to the extremely low metallicity of the models, mass-loss processes are negligible for all except the most massive stars. For most properties (such as evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, lifetimes, and final fates), the present models fit neatly between those previously computed at surrounding metallicities. However, specific to this metallicity is the very large production of primary nitrogen in moderately rotating stars, which is linked to the interplay between the hydrogen- and helium-burning regions. The stars in the present grid are interesting candidates as sources of nitrogen-enrichment in the early Universe. Indeed, they may have formed very early on from material previously enriched by the massive short-lived Population III stars, and as such constitute a very important piece in the puzzle that is the history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Empirical mass-loss rates and clumping properties of O-type stars in the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain wind parameters of a sample of 18 O-type stars in the LMC, through analysis with stellar atmosphere and wind models including the effects of optically thick clumping. This allows us to determine the most accurate spectroscopic mass-loss and wind structure properties of massive stars at sub-solar metallicity to date and gain insight into the impact of metallicity on massive stellar winds. Combining high signal to noise (S/N) ratio spectroscopy in the UV and optical gives us access to diagnostics of multiple different physical processes in the stellar wind. We produce synthetic spectra using the stellar atmosphere modelling code FASTWIND, and reproduce the observed spectra using a genetic algorithm based fitting technique. We empirically constrain 15 physical parameters associated with the stellar and wind properties, including temperature, surface gravity, surface abundances, rotation, macroturbulence and wind parameters. We find, on average, mass-loss rates a factor of 4-5 lower than those predicted by Vink et al. 2001, in good agreement with predictions from Bjorklund et al. 2021, and the best agreement with those from Krticka et al. 2018. In the 'weak-wind' regime we find mass-loss rates orders of magnitude below any theoretical predictions. We find a positive correlation of clumping factors (fcl) with effective temperature with an average fcl = 14 +- 8 for the full sample. Above 38 kK an average 46 +- 24% of the wind velocity span is covered by clumps and the interclump density is 10-30% of the mean wind. Below an effective temperature of roughly 38 kK there must be additional light leakage for supergiants. For dwarf stars at low temperatures there is a statistical preference for very low clump velocity spans, however it is unclear if this can be physically motivated as there are no clearly observable wind signatures in UV diagnostics.</description>

      <title>New Rotation Period Measurements for Kepler Stars Using Deep Learning: The 100K Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new framework to predict stellar properties from light curves. We analyze the light-curve data from the Kepler space mission and develop a novel tool for deriving the stellar rotation periods for main-sequence stars. Using this tool, we provide the largest (108785 stars) and most accurate (an average error of $1.6$ Days) sample of stellar rotations to date. Our model, LightPred, is a novel deep-learning model designed to extract stellar rotation periods from light curves. The model utilizes a dual-branch architecture combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer components to capture both temporal and global features within the data. We train LightPred on a dataset of simulated light curves generated using a realistic spot model and enhance its performance through self-supervised contrastive pre-training on Kepler light curves. Our evaluation demonstrates that LightPred outperforms classical methods like the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) in terms of accuracy and robustness. We apply LightPred to the Kepler dataset, generating the largest catalog to date of stellar rotation periods for main-sequence stars. Our analysis reveals a systematic shift towards shorter periods compared to previous studies, suggesting a potential revision of stellar age estimates. We also investigate the impact of stellar activity on period determination and find evidence for a distinct period-activity relation. Additionally, we confirm tidal synchronization in eclipsing binaries with orbital periods shorter than 10 days. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning in extracting fundamental stellar properties from light curves, opening new avenues for understanding stellar evolution and population demographics.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a barium blue straggler star in M67 and sighting of its WD companion*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a barium blue straggler star (BSS) in M67, exhibiting enhancements in slow neutron-capture ($s$-) process elements. Spectroscopic analysis of two BSSs (WOCS\,9005 \&amp; WOCS\,1020) and 4 stars located near the main-sequence turn-off using GALAH spectra, showed that WOCS\,9005 has a significantly high abundance of the s-process elements ([Ba/Fe] = 0.75$\pm$0.08, [Y/Fe] = 1.09$\pm$0.07, [La/Fe] = 0.65$\pm$0.06). The BSS (WOCS\,9005) is a spectroscopic binary with a known period, eccentricity and a suspected white dwarf (WD) companion with a kinematic mass of 0.5 M$_\odot$. The first `sighting' of the WD in this barium BSS is achieved through multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) with the crucial far-UV data from the UVIT/\textit{AstroSat}. The parameters of the hot and cool companions are derived using binary fits of the SED using two combinations of models, yielding a WD with T$_{eff}$ in the range 9750--15250 K. Considering the kinematic mass limit, the cooling age of the WD is estimated as $\sim$ 60 Myr. The observed enhancements are attributed to a mass transfer (MT) from a companion asymptotic giant branch star, now a WD. We estimate the accreted mass to be 0.15 M$_{\odot}$, through wind accretion, which increased the envelope mass from 0.45 M$_{\odot}$. The detection of chemical enhancement, as well as the sighting of WD in this system have been possible due to the recent MT in this binary, as suggested by the young WD.</description>

      <title>Transferring spectroscopic stellar labels to 217 million Gaia DR3 XP stars with SHBoost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of using machine-learning regression as a method of extracting basic stellar parameters and line-of-sight extinctions, given spectro-photometric data. To this end, we build a stable gradient-boosted random-forest regressor (xgboost), trained on spectroscopic data, capable of producing output parameters with reliable uncertainties from Gaia DR3 data (most notably the low-resolution XP spectra) without ground-based spectroscopic observations. Using Shapley additive explanations, we are able to interpret how the predictions for each star are influenced by each data feature. For the training and testing of the network, we use high-quality parameters obtained from the StarHorse code for a sample of around eight million stars observed by major spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, GALAH, LAMOST, RAVE, SEGUE, and GES), complemented by curated samples of hot stars, very metal-poor stars, white dwarfs, and hot sub-dwarfs. The training data cover the whole sky, all Galactic components, and almost the full magnitude range of the Gaia DR3 XP sample of more than 217 million objects that also have parallaxes. We achieve median uncertainties (at $G\approx16$) of 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, 0.01 dex in logarithmic effective temperature, 0.20 dex in surface gravity, 0.18 dex in metallicity, and $12\%$ in mass (over the full Gaia DR3 XP sample, with considerable variations in precision as a function of magnitude and stellar type). We succeed in predicting competitive results based on Gaia DR3 XP spectra compared to classical isochrone fitting methods we employed in earlier work, especially for the parameters $A_V$, $T_{\rm eff}$, and metallicity. Finally, we showcase some applications of this new catalogue (e.g. extinction maps, metallicity trends in the Milky Way, extended maps of young massive stars, metal-poor stars, and metal-rich stars).

      <title>Stochastic excitation of waves in magnetic stars -- I. Scaling laws for the modes amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar oscillations are key to unravelling stars' properties, such as their mass, radius and age. Amplitudes of acoustic modes in solar-like stars are intrinsically linked to their convective turbulent excitation source, which in turn is influenced by magnetism. In the observations of the Sun and stars, the amplitude of the modes is modulated following their magnetic activity cycles: the higher the magnetic field, the lower the modes' amplitudes. When the magnetic field is strong, it can even inhibit the acoustic modes, which are not detected in a majority of solar-like stars presenting a strong magnetic activity. Magnetic fields are known to freeze convection when stronger than a critical value: an "on-off" approach is used in the literature. In this work, we investigate the impact of magnetic fields on the stochastic excitation of acoustic modes. First, we generalise the forced wave equation formalism, including the effects of magnetic fields. Second, we assess how convection is affected by magnetic fields using results from Magnetic Mixing-Length Theory. We provide the source terms of stochastic excitation, including a new magnetic source term and the Reynolds stresses. We provide scaling laws for the amplitudes of the modes, taking into account both the driving and the damping. Those scalings are based on the inverse Alfv\'en dimensionless parameter: the damping increases with the magnetic field and reaches a saturation threshold when the magnetic field is strong. The driving of the modes diminishes when the magnetic field becomes stronger, the turbulent convection being weaker. As expected from the observations, we find that a higher magnetic field diminishes the resulting modes amplitudes. Evaluating the inverse Alfv\'en number in stellar models provides a means to estimate the expected amplitudes of acoustic modes in magnetic active solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Accreting Population III Stars at 10$^{-6}$-10$^3$ M$_\odot$/yr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first stars formed over five orders of magnitude in mass by accretion in primordial dark matter halos. We study the evolution of massive, very massive and supermassive primordial (Pop III) stars over nine orders of magnitude in accretion rate. We use the stellar evolution code GENEC to evolve accreting Pop III stars from 10$^{-6}$ - 10$^3$ M$_\odot$/yr and study how these rates determine final masses. The stars are evolved until either the end of central Si burning or until they encounter the general relativistic instability (GRI). We also examine how metallicity affects the evolution of the stars. At rates below $2.5 x 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr the final mass of the star falls below that required for pair-instability supernovae. The minimum rate required to produce black holes with masses above 250 M$_\odot$ is $5 x 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr, well within the range of infall rates found in numerical simulations of halos that cool via H$_2$, $10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$/yr. At rates of $5 x 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr to $4 x 10^{-2}$ \Ms\ yr$^{-1}$, like those expected for halos cooling by both H$_2$ and Ly-alpha, the star collapses after Si burning. At higher accretion rates the GRI triggers the collapse of the star during central H burning. Stars that grow at above these rates are cool red hypergiants with effective temperatures $log(T_{\text{eff}}) = 3.8$ and luminosities that can reach 10$^{10.5}$ L$_\odot$. At accretion rates of 100 - 1000 M$_\odot$/yr the gas encounters the general relativistic instability prior to the onset of central hydrogen burning and collapses to a black hole with a mass of 10$^6$ M$_\odot$ without ever having become a star. We reveal for the first time the critical transition rate in accretion above which catastrophic baryon collapse, like that which can occur during galaxy collisions in the high-redshift Universe, produces supermassive black holes via dark collapse.</description>

      <title>Ba Enrichment in Gaia MS+WD Binaries: Tracing $s$-Process Element Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large population of intermediate-separation binaries, consisting of a main-sequence (MS) star and a white dwarf (WD), has recently emerged from Gaia's third data release (DR3), posing challenges to current models of binary evolution. Here we examine the $s$-process element abundances in these systems using data from GALAH DR3. Following refined sample analysis with parameter estimates based on GALAH spectra, we find a distinct locus where enhanced $s$-process elements depend on both the WD mass and metallicity, consistent with loci identified in previous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis studies with higher $s$-process yields. Notably, these enhanced abundances show no correlation with the systems' orbital parameters, supporting a history of accretion in intermediate-separation MS+WD systems. Consequently, our results form a direct observational evidence of a connection between AGB masses and $s$-process yields. We conclude by showing that the GALAH DR3 survey includes numerous Ba dwarf stars, within and beyond the mass range covered in our current sample, which can further elucidate $s$-process element distributions in MS+WD binaries.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis Of Fractional Relativistic Polytropes</title>

Abstract: In astrophysics, the gravitational stability of a self-gravitating polytropic fluid sphere is an intriguing subject, especially when trying to comprehend the genesis and development of celestial bodies like planets and stars. This stability is the sphere's capacity to stay in balance in the face of disruptions. We utilize fractional calculus to explore self-gravitating, hydrostatic spheres governed by a polytropic equation of state \P=K\rho^{1+1/n}. We focus on structures with polytropic indices ranging from 1 to 3 and consider relativistic and fractional parameters, denoted by \sigma and \alpha, respectively. The stability of these relativistic polytropes is evaluated using the critical point method, which is associated with the energetic principles developed in 1964 by Tooper. This approach enables us to pinpoint the critical mass and radius at which where polytropic spheres shift from stable to unstable states. The results highlight the critical relativistic parameter where the polytrope's mass peaks, signaling the onset of radial instability. For polytropic indices of 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 with a fractional parameter \alpha, we observe stable relativistic polytropes for \sigma values below the critical thresholds of \sigma= 0.42, 0.20, 0.10, and 0.0, respectively. Conversely, instability emerges as \sigma surpasses these critical values. Our comprehensive calculations reveal that the critical relativistic value (\sigma_{CR}) for the onset of instability tends to increase as the fractional parameter {\alpha} decreases.</description>

      <title>Non-Standard Interactions of Supernova Neutrinos and Mass Ordering Ambiguity at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) can notably modify the pattern of resonant flavor conversion of neutrinos within supernovae and significantly impact the neutronization burst signal in forthcoming experiments such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The presence of NSI can invert the energy levels of neutrino matter eigenstates and even induce a new resonance in the inner parts close to the proto-neutron star. We demonstrate how DUNE can use these new configurations of energy levels to have sensitivity to NSIs down to $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$. We also elucidate how the effect may result in a puzzling confusion of normal and inverted mass orderings by highlighting the emergence or vanishing of the neutronization peak, which distinguishes between the two mass orderings. Potential implications are analyzed thoroughly.</description>

      <title>SHARP -- A near-IR multi-mode spectrograph conceived for MORFEO@ELT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), thanks to their large apertures and cutting-edge Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems, promise to deliver sharper and deeper data even than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 $\mu$m) spectrograph conceived to fully exploit the collecting area and the angular resolution of the upcoming generation of ELTs. In particular, SHARP is designed for the 2nd port of MORFEO@ELT. Composed of a Multi-Object Spectrograph, NEXUS, and a multi-Integral Field Unit, VESPER, MORFEO-SHARP will deliver high angular ($\sim$30 mas) and spectral (R$\simeq$300, 2000, 6000, 17000) resolution, outperforming NIRSpec@JWST (100 mas). SHARP will enable studies of the nearby Universe and the early Universe in unprecedented detail. NEXUS is fed by a configurable slit system deploying up to 30 slits with $\sim$2.4 arcsec length and adjustable width, over a field of about 1.2"$\times$1.2" (35 mas/pix). Each slit is fed by an inversion prism able to rotate by an arbitrary angle the field that can be seen by the slit. VESPER is composed of 12 probes of 1.7"$\times$1.5" each (spaxel 31 mas) probing a field 24"$\times$70". SHARP is conceived to exploit the ELTs apertures reaching the faintest flux and the sharpest angular resolution by joining the sensitivity of NEXUS and the high spatial sampling of VESPER to MORFEO capabilities. This article provides an overview of the scientific design drivers, their solutions, and the resulting optical design of the instrument achieving the required optical performance.</description>

      <title>ALMA high-resolution observations unveil planet formation shaping molecular emission in the PDS 70 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With two directly detected protoplanets, the PDS 70 system is a unique source in which to study the complex interplay between forming planets and their natal environment. The large dust cavity carved by the two giant planets can affect the disk chemistry, and therefore the molecular emission morphology. On the other hand, chemical properties of the gas component of the disk are expected to leave an imprint on the planetary atmospheres. In this work, we reconstruct the emission morphology of a rich inventory of molecular tracers in the PDS 70 disk, and we look for possible chemical signatures of the two actively accreting protoplanets, PDS b and c. We leverage Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 6 high-angular-resolution and deep-sensitivity line emission observations, together with image and $uv$-plane techniques, to boost the detection of faint lines. We robustly detect ring-shaped emission from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, H$^{13}$CN, HC$^{15}$N, DCN, H$_2$CO, CS, C$_2$H, and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ lines in unprecedented detail. Most of the molecular tracers show a peak of the emission inside the millimeter dust peak. We interpret this as the direct impact of the effective irradiation of the cavity wall, as a result of the planet formation process. Moreover, we have found evidence of an O-poor gas reservoir in the outer disk, which is supported by the observations of bright C-rich molecules, the non-detection of SO, and a lower limit on the $\mathrm{CS/SO}$ ratio of $\sim1$. Eventually, we provide the first detection of the c-C$_3$H$_2$ transitions at 218.73 GHz, and the marginal detection of an azimuthal asymmetry in the higher-energy H$_2$CO (3$_{2,1}$-2$_{2,0}$) line, which could be due to accretion heating near PDS 70b.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of scale-dependent kurtosis with HelioSwarm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma turbulence involves complex, nonlinear interactions of electromagnetic fields and charged particles across multiple scales. Studying these phenomena in space plasmas, like the solar wind, is facilitated by the intrinsic scale separations and the availability of in situ spacecraft observations. However, the single-point or single-scale configurations of current spacecraft limit our understanding of many properties of the turbulent solar wind. To overcome these limitations, multipoint measurements spanning a range of characteristic scales are essential. This paper prepares for the enhanced measurement capabilities of upcoming multispacecraft missions by demonstrating that higher-order statistics, specifically kurtosis, as a baseline for intermittency can be accurately measured. Using synthetic turbulent fields with adjustable intermittency levels, we achieve scale separations analogous to those in the solar wind and apply these techniques to the planned trajectories of the HelioSwarm mission. This approach promises significant advancements in our understanding of plasma turbulence.</description>

      <title>A NICER View of the Nearest and Brightest Millisecond Pulsar: PSR J0437$\unicode{x2013}$4715</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report Bayesian inference of the mass, radius and hot X-ray emitting region properties - using data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) - for the brightest rotation-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar PSR J0437$\unicode{x2013}$4715. Our modeling is conditional on informative tight priors on mass, distance and binary inclination obtained from radio pulsar timing using the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) (Reardon et al. 2024), and we use NICER background models to constrain the non-source background, cross-checking with data from XMM-Newton. We assume two distinct hot emitting regions, and various parameterized hot region geometries that are defined in terms of overlapping circles; while simplified, these capture many of the possibilities suggested by detailed modeling of return current heating. For the preferred model identified by our analysis we infer a mass of $M = 1.418 \pm 0.037$ M$_\odot$ (largely informed by the PPTA mass prior) and an equatorial radius of $R = 11.36^{+0.95}_{-0.63}$ km, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the 16% and 84% quantiles. This radius favors softer dense matter equations of state and is highly consistent with constraints derived from gravitational wave measurements of neutron star binary mergers. The hot regions are inferred to be non-antipodal, and hence inconsistent with a pure centered dipole magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Constraining the dense matter equation of state with new NICER mass-radius measurements and new chiral effective field theory inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulse profile modeling of X-ray data from NICER is now enabling precision inference of neutron star mass and radius. Combined with nuclear physics constraints from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), and masses and tidal deformabilities inferred from gravitational wave detections of binary neutron star mergers, this has lead to a steady improvement in our understanding of the dense matter equation of state (EOS). Here we consider the impact of several new results: the radius measurement for the 1.42$\,M_\odot$ pulsar PSR J0437$-$4715 presented by Choudhury et al. (2024), updates to the masses and radii of PSR J0740$+$6620 and PSR J0030$+$0451, and new $\chi$EFT results for neutron star matter up to 1.5 times nuclear saturation density. Using two different high-density EOS extensions -- a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model and a model based on the speed of sound in a neutron star (CS) -- we find the radius of a 1.4$\,M_\odot$ (2.0$\,M_\odot$) neutron star to be constrained to the 95\% credible ranges $12.28^{+0.50}_{-0.76}\,$km ($12.33^{+0.70}_{-1.34}\,$km) for the PP model and $12.01^{+0.56}_{-0.75}\,$km ($11.55^{+0.94}_{-1.09}\,$km) for the CS model. The maximum neutron star mass is predicted to be $2.15^{+0.14}_{-0.16}\,$$M_\odot$ and $2.08^{+0.28}_{-0.16}\,$$M_\odot$ for the PP and CS model, respectively. We explore the sensitivity of our results to different orders and different densities up to which $\chi$EFT is used, and show how the astrophysical observations provide constraints for the pressure at intermediate densities. Moreover, we investigate the difference $R_{2.0} - R_{1.4}$ of the radius of 2$\,M_\odot$ and 1.4$\,M_\odot$ neutron stars within our EOS inference.</description>

      <title>Molecular Formation in Low-Metallicity Hot Cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical complexity in low-metallicity hot cores has been confirmed by observations. We investigate the effect of varying physical parameters, such as temperature, density and the cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR), on the molecular abundance evolution in low-metallicity hot cores using the UMIST gas phase chemical model. CRIR had the strongest effect on molecular abundance. The resultant molecular abundances were divided into three categories with different trends in time evolution. We compared our results with the observations of hot cores in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our model fits best with the observations at a time of around $10^5$ years after the evaporation of ice and at the CRIR of $1.36 \times 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$. The resultant abundances of the oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (COMs), such as CH$_3$OH, HCOOCH$_3$ and CH$_3$OCH$_3$, do not fit with observations in the same physical condition and may be located in a different physical environment. Our results suggest that investigating the CRIR value is crucial to predict the molecular evolution in LMC hot cores.</description>

      <title>Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA). IV. Fragmentation in High-mass Star-Forming Clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fragmentation contributes to the formation and evolution of stars. Observationally, high-mass stars are known to form multiple-star systems, preferentially in cluster environments. Theoretically, Jeans instability has been suggested to determine characteristic fragmentation scales, and thermal or turbulent motion in the parental gas clump mainly contributes to the instability. To search for such a characteristic fragmentation scale, we have analyzed ALMA 1.33 mm continuum observations toward 30 high-mass star-forming clumps taken by the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. We have identified 573 cores using the dendrogram algorithm and measured the separation of cores by using the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) technique. The core separation corrected by projection effects has a distribution peaked around 5800 au. In order to remove biases produced by different distances and sensitivities, we further smooth the images to a common physical scale and perform completeness tests. Our careful analysis finds a characteristic fragmentation scale of $\sim$7000 au, comparable to the thermal Jeans length of the clumps. We conclude that thermal Jeans fragmentation plays a dominant role in determining the clump fragmentation in high-mass star-forming regions, without the need of invoking turbulent Jeans fragmentation.</description>

      <title>All known Type Ia supernovae models fail to reproduce the observed bolometric luminosity-width correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are widely believed to arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs (WDs). However, ongoing debate surrounds their progenitor systems and the mechanisms triggering these explosions. Recently, Sharon \&amp; Kushnir showed that existing models do not reproduce the observed positive correlation between the $\gamma$-ray escape time, $t_0$, and the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass, $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$. Their analysis, while avoiding complex radiation transfer (RT) calculations, did not account for the viewing-angle dependence of the derived $t_0$ and $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$ in multi-dimensional (multi-D) models during pre-nebular phases, where most observations performed. Here, we aim to identify an observational width-luminosity relation, similar to the $t_0$-$M_\mathrm{Ni56}$ relation to constrain multi-D models during pre-nebular phases while minimizing RT calculation uncertainties. We show that the bolometric luminosity at $t\le30$ days since explosion can be accurately computed without non-thermal ionization considerations, which are computationally expensive and uncertain. We find that the ratio of the bolometric luminosity at 30 days since explosion to the peak luminosity, $L_{30}/Lp$, correlates strongly with $t_0$. Using a sample of well-observed SNe Ia, we show that this parameter tightly correlates with the peak luminosity, $L_p$. We compare the observed $L_{30}/Lp$-$L_p$ distribution with models from the literature, including non-spherical models consisting of head-on WD collisions and off-centered ignitions of sub-Chandrasekhar mass WDs. We find that all known SNe Ia models fail to reproduce the observed bolometric luminosity-width correlation.</description>

      <title>Behaviors of Ca II K line in A-type stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.15152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A synthetic spectrum-fitting analysis was applied to the Ca II line at 3933.68 A for 122 A-type stars (7000 &lt;Te &lt; 10000 K) in a wide range of rotational velocity (10 &lt; vsini &lt; 300 km/s), in order to study the behaviors of Ca abundances ([Ca/H]39) determined from this Ca II 3934 line, especially in context of (i) how they are related with the Am phenomenon (often seen in slow rotators) and (ii) whether they are consistent with the Ca abundances ([Ca/H]61) derived from the weaker Ca I 6162 line. It was confirmed that Ca line strengths in Am stars tend to be weaker and associated abundances are lower compared to non-Am stars at the same Te, indicating a deficiency of Ca in the photosphere of Am stars. However, an appreciable fraction of cool Am stars (Te &lt; 8000 K) were found to show anomalous Ca II 3934 line feature (i.e., unusually broad for its weakness) which is hard to explain. Regarding the comparison between [Ca/H]39 and [Ca/H]61, while both are roughly consistent for hotter stars (Te &gt; 8000 K), the former tends to be lower (by up to -1 dex or even more) than the latter for cooler A stars (Te &lt; 8000 K) including those "weak broad K line" objects, This fact suggests that some special mechanism reducing the strength of Ca II 3934 line is involved at Te &lt; 8000 K where [Ca/H]39 would be no more reliable. Whereas atomic diffusion causing the deficit of Ca in the photosphere as a result of element segregation in the deeper radiative envelope may be regarded as a promising explanation because it seems to fit in the qualitative trend of [Ca/H]61 in A-type stars, the well-known feature of considerably weak Ca II K line in classical Am stars should not necessarily be attributed to only this element diffusion scenario, for which some unknown weakening mechanism specific to this resonance line may independently be operative.</description>

      <title>Photospheric silicon abundances of upper main-sequence stars derived from Si II 6347/6371 doublet lines</title>

Abstract: Silicon abundances were determined by applying the spectrum-fitting technic to the Si II doublet lines at 6347 and 6371A for a sample of 120 main-sequence stars in the T_eff range of ~7000-14000K (comprising not only normal stars but also non-magnetic chemically peculiar stars) with an aim of investigating their behaviors (e.g., correlation with stellar parameters and abundances of other elements such as Fe or C) and the background physical mechanisms involved therein, where attention was paid to taking into account of the non-LTE effect and to assigning a reasonable value of microturbulence. The following trends were revealed from the analysis: (i) The resulting [Si/H] values, mostly ranging from ~-0.5 to ~+0.3, show a positive correlation with [Fe/H]. (ii) A kind of anti-correlation exists between Si and C as seen from the tendency of [C/Si] steeply decreasing with [Si/H]. (iii) Si abundances do not show any clear dependence upon T_eff or vsini, while Am and HgMn stars appear to show comparatively higher [Si/H] than normal stars. Although it is not straightforward to explain these observational facts, different physical processes (gas-dust separation and atomic diffusion) are likely to be intricately involved in producing these characteristic behaviors of Si composition in the surface of late A through late B dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Towards a holistic magnetic braking model -- II: explaining several long-term internal- and surface-spin properties of solar-like stars and the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our model of magnetic braking (MB), driven by an $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo mechanism, from fully convective M-dwarfs (FCMDs) to explain the surface and internal spin $P_\mathrm{spin}$ evolution of partly convective dwarfs (PCDs) starting from the disc-dispersal stage to the main-sequence turnoff. In our model, the spin of the core is governed by shear at the core-envelope boundary while the spin of the envelope is governed by MB and shear. We show that (1) the most massive FCMDs experience a stronger spin-down than PCDs and less massive FCMDs, (2) the stalled spin-down and enhanced activity of K-dwarfs and the pileup of G-dwarfs older than a few Gyr are stellar-structure- and MB-dependent, and weakly dependent on core-envelope coupling effects, (3) our expression of the core-envelope convergence time-scale $\tau_\mathrm{converge}(M_\ast,\,P_\mathrm{spin})$ between a few 10 to 100~Myr strongly depends on stellar structure but weakly on MB strength and shear, such that fast and massive rotators achieve corotation earlier, (4) our estimates of the surface magnetic fields are in general agreement with observations and our wind mass loss evolution explains the weak winds from the solar analog $\pi^1$ UMa and (5) with our model the massive young Sun hypothesis as a solution to the faint young Sun problem can likely be ruled out, because the maximum mass lost by winds from our Sun with our model is about an order of magnitude smaller than required to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>Type Ia Supernovae Can Arise from the Detonations of Both Stars in a Double Degenerate Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08011</link>

Abstract: The precise origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is unknown despite their value to numerous areas in astronomy. While it is a long-standing consensus that they arise from an explosion of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, the exact progenitor configurations and explosion mechanisms that lead to SNe Ia are still debated. One popular theory is the double detonation in which a helium layer, accreted from a binary companion, detonates on the surface of the primary star, leading to a converging shock-induced detonation of the underlying core. It has recently been seen in simulations that a helium-rich degenerate companion may undergo its own explosion triggered by the impact from the ejecta of the primary star. We show 2D simulations that approximate a white dwarf undergoing a double detonation which triggers the explosion of the degenerate companion, leading to either a triple or quadruple detonation. We also present the first multi-dimensional radiative transfer results from the triple and quadruple detonation scenario. We find that within a range of mass configurations of the degenerate binary, the synthetic light curves and spectra of these events match observations as well as theoretical models of isolated double detonations do. Notably, double and quadruple detonations that are spectrally similar and reach the same peak brightnesses have drastically different ejection masses and produce different amounts of Si- and Fe-group elements. Further understanding of this scenario is needed in order to determine if at least some observed SNe Ia actually originate from two stars exploding.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters III: Probability of Binary Black Holes Hidden Inside of Gaia Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03662</link>

Abstract: Gaia mission and its follow-up observations have discovered binaries containing single BHs and visible stars without mass transfer, so-called Gaia BHs. One important question is if Gaia BHs have binary BHs (BBHs), hereafter Gaia BBHs, instead of single BHs. We have investigated how efficiently Gaia BBHs are formed in open star clusters, one of the promising formation sites of Gaia BHs, by means of gravitational $N$-body simulations. Limiting Gaia BHs' periods to $10^2$-$10^4$ days, we have found that there are no Gaia BBHs in the solar-metallicity environments, while the formation efficiency of Gaia BBHs is not small ($\sim 10^{-6} M_\odot^{-1}$ or $\sim 10$ % of Gaia BHs) in subsolar-metallicity environments. However, the probability of Gaia BBHs hidden in Gaia BHs is only $\sim 1$ %. This is because most of the BBHs merge within $1$ Gyr through gravitational wave radiation. Note that the ages of discovered Gaia BHs are more than $1$ Gyr. If we extend Gaia BHs' periods to $10^4$-$10^5$ days, the probability becomes higher to $\sim 10$ %. In this case, a large fraction of BBHs can have enough wide orbits not to merge within the Hubble time. The probability would not be high for Gaia BHs already discovered and to be discovered in the near future. Nevertheless, we have shown the BH/BBH mass, visible star mass, and eccentricity distributions of Gaia BHs and Gaia BBHs, which will be helpful for follow-up observations to discover Gaia BBHs. A Gaia BH would be more likely to be a Gaia BBH if it has younger age, longer period, lower-mass companion, more circular orbit, lower metallicity, and more massive BH. Our results have implied that Gaia BH3 is unlikely to be a Gaia BBH.</description>
