      <title>CryoMAE: Few-Shot Cryo-EM Particle Picking with Masked Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) emerges as a pivotal technology for determining the architecture of cells, viruses, and protein assemblies at near-atomic resolution. Traditional particle picking, a key step in cryo-EM, struggles with manual effort and automated methods' sensitivity to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and varied particle orientations. Furthermore, existing neural network (NN)-based approaches often require extensive labeled datasets, limiting their practicality. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce cryoMAE, a novel approach based on few-shot learning that harnesses the capabilities of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to enable efficient selection of single particles in cryo-EM images. Contrary to conventional NN-based techniques, cryoMAE requires only a minimal set of positive particle images for training yet demonstrates high performance in particle detection. Furthermore, the implementation of a self-cross similarity loss ensures distinct features for particle and background regions, thereby enhancing the discrimination capability of cryoMAE. Experiments on large-scale cryo-EM datasets show that cryoMAE outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, improving 3D reconstruction resolution by up to 22.4%.</description>

      <title>HelixFold-Multimer: Elevating Protein Complex Structure Prediction to New Heights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While monomer protein structure prediction tools boast impressive accuracy, the prediction of protein complex structures remains a daunting challenge in the field. This challenge is particularly pronounced in scenarios involving complexes with protein chains from different species, such as antigen-antibody interactions, where accuracy often falls short. Limited by the accuracy of complex prediction, tasks based on precise protein-protein interaction analysis also face obstacles. In this report, we highlight the ongoing advancements of our protein complex structure prediction model, HelixFold-Multimer, underscoring its enhanced performance. HelixFold-Multimer provides precise predictions for diverse protein complex structures, especially in therapeutic protein interactions. Notably, HelixFold-Multimer achieves remarkable success in antigen-antibody and peptide-protein structure prediction, surpassing AlphaFold-Multimer by several folds. HelixFold-Multimer is now available for public use on the PaddleHelix platform, offering both a general version and an antigen-antibody version. Researchers can conveniently access and utilize this service for their development needs.</description>
