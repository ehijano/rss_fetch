      <title>Localization of Dirac modes in a finite temperature SU(2) Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-lying Dirac modes become localized at the finite-temperature transition in QCD and other gauge theories, indicating a strong connection between localization and deconfinement. This phenomenon can be understood through the "sea/islands" picture: in the deconfined phase, modes become trapped on "islands" of Polyakov loop fluctuations within a "sea" of ordered Polyakov loops. To test the universality of the "sea/islands" mechanism, we investigate whether changes in the localization properties of low modes occur across other thermal transitions where the Polyakov loop becomes ordered, beyond the usual deconfinement transition. The fixed-length SU(2)-Higgs model is appropriate for this study. After mapping out the phase diagram, we find that low Dirac modes become localized in the deconfined and Higgs phases, where the Polyakov loop is ordered. However, localization is absent in the confined phase. These findings confirm the "sea/islands" picture of localization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the preliminary results of lattice computation for the proton decay matrix elements in $N_f=2+1$ physical point with Wilson-clover fermion. We perform it on the PACS configurations of $64^4$ lattice volume with lattice spacing $a=0.085$ fm, and carefully estimate the systematic uncertainties, especially for the excited state contamination and associated error of the renormalization constant with Regularization Independent (RI, Rome-Southampton) scheme. Our preliminary results of the twelve relevant transition modes in proton decay matrix element and comparison with other lattice results are presented.</description>

      <title>A proposal for removing $\pi N$-state contamination from the nucleon induced pseudoscalar form factor in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the PACS10 project, the PACS collaboration has generated three sets of the PACS10 gauge configurations at the physical point with lattice volume larger than $(10\;{\rm fm})^4$ and three different lattice spacings. The isovector nucleon form factors had been already calculated by using two sets of the PACS10 gauge configurations. In our strategy, the smearing parameters of the nucleon interpolation operator were highly optimized to eliminate as much as possible the contribution of excited states in the nucleon two-point function. This strategy was quite successful in calculations of the electric ($G_E$), magnetic ($G_M$) and axial-vector ($F_A$) form factors, while the induced pseudoscalar ($F_P$) and pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors remained strongly affected by residual contamination of $\pi N$-state contribution. In this work, we propose a simple method to remove the $\pi N$-state contamination from the $F_P$ form factor, and then evaluate the induced pseudoscalar charge $g_P^\ast$ and the pion-nucleon coupling $g_{\pi NN}$ from existing data in a new analysis. Applying this method to the $G_P$ form factor is also considered with a help of the axial Ward-Takahashi identity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction and $Z(2)$ Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $Z(2)$ lattice gauge theory plays an important role in the study of the threshold probability of Quantum Error Correction (QEC) for a quantum code. For certain QEC codes, such as the well-known Kitaev's toric/surface code, one can find a mapping of the QEC decoding problem onto a statistical mechanics model for a given noise model. The investigation of the threshold probability then corresponds to that of the phase diagram of the mapped statistical mechanics model. This can be studied by Monte Carlo simulation of the statistical mechanics model. In~\cite{Rispler}, we investigate the effects of realistic noise models on the toric/surface code in two dimensions together with syndrome measurement noise and introduce the random coupled-plaquette gauge model, 3-dimensional $Z(2) \times Z(2)$ lattice gauge theory. This new Z(2) gauge theory model captures main aspects of toric/surface code under depolarizing and syndrome noise. In these proceedings, we mainly focus on the aspects of Mont Carlo simulation and discuss preliminary results from Monte Carlo simulations of mapped classes of Z(2) lattice theories.</description>

      <title>Towards a parameter-free analysis of the QCD chiral phase transition and its universal critical behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To quantify the universal properties of chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we use an improved, renormalized order parameter for the chiral symmetry breaking. We construct ratios of this divergence-free order parameter from its values for different pairs of light quark masses. From this, we determine in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $\delta$ of the universality class. We present first numerical results of these calculations on $N_\tau=8$ lattices, with staggered fermions.</description>

      <title>Meson thermalization with a hot medium in the open Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field theories treated as open quantum systems provide a crucial framework for studying realistic experimental scenarios, such as quarkonia traversing the quark-gluon plasma produced at the Large Hadron Collider. In such cases, capturing the complex thermalization process requires a detailed understanding of how particles evolve and interact with a hot medium. Considering the open lattice Schwinger model and using tensor network algorithms, we investigate the thermalization dynamics of mesonic particles in a hot medium, such as the Schwinger boson or the electric flux string. We simulate systems with up to 100 lattice sites, achieving accurate preservation of the electric field parity symmetry, demonstrating the algorithm's robustness and scalability. Our results reveal that the thermalization time increases with stronger dissipation from the environment, increasing environment temperature, higher background electric field and heavier fermion masses. Further, we study the quantum mutual information between the two halves of the flux string connecting a meson's constituent particles and analyze its relation to relevant dynamical observables.</description>

      <title>Effective string description of the reconfined phase in the trace deformed $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in (2+1) dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of the flux tube in the reconfined phase of the trace deformed $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in (2 + 1) dimensions. In this phase the Polyakov loop has a vanishing expectation value (and center symmetry is recovered) even at high temperatures. We study, by means of numerical simulations, the confining potential between two Polyakov loops. We show that its behaviour is very different from that of usual confining gauge models and shows a remarkable agreement with the predictions of the so called "rigid string" in the limit in which the rigidity term (i.e. a term proportional to the square of the extrinsic curvature of the string) is very large and is the dominant contribution in the action.</description>

      <title>Distribution Functions of a Radially Excited Pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonperturbatively-improved, symmetry-preserving approximation to the quantum field equations relevant in calculations of meson masses and interactions is used to deliver predictions for all distribution functions (DFs) of the ground state pion, $\pi_0$, and its first radial excitation, $\pi_1$, viz. valence, glue, and sea. Regarding Mellin moments of the valence DFs, the $m=0,1$ moments in both states are identical; but for each $m\geq 2$, that in the $\pi_0$ is greater than its partner in the $\pi_1$. Working with such information, pointwise reconstructions of the hadron-scale $\pi_{0,1}$ valence DFs are developed. The predicted $\pi_0$ valence DF is consistent with extant results. The $\pi_1$ valence DF is novel: it possesses three-peaks, with the central maximum partnered by secondary peaks on either side, each separated from the centre by a zero: the zeroes lie at $x\approx 0.2,0.8$ and the secondary peaks at $x\approx 0.1,0.9$. Evolution to $\zeta =3.2\,$GeV, a typical scale for nonperturbative calculations, is accomplished using an evolution scheme for parton DFs that is all-orders exact. At this higher scale, differences between the $\pi_{0,1}$ valence DFs remain significant, but analogous differences between glue and sea DFs are far smaller. This analysis shows that, owing to constraints imposed by chiral symmetry and the pattern by which it is broken in Nature, there are noticeable differences between the structural properties of the pion ground state and its radial excitations.</description>

      <title>Native Three-Body Interactions in a Superconducting Lattice Gauge Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While universal quantum computers remain under development, analog quantum simulators offer a powerful alternative for understanding complex systems in condensed matter, chemistry, and high-energy physics. One compelling application is the characterization of real-time lattice gauge theories (LGTs). LGTs are nonperturbative tools, utilizing discretized spacetime to describe gauge-invariant models. They hold immense potential for understanding fundamental physics but require enforcing local constraints analogous to electromagnetism's Gauss's Law. These constraints, which arise from gauge symmetries and dictate the form of the interaction between matter and gauge fields, are a significant challenge for simulators to enforce. Implementing these constraints at the hardware level in analog simulations is crucial. This requires realizing multibody interactions between matter and gauge-field elements, enabling them to evolve together while suppressing unwanted two-body interactions that violate the gauge symmetry. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel parametrically activated three-qubit interaction within a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. We experimentally demonstrate a minimal $U(1)$ spin-1/2 model with a time evolution that intrinsically satisfies Gauss's law in the system. This design serves as the foundational block for simulating LGTs on a superconducting photonic lattice.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Flow Equations in Daubechies Wavelet Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the low energy dynamics of a system of two coupled real scalar fields in 1+1 dimensions using the flow equation approach of Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) in a wavelet basis. This paper presents an extension of the work by Michlin and Polyzou \cite{PhysRevD.95.094501} at one resolution higher. We also present the analysis of a model of two scalar fields coupled through a generally quadratic interaction in $1+1$ dimensions using wavelet-based flow equations. We demonstrate that the specifically chosen generator flows the Hamiltonian into a block diagonal form with each diagonal block being associated with a fixed resolution. The wavelet basis is known to transform the scalar field theory into a model of coupled localized oscillators, each of which is labelled by location and resolution indices. The chosen interaction represents the coupling between two types of oscillators at the same location and resolution index. There is no coupling between oscillators across locations and resolutions. We show that wavelet-based flow equations carry out scale separation while maintaining the interactions between the two scalar fields at each resolution. The effective Hamiltonian associated with the coarsest resolution is shown to correctly reproduce the normal mode frequencies of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model-independent method to calculate the radiative transition without the momentum extrapolation for the off-shell transition factors. The on-shell transition factor is directly obtained from the lattice hadronic function. We apply the method to calculate the charmonium radiative transition $J/\psi \rightarrow \gamma\eta_c$. After a continuous extrapolation under three lattice spacings, we obtain the on-shell transition factor as $V(0)=1.90(4)$, where the error is the statistical error that already takes into account the $a^2$-error in the continuous extrapolation. Finally, we determine the branching fraction of $J/\psi\rightarrow \gamma \eta_c$ as $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi\rightarrow \gamma\eta_c)=2.49(11)_{\textrm{lat}}(5)_{\textrm{exp}}$, where the second error comes from the uncertainty of $J/\psi$ total decay width $92.6(1.7)$ keV.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of screening masses of mesons in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spatial two-point correlation functions of mesonic operators in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures. The simulated temperatures over the range $T \in [147, 330]$ MeV, where the critical temperature is estimated around 165 MeV. To ensure a good control of the chiral symmetry we employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action for two degenerate flavors of quarks. With a lattice cut off $a^{-1}\sim 2.6$ GeV, the residual mass is reduced to 0.14 MeV. With the energy spectrum obtained from the screening mass at incremental values of the temperature range, we examine the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry, the anomalous axial $U(1)$ as well as an enhanced symmetry which exchanges the spin degrees of freedom. We also study how the data approaches the perturbative prediction given by twice the Matsubara frequency of free quarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the QCD instanton vacuum, the C-even and C-odd nucleon Pauli form factors receive a large contribution from the underlying ensemble of pseudoparticles, that is sensitive to a finite QCD vacuum angle $\theta$. This observation is used to derive explicitly the electric dipole form factor for light quark flavors, and estimate the proton and neutron electric dipole moment induced by a small CP violating $\theta$. The results are in the range of some recently reported lattice simulations.</description>
