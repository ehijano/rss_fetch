      <title>Automated electrostatic characterization of quantum dot devices in single- and bilayer heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum dot (QD)-based spin qubits advance toward larger, more complex device architectures, rapid, automated device characterization and data analysis tools become critical. The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field controlled nucleation and size selection of silver nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the reduction of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) size under an external magnetic field within a classical nucleation theory framework combined with a sphere-packing description of atomic assembly. The model incorporates magnetic free-energy contributions arising from the coupling between the applied field and the magnetic susceptibility of the nucleating material, yielding a closed-form relation between nanoparticle radius and field strength. Our approach reproduces the experimentally observed decrease in the most-probable particle radius from approximately 170 nm at 49.27 mT when the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the stirring plane, and to 155 nm at 180.78 mT in the perpendicular configuration. Across the investigated field range, the theoretical predictions remain consistent with experimental measurements obtained under continuous mechanical stirring, supporting the interpretation that the observed size reduction originates from a magnetic-field-induced modification of the nucleation free-energy landscape. Within the limits of classical capillarity and spherical demagnetization, the results provide a physically transparent and computationally efficient framework for understanding magnetic-field-controlled nanoparticle size selection.</description>

      <title>Nanocrystal Geometry Governs Phase Transformation Pathways in Palladium Hydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathways and structural dynamics of phase transformations impact performance of materials in energy and information storage technologies. Palladium hydride ($\mathrm{PdH}_x$) nanocrystals are an ideal model system for studying solute-induced phase transformations, where elastic energy from lattice mismatch between $\alpha$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ and $\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases is often considered a key to determining the transformation pathways. $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfacial elastic energy is affected by the confined geometry of a nanocrystal. However, how nanocrystal geometry influences phase transformation pathways is largely unknown. Using in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy, we directly visualize hydrogenation in Pd nanocrystals with two geometries -- a nanocube and a hexagonal nanoplate. Both follow similar sequences of an initially curved nucleus, interface flattening, and reverse-stage nucleation; however, their evolving $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibit geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments. In nanocubes, $\{100\}$-aligned configurations conform to static elastic energy ordering, representing a pathway that maintains a local mechanical equilibrium, whereas nanoplates display both $\{110\}$- and $\{211\}$-aligned interfaces. Theoretical simulations show that geometry determines the accessibility of alternative phase transformation pathways as the system is driven far from equilibrium during hydrogenation. These findings identify geometry as a fundamental parameter for directing phase transformation pathways, offering design principles for accessing atypical configurations and improving properties of intercalation-based devices.</description>

      <title>Unified topological phase diagram of quantum Hall and superconducting vortex-lattice states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the global topological phase diagram of a two-dimensional electron gas placed in a quantizing magnetic field and proximitized by a superconducting vortex lattice. Our theory allows for arbitrary ratios of the pairing amplitude, magnetic field, and chemical potential. By analyzing the Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian, we show that the resulting phase diagram is highly nontrivial, featuring a plethora of topological superconducting phases with chiral edge modes of quasiparticles. Landau-level mixing plays an essential role in our theory: even in the weak-pairing limit, it generically splits the integer quantum Hall transition lines into a sequence of transitions with larger Chern number jumps of both signs protected by the symmetries of the superconducting vortex lattice. Interestingly, we find that weak pairing induces trivial or topological superconductivity when chemical potential is tuned to a Landau level energy, depending on the Landau level index.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the suppression of the hybrid skin-topological effect by fragile topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators are well-known for their topological edge states, which are protected by the non-trivial bulk topology and characterized by gapless Wannier bands, a phenomenon known as the bulk-boundary correspondence. However, fragile topology challenged this concept, the Wannier bands are gapped, but the edge states still exist with similar protection. Previous studies on fragile topology have primarily focused on the spectral flow under twisted boundary conditions, but the discussion on the physical interpretation of the Wannier gap is limited. In this study, we introduce a bilayer breathing honeycomb lattice with spiral interlayer couplings inside the unit cell. As we increase the interlayer coupling strength, the Wannier gap increases monotonically and the bandgap first increases then decreases. After introducing a gain-loss domain wall, the hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) emerges, and the topological edge states under the periodic boundary condition (PBC) change into corner states under the open boundary condition (OBC) associated with the significant spectral difference. HSTE is suppressed as the interlayer coupling strength increases, the spectral difference between the two boundary conditions has an overall decreasing trend, which more closely mirrors the evolution of the inverse of the Wannier gap. Moreover, some of the corner states transform into edge states. Our work first provides evidence for the relation between fragile topology and HSTE, shedding new insights into the underlying mechanism of Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE).</description>

      <title>Magnon Superlattices around Skyrmions in Frustrated Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic and stable magnetic textures offer a powerful platform for controlling magnon states in the broader context of spin electronics. In this work, we uncover a novel class of dynamical, crystal-like localization patterns in real space, arising from the hybridization of magnons with topologically non-trivial spin textures that possess helicity as an internal degree of freedom. By tuning the magnon wavelength to match the size of these textures, specifically, atomic-scale skyrmions in centrosymmetric frustrated magnets, we achieve strong interference effects. This leads to the emergence of magnon superlattices, shaped by the internal skyrmion structure and the underlying Mexican-hat magnon dispersion. Furthermore, helicity-driven nonlinear dynamics give rise to dispersive magnon bands with nontrivial Chern numbers within the first magnon gap. These findings provide fundamental insights into magnon behavior in complex spin environments and establish frustrated magnets as a versatile platform for manipulating spin excitations at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>$\Delta_T$ Noise from Electron-Hole Asymmetry in Normal and Superconducting Quantum Point Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines $\Delta_T$ noise in two-terminal hybrid nanostructures featuring a quantum point contact (QPC), realized either between two normal metals (NQN) or between a normal metal and a superconductor (NQS). The inclusion of a QPC breaks electron-hole (e-h) symmetry, leading to a finite thermovoltage. In contrast, earlier studies on hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, as e-h symmetry is preserved, have vanishing thermovoltage, and consequently, $\Delta_T$ noise is calculated at zero thermovoltage. In our setup, the broken e-h symmetry allows for a finite thermovoltage, at which we compute the corresponding $\Delta_T$ noise. Unlike earlier studies restricted by e-h symmetry and vanishing thermovoltage, our work establishes a self-consistent framework in mesoscopic hybrid junctions, revealing how Andreev reflection fundamentally reshapes $\Delta_T$ noise once e-h symmetry is broken. This broad access to charge fluctuation signatures provides a more comprehensive understanding of non-equilibrium transport in linear response. To our knowledge, this work provides the first self-consistent analysis of $\Delta_T$ noise in superconducting hybrid junctions where e-h symmetry is broken, explicitly revealing how Andreev reflection modifies $\Delta_T$ noise beyond the symmetry-protected zero-thermovoltage regime.</description>

      <title>Analytical formulas for far-field radiated energy and angular momentum of metallic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate far-field radiation of energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum from two-dimensional electron systems, focusing on metallic thin films described by the Drude conductivity. Using the Keldysh formalism within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework, we derive analytical expressions for radiative power, force, and torque. To enable angular momentum radiation, an out-of-plane magnetic field is applied to break reciprocity, resulting in gyrotropic terms in the permittivity tensor. By approximating the emitter as a thin film, the photon Green's functions can be solved analytically. Expressions for the Poynting vector and Maxwell's stress tensor can subsequently be extracted from the lesser Green's function, which governs the field correlations. The final radiation formulas can be expressed in terms of Fresnel coefficients, revealing an insightful connection to energy conservation via Kirchhoff's law. Using the Wigner transform, the analytical expression for the radiative torque can also be related to the generalized Fresnel coefficients. Numerical calculations based on the optical conductivity of bismuth are presented to corroborate the analytical results. These results provide a unified framework for energy, momentum, and angular momentum radiation in gyrotropic thin films.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Hermitian Magnon Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A defining quantity of a physical system is its energy which is represented by the Hamiltonian. In closed quantum mechanical or/and coherent wave-based systems the Hamiltonian is introduced as a Hermitian operator which ensures real energy spectrum and secures the decomposition of any state over a complete basis set spanning the space where the states live. Pseudo-Hermitian, or PT symmetric, systems are a special class of non-Hermitian ones. They describe open systems but may still have real energy spectrum. The eigenmodes are however not orthogonal in general. This qualitative difference to Hermitian physics has a range of consequences for the physical behaviour of the system in the steady state or when it is subjected to external perturbations. This overview reviews the recent progress in the field of pseudo-Hermitian physics as it unfolds when applied to low-energy excitations of magnetically ordered materials. The focus is mainly on long wave length spin excitations (spin waves) with magnons being the energy quanta of these excitations. Various setups including ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, magnonic crystals, and hybride structures with different types of coupling to the environments as well as spatio-temporally engineered systems will be discussed with a focus on the particular aspects that are brought about by the pseudo-Hermiticity such as mode amplifications, non-reciprocal propagation, magnon cloaking, non-Hermitian skin effect, PT-symmetric assisted Floquet engineering, topological energy transfer, and field-induced enhanced sensitivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard approach to characterizing topological matter, computing topological invariants, fails when the symmetry protecting the topological phase is preserved only on average in a disordered system. Because topological invariants rely on enforcing the symmetry exactly, they can overcount phases by incorrectly identifying certain non-robust features as robust. Moreover, in intrinsic statistical topological insulators, enforcing the symmetry exactly is guaranteed to destroy the topological phase. We define a mapping that addresses both issues and provides a unified framework for describing disordered topological matter.</description>

      <title>Polar enhancement of optical nonlinearities and domain-driven second harmonic contrast in bismuth telluro-halide van der Waals crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BiTeX family of polar van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors offers a unique platform for exploring the interplay between polar crystalline structure and nonlinear optical phenomena. Here, we utilize second harmonic generation (SHG) polarimetry to demonstrate giant anisotropic optical nonlinearities in BiTeBr and BiTeI driven by contributions to the crystals' nonlinear polarizability originating from their permanent dipole moment. In addition, using SHG microscopy, we show that BiTeI displays a distinctive SHG spatial texture consisting of thread-like regions of reduced harmonic intensity. These features demark the boundaries between phase and anti-phase polar domains, confirmed via piezoresponse force microscopy and are attributable to disorder-driven restoration of inversion symmetry and concomitant optical interference effects. Our results unveil the power of polarization-resolved SHG microscopy in elucidating the intricate relationship between structure, symmetry, and nonlinear optical responses in polar vdW materials and highlight the promise of BiTeX as a material platform for domain-engineered nanoscale nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate quantum levitation controlled by Casimir forces acting between a polystyrene surface and a Teflon-coated metallic substrate immersed in a mixture of Toluene and magnetite particles. This system experiences repulsion-attraction transitions in the Casimir interaction for distances where the effect is measurable. This Casimir trapping can be controlled by clever choices of metallic and ferrofluid materials, which are directly linked to the emergence of the trapping effect. Thermal and quantum contributions are investigated in detail, showing how the optical and magnetic properties of the ferrofluid and other materials affect the magnitude of the trapping and its distance range of observability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuation-induced Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents. The graphene properties are modeled based on the shifted Fermi disk model to capture the non-equilibrium optical response of the system. We find that the drift current introduces a repulsive correction to the perpendicular to the layers Casimir interaction, thereby reducing the overall attractive force. Although the correction is repulsive, it does not overcome the underlying attraction between the layers. It also generates a lateral force that opposes the carrier flow direction. Both contributions are studied in terms of distance and drift velocity functionalities showing pathways for Casimir force control.</description>

      <title>Doping induced itinerant ferromagnetism and enhanced ferroelectricity in BL-InSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism in solids remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, with far-reaching implications for multifunctional materials and next-generation electronic devices. Using first-principles calculations, we predict emergent sliding ferroelectricity and doping-mediated ferromagnetism in bilayer (BL) InSe. The energetically favored AB stacked BL-InSe spontaneously breaks the out-of-plane mirror symmetry, resulting in a switchable polarization with a saturated component of 0.089 pC/m and a low transition barrier of 28.8 meV per unit cell. Strikingly, low-concentration electrostatic doping enhances rather than suppresses the ferroelectric polarization due to the abnormal layer-dependent electronic occupation in BL-InSe, in contrast to the conventional screening paradigm. In addition, the characteristic Mexican-hat-shaped valence band enables doping-induced itinerant half-metallic ferromagnetism, where the interlayer spin density difference scales linearly with doping concentration and can be reversed by switching the polarization direction. These results demonstrate the coexistence of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders in BL-InSe and establish a viable platform for realizing voltage-tunable multiferroicity through stacking and carrier doping in otherwise nonpolar and nonmagnetic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Coordination-driven magic numbers in protonated argon clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural properties of rare-gas clusters can be primarily described by a simple sphere packing model or by pairwise interactions. Remarkably, adding a single proton yields a large set of magic numbers that has remained unexplained. In this Letter, we unravel their origin by combining quantum Monte Carlo techniques with many-body ab initio potentials that correctly capture the proton's coordination environment. Thanks to this approach, we find that argon atoms are mainly localized around the classical minimum, resulting in a particularly rigid behavior in stark contrast to lighter rare-gas clusters. Moreover, as cluster size increases, we identify a clear structural transition from many-body coordination-driven stability to a regime dominated by two-body interactions, reflecting a reshaping of the underlying potential energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for dissipative photons from higher-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in generalized symmetries have provided new insights into quantum field theories. Within this framework, photons can be understood as Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with a spontaneously broken higher-form symmetry. In this work, we develop an effective field theory that builds on this symmetry structure to describe the real-time dynamics of photons in insulating media at finite temperature. Combining the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism with the generalized coset construction, we formulate a symmetry-based effective action that incorporates both conservative and dissipative effects. The effective theory implements the dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry, ensuring consistency with the fluctuation-dissipation relation and Onsager's reciprocal relations. Within this framework, we derive the entropy current associated with dissipative photon dynamics and demonstrate the non-negativity of its divergence, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. We also clarify the symmetry origin of the gauge redundancy in the unbroken phase within the Schwinger-Keldysh framework, relating it to strong and weak realizations of higher-form symmetries. Our results provide a model-independent effective description of photon dynamics in insulating media at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Accelerated Sampling of Pauli Strings for Nonstabilizerness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum magic, quantified by nonstabilizerness, measures departures from stabilizer structure and underlies potential quantum speedups. We introduce an efficient classical algorithm that exactly computes stabilizer R\'enyi entropies and stabilizer nullity for generic many-body wavefunctions of $N$ qubits. The method combines the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform with an exact partition of Pauli operators. It achieves an exponential speedup over direct approaches, reducing the average cost per sampled Pauli string from $O(2^N)$ to $O(N)$. Building on this framework, we further develop a Monte-Carlo estimator for stabilizer R\'enyi entropies together with a Clifford-based variance-reduction scheme that suppresses sampling fluctuations. We benchmark the accuracy and efficiency on ensembles of random magic states, and apply the method to random Clifford circuits with doped $T$ gates, comparing different doping architectures. Our approach applies to arbitrary quantum states and provides quantitative access to magic resources both encoded in highly entangled states and generated by long-time nonequilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin decoherence theory of magnetoresistance in mesoscopic ferromagnets and its applications</title>

Abstract: Quantum decoherence is the key mechanism determining whether quantum effects can manifest in quantum computation and transport, and mastering decoherence is central to designing and operating functional quantum devices. Here, we present a quantum spin decoherence theory of magnetoresistance (MR) from an open-quantum system perspective. Importantly, even when the spin-up and -down species have the same density of states, magnon MR, anisotropic MR, and Hanle MR still emerge in mesoscopic ferromagnets, which arise from the magnon-induced spin flip, spin relaxation anisotropy, and Hanle spin precession of itinerant electrons, respectively. The theory not only predicts the magnetic field and temperature dependencies of MR, which are related to spin relaxation time and spin-exchange field, but also obtains the universal cosine-square law of anisotropic MR. Moreover, we reveal diverse behaviors of the MR effects that enable the simple detection of the spin-exchange coupling strength via an electrical measurement. Our theory advances the understanding of the fundamental physics of MR in mesoscopic ferromagnets, revealing how it enables electrical probing of quantum decoherence-the decisive factor in nanoscience and nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Hopf Exceptional Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13012v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Inspired Framework for Subjective Evaluation: Cognitive Polarization and Entropic Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum-inspired framework to model subjective evaluation processes using state vectors in Hilbert space. In this approach, individual preferences are represented as cognitive states polarized between 'like' and 'dislike', enabling a continuous interpretation of evaluative attitudes. The evolution of these states is characterized on the Bloch sphere, and the cognitive coherence is interpreted geometrically. To further analyze the uncertainty and diversity in subjective preferences, we introduce both Shannon entropy (at the individual level) and Von Neumann entropy (at the group level) into the framework. A small-scale simulated dataset is used to conceptually demonstrate how these entropy measures can reveal internal indecisiveness and collective incoherence. The model offers a physically grounded and mathematically expressive tool for quantifying subjectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the expression for the local Hall conductivity for systems that lack translation symmetry and use it to study the local fluctuations of the Hall signal around disordered patches in magnetic insulators. We find that the regime in parameter space over which the system is a Chern insulating state increases upon inclusion of non-magnetic potential disorder. In addition, the phase space over which the topological Anderson insulator exists can be enhanced by breaking up a single disordered patch into multiple smaller patches with the same total amount of disorder. We expect our results will motivate the next generation of local scanning and local impedance spectroscopy experiments to visualize Hall currents around patches in the bulk of a disordered topological insulator.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with the energy levels of free parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a parent Hermitian tight-binding model on a bipartite lattice with chiral symmetry, we theoretically generate non-Hermitian models for free fermions with $p$ orbitals per unit cell satisfying a complex generalization of chiral symmetry. The $p$ complex energy bands in $k$ space are given by a common $k$-dependent real factor, determined by the bands of the parent model, multiplied by the $p$th roots of unity. When the parent model is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the single-particle energy levels are the same as those of free parafermion solutions to Baxter's non-Hermitian clock model. This construction relies on fully unidirectional hopping to create Bloch Hamiltonians with the form of generalized permutation matrices, but we also describe the effect of partial unidirectional hopping. For fully bidirectional hopping, the Bloch Hamiltonians are Hermitian and may be separated into even and odd parity blocks with respect to inversion of the orbitals within the unit cell. Partially unidirectional hopping breaks the inversion symmetry and mixes the even and odd blocks, and the real energy spectrum evolves into a complex one as the degree of unidirectionality increases, with details determined by the topology of the parent model and the number of orbitals per unit cell, $p$. We describe this process in detail for $p=3$ and $p=4$ with the SSH model. We also apply our approach to graphene, and show that $AA$-stacked bilayer graphene evolves into a square root Hamiltonian of monolayer graphene with the introduction of unidirectional hopping. We show that higher-order exceptional points occur at edge states and solitons in the non-Hermitian SSH model, and at the Dirac point of non-Hermitian graphene.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in three-dimensional PT- and PC-symmetric class CI band structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a previously missing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant for three-dimensional band structures in symmetry class CI defined by parity-time (PT) and parity-particle-hole (PC) symmetries. PT symmetry allows one to define a real Berry connection and, based on the $\eta$-invariant, a spin-Chern--Simons (spin-CS) action. We show that PC symmetry quantizes the spin-CS action to $\{0,2\pi\}$ with $4\pi$ periodicity, thereby yielding a well-defined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. This invariant is additive under direct sums of isolated band structures, reduces to a known $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index when a global Takagi factorization exists, and in general depends on the choice of spin structure. Finally, we demonstrate lattice models in which this newly introduced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant distinguishes topological phases that cannot be detected by the previously known topological indices.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic ultrafast edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ driven by broken crystal symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directional photocurrents in two-dimensional materials arise from broken crystal symmetry, offering pathways to high-speed, bias-free photodetection beyond conventional devices. Tungsten ditelluride (WTe$_2$), a type-II Weyl semimetal, exhibits robust symmetry-breaking-induced edge photocurrents from competing nonlinear optical and photothermoelectric mechanisms, whose intrinsic dynamics have remained experimentally inaccessible. Here, we directly resolve sub-picosecond edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ through ohmic contacts over temperatures from 300 K to 4 K. We demonstrate ultrafast optical-to-electrical conversion with a 3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$250 GHz and reveal picosecond-timescale switching of the net photocurrent direction below 150 K, linked to a Lifshitz transition. This transient bipolar response arises from non-equilibrium Seebeck effects due to asymmetric cooling of hot electrons and holes. These findings reveal previously hidden ultrafast dynamics in symmetry-engineered materials, offering new strategies to disentangle competing photocurrent mechanisms and enabling the development of self-powered, ultrafast optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.</description>

Abstract: Bilayer graphene cavities where electrons are confined within finite graphene flakes provide an alluring platform not only for the future nanoelectronic devices owing to the tunable energy gap but also for investigating the quantum nature of chaos due to the trigonal warping of their Fermi surface. Here we demonstrate that rotating the cavity boundary relative to the underlying lattice structure drives a quantum transition from nearly integrable dynamics to chaotic regime, observed as a concomitant crossover of eigenvalue statistics and eigenstate profiles. Complementing the full quantum treatment, we examine the classical backbone of this onset of chaos by employing semiclassical ray dynamics. Our results position bilayer graphene cavities as a promising venue for investigating and engineering quantum-chaotic behavior in graphene-based devices.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Spin-Valley Coupling in Dirac Material BaMnBi2 Probed by Quantum Hall Effect and Nonlinear Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valleytronics is a rapidly advancing field that explores the use of the valley degree of freedom in electronic systems to encode and process information. It relies on electronic states with spin valley locking, first predicted and observed in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2. However, very few bulk materials have been reported to host spin valley locked electronic states. In this work, we present experimental evidence for a predicted, unique spin valley locked electronic state generated by Bi zigzag chains in the layered compound BaMnBi2. We observe remarkable quantum transport properties in this material, including a stacked quantum Hall effect (QHE) and a nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). From the analysis of the QHE, we identify a spin valley degeneracy of four, while the NLHE provides supporting evidence for the anticipated valley contrasted Berry curvature, a typical signature of a spin valley locked state. This spin valley locked state contrasts with that observed in the sister compound BaMnSb2, where the degeneracy is two. This difference arises from significant variations in their orthorhombic crystal structures and spin orbit coupling. These findings establish a new platform for exploring coupled spin valley physics in bulk materials and highlight its potential for valleytronic device applications.</description>

Abstract: A theory for ground-state modifications of matter embedded in a Fabry-Perot cavity and whose excitations are described as harmonic oscillators is presented. Based on Lifshitz's theory for vacuum energy and employing a Lorentz model for the material permittivity, a nonperturbative macroscopic QED model that accounts for the infinite number of cavity modes with a continuum of their wavevectors was built. Differences from the commonly used single-mode Hopfield Hamiltonian are revealed. The nonresonant role of polaritons in the ground-state energy shift is also demonstrated, showing that the cavity effect is mainly caused by static screening occurring at very low frequencies. The theory allows for a straightforward incorporation of losses and temperature effects.</description>

Abstract: We study the interplay of non-Hermitian topological phases under point- and line-gap conditions. Using natural homomorphisms from line-gap to point-gap phases, we distinguish extrinsic phases, reducible to Hermitian or anti-Hermitian line-gapped phases, from intrinsic phases, which are genuinely non-Hermitian without Hermitian counterparts. Although classification tables for all symmetry classes were already presented in earlier work, the present paper develops a unified formulation and provides explicit computations for all internal symmetries.</description>
