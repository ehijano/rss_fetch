      <title>$\tau$-tilting finiteness and $\mathbf{g}$-tameness: Incidence algebras of posets and concealed algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any $\tau$-tilting finite incidence algebra of a finite poset is representation-finite, and that any $\mathbf{g}$-tame incidence algebra of a finite simply connected poset is tame. As the converse of these assertions are known to hold, we obtain characterizations of $\tau$-tilting finite incidence algebras and $\mathbf{g}$-tame simply connected incidence algebras. Both results are proved using the theory of concealed algebras. The former will be deduced from the fact that tame concealed algebras are $\tau$-tilting infinite, and to prove the latter, we show that wild concealed algebras are not $\mathbf{g}$-tame. We conjecture that any incidence algebra of a finite poset is wild if and only if it is not $\mathbf{g}$-tame, and prove a result showing that there are relatively few possible counterexamples. In the appendix, we determine the representation type of a $\tau$-tilting reduction of a concealed algebra of hyperbolic type.</description>

      <title>Kronecker Coefficients and Harrison Centers of Green's Ring $\mathcal{R}(S_6)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the laws and explanations for the combinatorial aspects of the Kronecker coefficients can be discovered through a large number of computations, then the solution to a long-standing open problem can be provided. The aim of our work is to compute the Kronecker coefficients for the representation ring of the symmetric group $S_6$. Specifically, the power formulas of irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_6$ are computed using the character theory of finite groups. In addition, by decomposing tensor products of irreducible representations of $S_6$, we characterise the representation ring $\mathcal{R}(S_6)$, such as generators, its unit group, primitive idempotents and Casimir number. We also give another way, using Harrison center theory, to study the representation ring. Finally, we leave some open problems for future consideration.</description>

      <title>Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras and Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Li, Sheng and Tang introduced post-Hopf algebras and relative Rota-Baxter operators (on cocommutative Hopf algebras), providing an adjunction between the respective categories under the assumption that the structures involved are cocommutative. We introduce Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras, which become usual post-Hopf algebras in the cocommutative setting. In analogy with the correspondence between cocommutative post-Hopf algebras and cocommutative Hopf braces, the category of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras is isomorphic to the category of Yetter-Drinfeld braces introduced by the author in a joint work with D. Ferri. This allows to explore the connection with matched pairs of actions and provide examples of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras. Moreover, we prove that the category of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras is equivalent to a subcategory of Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators. The latter structures coincide with the inverse maps of Yetter-Drinfeld 1-cocycles introduced by the author and D. Ferri, and generalise bijective relative Rota-Baxter operators on cocommutative Hopf algebras. Hence the previous equivalence passes to cocommutative post-Hopf algebras and bijective relative Rota-Baxter operators. Once the surjectivity of the Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators is removed, the equivalence is replaced by an adjunction and one can recover the result of Li, Sheng and Tang in the cocommutative case.</description>

      <title>Irreducible decompositions of tensors via the Brauer algebra and applications to metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this thesis, we make use of representation theory of groups and algebras to perform an irreducible decomposition of tensors in the context of metric-affine gravity. In particular, we consider the action of the orthogonal group O(1, d$-1$) on the Riemann tensor associated with an affine connection defined on a d-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold. This connection, with torsion and non-metricity, is the characteristic ingredient of metric-affine theories of gravity.
  In the second part of this thesis, we construct the projection operators used for the aforementioned decomposition. They are realized in terms of the symmetric group algebra $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{S}_n$ and of the Brauer algebra B$_n$(d) which are related respectively to the action of GL(d,$\mathbb{C}$) (and its real form GL(d,$\mathbb{R}$)) and to the action of O(d,$\mathbb{C}$) (and its real form O(1 , d$-1$)) on tensors via the Schur-Weyl duality. First of all, we give an alternative approach to the known formulas for the central idempotents of $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{S}_n$. These elements provide a unique reducible decomposition, known as the isotypic decomposition. For our purposes, this decomposition is remarkably handy to arrive at the sought after irreducible decomposition with respect to GL(d,$\mathbb{R}$). Then, we construct the elements in B$_n$(d) which realize the isotypic decomposition of a tensor under the action of O(d,$\mathbb{C}$). This decomposition is irreducible under O(d,$\mathbb{C}$) when applied to an irreducible GL(d,$\mathbb{C}$) tensor of order $5$ or less. As a by product of the construction, we give a solution to the problem of decomposing an arbitrary tensor into its traceless part, doubly traceless part and so on. These results led to the development of several Mathematica packages linked to the \textit{xAct} bundle for tensor calculus in field theory.</description>

      <title>On the desingularisation of moduli of principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{nr} Narasimhan and Ramanan and in \cite{desing}, Seshadri constructed desingularisations of the moduli space $M^{ss}_{_{\text{SL}(2)}}$ of semistable $\SL(2)$-bundles on a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g \geq 3$. Seshadri's construction was even modular and canonical. In this paper, we construct a smooth modular compactification of the moduli of stable principal $H$-bundles when $H$ is a simply connected almost simple algebraic group of type ${\tt B}_{_\ell}, {\tt D}_{_\ell}, {\tt G}_{_2}, {\tt F}_{_4}~~or~~{\tt C}_{_3}$. These spaces give canonical desingularisations of the moduli space $M^{ss}_{_H}$ of semistable principal $H$-bundles and thereby, a comprehensive generalisation of \cite{desing}.</description>

      <title>Osterwalder-Schrader axioms for unitary full vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full Vertex Operator Algebras (full VOA) are extensions of two commuting Vertex Operator Algebras, introduced to formulate compact two-dimensional conformal field theory. We define unitarity, polynomial energy bounds and polynomial spectral density for full VOA. Under these conditions and local $C_1$-cofiniteness of the simple full VOA, we show that the correlation functions of quasi-primary fields define tempered distributions and satisfy a conformal version of the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, including the linear growth condition.
  As an example, we show that a family of full extensions of the Heisenberg VOA satisfies all these assumptions.</description>

      <title>Partial Resolutions of Affine Symplectic Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between the Poisson deformation theory, birational geometry, and Springer theory of crepant partial resolutions of conical affine symplectic singularities. We show that given any crepant partial resolution $X'$, the Poisson deformation functor of $X'$ is prorepresentable and unobstructed. Additionally, we define a version of the Namikawa Weyl group $W_{X'}$ for partial resolutions, such that $W_{X'}$ is a parabolic subgroup of the Namikawa Weyl group $W_X$ determined by the birational geometry of $X'$, in particular by a face of a relative movable cone. If $Y$ is a Q-factorial terminalization which covers $X'$, we show there is a natural morphism from Poisson deformations of $Y$ to those of $X'$, and that this morphism is a Galois covering with Galois group $W_{X'}$, building on work of Namikawa. Finally, we put these partial resolutions and their universal deformations into the context of work of McGerty and Nevins, obtaining some preliminary results concerning their Springer theory.</description>

      <title>Geometric categorifications of Verma modules: Grassmannian Quiver Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Naisse and Vaz defined an extension of KLR algebras to categorify Verma modules. We realise these algebras geometrically as convolution algebras in Borel-Moore homology. For this we introduce Grassmannian-Steinberg quiver flag varieties. They generalize Steinberg quiver flag varieties in a non-obvious way, reflecting the diagrammatics from the Naisse-Vaz construction. Using different kind of stratifications we provide geometric explanations of the rather mysterious algebraic and diagrammatic basis theorems.
  A geometric categorification of Verma modules was recently found in the special case of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ by Rouquier. Rouquier's construction uses coherent sheaves on certain quasi-map spaces to flag varieties (zastavas), whereas our construction is implicitly based on perverse sheaves. Both should be seen as parts (on dual sides) of a general geometric framework for the Naisse-Vaz approach.
  We first treat the (substantially easier) $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ case in detail and construct as a byproduct a geometric dg-model of the nil-Hecke algebras. The extra difficulties we encounter in general require the use of more complicated Grassmannian-Steinberg quiver flag varieties. Their definition arises from combinatorially defined diagram varieties which we assign to each Naisse-Vaz basis diagram. Our explicit analysis here might shed some light on categories of coherent sheaves on more general zastava spaces studied by Feigin-Finkelberg-Kuznetsov-Mirkovi\'c and Braverman, which we expect to occur in a generalization of Rouquier's construction away from $\mathfrak{sl}_2$.</description>

      <title>Bounded $t$-structures, finitistic dimensions, and singularity categories of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Amnon Neeman settled a bold conjecture by Antieau, Gepner, and Heller regarding the relationship between the regularity of finite-dimensional noetherian schemes and the existence of bounded $t$-structures on their derived categories of perfect complexes.
  In this paper, using different methods, we prove some very general results about the existence of bounded $t$-structures on (not necessarily algebraic or topological) triangulated categories and their invariance under completion. We show that if the opposite category of an essentially small triangulated category has finite finitistic dimension in our sense, then the existence of a bounded t-structure on it forces it to be equal to its completion. We also prove a parallel result regarding the equivalence of all bounded t-structures on any intermediate triangulated category between the starting category and its completion.
  Our general treatment, when specialized to the case of schemes, immediately gives us Neeman's theorem as an application and significantly generalizes another remarkable theorem by Neeman about the equivalence of bounded $t$-structures on the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves. When specialized to other cases like associative rings, nonpositive DG-rings, connective $\mathbb{E}_1$-rings, triangulated categories without models, etc., we get many other applications. Under mild finiteness assumptions, these results not only give a categorical obstruction (the singularity category in our sense) to the existence of bounded $t$-structures on a triangulated category, but also provide plenty of triangulated categories on which all bounded $t$-structures are equivalent. The strategy used in our treatment is introducing a new concept of finitistic dimension for triangulated categories and lifting $t$-structures along completions of triangulated categories.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of composition series and the length of triangulated categories, and we study compositions series of derived categories of certain projective varieties and finite dimensional algebras. For example, we compute the length of the derived category ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(C)$ of a smooth projective curve $C$ and classify all finite length thick subcategories of ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(C)$. Furthermore, we prove that the derived categories of certain smooth projective varieties have composition series of different lengths. We also discuss the length of (1) derived categories of finite dimensional representations of Dynkin and extended Dynkin quivers, (2) derived categories of some singular varieties and (3) Krah's phantom subcategories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. We find the formulas for the highest weight vectors in coset decomposition and calculate their norms. We also derive formulas for matrix elements of natural vertex operators between these vectors. This leads to relations on conformal blocks. Due to the AGT correspondence, these relations are equivalent to blowup relations on Nekrasov partition functions with the presence of the surface defect. These relations can be used to prove Kyiv formulas for the Painlev\'e tau-functions (following Nekrasov's method).</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number, $K$ a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $n$ an integer $\geq 2$. We completely and explicitly describe the global sections $\Omega^\bullet$ of the de Rham complex of the Drinfeld space over $K$ in dimension $n-1$ as a complex of (duals of) locally $K$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$. Using this description, we construct an explicit section in the derived category of (duals of) finite length admissible locally $K$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ to the canonical morphism of complexes $\Omega^\bullet \twoheadrightarrow H^{n-1}(\Omega^\bullet)[-(n-1)]$.</description>
