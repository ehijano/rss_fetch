      <title>Hopfions of massive gauge bosons in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a novel model that characterizes the curvature of space-time, influenced by a massive gauge field in the early universe. This curvature can lead to a multitude of observations, including the Hubble tension issue and the isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background. We introduce, for the first time, the concept of gauge field Hopfions, which exist in the space-time. We further investigate how hopfions can influence Hubble parameter values. Our findings open the door to utilizing hopfions as a topological source which links both gravitation and the gauge field.</description>

      <title>Lower tensor-to-scalar ratio as possible signature of modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper simplifies the induced four-dimensional gravitational equations originating from a five-dimensional bulk within the framework of Nash's embeddings, incorporating them into a well-known $\mu-\Sigma$ modified gravity (MG) parametrization. By leveraging data from Planck Public Release 4 (PR4), BICEP/Keck Array 2018, Planck cosmic microwave background lensing, and baryon acoustic oscillation observations, we establish a stringent lower limit for the tensor-to-scalar ratio parameter: $r &lt; 0.0303$ at a confidence level (CL) of 95\%. This finding suggests the presence of extrinsic dynamics influencing standard four-dimensional cosmology. Notably, this limit surpasses those typically obtained through Bayesian analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, which yield $r&lt;0.038$, or through the frequentist profile likelihood method, which yields $r&lt;0.037$ at 95\% CL.</description>

      <title>Probing minihalo lenses with diffracted gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When gravitational waves pass near a gravitating object, they are deflected, or lensed. If the object is massive, such that the wavelength of the waves is small compared to its gravitational size, lensed gravitational wave events can be identified when multiple signals are detected at different times. However, when the wavelength is long, wave-optics diffraction effects will be important, and a lensed event can be identified by looking for frequency-dependent modulations to the gravitational waveform, without having to associate multiple signals. For current ground-based gravitational wave detectors observing stellar-mass binary compact object mergers, wave-optics effects are important for lenses with masses $\lesssim 1000 M_{\odot}$. Therefore, minihalos below this mass range could potentially be identified by lensing diffraction. The challenge with analyzing these events is that the frequency-dependent lensing modulation, or the amplification factor, is prohibitively expensive to compute for Bayesian parameter inference. In this work, we use a novel time-domain method to construct interpolators of the amplification factor for the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), generalized singular isothermal sphere (gSIS) and cored isothermal sphere (CIS) lens models. Using these interpolators, we perform Bayesian inference on gravitational-wave signals lensed by minihalos injected in mock detector noise, assuming current sensitivity of ground-based detectors. We find that we could potentially identify an event when it is lensed by minihalos and extract the values of all lens parameters in addition to the parameters of the GW source. All of the methods are implemented in Glworia, the accompanying open-source Python package, and can be generalized to study lensed signals detected by current and next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Higher memory effects and the post-Newtonian calculation of their gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new hierarchy of lasting gravitational-wave effects (the higher memory effects) was recently identified in asymptotically flat spacetimes, with the better-known displacement, spin, and center-of-mass memory effects included as the lowest two orders in the set of these effects. These gravitational-wave observables are determined by a set of temporal moments of the news tensor, which describes gravitational radiation from an isolated source. The moments of the news can be expressed in terms of changes in charge-like expressions and integrals over retarded time of flux-like terms, some of which vanish in the absence of radiation. In this paper, we compute expressions for the flux-like contributions to the moments of the news in terms of a set of multipoles that characterize the gravitational-wave strain. We also identify a part of the strain that gives rise to these moments of the news. In the context of post-Newtonian theory, we show that the strain related to the moments of the news is responsible for the many nonlinear, instantaneous terms and "memory" terms that appear in the post-Newtonian expressions for the radiative multipole moments of the strain. We also apply our results to compute the leading post-Newtonian expressions for the moments of the news and the corresponding strains that are generated during the inspiral of compact binary sources. These results provide a new viewpoint on the waveforms computed from the multipolar post-Minkowski formalism, and they could be used to assess the detection prospects of this new class of higher memory effects.</description>

      <title>General vacuum solution of modified $F(G)$-gravity with Gauss-Bonnet term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a general vacuum solution of the modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity equations for the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric. We use an ansatz to reduce the gravitational equations to an ordinary differential equations for function $F=F(G)$. The solution obtained depends on an arbitrary function and is new. As an example we take an arbitrary function in the form of a power one and analyze the solutions for both $ F(G) $ and the main cosmological physical quantities as scale factor, Hubble rate, the Gauss-Bonnet term and the scalar curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The action of an ideal fluid in Euler variables with a variable number of particles is used for the phenomenological description of the processes of particle creation in strong external fields. It has been demonstrated that the conformal invariance of the creation law imposes quite strict restrictions on the possible types of sources. It is shown that combinations with the particle number density in the creation law can be interpreted as dark matter within the framework of this model.</description>

      <title>Motion of spinning particles around a polymer black hole in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the curved spacetime background, the trajectory of a spinning test particle will deviate from the geodesic. Using the effective potential method, we study the motion of a spinning test particle on the equatorial plane of a polymer black hole in loop quantum gravity described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations with minimal spin-gravity interaction. We find that for the bounded orbits in the radial direction, the particle's motion is timelike when its spin is small. The radial range of the orbit and its eccentricity decrease with the loop quantum gravity parameter. However, when the particle takes a large enough spin, we observe an interesting phenomenon that the timelike and spacelike motions alternately appear while are separated by a critical radius. Outside the critical radius, the motion is timelike, however inside it is spacelike, and on the radius $r_c$ it is null. To explore more observable effects of the loop quantum gravity parameter on the motion of the spinning particle, we focus our attention on the circular orbits, particularly the innermost stable circular orbits, near the black hole. The result shows that for the same spin, there are two different innermost stable circular orbits, one with a larger radius and the other with a smaller radius. Both the radii decrease as the loop quantum gravity parameter increases. More significantly, with the increase of the spin of the particle, the small innermost stable circular orbit transition from timelike to spacelike, while the one with large radius does not. Instead, it terminates at a certain value of spin. All the results present the significant influences of the loop quantum gravity parameter on the motion of the spinning particles.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical Topology of Quantum BTZ Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the study of black hole thermodynamics, topology offers a novel approach and perspective for classifying black hole systems. In this work, we explore the thermodynamical topology of the quantum BTZ black hole by employing the concept of the generalized free energy. To fully characterize the thermodynamics, we introduce two distinct topological numbers. The first one is determined by an expression, denoted by $z$, derived from the free energy. Although it can provide us with some local physical explanations, sufficient physical significance still lacks from a global perspective. On the other hand, the second topological number is based on the entropy expression of the generalized free energy, leading to a more meaningful interpretation of its physical implications. This result highlights the natural choice of entropy as the domain variable for the generalized free energy. Regarding the second topological number, our analysis reveals a topological transition that is associated with the thermodynamical stability of the ``cold" black hole state of the quantum BTZ black hole. Furthermore, our study suggests the existence of topological numbers beyond the conventional values of $\pm 1,0$.</description>

      <title>Probing modified Hawking evaporation with gravitational waves from the primordial black hole dominated universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that Hawking evaporation might slow down after a black hole has lost about half of its mass. Such an effect, called "memory burden", is parameterized as a suppression in the mass loss rate by negative powers $n$ of the black hole entropy and could considerably extend the lifetime of a black hole. We study the impact of memory burden on the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario. Modified PBH evaporation leads to a significantly longer PBH dominated stage. Requiring that PBHs evaporate prior enough to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis shrinks the allowed PBH mass range. Indeed, we find that for $n&gt;2.5$ the PBH reheating scenario is not viable. The frequency of the Gravitational Waves (GWs) induced by PBH number density fluctuations is bound to be larger than about a Hz, while the amplitude of the GW spectrum is enhanced due to the longer PBH dominated phase. Interestingly, we show that, in some models, the slope of the induced GW spectrum might be sensitive to the modifications to Hawking evaporation, proving it may be possible to test the "memory burden" effect via induced GWs. Lastly, we argue that our results could also apply to general modifications of Hawking evaporation.</description>

      <title>Shadows and Properties of Spin-Induced Scalarized Black Holes with and without a Ricci Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the properties and shadows of spin-induced scalarized black holes, as well as investigate how a Ricci coupling influences them. Our findings reveal significant deviations from the Kerr metric in terms of the location and geodesic frequencies of the innermost stable circular orbit and light ring, with the former exhibiting more pronounced disparities. The shadows of scalarized black holes exhibit relatively minor deviations when compared to those of Kerr black holes with the same mass and spin. Overall, the presence of a Ricci coupling is observed to mitigate deviations from the Kerr metric.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the Dirac equation in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime upon the comformally flat spacetime. We also apply the analysis to the Majorana condition. The analytical solutions are neat. We observe that Dirac fermions and Majorana fermions behave differently in AdS background. The wavefunction of tachyonic neutrinos leaves an track, clumping in a special flatland, embedded in the curved 3+1-D AdS spacetime. Besides, there emerges a boundary, and neutrinos also oscillate.</description>

      <title>Testing Tachyon-Dominated Cosmology with Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An open or hyperbolic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime dominated by tachyonic dark matter can exhibit an ``inflected'' expansion -- initially decelerating, later accelerating -- similar but not identical to that of now-standard $\Lambda$CDM models dominated by dark energy. The features of the tachyonic model can be extracted by fitting the redshift-distance relation of the model to data obtained by treating Type Ia supernovae as standard candles. Here such a model is fitted to samples of 186 and 1048 Type Ia supernovae from the literature. The fits yield values of $H_0=(66.6\pm1.5)~\hbox{km/s/Mpc}$ and $H_0=(69.6\pm0.4)~\hbox{km/s/Mpc}$, respectively, for the current-time Hubble parameter, and $t_0=(8.35\pm0.68)~\hbox{Gyr}$ and $t_0=(8.15\pm0.36)~\hbox{Gyr}$, respectively, for the comoving-time age of the Universe. Tests of the model against other observations will be undertaken in subsequent works.</description>

      <title>On scrambling, tomperature and superdiffusion in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates basic properties of the de Sitter static patch using simple two-point functions in the probe approximation. We find that de Sitter equilibrates in a superdiffusive manner, unlike most physical systems which equilibrate diffusively. We also examine the scrambling time. In de Sitter, the two-point functions of free fields do not decay for sometime because quanta can reflect off the pole of the static patch. This suggests a minimum scrambling time of the order $\log(1/G_N)$, even for perturbations introduced on the stretched horizon, indicating fast scrambling inside de Sitter static patch. We also discuss the interplay between thermodynamic temperature and inverse correlation time, sometimes called "tomperature".</description>

      <title>The Quantum Theory Of Gravitation, Effective Field Theories, and Strings: Yesterday And Today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the effective field theory perspective on modern physics through the lens of the quantum theory of gravitational interaction. The historical part argues that the search for a theory of quantum gravity stimulated the change in outlook that characterizes the modern approach to the Standard Model of particle physics and General Relativity. We present some landmarks covering a long period, i.e., from the beginning of the 1930s until 1994, when, according to Steven Weinberg, the modern bottom-up approach to General Relativity began. Starting from the first attempt to apply the quantum field theory techniques to perturbatively quantize Einstein's theory, we explore its developments and interaction with the top-down approach encoded by String Theory. In the last part of the paper, we focus on this last approach to describe the relationship between our modern understanding of String Theory and Effective Field Theory in today's panorama. To this end, the non-historical part briefly explains the modern concepts of moduli stabilization and Swampland to understand another change in focus that explains the present framework where some string theorists move.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive data-driven odyssey to explore the equation of state of dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the dark energy equation of the state parameter without tying ourselves to any specific cosmological model or parametrization except spatial homogeneity, isotropy, and flatness leading to a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Instead, we rely on actual observational data to guide our analysis. This is the first study in which we combine the cosmological background and the growth observations to reconstruct the equation of the state parameter of dark energy independent of the present values of the matter-energy density parameter and Hubble parameter. We use information about the Hubble parameter from cosmic chronometer data and the growth rate from observations related to growth rates. Our method involves a posterior approach of Gaussian process regression analysis to figure out the Hubble parameter and growth rate, plus their changes with redshift. The significant shift of paradigm in this study lies in the independence of the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state from any prior knowledge of the present Hubble parameter and matter energy density parameter. We find a slight hint of dynamical behavior in dark energy. However, the evidence is not significant. We also find a leaning towards non-phantom behavior over phantom behavior. Intriguingly, we observe that the $\Lambda$CDM model nearly touches the lower boundary of the 1$\sigma$ confidence region for the reconstructed dark energy equation of state parameter in the redshift range $0.6 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.85$. However, it comfortably resides within the 1$\sigma$ confidence region in the redshift range under investigation, $0\leq z \leq 1.5$. Consequently, the non-parametric, model-independent reconstruction of dark energy provides no compelling evidence to deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM model when considering cosmic chronometer and growth rate observations.</description>

Abstract: Many previous studies have explored models of dynamically interacting dark energy scenarios instead of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter. This work aims to offer a comprehensive investigation of the Yukawa-type interaction between dark energy and dark matter where dark matter mass is also a function of a dynamical scalar field value. Unlike previous work, instead of taking an approximate solution, we numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation that governs the intricate interplay between these two components of the dark sector along with the corresponding perturbations, using a suitable shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions. We have conducted a thorough analysis of this interaction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating diverse datasets such as Planck, BAO, Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results, for the first time, reveal a discernible detection of the coupling constant, which encapsulates the strength of the dark sector interaction. We find non-zero $\beta$ values of 0.0487, 0.0680, 0.0712, and 0.0822 ($68\%$ Confidence Limit) corresponding to the inclusion of each dataset, respectively. Notably, the addition of SH$_0$ES data led to a significant increase in the prominence of $\beta$, suggesting the potential for new physics in the dark sector. This study serves as a strategic road map for future endeavours with non-linear cosmology, which will contribute to an enhanced understanding and refinement of constraints on the dark sector interaction.</description>

      <title>Probing Primordial Black Holes and Dark Matter Clumps in the Solar System with Gravimeter and GNSS Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and gravimeters on Earth and in space can potentially offer the most accurate direct measurement of local density of near-Earth asteroid-mass Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and Dark Matter (DM) clumps in the solar system by means of gravitational influence. Using semi-analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulation, this paper revisits the analysis of the trajectories of DM clumps in the solar system, including both captured objects and hyperbolic trajectories. A link is thus made between the frequency and distance of Earth overflights for a given mass flux, and a direct measure of dark matter clump density in the solar system. We then model the signature of a close flyby of a DM object on orbital data from GNSS satellites and gravity measurements from gravimeters. We thus obtain a first assessment of the single probe sensitivity. It paves the way for an exhaustive statistical analysis of 28 years of gravimeters and GNSS data to obtain observational constraints on the density of the PBHs and DM clumps within the solar system, for the mass range $[10^8-10^{17}]$ kg. In addition, our methodology offers a possibility of direct detection in cases where DM clumps are endowed with an additional long-range clump-matter fifth-force beyond gravity.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of static vacuum asymptotically flat black holes and equipotential photon surfaces in $n+1$ dimensions \`a la Robinson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize to higher dimensions Robinson's approach to proving the uniqueness of connected $(3+1)$-dimensional static vacuum asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes. In consequence, we prove geometric inequalities for connected $(n+1)$-dimensional static vacuum asymptotically flat black holes, recovering results by Agostiniani and Mazzieri. We also obtain similar geometric inequalities for connected $(n+1)$-dimensional static vacuum asymptotically flat equipotential photon surfaces and in particular photon spheres. Assuming a natural upper bound on the total scalar curvature, we recover the well-known uniqueness results for such black holes and equipotential photon surfaces. We also extend the known equipotential photon surface uniqueness results to spacetimes with negative mass. In order to replace the role of the Cotton tensor in Robinson's proof, we introduce techniques inspired by the analysis of Ricci solitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The in-in formalism provides a way to systematically organize the calculation of primordial correlation functions. Although its theoretical foundations are now firmly settled, the treatment of total time derivative interactions, incorrectly trivialized as ``boundary terms'', has been the subject of intense discussions and conceptual mistakes. In this work, we demystify the use of total time derivatives -- as well as terms proportional to the linear equations of motion -- and show that they can lead to artificially large contributions cancelling at different orders of the in-in operator formalism. We discuss the treatment of total time derivative interactions in the Lagrangian path integral formulation of the in-in perturbation theory, and we showcase the importance of interaction terms proportional to linear equations of motion. We then provide a new route to the calculation of primordial correlation functions, which avoids the generation of total time derivatives, by working directly at the level of the full Hamiltonian in terms of phase-space variables. Instead of integrating by parts, we perform canonical transformations to simplify interactions. We explain how to retrieve correlation functions of the initial phase-space variables from the knowledge of the ones after canonical transformations, and we provide diagrammatic rules to systematically classify all possible contributions. As an important first application, we find the explicit sizes of Hamiltonian cubic interactions in single-field inflation with canonical kinetic terms and for any background evolution [...]. Our results are important for performing complete calculations of exchange diagrams in inflation [...]. Being already written in a form amenable to characterize quantum properties of primordial fluctuations, they also promise to shed light on the non-linear dynamics of quantum states during inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1512.08755v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the fundamental thermodynamic equation for Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein quantum gases, which contains the first order contribution due to the quantum nature of the gas particles. Then, we analyze the fundamental equation in the context of geometrothermodynamics. Although the corresponding Hamiltonian does not contain a potential, indicating the lack of classical thermodynamic interaction, we show that the curvature of the equilibrium space is non-zero and can be interpreted as a measure of the effective quantum interaction between the gas particles. In the limiting case of a classical Boltzmann gas, we show that the equilibrium space becomes flat, as expected from the physical viewpoint. In addition, we derive a thermodynamic fundamental equation for the Bose-Einstein condensation and, using the Ehrenfest scheme, we show that it can be considered as a first order phase transition which in the equilibrium space corresponds to a curvature singularity. This result indicates that the curvature of the equilibrium space can be used to measure in an invariant way the thermodynamic interaction in classical and quantum ideal gases.</description>

      <title>Induced cosmological anisotropy by a gauge-gravity interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple model which generates cosmological anisotropies on top of standard FLRW geometry. This is in some sense reminiscent of the mean field approximation, where the mean field cosmological model under consideration would be the standard FLRW, and the anisotropy is a small perturbative correction on top of it. Using a supergravity-inspired model, we confirm that the stable fixed point of our model corresponds to standard FLRW cosmology. We use a Bianchi VII$_0$-type model supplemented with a scalar and $U(1)$ gauge fields, and we show that the anisotropies of the geometry are generated by the non-trivial interaction between the gravity sector and the $U(1)$ gauge sector. Studying the attractor flow, we show that the anisotropies are present at early times (high redshift) and decay asymptotically to an FLRW attractor fixed point. With such a mechanism, observations of non-isotropy are not contradictory to FLRW geometry or indeed the $\Lambda$CDM model. Such models could in principle shed some insights on the present cosmological tensions.</description>

Abstract: The prospect of unprecedented high-quality data of gravitational waves in the upcoming decades demands a theoretical effort to optimally study and analyze the signals that next generation detectors will provide. Here we study the gravitational wave emission and related dynamics during the inspiralling phase of the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem, a modification of the conventional binary scenario in which a small third object co-rotates with the parent binary system. Specifically, we obtain analytic expressions for the emitted power, frequency variation and other dynamical variables that describe the evolution of the system. As a key highlight, we find that the presence of the third body actually slows down the coalescence of the binary, which can be partially interpreted as an effective rescaling of the binary's chirp-mass. Our analysis assumes semi-Keplerian orbits for the particles and a highly mass asymmetric parent binary needed for the stability of orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In semiclassical gravity, the vacuum expectation value ${\langle\hat{N}\rangle}$ of the particle number operator for a quantum field gives rise to the perception of thermal radiation in the vicinity of a black hole. This Hawking effect has been examined only for observers asymptotically far from a Kerr black hole; here we generalize the analysis to various classes of freely falling observers both outside and inside the Kerr event horizon. Of note, we find that the effective temperature of the ${\langle\hat{N}\rangle}$ distribution remains regular for observers at the event horizon but becomes negative and divergent for observers reaching the inner Cauchy horizon. Furthermore, the perception of Hawking radiation varies greatly for different classes of observers, though the spectrum is generally a graybody that decreases in intensity with black hole spin and increases in temperature when looking toward the edges of the black hole shadow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The imprint of interacting dark energy (IDE) needs to be correctly identified in order to avoid bias in constraints on IDE. This paper investigates the large-scale imprint of IDE in redshift space distortions, using $Euclid$-like photometric prescriptions. A first attempt at incorporating the IDE dynamics in the galaxy (clustering and evolution) biases is made. Without IDE dynamics taken into account in the galaxy biases, as is conventionally done, the results suggest that for a constant dark energy equation of state parameter, an IDE model where the dark energy transfer rate is proportional to the dark energy density exhibits an alternating, positive-negative effect in the redshift space distortions angular power spectrum. However, when the IDE dynamics is incorporated in the galaxy biases, it is found that the apparent positive-negative alternating effect vanishes: implying that neglecting IDE dynamics in the galaxy biases can result in ''artefacts'' that can lead to incorrect identification of the IDE imprint. In general, the results show that multi-tracer analysis will be needed to beat down cosmic variance in order for the redshift space distortions angular power spectrum as a statistic to be a viable diagnostic of IDE. Moreover, it is found that redshift space distortions hold the potential to constrain IDE on large scales, at redshifts $z \,{\leq}\, 1$; with the scenario having IDE dynamics incorporated in the biases showing better potential.</description>

Abstract: We study the effects of conservation laws on wormholes that are made traversable by a double trace deformation. After coupling the two asymptotic boundaries of a maximally extended $(d+1)$ dimensional black brane geometry with $U(1)$ conserved current operators, we find that the quantum matter stress-energy tensor of the corresponding bulk gauge fields in the hydrodynamic limit violates the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), rendering the wormhole traversable. Applying our results to axionic two-sided black hole solutions, we discuss how the wormhole opening depends on the charge diffusion constant, how this affects the amount of information that can be sent through the wormhole, and possible implications for many-body quantum teleportation protocols involving conserved current operators.</description>

      <title>Negative Dark Energy Density from High Redshift Pantheon+ Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) framework, the Hubble constant $H_0$ is an integration constant. Thus, consistency of the model demands observational constancy of $H_0$. We demonstrate redshift evolution of best fit $\Lambda$CDM parameters $(H_0, \Omega_{m})$ in Pantheon+ supernove (SNe). Redshift evolution of best fit cosmological parameters is a prerequisite to finding a statistically significant evolution as well as identifying alternative models that are competitive with $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. To assess statistical significance, we employ three different methods: i) Bayesian model comparison, ii) mock simulations and iii) profile distributions. The first shows a marginal preference for the vanilla $\Lambda$CDM model over an ad hoc model with 3 additional parameters and an unphysical jump in cosmological parameters at $z=1$. From mock simulations, we estimate the statistical significance of redshift evolution of best fit parameters and negative dark energy density ($\Omega_m &gt; 1$) to be in the $1-2 \sigma$ range, depending on the criteria employed. Importantly, in direct comparison to the same analysis with the earlier Pantheon sample we find that statistical significance of redshift evolution of best fit parameters has increased, as expected for a physical effect. Our profile distribution analysis demonstrates a shift in $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ in excess of $95\%$ confidence level for SNe with redshifts $z &gt; 1$ and also shows that a degeneracy in MCMC posteriors is not equivalent to a curve of constant $\chi^2$. Our findings can be interpreted as a statistical fluctuation or unexplored systematics in Pantheon+ or $\Lambda$CDM model breakdown. The first two possibilities are disfavoured by similar trends in independent probes.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Dark Matter and Secondary Gravitational Waves from Warm Higgs-G Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of dissipative effects during warm inflation leading to the small-scale enhancement of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations. In this paper, we specifically focus on non-canonical warm inflationary scenarios and study a model of warm Higgs-G inflation, in which the Standard Model Higgs boson drives inflation, with a Galileon-like non-linear kinetic term. We show that in the Galileon-dominated regime, the primordial power spectrum is strongly enhanced, leading to the formation of primordial black holes (PBH) with a wide range of the mass spectrum. Interestingly, PBHs in the asteroid mass window $\sim (10^{17}$ -- $10^{23}$) g are generated in this model, which can explain the total abundance of the dark matter in the Universe. In our analysis, we also calculate the secondary gravitational waves (GW) sourced by these small-scale overdense fluctuations and find that the induced GW spectrum can be detected in the future GW detectors, such as LISA, BBO, DECIGO, etc. Our scenario thus provides a novel way of generating PBHs as dark matter and a detectable stochastic GW background from warm inflation. We also show that our scenario is consistent with the swampland and the trans-Planckian censorship conjectures and, thus, remains in the viable landscape of UV complete theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the Starobinsky model of inflation. We derive solutions for various cosmological observables, such as the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and their runnings, as well as the number of $e$-folds of inflation, reheating, and radiation with minimal assumptions. We establish an equation that connects inflation and reheating, which can be solved for the spectral index $n_s$. Using consistency relations of the model, we determine the other observables, the number of $e$-folds during inflation $N_k$, and the number of $e$-folds during reheating $N_{re}$. The impact of reheating on inflation is explored by constraining the equation of state parameter $\omega_{re}$ at the end of reheating. We find remarkable agreement between the Starobinsky model and current measurements of the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations and the present bounds on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: The memory effect in electrodynamics, as discovered in 1981 by Staruszkiewicz, and also analysed later, consists of adiabatic shift of the position of a test particle. The proposed 'velocity kick' memory effect, supposedly discovered recently, is in contradiction to these findings. We show that the 'velocity kick' memory is an artefact resulting from an unjustified interchange of limits. This example is a warning against drawing uncritical conclusions for spacetime fields, from their asymptotic behavior.</description>

Abstract: Current observations do not rule out the possibility that the Universe might end up in an abrupt event. Different such scenarios may be explored through suitable parameterizations of the dark energy and then confronted to cosmological background data. Here we parameterize a pseudorip scenario using a particular sigmoid function and carry an in-depth multifaceted examination of its evolutionary features and statistical performance. This depiction of a non violent final fate of our cosmos seems to be arguably statistically favoured over the consensus {\Lambda}CDM model according to some Bayesian discriminators.</description>

      <title>On Some Quantum Correction to the Coulomb Potential in Generalized Uncertainty Principle Approach</title>

Abstract: Taking into account the importance of the unified theory of quantum mechanics and gravity, and the existence of a minimal length of the order of the Planck scale, we consider a modified Schr\"odinger equation resulting from a generalized uncertainty principle, which finds applications from the realm of quantum information to large-scale physics, with a quantum mechanically corrected gravitational interaction proposed very recently. As the resulting equation cannot be solved by common exact approaches, we propose a Bethe ansatz approach, which will be applied and whose results we will discuss, commenting on the analogy of the present study with some other interesting physical problems.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Horndeski Gravity under Positivity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13096</link>

Abstract: A set of conditions that any effective field theory needs to satisfy in order to allow for the existence of a viable UV completion has recently gained attention in the cosmological context under the name of $\textit{positivity bounds}$. In this paper we revisit the derivation of such bounds for Horndeski gravity and translate them into a complete set of viability conditions in the language of effective field theory of dark energy. We implement the latter into $\texttt{EFTCAMB}$ and explore the large scale structure phenomenology of Horndeski gravity under positivity bounds. We build a statistically significant sample of viable Horndeski models, and derive the corresponding predictions for the background evolution, in terms of $w_{\rm DE}$, and the dynamics of linear perturbations, in terms of the phenomenological functions $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, associated to clustering and weak lensing, respectively. We find that the addition of positivity bounds to the traditional no-ghost and no-gradient conditions considerably tightens the theoretical constraints on all these functions. The most significant feature is a strengthening of the correlation $\mu\simeq\Sigma$, and a related tight constraint on the luminal speed of gravitational waves $c^2_T\simeq1$. In anticipation of a more complete formulation of positivity conditions in cosmology, this work demonstrates the strong potential of such bounds in shaping the viable parameter space of scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Towards complexity in de Sitter space from the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we define complexity in dS space from microscopic principles? Based on recent developments pointing towards a correspondence between a pair of double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) models/ 2D Liouville-de Sitter (LdS$_2$) field theory/ 3D Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS$_3$) space in arXiv:2310.16994, arXiv:2402.00635, arXiv:2402.02584, we study concrete complexity proposals in the microscopic models and their dual descriptions. First, we examine the spread complexity of the maximal entropy state of the doubled DSSYK model. We show that it counts the number of entangled chord states in its doubled Hilbert space. We interpret spread complexity in terms of a time difference between antipodal observers in SdS$_3$ space, and a boundary time difference of the dual LdS$_2$ CFTs. This provides a new connection between entanglement and geometry in dS space. Second, Krylov complexity, which describes operator growth, is computed for physical operators on all sides of the correspondence. Their late time evolution behaves as expected for chaotic systems. Later, we define the query complexity in the LdS$_2$ model as the number of steps in an algorithm computing n-point correlation functions of boundary operators of the corresponding antipodal points in SdS$_3$ space. We interpret query complexity as the number of matter operator chord insertions in a cylinder amplitude in the DSSYK, and the number of junctions of Wilson lines between antipodal static patch observers in SdS$_3$ space. Finally, we evaluate a specific proposal of Nielsen complexity for the DSSYK model and comment on its possible dual manifestations.</description>
