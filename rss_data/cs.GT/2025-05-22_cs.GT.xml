      <title>Adaptive Honeypot Allocation in Multi-Attacker Networks via Bayesian Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defending against sophisticated cyber threats demands strategic allocation of limited security resources across complex network infrastructures. When the defender has limited defensive resources, the complexity of coordinating honeypot placements across hundreds of nodes grows exponentially. In this paper, we present a multi-attacker Bayesian Stackelberg framework modeling concurrent adversaries attempting to breach a directed network of system components. Our approach uniquely characterizes each adversary through distinct target preferences, exploit capabilities, and associated costs, while enabling defenders to strategically deploy honeypots at critical network positions. By integrating a multi-follower Stackelberg formulation with dynamic Bayesian belief updates, our framework allows defenders to continuously refine their understanding of attacker intentions based on actions detected through Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Experimental results show that the proposed method prevents attack success within a few rounds and scales well up to networks of 500 nodes with more than 1,500 edges, maintaining tractable run times.</description>

      <title>A Non-Zero-Sum Game Model for Optimal Cyber Defense Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the contemporary digital landscape, cybersecurity has become a critical issue due to the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks. This study utilizes a non-zero-sum game theoretical framework to model the strategic interactions between cyber attackers and defenders, with the objective of identifying optimal strategies for both. By defining precise payoff functions that incorporate the probabilities and costs associated with various exploits, as well as the values of network nodes and the costs of deploying honeypots, we derive Nash equilibria that inform strategic decisions. The proposed model is validated through extensive simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing network security. Our results indicate that high-probability, low-cost exploits like Phishing and Social Engineering are more likely to be used by attackers, necessitating prioritized defense mechanisms. Our findings also show that increasing the number of network nodes dilutes the attacker's efforts, thereby improving the defender's payoff. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing resource allocation for cybersecurity and highlights the scalability and practical applicability of the game-theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>Multi-Unit Combinatorial Prophet Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a combinatorial auction setting where buyers have fractionally subadditive (XOS) valuations over the items and the seller's objective is to maximize the social welfare. A prophet inequality in this setting bounds the competitive ratio of sequential allocation (often using item pricing) against the hindsight optimum. We study the dependence of the competitive ratio on the number of copies, $k$, of each item.
  We show that the multi-unit combinatorial setting is strictly harder than its single-item counterpart in that there is a gap between the competitive ratios achieved by static item pricings in the two settings. However, if the seller is allowed to change item prices dynamically, it becomes possible to asymptotically match the competitive ratio of a single-item static pricing. We also develop a new non-adaptive anonymous multi-unit combinatorial prophet inequality where the item prices are determined up front but increase as the item supply decreases. Setting the item prices in our prophet inequality requires minimal information about the buyers' value distributions -- merely (an estimate of) the expected social welfare accrued by each item in the hindsight optimal solution suffices. Our non-adaptive pricing achieves a competitive ratio that increases strictly as a function of the item supply $k$.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Voting Design Vulnerabilities for Retroactive Funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) rewards blockchain projects based on proven impact rather than future promises. This paper reviews voting mechanisms for Optimism's RetroPGF, where "badgeholders" allocate rewards to valuable projects. We explore Optimism's previous schemes for RetroPGF voting, including quadratic, mean, and median voting. We present a proof-based formal analysis for vulnerabilities in these voting schemes, empirically validate these vulnerabilities using voting simulations, and offer assessments and practical recommendations for future iterations of Optimism's system based on our findings.</description>

      <title>Persuasive Prediction via Decision Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian persuasion, a central model in information design, studies how a sender, who privately observes a state drawn from a prior distribution, strategically sends a signal to influence a receiver's action. A key assumption is that both sender and receiver share the precise knowledge of the prior. Although this prior can be estimated from past data, such assumptions break down in high-dimensional or infinite state spaces, where learning an accurate prior may require a prohibitive amount of data. In this paper, we study a learning-based variant of persuasion, which we term persuasive prediction. This setting mirrors Bayesian persuasion with large state spaces, but crucially does not assume a common prior: the sender observes covariates $X$, learns to predict a payoff-relevant outcome $Y$ from past data, and releases a prediction to influence a population of receivers.
  To model rational receiver behavior without a common prior, we adopt a learnable proxy: decision calibration, which requires the prediction to be unbiased conditioned on the receiver's best response to the prediction. This condition guarantees that myopically responding to the prediction yields no swap regret. Assuming the receivers best respond to decision-calibrated predictors, we design a computationally and statistically efficient algorithm that learns a decision-calibrated predictor within a randomized predictor class that optimizes the sender's utility. In the commonly studied single-receiver case, our method matches the utility of a Bayesian sender who has full knowledge of the underlying prior distribution. Finally, we extend our algorithmic result to a setting where receivers respond stochastically to predictions and the sender may randomize over an infinite predictor class.</description>

      <title>Strategic Content Creation in the Age of GenAI: To Share or Not to Share?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a game-theoretic framework examining strategic interactions between a platform and its content creators in the presence of AI-generated content. Our model's main novelty is in capturing creators' dual strategic decisions: The investment in content quality and their (possible) consent to share their content with the platform's GenAI, both of which significantly impact their utility. To incentivize creators, the platform strategically allocates a portion of its GenAI-driven revenue to creators who share their content. We focus on the class of full-sharing equilibrium profiles, in which all creators willingly share their content with the platform's GenAI system. Such equilibria are highly desirable both theoretically and practically. Our main technical contribution is formulating and efficiently solving a novel optimization problem that approximates the platform's optimal revenue subject to inducing a full-sharing equilibrium. A key aspect of our approach is identifying conditions under which full-sharing equilibria exist and a surprising connection to the Prisoner's Dilemma. Finally, our simulations demonstrate how revenue-allocation mechanisms affect creator utility and the platform's revenue.</description>

      <title>Modeling Inequality in Complex Networks of Strategic Agents using Iterative Game-Theoretic Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transactions are an important aspect of human social life, and represent dynamic flow of information, intangible values, such as trust, as well as monetary and social capital. Although much research has been conducted on the nature of transactions in fields ranging from the social sciences to game theory, the systemic effects of different types of agents transacting in real-world social networks (often following a scale-free distribution) are not fully understood. A particular systemic measure that has not received adequate attention in the complex networks and game theory communities, is the Gini Coefficient, which is widely used in economics to quantify and understand wealth inequality. In part, the problem is a lack of experimentation using a replicable algorithm and publicly available data. Motivated by this problem, this article proposes a model and simulation algorithm, based on game theory, for quantifying the evolution of inequality in complex networks of strategic agents. Our results shed light on several complex drivers of inequality, even in simple, abstract settings, and exhibit consistency across networks with different origins and descriptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has emerged as a central issue in ML, and it has become standard practice to adjust ML algorithms so that they will satisfy fairness requirements such as Equal Opportunity. In this paper we consider the effects of adopting such fair classifiers on the overall level of ecosystem fairness. Specifically, we introduce the study of fairness with competing firms, and demonstrate the failure of fair classifiers in yielding fair ecosystems. Our results quantify the loss of fairness in systems, under a variety of conditions, based on classifiers' correlation and the level of their data overlap. We show that even if competing classifiers are individually fair, the ecosystem's outcome may be unfair; and that adjusting biased algorithms to improve their individual fairness may lead to an overall decline in ecosystem fairness. In addition to these theoretical results, we also provide supporting experimental evidence. Together, our model and results provide a novel and essential call for action.</description>

      <title>Serious Games: Human-AI Interaction, Evolution, and Coevolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The serious games between humans and AI have only just begun. Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) models the competitive and cooperative strategies of biological entities. EGT could help predict the potential evolutionary equilibrium of humans and AI. The objective of this work was to examine some of the EGT models relevant to human-AI interaction, evolution, and coevolution. Of thirteen EGT models considered, three were examined: the Hawk-Dove Game, Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, and the War of Attrition. This selection was based on the widespread acceptance and clear relevance of these models to potential human-AI evolutionary dynamics and coevolutionary trajectories. The Hawk-Dove Game predicts balanced mixed-strategy equilibria based on the costs of conflict. It also shows the potential for balanced coevolution rather than dominance. Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma suggests that repeated interaction may lead to cognitive coevolution. It demonstrates how memory and reciprocity can lead to cooperation. The War of Attrition suggests that competition for resources may result in strategic coevolution, asymmetric equilibria, and conventions on sharing resources. Therefore, EGT may provide a suitable framework to understand and predict the human-AI evolutionary dynamic. However, future research could extend beyond EGT and explore additional frameworks, empirical validation methods, and interdisciplinary perspectives. AI is being shaped by human input and is evolving in response to it. So too, neuroplasticity allows the human brain to grow and evolve in response to stimuli. If humans and AI converge in future, what might be the result of human neuroplasticity combined with an ever-evolving AI? Future research should be mindful of the ethical and cognitive implications of human-AI interaction, evolution, and coevolution.</description>

      <title>Contextual Learning for Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by stochastic optimization, we introduce the problem of learning from samples of contextual value distributions. A contextual value distribution can be understood as a family of real-valued distributions, where each sample consists of a context $x$ and a random variable drawn from the corresponding real-valued distribution $D_x$. By minimizing a convex surrogate loss, we learn an empirical distribution $D'_x$ for each context, ensuring a small L\'evy distance to $D_x$. We apply this result to obtain the sample complexity bounds for the learning of an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for stochastic optimization problems defined on an unknown contextual value distribution. The sample complexity is shown to be polynomial for the general case of strongly monotone and stable optimization problems, including Single-item Revenue Maximization, Pandora's Box and Optimal Stopping.</description>

      <title>iMLCA: Machine Learning-powered Iterative Combinatorial Auctions with Interval Bidding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.13605v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preference elicitation is a major challenge in large combinatorial auctions because the bundle space grows exponentially in the number of items. Recent work has used machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify a small set of bundles to query from each bidder. However, a shortcoming of this prior work is that bidders must submit exact values for the queried bundles, which can be quite costly. To address this, we propose iMLCA, a new ML-powered iterative combinatorial auction with interval bidding (i.e., where bidders submit upper and lower bounds instead of exact values). To steer the auction towards an efficient allocation, we introduce a price-based activity rule, asking bidders to tighten bounds on relevant bundles only. In our experiments, iMLCA achieves the same allocative efficiency as the prior ML-based auction that uses exact bidding. Moreover, it outperforms the well-known combinatorial clock auction in a realistically-sized domain.</description>

      <title>GLEE: A Unified Framework and Benchmark for Language-based Economic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in economic and strategic interactions, where communication via natural language is often prevalent. This raises key questions: Do LLMs behave rationally? How do they perform compared to humans? Do they tend to reach an efficient and fair outcome? What is the role of natural language in strategic interaction? How do characteristics of the economic environment influence these dynamics? These questions become crucial concerning the economic and societal implications of integrating LLM-based agents into real-world data-driven systems, such as online retail platforms and recommender systems. To answer these questions, we introduce a benchmark for standardizing research on two-player, sequential, language-based games. Inspired by the economic literature, we define three base families of games with consistent parameterization, degrees of freedom and economic measures to evaluate agents' performance (self-gain), as well as the game outcome (efficiency and fairness). We develop an open-source framework for interaction simulation and analysis, and utilize it to collect a dataset of LLM vs. LLM interactions across numerous game configurations and an additional dataset of human vs. LLM interactions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate how our framework and dataset can be used to: (i) compare the behavior of LLM-based agents in various economic contexts; (ii) evaluate agents in both individual and collective performance measures; and (iii) quantify the effect of the economic characteristics of the environments on the behavior of agents. Our results suggest that the market parameters, as well as the choice of the LLMs, tend to have complex and interdependent effects on the economic outcome, which calls for careful design and analysis of the language-based economic ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Timestamp Manipulation: Timestamp-based Nakamoto-style Blockchains are Vulnerable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nakamoto consensus are the most widely adopted decentralized consensus mechanism in cryptocurrency systems. Since it was proposed in 2008, many studies have focused on analyzing its security. Most of them focus on maximizing the profit of the adversary. Examples include the selfish mining attack [FC '14] and the recent riskless uncle maker (RUM) attack [CCS '23]. In this work, we introduce the Staircase-Unrestricted Uncle Maker (SUUM), the first block withholding attack targeting the timestamp-based Nakamoto-style blockchain. Through block withholding, timestamp manipulation, and difficulty risk control, SUUM adversaries are capable of launching persistent attacks with zero cost and minimal difficulty risk characteristics, indefinitely exploiting rewards from honest participants. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle that threatens the security of blockchains. We conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of SUUM, including the attack conditions, its impact on blockchains, and the difficulty risks. Finally, we further discuss four feasible mitigation measures against SUUM.</description>

      <title>Robust Online Learning with Private Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of online learning algorithms when learners possess private information. No-external-regret algorithms, prevalent in machine learning, are vulnerable to strategic manipulation, allowing an adaptive opponent to extract full surplus. Even standard no-weak-external-regret algorithms, designed for optimal learning in stationary environments, exhibit similar vulnerabilities. This raises a fundamental question: can a learner simultaneously prevent full surplus extraction by adaptive opponents while maintaining optimal performance in well-behaved environments? To address this, we model the problem as a two-player repeated game, where the learner with private information plays against the environment, facing ambiguity about the environment's types: stationary or adaptive. We introduce \emph{partial safety} as a key design criterion for online learning algorithms to prevent full surplus extraction. We then propose the \emph{Explore-Exploit-Punish} (\textsf{EEP}) algorithm and prove that it satisfies partial safety while achieving optimal learning in stationary environments, and has a variant that delivers improved welfare performance. Our findings highlight the risks of applying standard online learning algorithms in strategic settings with adverse selection. We advocate for a shift toward online learning algorithms that explicitly incorporate safeguards against strategic manipulation while ensuring strong learning performance.</description>
