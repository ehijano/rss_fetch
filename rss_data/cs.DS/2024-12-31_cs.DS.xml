      <title>Highway Dimension: a Metric View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic metric spaces (such as road/transportation networks) tend to be much more algorithmically tractable than general metrics. In an attempt to formalize this intuition, Abraham et al. (SODA 2010, JACM 2016) introduced the notion of highway dimension. A weighted graph $G$ has highway dimension $h$ if for every ball $B$ of radius $\approx 4r$ there is a hitting set of size $h$ hitting all the shortest paths of length $&gt;r$ in $B$. Unfortunately, this definition fails to incorporate some very natural metric spaces such as the grid graph, and the Euclidean plane.
  We relax the definition of highway dimension by demanding to hit only approximate shortest paths. In addition to generalizing the original definition, this new definition also incorporates all doubling spaces (in particular the grid graph and the Euclidean plane). We then construct a PTAS for TSP under this new definition (improving a QPTAS w.r.t. the original more restrictive definition of Feldmann et al. (SICOMP 2018)). Finally, we develop a basic metric toolkit for spaces with small highway dimension by constructing padded decompositions, sparse covers/partitions, and tree covers. An abundance of applications follow.</description>

      <title>Optimal rolling of fair dice using fair coins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1976, Knuth and Yao presented an algorithm for sampling from a finite distribution using flips of a fair coin that on average used the optimal number of flips. Here we show how to easily run their algorithm for the special case of rolling a fair die that uses memory linear in the input. Analysis of this algorithm yields a bound on the average number of coin flips needed that is slightly better than the original Knuth-Yao bound. This can then be extended to discrete distributions in a near optimal number of flips again using memory linear in the input.</description>

      <title>The Restricted Inverse Optimal Value Problem under Weighted Bottle-neck Hamming distance on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Restricted Inverse Optimal Value Problem (RIOVSP) on trees under weighted bottleneck Hamming distance, denoted as (RIOVSPT$_{BH}$). The problem aims to minimize the total cost under weighted bottle-neck Hamming distance such that the length of the shortest root-leaf path of the tree is lower-bounded by a given value by adjusting the length of some edges. Additionally, the specified lower bound must correspond to the length of a particular root-leaf path. Through careful analysis of the problem's structural properties, we develop an algorithm with $O(n\log n)$ time complexity to solve (RIOVSPT$_{BH}$). Furthermore, by removing the path-length constraint, we derive the Minimum Cost Shortest Path Interdiction Problem on Trees (MCSPIT), for which we present an $O(n\log n)$ time algorithm that operates under weighted bottleneck Hamming distance. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of both algorithms.</description>

      <title>How to Balance the Load Online When Jobs and Machines Are Both Selfish?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the classic optimization problem of Related Machine Online Load Balancing under the conditions of selfish machines and selfish jobs. We have $m$ related machines with varying speeds and $n$ jobs arriving online with different sizes. Our objective is to design an online truthful algorithm that minimizes the makespan while ensuring that jobs and machines report their true sizes and speeds.
  Previous studies in the online scenario have primarily focused on selfish jobs, beginning with the work of Aspnes et al. (JACM 1997). An $O(1)$-competitive online mechanism for selfish jobs was discovered by Feldman, Fiat, and Roytman (EC 2017). For selfish machines, truthful mechanisms have only been explored in offline settings, starting with Archer and Tardos (FOCS 2001). The best-known results are two PTAS mechanisms by Christodoulou and Kov\'{a}cs (SICOMP 2013) and Epstein et al. (MOR 2016).
  We design an online mechanism that is truthful for both machines and jobs, achieving a competitive ratio of $O(\log m)$. This is the first non-trivial two-sided truthful mechanism for online load balancing and also the first non-trivial machine-side truthful mechanism. Furthermore, we extend our mechanism to the $\ell_q$ norm variant of load balancing, maintaining two-sided truthfulness with a competitive ratio of $\tilde{O}(m^{\frac{1}{q}(1-\frac{1}{q})})$.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of the Bilevel Shortest Path Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new bilevel version of the classic shortest path problem and completely characterize its computational complexity with respect to several problem variants. In our problem, the leader and the follower each control a subset of the edges of a graph and together aim at building a path between two given vertices, while each of the two players minimizes the cost of the resulting path according to their own cost function. We investigate both directed and undirected graphs, as well as the special case of directed acyclic graphs. Moreover, we distinguish two versions of the follower's problem: Either they have to complete the edge set selected by the leader such that the joint solution is exactly a path, or they have to complete the edge set selected by the leader such that the joint solution is a superset of a path. In general, the bilevel problem turns out to be much harder in the former case: We show that the follower's problem is already NP-hard here and that the leader's problem is even hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, while both problems are one level easier in the latter case. Interestingly, for directed acyclic graphs, this difference turns around, as we give a polynomial-time algorithm for the first version of the bilevel problem, but it stays NP-hard in the second case. Finally, we consider restrictions that render the problem tractable. We prove that, for a constant number of leader's edges, one of our problem variants is actually equivalent to the shortest-$k$-cycle problem, which is a known combinatorial problem with partially unresolved complexity status. In particular, our problem admits a polynomial-time randomized algorithm that can be derandomized if and only if the shortest-$k$-cycle problem admits a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>SoS Certificates for Sparse Singular Values and Their Applications: Robust Statistics, Subspace Distortion, and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\textit{sparse singular value certificates}$ for random rectangular matrices. If $M$ is an $n \times d$ matrix with independent Gaussian entries, we give a new family of polynomial-time algorithms which can certify upper bounds on the maximum of $\|M u\|$, where $u$ is a unit vector with at most $\eta n$ nonzero entries for a given $\eta \in (0,1)$. This basic algorithmic primitive lies at the heart of a wide range of problems across algorithmic statistics and theoretical computer science.
  Our algorithms certify a bound which is asymptotically smaller than the naive one, given by the maximum singular value of $M$, for nearly the widest-possible range of $n,d,$ and $\eta$. Efficiently certifying such a bound for a range of $n,d$ and $\eta$ which is larger by any polynomial factor than what is achieved by our algorithm would violate lower bounds in the SQ and low-degree polynomials models. Our certification algorithm makes essential use of the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy. To prove the correctness of our algorithm, we develop a new combinatorial connection between the graph matrix approach to analyze random matrices with dependent entries, and the Efron-Stein decomposition of functions of independent random variables.
  As applications of our certification algorithm, we obtain new efficient algorithms for a wide range of well-studied algorithmic tasks. In algorithmic robust statistics, we obtain new algorithms for robust mean and covariance estimation with tradeoffs between breakdown point and sample complexity, which are nearly matched by SQ and low-degree polynomial lower bounds (that we establish). We also obtain new polynomial-time guarantees for certification of $\ell_1/\ell_2$ distortion of random subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (also with nearly matching lower bounds), sparse principal component analysis, and certification of the $2\rightarrow p$ norm of a random matrix.</description>

      <title>A Formal Correctness Proof of Edmonds' Blossom Shrinking Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first formal correctness proof of Edmonds' blossom shrinking algorithm for maximum cardinality matching in general graphs. We focus on formalising the mathematical structures and properties that allow the algorithm to run in worst-case polynomial running time. We formalise Berge's lemma, blossoms and their properties, and a mathematical model of the algorithm, showing that it is totally correct. We provide the first detailed proofs of many of the facts underlying the algorithm's correctness.</description>

      <title>Low coordinate degree algorithms II: Categorical signals and generalized stochastic block models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study when low coordinate degree functions (LCDF) -- linear combinations of functions depending on small subsets of entries of a vector -- can test for the presence of categorical structure, including community structure and generalizations thereof, in high-dimensional data. This complements the first paper of this series, which studied the power of LCDF in testing for continuous structure like real-valued signals perturbed by additive noise. We apply the tools developed there to a general form of stochastic block model (SBM), where a population is assigned random labels and every $p$-tuple of the population generates an observation according to an arbitrary probability measure associated to the $p$ labels of its members. We show that the performance of LCDF admits a unified analysis for this class of models. As applications, we prove tight lower bounds against LCDF (and therefore also against low degree polynomials) for nearly arbitrary graph and regular hypergraph SBMs, always matching suitable generalizations of the Kesten-Stigum threshold. We also prove tight lower bounds for group synchronization and abelian group sumset problems under the "truth-or-Haar" noise model, and use our technical results to give an improved analysis of Gaussian multi-frequency group synchronization. In most of these models, for some parameter settings our lower bounds give new evidence for conjectural statistical-to-computational gaps. Finally, interpreting some of our findings, we propose a precise analogy between categorical and continuous signals: a general SBM as above behaves, in terms of the tradeoff between subexponential runtime cost of testing algorithms and the signal strength needed for a testing algorithm to succeed, like a spiked $p_*$-tensor model of a certain order $p_*$ that may be computed from the parameters of the SBM.</description>

      <title>Infrequent Resolving Algorithm for Online Linear Programming</title>

Abstract: Online linear programming (OLP) has gained significant attention from both researchers and practitioners due to its extensive applications, such as online auction, network revenue management, order fulfillment and advertising. Existing OLP algorithms fall into two categories: LP-based algorithms and LP-free algorithms. The former one typically guarantees better performance, even offering a constant regret, but requires solving a large number of LPs, which could be computationally expensive. In contrast, LP-free algorithm only requires first-order computations but induces a worse performance, lacking a constant regret bound. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two extremes by proposing a well-performing algorithm, that solves LPs at a few selected time points and conducts first-order computations at other time points. Specifically, for the case where the inputs are drawn from an unknown finite-support distribution, the proposed algorithm achieves a constant regret (even for the hard ``degenerate'' case) while solving LPs only $\mathcal{O}(\log\log T)$ times over the time horizon $T$. Moreover, when we are allowed to solve LPs only $M$ times, we design the corresponding schedule such that the proposed algorithm can guarantee a nearly $\mathcal{O}\left(T^{(1/2)^{M-1}}\right)$ regret. Our work highlights the value of resolving both at the beginning and the end of the selling horizon, and provides a novel framework to prove the performance guarantee of the proposed policy under different infrequent resolving schedules. Furthermore, when the arrival probabilities are known at the beginning, our algorithm can guarantee a constant regret by solving LPs $\mathcal{O}(\log\log T)$ times, and a nearly $\mathcal{O}\left(T^{(1/2)^{M}}\right)$ regret by solving LPs only $M$ times. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Weakly Leveled Planarity with Bounded Span</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies planar drawings of graphs in which each vertex is represented as a point along a sequence of horizontal lines, called levels, and each edge is either a horizontal segment or a strictly $y$-monotone curve. A graph is $s$-span weakly leveled planar if it admits such a drawing where the edges have span at most $s$; the span of an edge is the number of levels it touches minus one. We investigate the problem of computing $s$-span weakly leveled planar drawings from both the computational and the combinatorial perspectives. We prove the problem to be para-NP-hard with respect to its natural parameter $s$ and investigate its complexity with respect to widely used structural parameters. We show the existence of a polynomial-size kernel with respect to vertex cover number and prove that the problem is FPT when parameterized by treedepth. We also present upper and lower bounds on the span for various graph classes.
  Notably, we show that cycle trees, a family of $2$-outerplanar graphs generalizing Halin graphs, are $\Theta(\log n)$-span weakly leveled planar and $4$-span weakly leveled planar when $3$-connected. As a byproduct of these combinatorial results, we obtain improved bounds on the edge-length ratio of the graph families under consideration.</description>

      <title>Optimal L-Systems for Stochastic L-system Inference Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents two novel theorems that address two open problems in stochastic Lindenmayer-system (L-system) inference, specifically focusing on the construction of an optimal stochastic L-system capable of generating a given sequence of strings. The first theorem delineates a method for crafting a stochastic L-system that has the maximum probability of a derivation producing a given sequence of words through a single derivation (noting that multiple derivations may generate the same sequence). Furthermore, the second theorem determines the stochastic L-systems with the highest probability of producing a given sequence of words with multiple possible derivations. From these, we introduce an algorithm to infer an optimal stochastic L-system from a given sequence. This algorithm incorporates advanced optimization techniques, such as interior point methods, to ensure the creation of a stochastic L-system that maximizes the probability of generating the given sequence (allowing for multiple derivations). This allows for the use of stochastic L-systems as a model for machine learning using only positive data for training.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Matrix Multiplication Algorithm for Accelerating Inference in Binary and Ternary Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their tremendous success and versatility, Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from inference inefficiency while relying on advanced computational infrastructure. To address these challenges and make LLMs more accessible and cost-effective, in this paper, we propose algorithms to improve the inference time and memory efficiency of 1.58-bit LLMs with ternary weight matrices. Particularly focusing on matrix multiplication as the bottle-neck operation of inference, we observe that, once trained, the weight matrices of a model no longer change. This allows us to preprocess these matrices and create indices that help reduce the storage requirements by a logarithmic factor while enabling our efficient inference algorithms. Specifically, for a $n$ by $n$ weight matrix, our efficient algorithm guarantees a time complexity of $O(\frac{n^2}{\log n})$, a logarithmic factor improvement over the standard $O(n^2)$ vector-matrix multiplication. Besides theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the practical efficiency of our algorithms. Our results confirm the superiority of the approach both with respect to time and memory, as we observed a reduction in inference time up to 29x and memory usage up to 6x.</description>
