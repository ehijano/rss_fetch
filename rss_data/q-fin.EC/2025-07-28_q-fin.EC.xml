      <title>Financial Regulation and AI: A Faustian Bargain?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine whether and how granular, real-time predictive models should be integrated into central banks' macroprudential toolkit. First, we develop a tractable framework that formalizes the tradeoff regulators face when choosing between implementing models that forecast systemic risk accurately but have uncertain causal content and models with the opposite profile. We derive the regulator's optimal policy in a setting in which private portfolios react endogenously to the regulator's model choice and policy rule. We show that even purely predictive models can generate welfare gains for a regulator, and that predictive precision and knowledge of causal impacts of policy interventions are complementary. Second, we introduce a deep learning architecture tailored to financial holdings data--a graph transformer--and we discuss why it is optimally suited to this problem. The model learns vector embedding representations for both assets and investors by explicitly modeling the relational structure of holdings, and it attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy in out-of-sample forecasting tasks including trade prediction.</description>

      <title>Production Heterogeneity in Collective Labor Supply Models with Children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Children welfare is at the center of many welfare reforms such as cash transfers to families and training programs to parents. A key goal for policy-makers is to evaluate the costs and benefits of such reforms. The main challenge lies in that the outcome of interest, children welfare, is unobservable. To address this issue, I consider a collective labor supply model with children where adult members have preferences over their own leisure, expenditures, and children welfare. I show that the model nonparametrically partially identifies the impacts of parental inputs on children welfare in panel data. I then propose a novel estimation strategy that accommodates measurement error and can be used to efficiently construct valid confidence sets. Using Dutch data on couples with children, I investigate the structure of the expected production technology and how it varies with household characteristics. I find that the production of children welfare is characterized by decreasing returns to scale and large heterogeneity across household types. In particular, I find that children from disadvantaged households, whose parents have low education levels and are not homeowners, are significantly worse off. My results highlight the importance for welfare reforms to include policies targeted at improving children home environment.</description>

      <title>The Cognitive Foundations of Economic Exchange: A Modular Framework Grounded in Behavioral Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02945v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origins of economic behavior remain unresolved-not only in the social sciences but also in AI, where dominant theories often rely on predefined incentives or institutional assumptions. Contrary to the longstanding myth of barter as the foundation of exchange, converging evidence from early human societies suggests that reciprocity-not barter-was the foundational economic logic, enabling communities to sustain exchange and social cohesion long before formal markets emerged. Yet despite its centrality, reciprocity lacks a simulateable and cognitively grounded account. Here, we introduce a minimal behavioral framework based on three empirically supported cognitive primitives-individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost--return sensitivity-that enable agents to participate in and sustain reciprocal exchange, laying the foundation for scalable economic behavior. These mechanisms scaffold the emergence of cooperation, proto-economic exchange, and institutional structure from the bottom up. By bridging insights from primatology, developmental psychology, and economic anthropology, this framework offers a unified substrate for modeling trust, coordination, and economic behavior in both human and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>People Are Highly Cooperative with Large Language Models, Especially When Communication Is Possible or Following Human Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machines driven by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment humans across various tasks, a development with profound implications for business settings where effective communication, collaboration, and stakeholder trust are paramount. To explore how interacting with an LLM instead of a human might shift cooperative behavior in such settings, we used the Prisoner's Dilemma game -- a surrogate of several real-world managerial and economic scenarios. In Experiment 1 (N=100), participants engaged in a thirty-round repeated game against a human, a classic bot, and an LLM (GPT, in real-time). In Experiment 2 (N=192), participants played a one-shot game against a human or an LLM, with half of them allowed to communicate with their opponent, enabling LLMs to leverage a key advantage over older-generation machines. Cooperation rates with LLMs -- while lower by approximately 10-15 percentage points compared to interactions with human opponents -- were nonetheless high. This finding was particularly notable in Experiment 2, where the psychological cost of selfish behavior was reduced. Although allowing communication about cooperation did not close the human-machine behavioral gap, it increased the likelihood of cooperation with both humans and LLMs equally (by 88%), which is particularly surprising for LLMs given their non-human nature and the assumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines compared to human counterparts. Additionally, cooperation with LLMs was higher following prior interaction with humans, suggesting a spillover effect in cooperative behavior. Our findings validate the (careful) use of LLMs by businesses in settings that have a cooperative component.</description>

      <title>Not All Oil Price Shocks Are Alike. A Replication of Kilian (American Economic Review, 2009)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The price of oil can rise because of a disruption to supply or an increase in demand. The nature of the price change determines the dynamic effects. As Kilian (2009) put it: "not all oil price shocks are alike." Using the latest available data, we extend Kilian's (2009) analysis using the R ecosystem and provide more evidence for Kilian's (2009) conclusions. Inference based on unknown conditional heteroskedasticity strengthens the conclusions. With the updated shocks, we assess how a local economy responds to the global oil market, an application that is relevant to policymakers concerned with the transition away from fossil fuels.</description>

      <title>Delphos: A reinforcement learning framework for assisting discrete choice model specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Delphos, a deep reinforcement learning framework for assisting the discrete choice model specification process. Unlike traditional approaches that treat model specification as a static optimisation problem, Delphos represents a paradigm shift: it frames this specification challenge as a sequential decision-making problem, formalised as a Markov Decision Process. In this setting, an agent learns to specify well-performing model candidates by choosing a sequence of modelling actions - such as selecting variables, accommodating both generic and alternative-specific taste parameters, applying non-linear transformations, and including interactions with covariates - and interacting with a modelling environment that estimates each candidate and returns a reward signal. Specifically, Delphos uses a Deep Q-Network that receives delayed rewards based on modelling outcomes (e.g., log-likelihood) and behavioural expectations (e.g., parameter signs), and distributes rewards across the sequence of actions to learn which modelling decisions lead to well-performing candidates. We evaluate Delphos on both simulated and empirical datasets, varying the size of the modelling space and the reward function. To assess the agent's performance in navigating the model space, we analyse the learning curve, the distribution of Q-values, occupancy metrics, and Pareto fronts. Our results show that the agent learns to adaptively explore strategies to identify well-performing models across search spaces, even without prior domain knowledge. It efficiently explores large modelling spaces, concentrates its search in high-reward regions, and suggests candidates that define Pareto frontiers balancing model fit and behavioural plausibility. These findings highlight the potential of this novel adaptive, learning-based framework to assist in the model specification process.</description>
