      <title>Chemotaxis of branched cells in complex environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell migration in vivo is often guided by chemical signals. Such chemotaxis, such as performed by immune cells migrating to a wound site, is complicated by the complex geometry inside living tissues. In this study, we extend our theoretical model of branched-cell migration on a network by introducing chemokine sources to explore the cellular response. The model predicts a speed-accuracy tradeoff, whereby slow cells are significantly more accurate and able to follow efficiently a weak chemoattractant signal. We then compare the model's predictions with experimental observations of neutrophils migrating to the site of laser-inflicted wound in a zebrafish larva fin, and migrating in-vitro inside a regular lattice of pillars. We find that the model captures the details of the sub-cellular response to the chemokine gradient, as well as the large-scale migration response. This comparison suggests that the neutrophils behave as fast cells, compromising their chemotaxis accuracy, which explains the functionality of these immune cells.</description>

      <title>Forager with Inertia : Better for Survival?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fate of a forager who searches for food performing simple random walk on lattices. The forager consumes the available food on the site it visits and leaves it depleted but can survive up to $S$ steps without food. We introduce the concept of inertia in the dynamics which allows the forager to rest with probability $p$ upon consumption of food. The parameter $p$ significantly affects the lifetime of the forager, showing that the inertia can be beneficial for the forager for chosen parameter values. The study of various other quantities reveals interesting scaling behavior with $p$ and also departure from usual diffusive behavior for $0.5 &lt; p &lt; 1$. In addition to numerical approach, the problem has also been studied with analytical approach in one dimension and the results agree reasonably well.</description>

      <title>Reduced order modelling of air puff test for corneal material characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model for the air puff test were analysed. Using Abaqus, the air puff test is applied to eyes with varying biomechanical parameters, such as material properties, corneal thickness, and radius. A reduced order model of the air puff (a turbulent impinging jet) has been acquired to decrease simulation time from 48 hours for the FSI model to approximately 12 minutes for the finite element analysis (FEA) model alone. To further accelerate simulations and improve model accuracy, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) will be integrated with the reduced-order model. This hybrid approach will help expand the model to a larger dataset, enhancing intraocular pressure (IOP) estimation accuracy and the corneal material properties algorithm through inverse FEA. Additionally, a neural network (NN) framework with embedded Gaussian-modulated waveforms is proposed to model the pressure and deformation distributions on the corneal surface as functions of spatial and temporal parameters. By learning the relationship between corneal biomechanical inputs such as Corneal Central Thickness (CCT), Intraocular Pressure (IOP), and baseline properties (Mu), and the governing coefficients of pressure and deformation, the network accurately reconstructs the result that matches well with the high-fidelity CFD data. This approach can quickly capture the distribution of pressure and deformation. It can also provide insights into the distinct spatial and temporal dynamics of pressure and deformation, giving a more comprehensive understanding of fluid-structure interaction phenomena in the air puff test.</description>

      <title>Symmetry's Edge in Cortical Dynamics: Multiscale Dynamics of Ensemble Excitation and Inhibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11965v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating a quantitative theory for the cortex presents challenges and raises questions. What are the significant scales--micro, meso, or macroscopic? What are the interactions--pairwise, higher order, or mean-field? And what control parameters are relevant--noisy, dissipative, or emergent?
  We suggest an approach inspired by advances in understanding matter. This involves identifying invariances in neuron ensemble dynamics, searching for order parameters connecting key degrees of freedom and distinguishing macroscopic states, and pinpointing broken symmetries to uncover emergent laws when neurons interact and coordinate.
  Using multielectrode and multiscale neural recordings, we measure population-level ensemble Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) balance, differing from the input-level E/I balance of single neurons, to study collective behavior in large neural populations. We investigate a set of parameters that can assist us in differentiating between various functional system states (during wake/sleep cycle) and pinpointing broken symmetries that serve different information processing and memory functions. Furthermore, we identify pathological broken symmetries that result in states like seizures.</description>

      <title>Wave front propagation in the Active Coagulation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spreading processes on top of active dynamics provide a novel theoretical framework for capturing emerging collective behavior in living systems. I consider run-and-tumble dynamics coupled with coagulation/decoagulation reactions that lead to an absorbing state phase transition. While the active dynamics does not change the location of the transition point, the relaxation toward the stationary state depends on motility parameters. Because of the competition between spreading dynamics and active motion, the system can support long-living currents whose typical time scale is a nontrivial function of motility and reaction rates. Because of this interplay between time-scales, the wave front propagation qualitatively changes from traveling to diffusive waves. Moving beyond the mean-field regime, instability at finite length scales regulates a crossover from periodic to diffusive modes. Finally, it is possible to individuate different mechanisms of pattern formation on a large time scale, ranging from the Fisher-Kolmogorov to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.</description>

      <title>Multi-phase-field Models of Biological Tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of complex multicellular organisms from a single parent cell is a highly orchestrated process that cells conduct collectively without central guidance, creating intricate dynamic patterns essential for development and regeneration. Despite significant advances in imaging spatiotemporal dynamics of cell collectives and mechanical characterization techniques, the role of physical forces in biological functions remains poorly understood. Physics-based models are crucial in complementing experiments, providing high-resolution spatiotemporal fields in three dimensions. This review focuses on dense, soft multicellular systems, such as tissues, where mechanical deformation of one cell necessitates the re-organization of neighboring cells. The multi-phase-field model offers a rich physics-based framework to advance our understanding of biological systems and provides a robust playground for non-equilibrium physics of active matter. We discuss the foundational aspects of the multi-phase-field model and their applications in understanding physics of active matter. We also explore the integration of biological physics with experimental data, covering cell migration, heterogeneous cell populations, and confined systems. Finally, we highlight current trends, the importance of multi-phase-field models in biological and physics research, and future challenges.</description>
