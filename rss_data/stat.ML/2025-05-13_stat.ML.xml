      <title>Fair Representation Learning for Continuous Sensitive Attributes using Expectation of Integral Probability Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI fairness, also known as algorithmic fairness, aims to ensure that algorithms operate without bias or discrimination towards any individual or group. Among various AI algorithms, the Fair Representation Learning (FRL) approach has gained significant interest in recent years. However, existing FRL algorithms have a limitation: they are primarily designed for categorical sensitive attributes and thus cannot be applied to continuous sensitive attributes, such as age or income. In this paper, we propose an FRL algorithm for continuous sensitive attributes. First, we introduce a measure called the Expectation of Integral Probability Metrics (EIPM) to assess the fairness level of representation space for continuous sensitive attributes. We demonstrate that if the distribution of the representation has a low EIPM value, then any prediction head constructed on the top of the representation become fair, regardless of the selection of the prediction head. Furthermore, EIPM possesses a distinguished advantage in that it can be accurately estimated using our proposed estimator with finite samples. Based on these properties, we propose a new FRL algorithm called Fair Representation using EIPM with MMD (FREM). Experimental evidences show that FREM outperforms other baseline methods.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Importance-Weighted Information Criteria: Theory and Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imori and Ing (2025) proposed the importance-weighted orthogonal greedy algorithm (IWOGA) for model selection in high-dimensional misspecified regression models under covariate shift. To determine the number of IWOGA iterations, they introduced the high-dimensional importance-weighted information criterion (HDIWIC). They argued that the combined use of IWOGA and HDIWIC, IWOGA + HDIWIC, achieves an optimal trade-off between variance and squared bias, leading to optimal convergence rates in terms of conditional mean squared prediction error. In this article, we provide a theoretical justification for this claim by establishing the optimality of IWOGA + HDIWIC under a set of reasonable assumptions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport for Machine Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal Transport is a foundational mathematical theory that connects optimization, partial differential equations, and probability. It offers a powerful framework for comparing probability distributions and has recently become an important tool in machine learning, especially for designing and evaluating generative models. These course notes cover the fundamental mathematical aspects of OT, including the Monge and Kantorovich formulations, Brenier's theorem, the dual and dynamic formulations, the Bures metric on Gaussian distributions, and gradient flows. It also introduces numerical methods such as linear programming, semi-discrete solvers, and entropic regularization. Applications in machine learning include topics like training neural networks via gradient flows, token dynamics in transformers, and the structure of GANs and diffusion models. These notes focus primarily on mathematical content rather than deep learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Feature Representation Transferring to Lightweight Models via Perception Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Our theoretical insights provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation transferring.</description>

      <title>Learning Guarantee of Reward Modeling Using Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the learning theory of reward modeling with pairwise comparison data using deep neural networks. We establish a novel non-asymptotic regret bound for deep reward estimators in a non-parametric setting, which depends explicitly on the network architecture. Furthermore, to underscore the critical importance of clear human beliefs, we introduce a margin-type condition that assumes the conditional winning probability of the optimal action in pairwise comparisons is significantly distanced from 1/2. This condition enables a sharper regret bound, which substantiates the empirical efficiency of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and highlights clear human beliefs in its success. Notably, this improvement stems from high-quality pairwise comparison data implied by the margin-type condition, is independent of the specific estimators used, and thus applies to various learning algorithms and models.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Sample Embedding with Proximity Data: Projection versus Restricted Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of using proximity (similarity or dissimilarity) data for the purpose of "adding a point to a vector diagram" was first studied by J.C. Gower in 1968. Since then, a number of methods -- mostly kernel methods -- have been proposed for solving what has come to be called the problem of *out-of-sample embedding*. We survey the various kernel methods that we have encountered and show that each can be derived from one or the other of two competing strategies: *projection* or *restricted reconstruction*. Projection can be analogized to a well-known formula for adding a point to a principal component analysis. Restricted reconstruction poses a different challenge: how to best approximate redoing the entire multivariate analysis while holding fixed the vector diagram that was previously obtained. This strategy results in a nonlinear optimization problem that can be simplified to a unidimensional search. Various circumstances may warrant either projection or restricted reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in generative models based on diffusions driven by the empirical robustness of these methods in generating high-dimensional photorealistic images and the possibility of using the vast existing toolbox of stochastic differential equations. %This remarkable ability may stem from their capacity to model and generate multimodal distributions. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on the approach introduced in Song et al. (2021), shifting the focus from a "learning" problem to a "sampling" problem. To achieve this, we reformulate the equations governing diffusion-based generative models as a Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE), which avoids the well-known issue of pre-estimating the gradient of the log target density. The solution of this FBSDE is proved to be unique using non-standard techniques. Additionally, we propose a numerical solution to this problem, leveraging on Deep Learning techniques. This reformulation opens new pathways for sampling multidimensional distributions with densities known up to a normalization constant, a problem frequently encountered in Bayesian statistics.</description>

      <title>Outperformance Score: A Universal Standardization Method for Confusion-Matrix-Based Classification Performance Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many classification performance metrics exist, each suited to a specific application. However, these metrics often differ in scale and can exhibit varying sensitivity to class imbalance rates in the test set. As a result, it is difficult to use the nominal values of these metrics to interpret and evaluate classification performances, especially when imbalance rates vary. To address this problem, we introduce the outperformance score function, a universal standardization method for confusion-matrix-based classification performance (CMBCP) metrics. It maps any given metric to a common scale of $[0,1]$, while providing a clear and consistent interpretation. Specifically, the outperformance score represents the percentile rank of the observed classification performance within a reference distribution of possible performances. This unified framework enables meaningful comparison and monitoring of classification performance across test sets with differing imbalance rates. We illustrate how the outperformance scores can be applied to a variety of commonly used classification performance metrics and demonstrate the robustness of our method through experiments on real-world datasets spanning multiple classification applications.</description>

      <title>Learning curves theory for hierarchically compositional data with power-law distributed features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theories suggest that Neural Scaling Laws arise whenever the task is linearly decomposed into power-law distributed units. Alternatively, scaling laws also emerge when data exhibit a hierarchically compositional structure, as is thought to occur in language and images. To unify these views, we consider classification and next-token prediction tasks based on probabilistic context-free grammars -- probabilistic models that generate data via a hierarchy of production rules. For classification, we show that having power-law distributed production rules results in a power-law learning curve with an exponent depending on the rules' distribution and a large multiplicative constant that depends on the hierarchical structure. By contrast, for next-token prediction, the distribution of production rules controls the local details of the learning curve, but not the exponent describing the large-scale behaviour.</description>

      <title>A Sparse Bayesian Learning Algorithm for Estimation of Interaction Kernels in Motsch-Tadmor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the data-driven identification of asymmetric interaction kernels in the Motsch-Tadmor model based on observed trajectory data. The model under consideration is governed by a class of semilinear evolution equations, where the interaction kernel defines a normalized, state-dependent Laplacian operator that governs collective dynamics. To address the resulting nonlinear inverse problem, we propose a variational framework that reformulates kernel identification using the implicit form of the governing equations, reducing it to a subspace identification problem. We establish an identifiability result that characterizes conditions under which the interaction kernel can be uniquely recovered up to scale. To solve the inverse problem robustly, we develop a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm that incorporates informative priors for regularization, quantifies uncertainty, and enables principled model selection. Extensive numerical experiments on representative interacting particle systems demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of the proposed framework across a range of noise levels and data regimes.</description>

      <title>Constrained Online Decision-Making with Density Estimation Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual online decision-making problems with constraints appear in a wide range of real-world applications, such as personalized recommendation with resource limits, adaptive experimental design, and decision-making under safety or fairness requirements. In this paper, we investigate a general formulation of sequential decision-making with stage-wise feasibility constraints, where at each round, the learner must select an action based on observed context while ensuring that a problem-specific feasibility criterion is satisfied. We propose a unified algorithmic framework that captures many existing constrained learning problems, including constrained bandits, active learning with label budgets, online hypothesis testing with Type I error control, and model calibration. Central to our approach is the concept of upper counterfactual confidence bounds, which enables the design of practically efficient online algorithms with strong theoretical guarantee using any offline conditional density estimation oracle. Technically, to handle feasibility constraints in complex environments, we introduce a generalized notion of the eluder dimension - extending it from the classical setting based on square loss to a broader class of metric-like probability divergences. This allows us to capture the complexity of various density function classes and characterize the utility regret incurred due to feasibility constraint uncertainty. Our result offers a principled foundation for constrained sequential decision-making in both theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Adaptive, Robust and Scalable Bayesian Filtering for Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we introduce Bayesian filtering as a principled framework for tackling diverse sequential machine learning problems, including online (continual) learning, prequential (one-step-ahead) forecasting, and contextual bandits. To this end, this thesis addresses key challenges in applying Bayesian filtering to these problems: adaptivity to non-stationary environments, robustness to model misspecification and outliers, and scalability to the high-dimensional parameter space of deep neural networks. We develop novel tools within the Bayesian filtering framework to address each of these challenges, including: (i) a modular framework that enables the development adaptive approaches for online learning; (ii) a novel, provably robust filter with similar computational cost to standard filters, that employs Generalised Bayes; and (iii) a set of tools for sequentially updating model parameters using approximate second-order optimisation methods that exploit the overparametrisation of high-dimensional parametric models such as neural networks. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the improved performance of our methods in dynamic, high-dimensional, and misspecified models.</description>

      <title>ALPCAH: Subspace Learning for Sample-wise Heteroscedastic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data dimensionality reduction. However, some applications involve heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This paper develops a subspace learning method, named ALPCAH, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace basis associated with the low-rank structure of the data. Our method makes no distributional assumptions of the low-rank component and does not assume that the noise variances are known. Further, this method uses a soft rank constraint that does not require subspace dimension to be known. Additionally, this paper develops a matrix factorized version of ALPCAH, named LR-ALPCAH, that is much faster and more memory efficient at the cost of requiring subspace dimension to be known or estimated. Simulations and real data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing algorithms.

      <title>Certified Data Removal Under High-dimensional Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning focuses on the computationally efficient removal of specific training data from trained models, ensuring that the influence of forgotten data is effectively eliminated without the need for full retraining. Despite advances in low-dimensional settings, where the number of parameters \( p \) is much smaller than the sample size \( n \), extending similar theoretical guarantees to high-dimensional regimes remains challenging. We propose an unlearning algorithm that starts from the original model parameters and performs a theory-guided sequence of Newton steps \( T \in \{ 1,2\}\). After this update, carefully scaled isotropic Laplacian noise is added to the estimate to ensure that any (potential) residual influence of forget data is completely removed. We show that when both \( n, p \to \infty \) with a fixed ratio \( n/p \), significant theoretical and computational obstacles arise due to the interplay between the complexity of the model and the finite signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we show that, unlike in low-dimensional settings, a single Newton step is insufficient for effective unlearning in high-dimensional problems -- however, two steps are enough to achieve the desired certifiebility. We provide numerical experiments to support the certifiability and accuracy claims of this approach.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Across Fixed-Income Product Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for transfer learning of discount curves across different fixed-income product classes. Motivated by challenges in estimating discount curves from sparse or noisy data, we extend kernel ridge regression (KR) to a vector-valued setting, formulating a convex optimization problem in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Each component of the solution corresponds to the discount curve implied by a specific product class. We introduce an additional regularization term motivated by economic principles, promoting smoothness of spread curves between product classes, and show that it leads to a valid separable kernel structure. A main theoretical contribution is a decomposition of the vector-valued RKHS norm induced by separable kernels. We further provide a Gaussian process interpretation of vector-valued KR, enabling quantification of estimation uncertainty. Illustrative examples demonstrate that transfer learning significantly improves extrapolation performance and tightens confidence intervals compared to single-curve estimation.</description>

      <title>Analytic theory of dropout regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dropout is a regularization technique widely used in training artificial neural networks to mitigate overfitting. It consists of dynamically deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times. Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are validated by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Learning Dynamics in Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an interpretability framework for unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) agents, aimed at understanding how intrinsic motivation shapes attention, behavior, and representation learning. We analyze five agents DQN, RND, ICM, PPO, and a Transformer-RND variant trained on procedurally generated environments, using Grad-CAM, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), exploration metrics, and latent space clustering. To capture how agents perceive and adapt over time, we introduce two metrics: attention diversity, which measures the spatial breadth of focus, and attention change rate, which quantifies temporal shifts in attention. Our findings show that curiosity-driven agents display broader, more dynamic attention and exploratory behavior than their extrinsically motivated counterparts. Among them, TransformerRND combines wide attention, high exploration coverage, and compact, structured latent representations. Our results highlight the influence of architectural inductive biases and training signals on internal agent dynamics. Beyond reward-centric evaluation, the proposed framework offers diagnostic tools to probe perception and abstraction in RL agents, enabling more interpretable and generalizable behavior.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Probabilistic Framework for Cascading Urban Risk Analysis Using Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of cascading risks in urban systems necessitates robust, data-driven frameworks to model interdependencies across multiple domains. This study presents a foundational Bayesian network-based approach for analyzing cross-domain risk propagation across key urban domains, including air, water, electricity, agriculture, health, infrastructure, weather, and climate. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are constructed using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs), with structure learning guided by Hill-Climbing search optimized through Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and K2 scoring. The framework is trained on a hybrid dataset that combines real-world urban indicators with synthetically generated data from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and is further balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) derived from the learned structures enable interpretable probabilistic reasoning and quantify the likelihood of cascading failures. The results identify key intra- and inter-domain risk factors and demonstrate the framework's utility for proactive urban resilience planning. This work establishes a scalable, interpretable foundation for cascading risk assessment and serves as a basis for future empirical research in this emerging interdisciplinary field.</description>

      <title>Soft causal learning for generalized molecule property prediction: An environment perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning on molecule graphs has become an increasingly important topic in AI for science, which takes full advantage of AI to facilitate scientific discovery. Existing solutions on modeling molecules utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to achieve representations but they mostly fail to adapt models to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Although recent advances on OOD-oriented graph learning have discovered the invariant rationale on graphs, they still ignore three important issues, i.e., 1) the expanding atom patterns regarding environments on graphs lead to failures of invariant rationale based models, 2) the associations between discovered molecular subgraphs and corresponding properties are complex where causal substructures cannot fully interpret the labels. 3) the interactions between environments and invariances can influence with each other thus are challenging to be modeled. To this end, we propose a soft causal learning framework, to tackle the unresolved OOD challenge in molecular science, from the perspective of fully modeling the molecule environments and bypassing the invariant subgraphs. Specifically, we first incorporate chemistry theories into our graph growth generator to imitate expaned environments, and then devise an GIB-based objective to disentangle environment from whole graphs and finally introduce a cross-attention based soft causal interaction, which allows dynamic interactions between environments and invariances. We perform experiments on seven datasets by imitating different kinds of OOD generalization scenarios. Extensive comparison, ablation experiments as well as visualized case studies demonstrate well generalization ability of our proposal.</description>

      <title>IIKL: Isometric Immersion Kernel Learning with Riemannian Manifold for Geometric Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric representation learning in preserving the intrinsic geometric and topological properties for discrete non-Euclidean data is crucial in scientific applications. Previous research generally mapped non-Euclidean discrete data into Euclidean space during representation learning, which may lead to the loss of some critical geometric information. In this paper, we propose a novel Isometric Immersion Kernel Learning (IIKL) method to build Riemannian manifold and isometrically induce Riemannian metric from discrete non-Euclidean data. We prove that Isometric immersion is equivalent to the kernel function in the tangent bundle on the manifold, which explicitly guarantees the invariance of the inner product between vectors in the arbitrary tangent space throughout the learning process, thus maintaining the geometric structure of the original data. Moreover, a novel parameterized learning model based on IIKL is introduced, and an alternating training method for this model is derived using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), ensuring efficient convergence. Experimental results proved that using the learned Riemannian manifold and its metric, our model preserved the intrinsic geometric representation of data in both 3D and high-dimensional datasets successfully, and significantly improved the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as data reconstruction and classification. It is showed that our method could reduce the inner product invariant loss by more than 90% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, also achieved an average 40% improvement in downstream reconstruction accuracy and a 90% reduction in error for geometric metrics involving isometric and conformal.</description>

      <title>Edge-Optimized Deep Learning &amp; Pattern Recognition Techniques for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring of Energy Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing global energy demand and the urgent need for sustainability call for innovative ways to boost energy efficiency. While advanced energy-saving systems exist, they often fall short without user engagement. Providing feedback on energy consumption behavior is key to promoting sustainable practices. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a promising solution by disaggregating total household energy usage, recorded by a central smart meter, into appliance-level data. This empowers users to optimize consumption. Advances in AI, IoT, and smart meter adoption have further enhanced NILM's potential.
  Despite this promise, real-world NILM deployment faces major challenges. First, existing datasets mainly represent regions like the USA and UK, leaving places like the Mediterranean underrepresented. This limits understanding of regional consumption patterns, such as heavy use of air conditioners and electric water heaters. Second, deep learning models used in NILM require high computational power, often relying on cloud services. This increases costs, raises privacy concerns, and limits scalability, especially for households with poor connectivity. This thesis tackles these issues with key contributions. It presents an interoperable data collection framework and introduces the Plegma Dataset, focused on underrepresented Mediterranean energy patterns. It also explores advanced deep neural networks and model compression techniques for efficient edge deployment. By bridging theoretical advances with practical needs, this work aims to make NILM scalable, efficient, and adaptable for global energy sustainability.</description>

      <title>Classifying Inconsistency in AHP Pairwise Comparison Matrices Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing consistency in Pairwise Comparison Matrices (PCMs) within the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) poses significant challenges when using the traditional Consistency Ratio (CR) method. This study introduces a novel alternative that leverages triadic preference reversals (PR) to provide a more robust and interpretable assessment of consistency. Triadic preference reversals capture inconsistencies between a pair of elements by comparing the direction of preference derived from the global eigenvector with that from a 3x3 submatrix (triad) containing the same pair, highlighting local-global preference conflicts. This method detects a reversal when one eigen ratio exceeds one while another falls below one, signaling inconsistency. We identify two key features: the proportion of preference reversals and the maximum reversal, which mediate the impact of a PCM's order on its consistency. Using these features simulated PCMs are clustered into consistent and inconsistent classes through k-means clustering, followed by training a logistic classifier for consistency evaluation. The PR method achieves 97\% accuracy, significantly surpassing the Consistency Ratio (CR) method's 50%, with a false negative rate of only 2.6\% compared to 5.5\%. These findings demonstrate the PR method's superior accuracy in assessing AHP consistency, thereby enabling more reliable decision-making. The proposed triadic preference reversal (PR) approach is implemented in the R package AHPtools publicly available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).</description>

      <title>CAST: Time-Varying Treatment Effects with Application to Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy on Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal machine learning (CML) enables individualized estimation of treatment effects, offering critical advantages over traditional correlation-based methods. However, existing approaches for medical survival data with censoring such as causal survival forests estimate effects at fixed time points, limiting their ability to capture dynamic changes over time. We introduce Causal Analysis for Survival Trajectories (CAST), a novel framework that models treatment effects as continuous functions of time following treatment. By combining parametric and non-parametric methods, CAST overcomes the limitations of discrete time-point analysis to estimate continuous effect trajectories. Using the RADCURE dataset [1] of 2,651 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as a clinically relevant example, CAST models how chemotherapy and radiotherapy effects evolve over time at the population and individual levels. By capturing the temporal dynamics of treatment response, CAST reveals how treatment effects rise, peak, and decline over the follow-up period, helping clinicians determine when and for whom treatment benefits are maximized. This framework advances the application of CML to personalized care in HNSCC and other life-threatening medical conditions.

      <title>Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Physics-Informed Neural Networks Using Error Bounds and Solution Bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used to obtain solutions to various physical phenomena modeled as Differential Equations. As PINNs are not naturally equipped with mechanisms for Uncertainty Quantification, some work has been done to quantify the different uncertainties that arise when dealing with PINNs. In this paper, we use a two-step procedure to train Bayesian Neural Networks that provide uncertainties over the solutions to differential equation systems provided by PINNs. We use available error bounds over PINNs to formulate a heteroscedastic variance that improves the uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, we solve forward problems and utilize the obtained uncertainties when doing parameter estimation in inverse problems in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Online Feedback Efficient Active Target Discovery in Partially Observable Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In various scientific and engineering domains, where data acquisition is costly, such as in medical imaging, environmental monitoring, or remote sensing, strategic sampling from unobserved regions, guided by prior observations, is essential to maximize target discovery within a limited sampling budget. In this work, we introduce Diffusion-guided Active Target Discovery (DiffATD), a novel method that leverages diffusion dynamics for active target discovery. DiffATD maintains a belief distribution over each unobserved state in the environment, using this distribution to dynamically balance exploration-exploitation. Exploration reduces uncertainty by sampling regions with the highest expected entropy, while exploitation targets areas with the highest likelihood of discovering the target, indicated by the belief distribution and an incrementally trained reward model designed to learn the characteristics of the target. DiffATD enables efficient target discovery in a partially observable environment within a fixed sampling budget, all without relying on any prior supervised training. Furthermore, DiffATD offers interpretability, unlike existing black-box policies that require extensive supervised training. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across diverse domains, including medical imaging and remote sensing, we show that DiffATD performs significantly better than baselines and competitively with supervised methods that operate under full environmental observability.</description>

      <title>dcFCI: Robust Causal Discovery Under Latent Confounding, Unfaithfulness, and Mixed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery is central to inferring causal relationships from observational data. In the presence of latent confounding, algorithms such as Fast Causal Inference (FCI) learn a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) representing the true model's Markov Equivalence Class. However, their correctness critically depends on empirical faithfulness, the assumption that observed (in)dependencies perfectly reflect those of the underlying causal model, which often fails in practice due to limited sample sizes. To address this, we introduce the first nonparametric score to assess a PAG's compatibility with observed data, even with mixed variable types. This score is both necessary and sufficient to characterize structural uncertainty and distinguish between distinct PAGs. We then propose data-compatible FCI (dcFCI), the first hybrid causal discovery algorithm to jointly address latent confounding, empirical unfaithfulness, and mixed data types. dcFCI integrates our score into an (Anytime)FCI-guided search that systematically explores, ranks, and validates candidate PAGs. Experiments on synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that dcFCI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, often recovering the true PAG even in small and heterogeneous datasets. Examining top-ranked PAGs further provides valuable insights into structural uncertainty, supporting more robust and informed causal reasoning and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Good Things Come in Pairs: Paired Autoencoders for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this book chapter, we discuss recent advances in data-driven approaches for inverse problems. In particular, we focus on the \emph{paired autoencoder} framework, which has proven to be a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in scientific computing. The paired autoencoder framework is a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both data-driven and model-based methods by projecting both the data and the quantity of interest into a latent space and mapping these latent spaces to provide surrogate forward and inverse mappings. We illustrate the advantages of this approach through numerical experiments, including seismic imaging and classical inpainting: nonlinear and linear inverse problems, respectively. Although the paired autoencoder framework is likelihood-free, it generates multiple data- and model-based reconstruction metrics that help assess whether examples are in or out of distribution. In addition to direct model estimates from data, the paired autoencoder enables latent-space refinement to fit the observed data accurately. Numerical experiments show that this procedure, combined with the latent-space initial guess, is essential for high-quality estimates, even when data noise exceeds the training regime. We also introduce two novel variants that combine variational and paired autoencoder ideas, maintaining the original benefits while enabling sampling for uncertainty analysis.</description>

      <title>TAROT: Towards Essentially Domain-Invariant Robustness with Theoretical Justification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust domain adaptation against adversarial attacks is a critical research area that aims to develop models capable of maintaining consistent performance across diverse and challenging domains. In this paper, we derive a new generalization bound for robust risk on the target domain using a novel divergence measure specifically designed for robust domain adaptation. Building upon this, we propose a new algorithm named TAROT, which is designed to enhance both domain adaptability and robustness. Through extensive experiments, TAROT not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness but also significantly enhances domain generalization and scalability by effectively learning domain-invariant features. In particular, TAROT achieves superior performance on the challenging DomainNet dataset, demonstrating its ability to learn domain-invariant representations that generalize well across different domains, including unseen ones. These results highlight the broader applicability of our approach in real-world domain adaptation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Model Steering: Learning with a Reference Model Improves Generalization Bounds and Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06699v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper formalizes an emerging learning paradigm that uses a trained model as a reference to guide and enhance the training of a target model through strategic data selection or weighting, named $\textbf{model steering}$. While ad-hoc methods have been used in various contexts, including the training of large foundation models, its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose a theory-driven framework for model steering called $\textbf{DRRho risk minimization}$, which is rooted in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). Through a generalization analysis, we provide theoretical insights into why this approach improves generalization and data efficiency compared to training without a reference model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such theoretical insights are provided for the new learning paradigm, which significantly enhance our understanding and practice of model steering. Building on these insights and the connection between contrastive learning and DRO, we introduce a novel method for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) with a reference model, termed DRRho-CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the theoretical insights, reveal a superior scaling law compared to CLIP without a reference model, and demonstrate its strength over existing heuristic approaches.</description>

      <title>Beyond $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ Constraint Violation for Online Convex Optimization with Adversarial Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Online Convex Optimization problem with adversarial constraints (COCO) where, in each round, a learner is presented with a convex cost function and a convex constraint function, both of which may be chosen adversarially. The learner selects actions from a convex decision set in an online fashion, with the goal of minimizing both regret and the cumulative constraint violation (CCV) over a horizon of $T$ rounds. The best-known policy for this problem achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ CCV. In this paper, we present a surprising improvement that achieves a significantly smaller CCV by trading it off with regret. Specifically, for any bounded convex cost and constraint functions, we propose an online policy that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT}+ T^\beta)$ regret and $\tilde{O}(dT^{1-\beta})$ CCV, where $d$ is the dimension of the decision set and $\beta \in [0,1]$ is a tunable parameter. We achieve this result by first considering the special case of $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem where the decision set is a probability simplex and the cost and constraint functions are linear. Leveraging a new adaptive small-loss regret bound, we propose an efficient policy for the $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem, that attains $O(\sqrt{T\ln N}+T^{\beta})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\beta} \ln N)$ CCV, where $N$ is the number of experts. The original problem is then reduced to the $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem via a covering argument. Finally, with an additional smoothness assumption, we propose an efficient gradient-based policy attaining $O(T^{\max(\frac{1}{2},\beta)})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\beta})$ CCV.</description>

      <title>LineFlow: A Framework to Learn Active Control of Production Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many production lines require active control mechanisms, such as adaptive routing, worker reallocation, and rescheduling, to maintain optimal performance. However, designing these control systems is challenging for various reasons, and while reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in addressing these challenges, a standardized and general framework is still lacking. In this work, we introduce LineFlow, an extensible, open-source Python framework for simulating production lines of arbitrary complexity and training RL agents to control them. To demonstrate the capabilities and to validate the underlying theoretical assumptions of LineFlow, we formulate core subproblems of active line control in ways that facilitate mathematical analysis. For each problem, we provide optimal solutions for comparison. We benchmark state-of-the-art RL algorithms and show that the learned policies approach optimal performance in well-understood scenarios. However, for more complex, industrial-scale production lines, RL still faces significant challenges, highlighting the need for further research in areas such as reward shaping, curriculum learning, and hierarchical control.</description>

      <title>Topology Guidance: Controlling the Outputs of Generative Models via Vector Field Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For domains that involve numerical simulation, it can be computationally expensive to run an ensemble of simulations spanning a parameter space of interest to a user. To this end, an attractive surrogate for simulation is the generative modeling of fields produced by an ensemble, allowing one to synthesize fields in a computationally cheap, yet accurate, manner. However, for the purposes of visual analysis, a limitation of generative models is their lack of control, as it is unclear what one should expect when sampling a field from a model. In this paper we study how to make generative models of fields more controllable, so that users can specify features of interest, in particular topological features, that they wish to see in the output. We propose topology guidance, a method for guiding the sampling process of a generative model, specifically a diffusion model, such that a topological description specified as input is satisfied in the generated output. Central to our method, we couple a coordinate-based neural network used to represent fields, with a diffusion model used for generation. We show how to use topologically-relevant signals provided by the coordinate-based network to help guide the denoising process of a diffusion model. This enables us to faithfully represent a user's specified topology, while ensuring that the output field remains within the generative data distribution. Specifically, we study 2D vector field topology, evaluating our method over an ensemble of fluid flows, where we show that generated vector fields faithfully adhere to the location, and type, of critical points over the spatial domain. We further show the benefits of our method in aiding the comparison of ensembles, allowing one to explore commonalities and differences in distributions along prescribed topological features.</description>

      <title>A stochastic gradient method for trilevel optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the success that the field of bilevel optimization has seen in recent years, similar methodologies have started being applied to solving more difficult applications that arise in trilevel optimization. At the helm of these applications are new machine learning formulations that have been proposed in the trilevel context and, as a result, efficient and theoretically sound stochastic methods are required. In this work, we propose the first-ever stochastic gradient descent method for solving unconstrained trilevel optimization problems and provide a convergence theory that covers all forms of inexactness of the trilevel adjoint gradient, such as the inexact solutions of the middle-level and lower-level problems, inexact computation of the trilevel adjoint formula, and noisy estimates of the gradients, Hessians, Jacobians, and tensors of third-order derivatives involved. We also demonstrate the promise of our approach by providing numerical results on both synthetic trilevel problems and trilevel formulations for hyperparameter adversarial tuning.</description>

      <title>Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition For Sparse Reconstruction of Closable Koopman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial temporal reconstruction of dynamical system is indeed a crucial problem with diverse applications ranging from climate modeling to numerous chaotic and physical processes. These reconstructions are based on the harmonious relationship between the Koopman operators and the choice of dictionary, determined implicitly by a kernel function. This leads to the approximation of the Koopman operators in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) associated with that kernel function. Data-driven analysis of Koopman operators demands that Koopman operators be closable over the underlying RKHS, which still remains an unsettled, unexplored, and critical operator-theoretic challenge. We aim to address this challenge by investigating the embedding of the Laplacian kernel in the measure-theoretic sense, giving rise to a rich enough RKHS to settle the closability of the Koopman operators. We leverage Kernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with the Laplacian kernel to reconstruct the dominant spatial temporal modes of various diverse dynamical systems. After empirical demonstration, we concrete such results by providing the theoretical justification leveraging the closability of the Koopman operators on the RKHS generated by the Laplacian kernel on the avenues of Koopman mode decomposition and the Koopman spectral measure. Such results were explored from both grounds of operator theory and data-driven science, thus making the Laplacian kernel a robust choice for spatial-temporal reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Streaming Sliced Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliced optimal transport (SOT) or sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance is widely recognized for its statistical and computational scalability. In this work, we further enhance the computational scalability by proposing the first method for computing SW from sample streams, called \emph{streaming sliced Wasserstein} (Stream-SW). To define Stream-SW, we first introduce the streaming computation of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance. Since the one-dimensional Wasserstein (1DW) distance has a closed-form expression, given by the absolute difference between the quantile functions of the compared distributions, we leverage quantile approximation techniques for sample streams to define the streaming 1DW distance. By applying streaming 1DW to all projections, we obtain Stream-SW. The key advantage of Stream-SW is its low memory complexity while providing theoretical guarantees on the approximation error. We demonstrate that Stream-SW achieves a more accurate approximation of SW than random subsampling, with lower memory consumption, in comparing Gaussian distributions and mixtures of Gaussians from streaming samples. Additionally, we conduct experiments on point cloud classification, point cloud gradient flows, and streaming change point detection to further highlight the favorable performance of Stream-SW.</description>

      <title>The power of fine-grained experts: Granularity boosts expressivity in Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are increasingly central to frontier model architectures. By selectively activating parameters, they reduce computational cost while scaling total parameter count. This paper investigates the impact of the number of active experts, termed granularity, comparing architectures with many (e.g., 8 per layer in DeepSeek) to those with fewer (e.g., 1 per layer in Llama-4 models). We prove an exponential separation in network expressivity based on this design parameter, suggesting that models benefit from higher granularity. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings and illustrate this separation.</description>

      <title>Improving Random Forests by Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process regression is a popular model in the small data regime due to its sound uncertainty quantification and the exploitation of the smoothness of the regression function that is encountered in a wide range of practical problems. However, Gaussian processes perform sub-optimally when the degree of smoothness is non-homogeneous across the input domain. Random forest regression partially addresses this issue by providing local basis functions of variable support set sizes that are chosen in a data-driven way. However, they do so at the expense of forgoing any degree of smoothness, which often results in poor performance in the small data regime. Here, we aim to combine the advantages of both models by applying a kernel-based smoothing mechanism to a learned random forest or any other piecewise constant prediction function. As we demonstrate empirically, the resulting model consistently improves the predictive performance of the underlying random forests and, in almost all test cases, also improves the log loss of the usual uncertainty quantification based on inter-tree variance. The latter advantage can be attributed to the ability of the smoothing model to take into account the uncertainty over the exact tree-splitting locations.</description>

      <title>Stability Regularized Cross-Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of ensuring strong test-set performance via cross-validation. Motivated by the generalization theory literature, we propose a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme that selects hyperparameters by minimizing a weighted sum of the usual cross-validation metric and an empirical model-stability measure. The weight on the stability term is itself chosen via a nested cross-validation procedure. This reduces the risk of strong validation set performance and poor test set performance due to instability. We benchmark our procedure on a suite of 13 real-world UCI datasets, and find that, compared to k-fold cross-validation over the same hyperparameters, it improves the out-of-sample MSE for sparse ridge regression and CART by 4% on average, but has no impact on XGBoost. This suggests that for interpretable and unstable models, such as sparse regression and CART, our approach is a viable and computationally affordable method for improving test-set performance.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal data modeling has emerged as a powerful approach in clinical research, enabling the integration of diverse data types such as imaging, genomics, wearable sensors, and electronic health records. Despite its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and support personalized care, modeling such heterogeneous data presents significant technical challenges. This systematic review synthesizes findings from 69 studies to identify common obstacles, including missing modalities, limited sample sizes, dimensionality imbalance, interpretability issues, and finding the optimal fusion techniques. We highlight recent methodological advances, such as transfer learning, generative models, attention mechanisms, and neural architecture search that offer promising solutions. By mapping current trends and innovations, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the field and offers practical insights to guide future research and development in multimodal modeling for medical applications.</description>

      <title>Source Anonymity for Private Random Walk Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers random walk-based decentralized learning, where at each iteration of the learning process, one user updates the model and sends it to a randomly chosen neighbor until a convergence criterion is met. Preserving data privacy is a central concern and open problem in decentralized learning. We propose a privacy-preserving algorithm based on public-key cryptography and anonymization. In this algorithm, the user updates the model and encrypts the result using a distant user's public key. The encrypted result is then transmitted through the network with the goal of reaching that specific user. The key idea is to hide the source's identity so that, when the destination user decrypts the result, it does not know who the source was. The challenge is to design a network-dependent probability distribution (at the source) over the potential destinations such that, from the receiver's perspective, all users have a similar likelihood of being the source. We introduce the problem and construct a scheme that provides anonymity with theoretical guarantees. We focus on random regular graphs to establish rigorous guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of monitoring machine learning models under gradual distribution shifts, where circumstances change slowly over time, often leading to unnoticed yet significant declines in accuracy. To address this, we propose Incremental Uncertainty-aware Performance Monitoring (IUPM), a novel label-free method that estimates performance changes by modeling gradual shifts using optimal transport. In addition, IUPM quantifies the uncertainty in the performance prediction and introduces an active labeling procedure to restore a reliable estimate under a limited labeling budget. Our experiments show that IUPM outperforms existing performance estimation baselines in various gradual shift scenarios and that its uncertainty awareness guides label acquisition more effectively compared to other strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning is essential for meeting legal obligations such as the right to be forgotten, which requires the removal of specific data from machine learning models upon request. While several approaches to unlearning have been proposed, existing solutions often struggle with efficiency and, more critically, with the verification of unlearning - particularly in the case of weak unlearning guarantees, where verification remains an open challenge. We introduce a generalized variant of the standard unlearning metric that enables more efficient and precise unlearning strategies. We also present an unlearning-aware training procedure that, in many cases, allows for exact unlearning. We term our approach MaxRR. When exact unlearning is not feasible, MaxRR still supports efficient unlearning with properties closely matching those achieved through full retraining.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws and Representation Learning in Simple Hierarchical Languages: Transformers vs. Convolutional Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do neural language models acquire a language's structure when trained for next-token prediction? We address this question by deriving theoretical scaling laws for neural network performance on synthetic datasets generated by the Random Hierarchy Model (RHM) -- an ensemble of probabilistic context-free grammars designed to capture the hierarchical structure of natural language while remaining analytically tractable. Previously, we developed a theory of representation learning based on data correlations that explains how deep learning models capture the hierarchical structure of the data sequentially, one layer at a time. Here, we extend our theoretical framework to account for architectural differences. In particular, we predict and empirically validate that convolutional networks, whose structure aligns with that of the generative process through locality and weight sharing, enjoy a faster scaling of performance compared to transformer models, which rely on global self-attention mechanisms. This finding clarifies the architectural biases underlying neural scaling laws and highlights how representation learning is shaped by the interaction between model architecture and the statistical properties of data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07081v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various domains such as social networks, molecular biology, or recommendation systems. Concurrently, different explanations methods of GNNs have arisen to complement its black-box nature. Explanations of the GNNs' predictions can be categorized into two types--factual and counterfactual. Given a GNN trained on binary classification into ''accept'' and ''reject'' classes, a global counterfactual explanation consists in generating a small set of ''accept'' graphs relevant to all of the input ''reject'' graphs. The transformation of a ''reject'' graph into an ''accept'' graph is called a recourse. A common recourse explanation is a small set of recourse, from which every ''reject'' graph can be turned into an ''accept'' graph. Although local counterfactual explanations have been studied extensively, the problem of finding common recourse for global counterfactual explanation remains unexplored, particularly for GNNs. In this paper, we formalize the common recourse explanation problem, and design an effective algorithm, COMRECGC, to solve it. We benchmark our algorithm against strong baselines on four different real-world graphs datasets and demonstrate the superior performance of COMRECGC against the competitors. We also compare the common recourse explanations to the graph counterfactual explanation, showing that common recourse explanations are either comparable or superior, making them worth considering for applications such as drug discovery or computational biology.</description>

      <title>Learning from Samples: Inverse Problems over measures via Sharpened Fenchel-Young Losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating parameters from samples of an optimal probability distribution is essential in applications ranging from socio-economic modeling to biological system analysis. In these settings, the probability distribution arises as the solution to an optimization problem that captures either static interactions among agents or the dynamic evolution of a system over time. Our approach relies on minimizing a new class of loss functions, called sharpened Fenchel-Young losses, which measure the sub-optimality gap of the optimization problem over the space of measures. We study the stability of this estimation method when only a finite number of sample is available. The parameters to be estimated typically correspond to a cost function in static problems and to a potential function in dynamic problems. To analyze stability, we introduce a general methodology that leverages the strong convexity of the loss function together with the sample complexity of the forward optimization problem. Our analysis emphasizes two specific settings in the context of optimal transport, where our method provides explicit stability guarantees: The first is inverse unbalanced optimal transport (iUOT) with entropic regularization, where the parameters to estimate are cost functions that govern transport computations; this method has applications such as link prediction in machine learning. The second is inverse gradient flow (iJKO), where the objective is to recover a potential function that drives the evolution of a probability distribution via the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) time-discretization scheme; this is particularly relevant for understanding cell population dynamics in single-cell genomics. Finally, we validate our approach through numerical experiments on Gaussian distributions, where closed-form solutions are available, to demonstrate the practical performance of our methods</description>

      <title>Causal View of Time Series Imputation: Some Identification Results on Missing Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series imputation is one of the most challenge problems and has broad applications in various fields like health care and the Internet of Things. Existing methods mainly aim to model the temporally latent dependencies and the generation process from the observed time series data. In real-world scenarios, different types of missing mechanisms, like MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR (Missing Not At Random) can occur in time series data. However, existing methods often overlook the difference among the aforementioned missing mechanisms and use a single model for time series imputation, which can easily lead to misleading results due to mechanism mismatching. In this paper, we propose a framework for time series imputation problem by exploring Different Missing Mechanisms (DMM in short) and tailoring solutions accordingly. Specifically, we first analyze the data generation processes with temporal latent states and missing cause variables for different mechanisms. Sequentially, we model these generation processes via variational inference and estimate prior distributions of latent variables via normalizing flow-based neural architecture. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results under the nonlinear independent component analysis framework to show that latent variables are identifiable. Experimental results show that our method surpasses existing time series imputation techniques across various datasets with different missing mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>FCPCA: Fuzzy clustering of high-dimensional time series based on common principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering multivariate time series data is a crucial task in many domains, as it enables the identification of meaningful patterns and groups in time-evolving data. Traditional approaches, such as crisp clustering, rely on the assumption that clusters are sufficiently separated with little overlap. However, real-world data often defy this assumption, exhibiting overlapping distributions or overlapping clouds of points and blurred boundaries between clusters. Fuzzy clustering offers a compelling alternative by allowing partial membership in multiple clusters, making it well-suited for these ambiguous scenarios. Despite its advantages, current fuzzy clustering methods primarily focus on univariate time series, and for multivariate cases, even datasets of moderate dimensionality become computationally prohibitive. This challenge is further exacerbated when dealing with time series of varying lengths, leaving a clear gap in addressing the complexities of modern datasets. This work introduces a novel fuzzy clustering approach based on common principal component analysis to address the aforementioned shortcomings. Our method has the advantage of efficiently handling high-dimensional multivariate time series by reducing dimensionality while preserving critical temporal features. Extensive numerical results show that our proposed clustering method outperforms several existing approaches in the literature. An interesting application involving brain signals from different drivers recorded from a simulated driving experiment illustrates the potential of the approach.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learning-based Surrogate Method for Stochastic Programs with Implicitly Decision-dependent Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of stochastic programming problems where the implicitly decision-dependent random variable follows a nonparametric regression model with heteroscedastic error. The Clarke subdifferential and surrogate functions are not readily obtainable due to the latent decision dependency. To deal with such a computational difficulty, we develop an adaptive learning-based surrogate method that integrates the simulation scheme and statistical estimates to construct estimation-based surrogate functions in a way that the simulation process is adaptively guided by the algorithmic procedure. We establish the non-asymptotic convergence rate analysis in terms of $(\nu, \delta)$-near stationarity in expectation under variable proximal parameters and batch sizes, which exhibits the superior convergence performance and enhanced stability in both theory and practice. We provide numerical results with both synthetic and real data which illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm in terms of algorithmic stability and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Online Episodic Convex Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study online learning in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with convex objective functions, known as the concave utility reinforcement learning (CURL) problem. This setting generalizes RL from linear to convex losses on the state-action distribution induced by the agent's policy. The non-linearity of CURL invalidates classical Bellman equations and requires new algorithmic approaches. We introduce the first algorithm achieving near-optimal regret bounds for online CURL without any prior knowledge on the transition function. To achieve this, we use an online mirror descent algorithm with varying constraint sets and a carefully designed exploration bonus. We then address for the first time a bandit version of CURL, where the only feedback is the value of the objective function on the state-action distribution induced by the agent's policy. We achieve a sub-linear regret bound for this more challenging problem by adapting techniques from bandit convex optimization to the MDP setting.</description>

      <title>Causal mediation analysis with one or multiple mediators: a comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mediation analysis breaks down the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome into an indirect effect, acting through a third group of variables called mediators, and a direct effect, operating through other mechanisms. Mediation analysis is hard because confounders between treatment, mediators, and outcome blur effect estimates in observational studies. Many estimators have been proposed to adjust on those confounders and provide accurate causal estimates. We consider parametric and non-parametric implementations of classical estimators and provide a thorough evaluation for the estimation of the direct and indirect effects in the context of causal mediation analysis for binary, continuous, and multi-dimensional mediators. We assess several approaches in a comprehensive benchmark on simulated data.  Our results show that advanced statistical approaches such as the multiply robust and the double machine learning estimators achieve good performances in most of the simulated settings and on real data. As an example of application, we propose a thorough analysis of factors known to influence cognitive functions to assess if the mechanism involves modifications in brain morphology using the UK Biobank brain imaging cohort. This analysis shows that for several physiological factors, such as hypertension and obesity, a substantial part of the effect is mediated by changes in the brain structure. This work provides guidance to the practitioner from the formulation of a valid causal mediation problem, including the verification of the identification assumptions, to the choice of an adequate estimator.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds and Stopping Rules for Learning with Self-Selected Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many learning paradigms self-select training data in light of previously learned parameters. Examples include active learning, semi-supervised learning, bandits, or boosting. Rodemann et al. (2024) unify them under the framework of "reciprocal learning". In this article, we address the question of how well these methods can generalize from their self-selected samples. In particular, we prove universal generalization bounds for reciprocal learning using covering numbers and Wasserstein ambiguity sets. Our results require no assumptions on the distribution of self-selected data, only verifiable conditions on the algorithms. We prove results for both convergent and finite iteration solutions. The latter are anytime valid, thereby giving rise to stopping rules for a practitioner seeking to guarantee the out-of-sample performance of their reciprocal learning algorithm. Finally, we illustrate our bounds and stopping rules for reciprocal learning's special case of semi-supervised learning.</description>

      <title>ICE-Pruning: An Iterative Cost-Efficient Pruning Pipeline for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pruning is a widely used method for compressing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), where less relevant parameters are removed from a DNN model to reduce its size. However, removing parameters reduces model accuracy, so pruning is typically combined with fine-tuning, and sometimes other operations such as rewinding weights, to recover accuracy. A common approach is to repeatedly prune and then fine-tune, with increasing amounts of model parameters being removed in each step. While straightforward to implement, pruning pipelines that follow this approach are computationally expensive due to the need for repeated fine-tuning.
  In this paper we propose ICE-Pruning, an iterative pruning pipeline for DNNs that significantly decreases the time required for pruning by reducing the overall cost of fine-tuning, while maintaining a similar accuracy to existing pruning pipelines. ICE-Pruning is based on three main components: i) an automatic mechanism to determine after which pruning steps fine-tuning should be performed; ii) a freezing strategy for faster fine-tuning in each pruning step; and iii) a custom pruning-aware learning rate scheduler to further improve the accuracy of each pruning step and reduce the overall time consumption. We also propose an efficient auto-tuning stage for the hyperparameters (e.g., freezing percentage) introduced by the three components. We evaluate ICE-Pruning on several DNN models and datasets, showing that it can accelerate pruning by up to 9.61x. Code is available at https://github.com/gicLAB/ICE-Pruning</description>

      <title>Identifying Causal Direction via Variational Bayesian Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Telling apart the cause and effect between two random variables with purely observational data is a challenging problem that finds applications in various scientific disciplines. A key principle utilized in this task is the algorithmic Markov condition, which postulates that the joint distribution, when factorized according to the causal direction, yields a more succinct codelength compared to the anti-causal direction. Previous approaches approximate these codelengths by relying on simple functions or Gaussian processes (GPs) with easily evaluable complexity, compromising between model fitness and computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging the variational Bayesian learning of neural networks as an interpretation of the codelengths. Consequently, we can enhance the model fitness while promoting the succinctness of the codelengths, while avoiding the significant computational complexity of the GP-based approaches. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks in cause-effect identification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the overall performance of related complexity-based and structural causal model regression-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Direct Density Ratio Optimization: A Statistically Consistent Approach to Aligning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for safe deployment, yet existing methods assume specific preference models like Bradley-Terry model. This assumption leads to statistical inconsistency, where more data doesn't guarantee convergence to true human preferences. To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel alignment method Direct Density Ratio Optimization (DDRO). DDRO directly estimates the density ratio between preferred and unpreferred output distributions, circumventing the need for explicit human preference modeling. We theoretically prove that DDRO is statistically consistent, ensuring convergence to the true preferred distribution as the data size grows, regardless of the underlying preference structure. Experiments demonstrate that DDRO achieves superior performance compared to existing methods on many major benchmarks. DDRO unlocks the potential for truly data-driven alignment, paving the way for more reliable and human-aligned LLMs.</description>

      <title>Modelling higher education dropouts using sparse and interpretable post-clustering logistic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher education dropout constitutes a critical challenge for tertiary education systems worldwide. While machine learning techniques can achieve high predictive accuracy on selected datasets, their adoption by policymakers remains limited and unsatisfactory, particularly when the objective is the unsupervised identification and characterization of student subgroups at elevated risk of dropout. The model introduced in this paper is a specialized form of logistic regression, specifically adapted to the context of university dropout analysis. Logistic regression continues to serve as a foundational tool among reliable statistical models, primarily due to the ease with which its parameters can be interpreted in terms of odds ratios. Our approach significantly extends this framework by incorporating heterogeneity within the student population. This is achieved through the application of a preliminary clustering algorithm that identifies latent subgroups, each characterized by distinct dropout propensities, which are then modeled via cluster-specific effects. We provide a detailed interpretation of the model parameters within this extended framework and enhance interpretability by imposing sparsity through a tailored variant of the LASSO algorithm. To demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed methodology, we present an extensive case study based on the Italian university system, in which all the developed tools are systematically applied</description>

      <title>Convergence of Time-Averaged Mean Field Gradient Descent Dynamics for Continuous Multi-Player Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approximation of mixed Nash equilibria (MNE) for zero-sum games with mean-field interacting players has recently raised much interest in machine learning. In this paper we propose a mean-field gradient descent dynamics for finding the MNE of zero-sum games involving $K$ players with $K\geq 2$. The evolution of the players' strategy distributions follows coupled mean-field gradient descent flows with momentum, incorporating an exponentially discounted time-averaging of gradients. First, in the case of a fixed entropic regularization, we prove an exponential convergence rate for the mean-field dynamics to the mixed Nash equilibrium with respect to the total variation metric. This improves a previous polynomial convergence rate for a similar time-averaged dynamics with different averaging factors. Moreover, unlike previous two-scale approaches for finding the MNE, our approach treats all player types on the same time scale. We also show that with a suitable choice of decreasing temperature, a simulated annealing version of the mean-field dynamics converges to an MNE of the initial unregularized problem.</description>

      <title>Langevin Diffusion Approximation to Same Marginal Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approximation to the same marginal Schr\"{o}dinger bridge using the Langevin diffusion. As $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$, it is known that the barycentric projection (also known as the entropic Brenier map) of the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge converges to the Brenier map, which is the identity. Our diffusion approximation is leveraged to show that, under suitable assumptions, the difference between the two is $\varepsilon$ times the gradient of the marginal log density (i.e., the score function), in $\mathbf{L}^2$. More generally, we show that the family of Markov operators, indexed by $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, derived from integrating test functions against the conditional density of the static Schr\"{o}dinger bridge at temperature $\varepsilon$, admits a derivative at $\varepsilon=0$ given by the generator of the Langevin semigroup. Hence, these operators satisfy an approximate semigroup property at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Instrumental Variable Inference with Many Weak Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study inference on linear functionals in the nonparametric instrumental variable (NPIV) problem with a discretely-valued instrument under a many-weak-instruments asymptotic regime, where the number of instrument values grows with the sample size. A key motivating example is estimating long-term causal effects in a new experiment with only short-term outcomes, using past experiments to instrument for the effect of short- on long-term outcomes. Here, the assignment to a past experiment serves as the instrument: we have many past experiments but only a limited number of units in each. Since the structural function is nonparametric but constrained by only finitely many moment restrictions, point identification typically fails. To address this, we consider linear functionals of the minimum-norm solution to the moment restrictions, which is always well-defined. As the number of instrument levels grows, these functionals define an approximating sequence to a target functional, replacing point identification with a weaker asymptotic notion suited to discrete instruments. Extending the Jackknife Instrumental Variable Estimator (JIVE) beyond the classical parametric setting, we propose npJIVE, a nonparametric estimator for solutions to linear inverse problems with many weak instruments. We construct automatic debiased machine learning estimators for linear functionals of both the structural function and its minimum-norm projection, and establish their efficiency in the many-weak-instruments regime.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Membership Inference Attacks on Machine Learning Models</title>

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIA) can reveal whether a particular data point was part of the training dataset, potentially exposing sensitive information about individuals. This article provides theoretical guarantees by exploring the fundamental statistical limitations associated with MIAs on machine learning models at large. More precisely, we first derive the statistical quantity that governs the effectiveness and success of such attacks. We then theoretically prove that in a non-linear regression setting with overfitting learning procedures, attacks may have a high probability of success. Finally, we investigate several situations for which we provide bounds on this quantity of interest. Interestingly, our findings indicate that discretizing the data might enhance the learning procedure's security. Specifically, it is demonstrated to be limited by a constant, which quantifies the diversity of the underlying data distribution. We illustrate those results through simple simulations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear functional regression by functional deep neural network with kernel embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning has been widely applied in functional data analysis (FDA) with notable empirical success. However, the infinite dimensionality of functional data necessitates an effective dimension reduction approach for functional learning tasks, particularly in nonlinear functional regression. In this paper, we introduce a functional deep neural network with an adaptive and discretization-invariant dimension reduction method. Our functional network architecture consists of three parts: first, a kernel embedding step that features an integral transformation with an adaptive smooth kernel; next, a projection step that utilizes eigenfunction bases based on a projection Mercer kernel for the dimension reduction; and finally, a deep ReLU neural network is employed for the prediction. Explicit rates of approximating nonlinear smooth functionals across various input function spaces by our proposed functional network are derived. Additionally, we conduct a generalization analysis for the empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithm applied to our functional net, by employing a novel two-stage oracle inequality and the established functional approximation results. Ultimately, we conduct numerical experiments on both simulated and real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of our functional net.</description>

      <title>Privacy of SGD under Gaussian or Heavy-Tailed Noise: Guarantees without Gradient Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The injection of heavy-tailed noise into the iterates of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has garnered growing interest in recent years due to its theoretical and empirical benefits for optimization and generalization. However, its implications for privacy preservation remain largely unexplored. Aiming to bridge this gap, we provide differential privacy (DP) guarantees for noisy SGD, when the injected noise follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution, which includes a spectrum of heavy-tailed distributions (with infinite variance) as well as the light-tailed Gaussian distribution. Considering the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP framework, we show that SGD with heavy-tailed perturbations achieves $(0, O(1/n))$-DP for a broad class of loss functions which can be non-convex, where $n$ is the number of data points. As a remarkable byproduct, contrary to prior work that necessitates bounded sensitivity for the gradients or clipping the iterates, our theory can handle unbounded gradients without clipping, and reveals that under mild assumptions, such a projection step is not actually necessary. Our results suggest that, given other benefits of heavy-tails in optimization, heavy-tailed noising schemes can be a viable alternative to their light-tailed counterparts.</description>

      <title>On Kernel-based Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we bridge Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and kernel density estimations (KDEs) by approximating the posterior by KDEs and deriving an upper bound of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in the evidence lower bound (ELBO). The flexibility of KDEs makes the optimization of posteriors in VAEs possible, which not only addresses the limitations of Gaussian latent space in vanilla VAE but also provides a new perspective of estimating the KL-divergence in ELBO. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the Epanechnikov kernel is the optimal choice in minimizing the derived upper bound of KL-divergence asymptotically. Compared with Gaussian kernel, Epanechnikov kernel has compact support which should make the generated sample less noisy and blurry. The implementation of Epanechnikov kernel in ELBO is straightforward as it lies in the "location-scale" family of distributions where the reparametrization tricks can be directly employed. A series of experiments on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA further demonstrate the superiority of Epanechnikov Variational Autoenocoder (EVAE) over vanilla VAE in the quality of reconstructed images, as measured by the FID score and Sharpness.</description>

      <title>Towards One Model for Classical Dimensionality Reduction: A Probabilistic Perspective on UMAP and t-SNE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17412v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP and t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a model introduced in Ravuri et al. (2023), that describes the graph Laplacian (an estimate of the data precision matrix) using a Wishart distribution, with a mean given by a non-linear covariance function evaluated on the latents. This interpretation offers deeper theoretical and semantic insights into such algorithms, and forging a connection to Gaussian process latent variable models by showing that well-known kernels can be used to describe covariances implied by graph Laplacians. We also introduce tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied.</description>

      <title>Demystifying SGD with Doubly Stochastic Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization objectives in the form of a sum of intractable expectations are rising in importance (e.g., diffusion models, variational autoencoders, and many more), a setting also known as "finite sum with infinite data." For these problems, a popular strategy is to employ SGD with doubly stochastic gradients (doubly SGD): the expectations are estimated using the gradient estimator of each component, while the sum is estimated by subsampling over these estimators. Despite its popularity, little is known about the convergence properties of doubly SGD, except under strong assumptions such as bounded variance. In this work, we establish the convergence of doubly SGD with independent minibatching and random reshuffling under general conditions, which encompasses dependent component gradient estimators. In particular, for dependent estimators, our analysis allows fined-grained analysis of the effect correlations. As a result, under a per-iteration computational budget of $b \times m$, where $b$ is the minibatch size and $m$ is the number of Monte Carlo samples, our analysis suggests where one should invest most of the budget in general. Furthermore, we prove that random reshuffling (RR) improves the complexity dependence on the subsampling noise.</description>

      <title>Causal Post-Processing of Predictive Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision makers across various domains rely on predictive models to guide individual-level intervention decisions. However, these models are typically trained to predict outcomes rather than causal effects, leading to misalignments when they are used for causal decision making. Experimental data to train effective causal effect models often is limited. To address this issue, we propose causal post-processing (CPP), a family of techniques for refining predictive scores to better align with causal effects using limited experimental data. Rather than training separate causal models for each intervention, causal post-processing can adapt existing predictive scores to support different decision-making requirements, such as estimating effect sizes, ranking individuals by expected effects, or classifying individuals based on an intervention threshold. We introduce three main CPP approaches -- monotonic post-processing, correction post-processing, and model-based post-processing -- each balancing statistical efficiency and flexibility differently. Through simulations and an empirical application in advertising, we demonstrate that causal post-processing improves intervention decisions, particularly in settings where experimental data is expensive or difficult to obtain at scale. Our findings highlight the advantages of integrating non-causal predictive models with experimental data, rather than treating them as competing alternatives, which provides a scalable and data-efficient approach to causal inference for decision making.</description>

      <title>Statistical Error Bounds for GANs with Nonlinear Objective Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are unsupervised learning methods for training a generator distribution to produce samples that approximate those drawn from a target distribution. Many such methods can be formulated as minimization of a metric or divergence between probability distributions. Recent works have derived statistical error bounds for GANs that are based on integral probability metrics (IPMs), e.g., WGAN which is based on the 1-Wasserstein metric. In general, IPMs are defined by optimizing a linear functional (difference of expectations) over a space of discriminators. A much larger class of GANs, which we here call $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs, can be constructed using $f$-divergences (e.g., Jensen-Shannon, KL, or $\alpha$-divergences) together with a regularizing discriminator space $\Gamma$ (e.g., $1$-Lipschitz functions). These GANs have nonlinear objective functions, depending on the choice of $f$, and have been shown to exhibit improved performance in a number of applications. In this work we derive statistical error bounds for $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs for general classes of $f$ and $\Gamma$ in the form of finite-sample concentration inequalities. These results prove the statistical consistency of $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs and reduce to the known results for IPM-GANs in the appropriate limit. Our results use novel Rademacher complexity bounds which provide new insight into the performance of IPM-GANs for distributions with unbounded support and have application to statistical learning tasks beyond GANs.</description>

      <title>Transformers Handle Endogeneity in In-Context Linear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the capability of transformers to address endogeneity in in-context linear regression. Our main finding is that transformers inherently possess a mechanism to handle endogeneity effectively using instrumental variables (IV). First, we demonstrate that the transformer architecture can emulate a gradient-based bi-level optimization procedure that converges to the widely used two-stage least squares $(\textsf{2SLS})$ solution at an exponential rate. Next, we propose an in-context pretraining scheme and provide theoretical guarantees showing that the global minimizer of the pre-training loss achieves a small excess loss. Our extensive experiments validate these theoretical findings, showing that the trained transformer provides more robust and reliable in-context predictions and coefficient estimates than the $\textsf{2SLS}$ method, in the presence of endogeneity.</description>

      <title>Discrete distributions are learnable from metastable samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physically motivated stochastic dynamics are often used to sample from high-dimensional distributions. However such dynamics often get stuck in specific regions of their state space and mix very slowly to the desired stationary state. This causes such systems to approximately sample from a metastable distribution which is usually quite different from the desired, stationary distribution of the dynamic. We rigorously show that, in the case of multi-variable discrete distributions, the true model describing the stationary distribution can be recovered from samples produced from a metastable distribution under minimal assumptions about the system. This follows from a fundamental observation that the single-variable conditionals of metastable distributions that satisfy a strong metastability condition are on average close to those of the stationary distribution. This holds even when the metastable distribution differs considerably from the true model in terms of global metrics like Kullback-Leibler divergence or total variation distance. This property allows us to learn the true model using a conditional likelihood based estimator, even when the samples come from a metastable distribution concentrated in a small region of the state space. Explicit examples of such metastable states can be constructed from regions that effectively bottleneck the probability flow and cause poor mixing of the Markov chain. For specific cases of binary pairwise undirected graphical models (i.e. Ising models), we extend our results to further rigorously show that data coming from metastable states can be used to learn the parameters of the energy function and recover the structure of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Soft Kernel Interpolation (SoftKI), a method that combines aspects of Structured Kernel Interpolation (SKI) and variational inducing point methods, to achieve scalable Gaussian Process (GP) regression on high-dimensional datasets. SoftKI approximates a kernel via softmax interpolation from a smaller number of interpolation points learned by optimizing a combination of the SoftKI marginal log-likelihood (MLL), and when needed, an approximate MLL for improved numerical stability. Consequently, it can overcome the dimensionality scaling challenges that SKI faces when interpolating from a dense and static lattice while retaining the flexibility of variational methods to adapt inducing points to the dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SoftKI across various examples and show that it is competitive with other approximated GP methods when the data dimensionality is modest (around 10).</description>

      <title>Using matrix-product states for time-series machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix-product states (MPS) have proven to be a versatile ansatz for modeling quantum many-body physics. For many applications, and particularly in one-dimension, they capture relevant quantum correlations in many-body wavefunctions while remaining tractable to store and manipulate on a classical computer. This has motivated researchers to also apply the MPS ansatz to machine learning (ML) problems where capturing complex correlations in datasets is also a key requirement. Here, we develop and apply an MPS-based algorithm, MPSTime, for learning a joint probability distribution underlying an observed time-series dataset, and show how it can be used to tackle important time-series ML problems, including classification and imputation. MPSTime can efficiently learn complicated time-series probability distributions directly from data, requires only moderate maximum MPS bond dimension $\chi_{\rm max}$, with values for our applications ranging between $\chi_{\rm max} = 20-160$, and can be trained for both classification and imputation tasks under a single logarithmic loss function. Using synthetic and publicly available real-world datasets, spanning applications in medicine, energy, and astronomy, we demonstrate performance competitive with state-of-the-art ML approaches, but with the key advantage of encoding the full joint probability distribution learned from the data, which is useful for analyzing and interpreting its underlying structure. This manuscript is supplemented with the release of a publicly available code package MPSTime that implements our approach. The effectiveness of the MPS-based ansatz for capturing complex correlation structures in time-series data makes it a powerful foundation for tackling challenging time-series analysis problems across science, industry, and medicine.</description>

      <title>Gaussian entropic optimal transport: Schr\"odinger bridges and the Sinkhorn algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport problems are regularized versions of optimal transport problems. These models play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. For finite spaces, these problems are commonly solved using Sinkhorn algorithm (a.k.a. iterative proportional fitting procedure). However, in more general settings the Sinkhorn iterations are based on nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations and exact finite-dimensional solutions cannot be computed.
  This article presents a finite-dimensional recursive formulation of the iterative proportional fitting procedure for general Gaussian multivariate models. As expected, this recursive formulation is closely related to the celebrated Kalman filter and related Riccati matrix difference equations, and it yields algorithms that can be implemented in practical settings without further approximations. We extend this filtering methodology to develop a refined and self-contained convergence analysis of Gaussian Sinkhorn algorithms, including closed form expressions of entropic transport maps and Schr\"odinger bridges.</description>

      <title>Learning to Fuse Temporal Proximity Networks: A Case Study in Chimpanzee Social Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can we identify groups of primate individuals which could be conjectured to drive social structure? To address this question, one of us has collected a time series of data for social interactions between chimpanzees. Here we use a network representation, leading to the task of combining these data into a time series of a single weighted network per time stamp, where different proximities should be given different weights reflecting their relative importance. We optimize these proximity-type weights in a principled way, using an innovative loss function which rewards structural consistency across time. The approach is empirically validated by carefully designed synthetic data. Using statistical tests, we provide a way of identifying groups of individuals that stay related for a significant length of time. Applying the approach to the chimpanzee data set, we detect cliques in the animal social network time series, which can be validated by real-world intuition from prior research and qualitative observations by chimpanzee experts.</description>

      <title>Inverse Covariance and Partial Correlation Matrix Estimation via Joint Partial Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for estimating sparse high-dimensional inverse covariance and partial correlation matrices, which exploits the connection between the inverse covariance matrix and linear regression. The method is a two-stage estimation method wherein each individual feature is regressed on all other features while positive semi-definiteness is enforced simultaneously. We derive non-asymptotic estimation rates for both inverse covariance and partial correlation matrix estimation. An efficient proximal splitting algorithm for numerically computing the estimate is also dervied. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Constraint-based causal discovery with tiered background knowledge and latent variables in single or overlapping datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the use of tiered background knowledge within constraint based causal discovery. Our focus is on settings relaxing causal sufficiency, i.e. allowing for latent variables which may arise because relevant information could not be measured at all, or not jointly, as in the case of multiple overlapping datasets. We first present novel insights into the properties of the 'tiered FCI' (tFCI) algorithm. Building on this, we introduce a new extension of the IOD (integrating overlapping datasets) algorithm incorporating tiered background knowledge, the 'tiered IOD' (tIOD) algorithm. We show that under full usage of the tiered background knowledge tFCI and tIOD are sound, while simple versions of the tIOD and tFCI are sound and complete. We further show that the tIOD algorithm can often be expected to be considerably more efficient and informative than the IOD algorithm even beyond the obvious restriction of the Markov equivalence classes. We provide a formal result on the conditions for this gain in efficiency and informativeness. Our results are accompanied by a series of examples illustrating the exact role and usefulness of tiered background knowledge.</description>

      <title>TODS: An Automated Time Series Outlier Detection System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.09822v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TODS, an automated Time Series Outlier Detection System for research and industrial applications. TODS is a highly modular system that supports easy pipeline construction. The basic building block of TODS is primitive, which is an implementation of a function with hyperparameters. TODS currently supports 70 primitives, including data processing, time series processing, feature analysis, detection algorithms, and a reinforcement module. Users can freely construct a pipeline using these primitives and perform end- to-end outlier detection with the constructed pipeline. TODS provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI), where users can flexibly design a pipeline with drag-and-drop. Moreover, a data-driven searcher is provided to automatically discover the most suitable pipelines given a dataset. TODS is released under Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/datamllab/tods.</description>

      <title>Effective Regularization Through Loss-Function Metalearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.00788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary computation can be used to optimize several different aspects of neural network architectures. For instance, the TaylorGLO method discovers novel, customized loss functions, resulting in improved performance, faster training, and improved data utilization. A likely reason is that such functions discourage overfitting, leading to effective regularization. This paper demonstrates theoretically that this is indeed the case for TaylorGLO. Learning rule decomposition reveals that evolved loss functions balance two factors: the pull toward zero error, and a push away from it to avoid overfitting. This is a general principle that may be used to understand other regularization techniques as well (as demonstrated in this paper for label smoothing). The theoretical analysis leads to a constraint that can be utilized to find more effective loss functions in practice; the mechanism also results in networks that are more robust (as demonstrated in this paper with adversarial inputs). The analysis in this paper thus constitutes a first step towards understanding regularization, and demonstrates the power of evolutionary neural architecture search in general.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13548v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human feedback is commonly utilized to finetune AI assistants. But human feedback may also encourage model responses that match user beliefs over truthful ones, a behaviour known as sycophancy. We investigate the prevalence of sycophancy in models whose finetuning procedure made use of human feedback, and the potential role of human preference judgments in such behavior. We first demonstrate that five state-of-the-art AI assistants consistently exhibit sycophancy across four varied free-form text-generation tasks. To understand if human preferences drive this broadly observed behavior, we analyze existing human preference data. We find that when a response matches a user's views, it is more likely to be preferred. Moreover, both humans and preference models (PMs) prefer convincingly-written sycophantic responses over correct ones a non-negligible fraction of the time. Optimizing model outputs against PMs also sometimes sacrifices truthfulness in favor of sycophancy. Overall, our results indicate that sycophancy is a general behavior of state-of-the-art AI assistants, likely driven in part by human preference judgments favoring sycophantic responses.</description>

      <title>Identifying Drivers of Predictive Aleatoric Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainability and uncertainty quantification are key to trustable artificial intelligence. However, the reasoning behind uncertainty estimates is generally left unexplained. Identifying the drivers of uncertainty complements explanations of point predictions in recognizing model limitations and enhancing transparent decision-making. So far, explanations of uncertainties have been rarely studied. The few exceptions rely on Bayesian neural networks or technically intricate approaches, such as auxiliary generative models, thereby hindering their broad adoption. We propose a straightforward approach to explain predictive aleatoric uncertainties. We estimate uncertainty in regression as predictive variance by adapting a neural network with a Gaussian output distribution. Subsequently, we apply out-of-the-box explainers to the model's variance output. This approach can explain uncertainty influences more reliably than complex published approaches, which we demonstrate in a synthetic setting with a known data-generating process. We substantiate our findings with a nuanced, quantitative benchmark including synthetic and real, tabular and image datasets. For this, we adapt metrics from conventional XAI research to uncertainty explanations. Overall, the proposed method explains uncertainty estimates with little modifications to the model architecture and outperforms more intricate methods in most settings.</description>

      <title>Integrating Large Language Models in Causal Discovery: A Statistical Causal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01454v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In practical statistical causal discovery (SCD), embedding domain expert knowledge as constraints into the algorithm is important for reasonable causal models reflecting the broad knowledge of domain experts, despite the challenges in the systematic acquisition of background knowledge. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel method for causal inference, in which SCD and knowledge-based causal inference (KBCI) with a large language model (LLM) are synthesized through ``statistical causal prompting (SCP)'' for LLMs and prior knowledge augmentation for SCD. The experiments in this work have revealed that the results of LLM-KBCI and SCD augmented with LLM-KBCI approach the ground truths, more than the SCD result without prior knowledge. These experiments have also revealed that the SCD result can be further improved if the LLM undergoes SCP. Furthermore, with an unpublished real-world dataset, we have demonstrated that the background knowledge provided by the LLM can improve the SCD on this dataset, even if this dataset has never been included in the training data of the LLM. For future practical application of this proposed method across important domains such as healthcare, we also thoroughly discuss the limitations, risks of critical errors, expected improvement of techniques around LLMs, and realistic integration of expert checks of the results into this automatic process, with SCP simulations under various conditions both in successful and failure scenarios. The careful and appropriate application of the proposed approach in this work, with improvement and customization for each domain, can thus address challenges such as dataset biases and limitations, illustrating the potential of LLMs to improve data-driven causal inference across diverse scientific domains.

      <title>Beyond DAGs: A Latent Partial Causal Model for Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are fundamental graph structures in causal modeling, but identifying the desired DAG from observational data often requires strong assumptions that may not hold in real-world scenarios, especially for latent causal models and complex multimodal data. This raises the question of whether we can relax or bypass the DAG assumption while maintaining practical utility. In this work, we propose a novel latent partial causal model for multimodal data, featuring two latent coupled variables, connected by an undirected edge, to represent the transfer of knowledge across modalities. Under specific statistical assumptions, we establish an identifiability result, demonstrating that representations learned by multimodal contrastive learning correspond to the latent coupled variables up to a trivial transformation. This result deepens our understanding of the why multimodal contrastive learning works, highlights its potential for disentanglement, and expands the utility of pre-trained models like CLIP. Synthetic experiments confirm the robustness of our findings, even when the assumptions are partially violated. Most importantly, experiments on a pre-trained CLIP model embodies disentangled representations, enabling few-shot learning and improving domain generalization across diverse real-world datasets. Together, these contributions push the boundaries of multimodal contrastive learning, both theoretically and, crucially, in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Halpern iteration in normed spaces and applications to reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12338v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the oracle complexity of the stochastic Halpern iteration with minibatch, where we aim to approximate fixed-points of nonexpansive and contractive operators in a normed finite-dimensional space. We show that if the underlying stochastic oracle has uniformly bounded variance, our method exhibits an overall oracle complexity of $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-5})$, to obtain $\varepsilon$ expected fixed-point residual for nonexpansive operators, improving recent rates established for the stochastic Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. Also, we establish a lower bound of $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-3})$ which applies to a wide range of algorithms, including all averaged iterations even with minibatching. Using a suitable modification of our approach, we derive a $O(\varepsilon^{-2}(1-\gamma)^{-3})$ complexity bound in the case in which the operator is a $\gamma$-contraction to obtain an approximation of the fixed-point. As an application, we propose new model-free algorithms for average and discounted reward MDPs. For the average reward case, our method applies to weakly communicating MDPs without requiring prior parameter knowledge.</description>

      <title>Lean Copilot: Large Language Models as Copilots for Theorem Proving in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural theorem proving combines large language models (LLMs) with proof assistants such as Lean, where the correctness of formal proofs can be rigorously verified, leaving no room for hallucination. With existing neural theorem provers pretrained on a fixed collection of data and offering valuable suggestions at times, it is challenging for them to continually prove novel theorems in a fully autonomous mode, where human insights may be critical. In this paper, we explore LLMs as copilots that assist humans in proving theorems. We introduce Lean Copilot, a general framework for running LLM inference natively in Lean. It enables programmers to build various LLM-based proof automation tools that integrate seamlessly into the workflow of Lean users. Lean users can use our pretrained models or bring their own ones that run either locally (with or without GPUs) or on the cloud. Using Lean Copilot, we build LLM-based tools that suggest proof steps, complete proof goals, and select relevant premises. Experimental results on the Mathematics in Lean textbook demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to existing rule-based proof automation in Lean (aesop). When assisting humans, Lean Copilot requires only 2.08 manually-entered proof steps on average (3.86 required by aesop); when automating the theorem proving process, Lean Copilot automates 74.2% proof steps on average, 85% better than aesop (40.1%). We open source all code and artifacts under a permissive MIT license to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Neural timescales from a computational perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural activity fluctuates over a wide range of timescales within and across brain areas. Experimental observations suggest that diverse neural timescales reflect information in dynamic environments. However, how timescales are defined and measured from brain recordings vary across the literature. Moreover, these observations do not specify the mechanisms underlying timescale variations, nor whether specific timescales are necessary for neural computation and brain function. Here, we synthesize three directions where computational approaches can distill the broad set of empirical observations into quantitative and testable theories: We review (i) how different data analysis methods quantify timescales across distinct behavioral states and recording modalities, (ii) how biophysical models provide mechanistic explanations for the emergence of diverse timescales, and (iii) how task-performing networks and machine learning models uncover the functional relevance of neural timescales. This integrative computational perspective thus complements experimental investigations, providing a holistic view on how neural timescales reflect the relationship between brain structure, dynamics, and behavior.</description>

      <title>BNEM: A Boltzmann Sampler Based on Bootstrapped Noised Energy Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09787v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing an efficient sampler capable of generating independent and identically distributed (IID) samples from a Boltzmann distribution is a crucial challenge in scientific research, e.g. molecular dynamics. In this work, we intend to learn neural samplers given energy functions instead of data sampled from the Boltzmann distribution. By learning the energies of the noised data, we propose a diffusion-based sampler, Noised Energy Matching, which theoretically has lower variance and more complexity compared to related works. Furthermore, a novel bootstrapping technique is applied to NEM to balance between bias and variance. We evaluate NEM and BNEM on a 2-dimensional 40 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a 4-particle double-well potential (DW-4). The experimental results demonstrate that BNEM can achieve state-of-the-art performance while being more robust.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching with Gaussian Process Priors for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative modeling, particularly diffusion models, have opened new directions for time series modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance in forecasting and synthesis. However, the reliance of diffusion-based models on a simple, fixed prior complicates the generative process since the data and prior distributions differ significantly. We introduce TSFlow, a conditional flow matching (CFM) model for time series combining Gaussian processes, optimal transport paths, and data-dependent prior distributions. By incorporating (conditional) Gaussian processes, TSFlow aligns the prior distribution more closely with the temporal structure of the data, enhancing both unconditional and conditional generation. Furthermore, we propose conditional prior sampling to enable probabilistic forecasting with an unconditionally trained model. In our experimental evaluation on eight real-world datasets, we demonstrate the generative capabilities of TSFlow, producing high-quality unconditional samples. Finally, we show that both conditionally and unconditionally trained models achieve competitive results across multiple forecasting benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Understanding Model Calibration -- A gentle introduction and visual exploration of calibration and the expected calibration error (ECE)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19047v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To be considered reliable, a model must be calibrated so that its confidence in each decision closely reflects its true outcome. In this blogpost we'll take a look at the most commonly used definition for calibration and then dive into a frequently used evaluation measure for model calibration. We'll then cover some of the drawbacks of this measure and how these surfaced the need for additional notions of calibration, which require their own new evaluation measures. This post is not intended to be an in-depth dissection of all works on calibration, nor does it focus on how to calibrate models. Instead, it is meant to provide a gentle introduction to the different notions and their evaluation measures as well as to re-highlight some issues with a measure that is still widely used to evaluate calibration.</description>

      <title>A Computational Theory for Efficient Mini Agent Evaluation with Causal Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21138v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to reduce the cost of experimental evaluation for agents, we introduce a computational theory of evaluation for mini agents: build evaluation model to accelerate the evaluation procedures. We prove upper bounds of generalized error and generalized causal effect error of given evaluation models for infinite agents. We also prove efficiency, and consistency to estimated causal effect from deployed agents to evaluation metric by prediction. To learn evaluation models, we propose a meta-learner to handle heterogeneous agents space problem. Comparing with existed evaluation approaches, our (conditional) evaluation model reduced 24.1\% to 99.0\% evaluation errors across 12 scenes, including individual medicine, scientific simulation, social experiment, business activity, and quantum trade. The evaluation time is reduced 3 to 7 order of magnitude per subject comparing with experiments or simulations.</description>

      <title>Topological Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching</title>

Abstract: Given two boundary distributions, the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem seeks the ``most likely`` random evolution between them with respect to a reference process. It has revealed rich connections to recent machine learning methods for generative modeling and distribution matching. While these methods perform well in Euclidean domains, they are not directly applicable to topological domains such as graphs and simplicial complexes, which are crucial for data defined over network entities, such as node signals and edge flows. In this work, we propose the Topological Schr\"odinger Bridge problem (TSBP) for matching signal distributions on a topological domain. We set the reference process to follow some linear tractable topology-aware stochastic dynamics such as topological heat diffusion. For the case of Gaussian boundary distributions, we derive a closed-form topological SB (TSB) in terms of its time-marginal and stochastic differential. In the general case, leveraging the well-known result, we show that the optimal process follows the forward-backward topological dynamics governed by some unknowns. Building on these results, we develop TSB-based models for matching topological signals by parameterizing the unknowns in the optimal process as (topological) neural networks and learning them through likelihood training. We validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical applications of TSB-based models on both synthetic and real-world networks, emphasizing the role of topology. Additionally, we discuss the connections of TSB-based models to other emerging models, and outline future directions for topological signal matching.</description>

      <title>Proofs as Explanations: Short Certificates for Reliable Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a model for explainable AI in which an explanation for a prediction $h(x)=y$ consists of a subset $S'$ of the training data (if it exists) such that all classifiers $h' \in H$ that make at most $b$ mistakes on $S'$ predict $h'(x)=y$. Such a set $S'$ serves as a proof that $x$ indeed has label $y$ under the assumption that (1) the target function $h^\star$ belongs to $H$, and (2) the set $S$ contains at most $b$ corrupted points. For example, if $b=0$ and $H$ is the family of linear classifiers in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and if $x$ lies inside the convex hull of the positive data points in $S$ (and hence every consistent linear classifier labels $x$ as positive), then Carath\'eodory's theorem states that $x$ lies inside the convex hull of $d+1$ of those points. So, a set $S'$ of size $d+1$ could be released as an explanation for a positive prediction, and would serve as a short proof of correctness of the prediction under the assumption of realizability.
  In this work, we consider this problem more generally, for general hypothesis classes $H$ and general values $b\geq 0$. We define the notion of the robust hollow star number of $H$ (which generalizes the standard hollow star number), and show that it precisely characterizes the worst-case size of the smallest certificate achievable, and analyze its size for natural classes. We also consider worst-case distributional bounds on certificate size, as well as distribution-dependent bounds that we show tightly control the sample size needed to get a certificate for any given test example. In particular, we define a notion of the certificate coefficient $\varepsilon_x$ of an example $x$ with respect to a data distribution $D$ and target function $h^\star$, and prove matching upper and lower bounds on sample size as a function of $\varepsilon_x$, $b$, and the VC dimension $d$ of $H$.</description>

      <title>Practical Efficiency of Muon for Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Muon, the simplest instantiation of a second-order optimizer, explicitly expands the Pareto frontier over AdamW on the compute-time tradeoff. We find that Muon is more effective than AdamW in retaining data efficiency at large batch sizes, far beyond the so-called critical batch size, while remaining computationally efficient, thus enabling more economical training. We study the combination of Muon and the maximal update parameterization (muP) for efficient hyperparameter transfer and present a simple telescoping algorithm that accounts for all sources of error in muP while introducing only a modest overhead in resources. We validate our findings through extensive experiments with model sizes up to four billion parameters and ablations on the data distribution and architecture.</description>

      <title>WATCH: Adaptive Monitoring for AI Deployments via Weighted-Conformal Martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Responsibly deploying artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) systems in high-stakes settings arguably requires not only proof of system reliability, but moreover continual, post-deployment monitoring to quickly detect and address any unsafe behavior. Statistical methods for nonparametric change-point detection -- especially the tools of conformal test martingales (CTMs) and anytime-valid inference -- offer promising approaches to this monitoring task. However, existing methods are restricted to monitoring limited hypothesis classes or ``alarm criteria'' (such as data shifts that violate certain exchangeability assumptions), do not allow for online adaptation in response to shifts, and/or do not enable root-cause analysis of any degradation. In this paper, we expand the scope of these monitoring methods by proposing a weighted generalization of conformal test martingales (WCTMs), which lay a theoretical foundation for online monitoring for any unexpected changepoints in the data distribution while controlling false-alarms. For practical applications, we propose specific WCTM algorithms that adapt online to mild covariate shifts (in the marginal input distribution) while quickly detecting and diagnosing more severe shifts, such as concept shifts (in the conditional label distribution) or extreme (out-of-support) covariate shifts that cannot be easily adapted to. On real-world datasets, we demonstrate improved performance relative to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>
