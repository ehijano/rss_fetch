      <title>Observation of Kolmogorov turbulence due to multiscale vortices in dusty plasma experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of fully developed Kolmogorov turbulence originating from self-excited vortex flows in a three-dimensional (3D) dust cloud. The characteristic -5/3 scaling of three-dimensional Kolmogorov turbulence is universally observed in both the spatial and temporal power spectra. Additionally, the 2/3 scaling in the second-order structure function further confirms the presence of Kolmogorov turbulence. We also identified a slight deviation in the tails of the probability distribution functions for velocity gradients. The dust cloud formed in the diffused region away from the electrode and above the glass device surface in the glow discharge experiments. The dust rotation was observed in multiple experimental campaigns under different discharge conditions at different spatial locations and background plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Generation of relativistic polarized electron beams via collective beam-target interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic polarized electron beams can find applications in broad areas of fundamental physics. Here, we propose for the first time that electron spin polarization can be realized efficiently via collective beam-target interactions. When a relativistic unpolarized electron beam is incident onto the surface of a solid target with a grazing angle, strong magnetic fields are induced at the target surface due to the formation of a high reflux of target electrons. This results in violent beam self-focusing and corresponding beam density increase via magnetic pinching. The pinched dense beam in turn further enhances the magnetic fields to the level of a few Giga-Gauss, which is high enough to trigger strong synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic electrons. During the interaction, electron spin polarization develops along the magnetic field direction, which is achieved via radiative spin flips in the quantum radiation-dominated regime. As a consequence, the incident electron beam can be effectively polarized via the spin-dependent radiation reaction, for example, the mean polarization of electrons with energy less than 2 GeV can reach above 50% for an initial 5GeV beam. This provides a robust way for the development of polarized electron sources.</description>

      <title>Guiding center Lagrangian and quasisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A charged particle in a suitably strong magnetic field spirals along the field lines while slowly drifting transversely. This note provides a brief derivation of an effective Lagrangian formulation for the guiding center approximation that captures this dynamics without resolving the gyro motion. It also explains how the effective Lagrangian may, for special magnetic fields, admit a ``quasisymmetry'' which can give rise to a conserved quantity helpful for plasma confinement in fields lacking a geometric isometry. The aim of this note is to offer a pedagogical introduction and some perspectives on this well established subject.</description>

      <title>Drift wave solitons and zonal flows: implication on staircase formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-consistent nonlinear interaction of drift wave (DW) and zonal flow (ZF) is investigated using nonlinear gyrokinetic theory, with both spontaneous excitation and beat-driven of ZF by DW treated on the same footing. DW solitons are formed in the nonlinear DW-ZF interactions and are confined between radially spaced micro-barriers. The resulting radial structures in the nonlinear DW-ZF interactions exhibit similar pattern to the ExB "staircase" observed in numerical simulations. These micro-barriers are generated by the repulsive response due to spontaneously excited ZF, which, as a general property demonstrated in this work, also generate an attractive nonlinear potential in DW equation. Meanwhile, the nonlinear potential due to beat-driven ZF is always attractive and, as such, always serve as potential well to contribute to soliton formation. For spontaneously excited ZF from initial noise, the simultaneous excitation of solitons and micro-barriers is found to be universal, due to the zero frequency nature of ZF and spatial structure of the Reynolds stress. The present analysis, thus, provides a potential first-principle-based interpretation of the ExB staircase observed in simulations, which may contribute to micro transport barriers formation and enhance plasma confinement.</description>

      <title>Non-Maxwellian Ion Distribution in the Equatorial and Auroral Electrojets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong electric fields in the auroral and equatorial electrojets can distort the background ion distribution function away from Maxwellian. We developed a collisional plasma kinetic model using the Boltzmann equation and a simple BGK collision operator which predicts a relatively simple relationship between the intensity of the background electric field and the resulting ion distribution function. To test the model, we perform 3-D plasma particle-in-cell simulations and compare the results to the model. The simulation applies an elastic collision operator assuming a constant ion-neutral collision rate. These simulations show less ion heating in the Pedersen direction than the analytic model but show similar overall heating. The model overestimates the heating in the Pedersen direction because the simple BGK operator includes no angular collisional scattering in the ion velocity space. On the other hand, the fully-kinetic particle-in-cell code is able to capture the physics of ion scattering in 3-D and therefore heats ions more isotropically. Although the simple BGK analytic theory does not precisely model the non-Maxwellian ion distribution function, it does capture the overall momentum and energy flows and therefore can provide the basis of further analysis of E-region wave evolution.</description>

      <title>Attosecond gamma-ray flashes and electron-positron pairs in dyadic laser interaction with micro-wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of an ultra-intense laser with matter is an efficient source of high-energy particles, with efforts directed towards narrowing the divergence and simultaneously increasing the brightness. In this paper we report on emission of highly collimated, ultrabright, attosecond $\gamma$-photons and generation of dense electron-positron pairs via a tunable particle generation scheme which utilizes the interaction of two high-power lasers with a thin wire target. Irradiating the target with a radially polarized laser pulse first produces a series of high charge, short duration, electron bunches with low transverse momentum. These electron bunches subsequently collide with a counter-propagating high intensity laser. Depending on the intensity of the counter-propagating laser, the scheme generates highly collimated ultra-bright GeV-level $\gamma$-beams and/or electron-positron plasma of solid density level.</description>

      <title>Estimated Heating Rates Due to Cyclotron Damping of Ion-scale Waves Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized waves consistent with parallel-propagating ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) and fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs) are often observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at ion kinetic scales. Such waves damp energy via the cyclotron resonance, with such damping expected to play a significant role in the enhanced, anisotropic heating of the solar wind observed in the inner heliosphere. We employ a linear plasma dispersion solver, PLUME, to evaluate frequencies of ICWs and FMWs in the plasma rest frame and Doppler-shift them to the spacecraft frame, calculating their damping rates at frequencies where persistently high values of circular polarization are observed. We find such ion-scale waves are observed during $20.37\%$ of PSP Encounters 1 and 2 observations and their plasma frame frequencies are consistent with them being transient ICWs. We estimate significant ICW dissipation onto protons, consistent with previous empirical estimates for the total turbulent damping rates, indicating that ICW dissipation could account for the observed enhancements in the proton temperature and its anisotropy with respect to the mean magnetic field.</description>
