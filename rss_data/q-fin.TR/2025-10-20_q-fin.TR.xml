      <title>SoK: Market Microstructure for Decentralized Prediction Markets (DePMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized prediction markets (DePMs) allow open participation in event-based wagering without fully relying on centralized intermediaries. We review the history of DePMs which date back to 2011 and includes hundreds of proposals. Perhaps surprising, modern DePMs like Polymarket deviate materially from earlier designs like Truthcoin and Augur v1. We use our review to present a modular workflow comprising seven stages: underlying infrastructure, market topic, share structure and pricing, trading, market resolution, settlement, and archiving. For each module, we enumerate the design variants, analyzing trade-offs around decentralization, expressiveness, and manipulation resistance. We also identify open problems for researchers interested in this ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Causal Interventions in Bond Multi-Dealer-to-Client Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The digitalization of financial markets has shifted trading from voice to electronic channels, with Multi-Dealer-to-Client (MD2C) platforms now enabling clients to request quotes (RfQs) for financial instruments like bonds from multiple dealers simultaneously. In this competitive landscape, dealers cannot see each other's prices, making a rigorous analysis of the negotiation process crucial to ensure their profitability. This article introduces a novel general framework for analyzing the RfQ process using probabilistic graphical models and causal inference. Within this framework, we explore different inferential questions that are relevant for dealers participating in MD2C platforms, such as the computation of optimal prices, estimating potential revenues and the identification of clients that might be interested in trading the dealer's axes. We then move into analyzing two different approaches for model specification: a generative model built on the work of (Fermanian, Gu\'eant, \&amp; Pu, 2017); and discriminative models utilizing machine learning techniques. Our results show that generative models can match the predictive accuracy of leading discriminative algorithms such as LightGBM (ROC-AUC: 0.742 vs. 0.743) while simultaneously enforcing critical business requirements, notably spread monotonicity.</description>
