      <title>Metric geometry for ranking-based voting: Tools for learning electoral structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the metric geometry of ranking statistics, proving that the two major permutation distances in the statistics literature -- Kendall tau and Spearman footrule -- extend naturally to incomplete rankings with both coordinate embeddings and graph realizations. This gives us a unifying framework that allows us to connect popular topics in computational social choice: metric preferences (and metric distortion), polarization, and proportionality.
  As an important application, the metric structure enables efficient identification of blocs of voters and slates of their preferred candidates. Since the definitions work for partial ballots, we can execute the methods not only on synthetic elections, but on a suite of real-world elections. This gives us robust clustering methods that often produce an identical grouping of voters -- even though one family of methods is based on a Condorcet-consistent ranking rule while the other is not.</description>

      <title>The metric geometry of paper surfaces under geometric constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quasisymmetric uniformization of a special class of metric surfaces known as paper surfaces, constructed as quotients of planar multipolygons via segment pairings, including infinite Type W identifications. These spaces, which arise naturally in dynamical settings, exhibit conic singularities and complex geometric structure. Our goal is to prove that a broad class of such surfaces satisfies Ahlfors 2-regularity and linear local contractibility, which together ensure the existence of a quasisymmetric parametrization onto the standard 2-sphere.</description>

      <title>ImprovEvolve: Ask AlphaEvolve to Improve the Input Solution and Then Improvise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-guided evolutionary computation, particularly AlphaEvolve, have demonstrated remarkable success in discovering novel mathematical constructions and solving challenging optimization problems. In this article, we present ImprovEvolve, a simple yet effective technique for enhancing LLM-based evolutionary approaches such as AlphaEvolve. Given an optimization problem, the standard approach is to evolve program code that, when executed, produces a solution close to the optimum. We propose an alternative program parameterization that maintains the ability to construct optimal solutions while reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. Specifically, we evolve a program (implementing, e.g., a Python class with a prescribed interface) that provides the following functionality: (1) propose a valid initial solution, (2) improve any given solution in terms of fitness, and (3) perturb a solution with a specified intensity. The optimum can then be approached by iteratively applying improve() and perturb() with a scheduled intensity. We evaluate ImprovEvolve on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: hexagon packing in a hexagon and the second autocorrelation inequality. For hexagon packing, the evolved program achieves new state-of-the-art results for 11, 12, 15, and 16 hexagons; a lightly human-edited variant further improves results for 14, 17, and 23 hexagons. For the second autocorrelation inequality, the human-edited program achieves a new state-of-the-art lower bound of 0.96258, improving upon AlphaEvolve's 0.96102.</description>

      <title>A new infinitesimal form of the Pr\'ekopa--Leindler inequality with multiplicative structure and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By differentiating a concavity principle arising from the Pr\'ekopa--Leindler inequality, we obtain a statement simultaneously strengthening the weighted boundary Poincar\'e inequality and the Brascamp--Lieb variance inequality. The resulting inequality possesses a multiplicative structure, which we exploit to develop an alternative to the (by now classical) $L_2$ method in the study of geometric and analytic inequalities. We apply this approach to derive a stability estimate for the weighted Poincar\'e inequality and to investigate the dimensional Brunn--Minkowski conjecture. In particular, in the latter setting, we obtain new reformulations together with several partial results.</description>

      <title>Expected area of the star hull of planar Brownian motion and bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the star hull of planar Brownian motion and bridge. Roughly speaking, this is the smallest starshaped set (with respect to the origin) that contains the trace of the path. In particular, we prove that the expected areas of the star hulls are $\frac{3\pi}{8}$ and $\frac{\pi}{4}$ for planar Brownian motion and bridge, respectively. Our proofs rely on a detailed analysis of the first hitting time and place of a horizontal ray $\mathcal{R}_\rho : = [\rho,\infty)\times\{0\}$ by planar Brownian motion starting at the origin. After deriving a remarkably simple Laplace transform of this joint law, we uncover via a probabilistic argument a surprising conditional structure: conditionally on the first hitting place being the point $(x,0)\in \mathcal{R}_\rho$, the hitting time is distributed as the first passage time to the level $x$ of one-dimensional Brownian motion starting at $0$.</description>

      <title>Cutoff Sobolev inequalities for local and non-local $p$-energies on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $p&gt;1$, we study subordination phenomena for local and non-local regular $p$-energies on metric measure spaces. Under suitable geometric assumptions, we show that if a local regular $p$-energy satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality together with a cutoff Sobolev inequality with scaling function $\Psi$, then all associated stable-like non-local $p$-energies with scaling functions strictly below $\Psi$ are regular and satisfy the corresponding non-local cutoff Sobolev inequalities. Moreover, if a stable-like non-local regular $p$-energy with scaling function $\Psi$ satisfies the corresponding non-local cutoff Sobolev inequality, then the same conclusion holds for all associated stable-like non-local $p$-energies with scaling functions below $\Psi$. These results provide a non-linear extension of the classical subordination principle beyond the Dirichlet form framework.</description>

      <title>Polarization of lattices: Stable cold spots and spherical designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the minimum of inhomogeneous Gaussian lattice sums: Given a lattice $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and a positive constant $\alpha$, the goal is to find the minimizers of $\sum_{x \in L} e^{-\alpha \|x - z\|^2}$ over all $z \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
  By a result of B\'etermin and Petrache from 2017 it is known that for steep potential energy functions - when $\alpha$ tends to infinity - the minimizers in the limit are found at deep holes of the lattice. In this paper, we consider minimizers which already stabilize for all $\alpha \geq \alpha_0$ for some finite $\alpha_0$; we call these minimizers stable cold spots.
  Generic lattices do not have stable cold spots. For several important lattices, like the root lattices, the Coxeter-Todd lattice, and the Barnes-Wall lattice, we show how to apply the linear programming bound for spherical designs to prove that the deep holes are stable cold spots. We also show, somewhat unexpectedly, that the Leech lattice does not have stable cold spots.</description>

      <title>From Brunn-Minkowski to Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb: discrete inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a general way to obtain Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb type inequalities from Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities and provide numerous examples. We use the same heuristic to prove a discrete version of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities for functions over $\mathbb{Z}^d$. These are the functional extensions of the discrete Brunn-Minkowski inequality conjectured by Ruzsa and recently established by Keevash, Tiba, and the author.</description>
