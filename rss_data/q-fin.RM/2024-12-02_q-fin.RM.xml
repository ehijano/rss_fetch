      <title>Self-protection and insurance demand with convex premium principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In economic analysis, rational decision-makers often take actions to reduce their risk exposure. These actions include purchasing market insurance and implementing prevention measures to modify the shape of the loss distribution. Under the assumption that the insureds' actions are fully observed by the insurer, this paper investigates the interaction between self-protection and insurance demand when insurance premiums are determined by convex premium principles within the framework of distortion risk measures. Specifically, the insured selects an optimal proportional insurance share and prevention effort to minimize the risk measure of their end-of-period exposure. We explicitly characterize the optimal combination of prevention effort and insurance demand in a self-protection model when the insured adopts tail value-at-risk and strictly convex distortion risk measures, respectively. Additionally, we conduct comparative static analyses to illustrate our main findings under various premium structures, risk aversion levels, and loss distributions. Our results indicate that market insurance and self-protection are complementary, supporting classical insights from the literature regarding corner insurance policies (i.e., null and full insurance) in the absence of ex ante moral hazard. Finally, we consider the effects of moral hazard on the interaction between self-protection and insurance demand. Our findings show that ex ante moral hazard shifts the complementary effect into substitution effect.</description>

      <title>Market Making in Spot Precious Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary challenge of market making in spot precious metals is navigating the liquidity that is mainly provided by futures contracts. The Exchange for Physical (EFP) spread, which is the price difference between futures and spot, plays a pivotal role and exhibits multiple modes of relaxation corresponding to the diverse trading horizons of market participants. In this paper, we model the EFP spread using a nested Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, in the spirit of the two-factor Hull-White model for interest rates. We demonstrate the suitability of the framework for maximizing the expected P\&amp;L of a market maker while minimizing inventory risk across both spot and futures. Using a computationally efficient technique to approximate the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem, our methodology facilitates strategy optimization on demand in near real-time, paving the way for advanced algorithmic market making that capitalizes on the co-integration properties intrinsic to the precious metals sector.</description>
