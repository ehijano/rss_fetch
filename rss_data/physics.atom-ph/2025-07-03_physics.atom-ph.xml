      <title>Electron Orbital Angular Momentum Polarization in Neutral Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the polarization of electron orbital angular momentum (OAM) in neutral atoms by integrating the Zeeman effect with attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS). Using density matrix simulations, we show that in a helium atom, the absorption probability asymmetry between mj=-1 and mj = 1 in the 1s2p state can be precisely controlled by adjusting the time delay between infrared (IR) and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) fields, the strength of an applied static magnetic field, as well as the angle between laser polarization and magnetic field direction. This approach has significant implications across various fields, including quantum computing, quantum communication, and spintronics. Moreover, it paves the way for advancements in applications such as manipulating chemical reactions control, tailoring the magnetic properties of matter, and enabling novel laser emissions.</description>

      <title>Laser-driven high-flux source of coherent quasi-monochromatic extreme ultraviolet radiation for coincidence spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a source of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation with a flux of 10$^{13}$ photons per second at 26.5 eV. The source is based on high-harmonic generation (HHG) in argon and pumped by a frequency-doubled 100 kHz repetition rate fiber laser providing 30 fs pulses centered at 515 nm. We report on the characterization of the source and the generated XUV radiation using optical imaging and photoelectron spectroscopy. The generated radiation is quasi-monochromatized using a suitably coated XUV mirror and used for coincidence spectroscopy of ions and electrons generated from a cold gas target. The high intensity of the focused XUV pulses is confirmed by the observation of two-photon double ionization in argon. Moreover, we measure the XUV pulse duration by cross-correlation with visible laser pulses in argon.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Differential Static Scalar Polarizability of the $^\mathbf{88}$Sr$^{+}$ Clock Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a precision measurement of the differential static scalar polarizability $\Delta\alpha_0$ of the ${}^{2}\!S_{1/2} \rightarrow {}^{2}\!D_{5/2}$ optical clock transition in the $^{88}$Sr$^{+}$ ion. The polarizability was determined from the 'magic' ion-trap drive frequency where the micromotion-induced second-order Doppler and quadratic Stark shifts cancel, using a single clock in an interleaved scheme by switching between minimized and large micromotion. By measuring at different Mathieu $q_z$ parameters, $\Delta\alpha_0$ can be obtained without prior knowledge of the angle between the rf electric field and the trap axis, which would otherwise dominate the systematic uncertainty. For validation, measurements were carried out at different micromotion levels and by displacing the ion in opposite directions. The results show excellent consistency and our value, $\Delta\alpha_0 = -4.8314(20)\times 10^{-40}\;\mathrm{J\, m^2/V^2} = -29.303(12)\;\mathrm{au}$, reduces the uncertainty by a factor of 3.5 compared to a previous measurement, while showing a discrepancy of $5 \sigma$. Our measurement reduces the polarizability-related uncertainty of the $^{88}$Sr$^{+}$ clock to $2.2\times 10^{-19}$ for a blackbody radiation temperature of 295 K -- a significant step towards total uncertainties ${&lt;}1\times10^{-18}$. Using existing polarizability transfer schemes, the result can reduce the uncertainty also for other ion species.</description>

      <title>Sub-Doppler cooling of bosonic strontium in a two-color MOT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a two-color magneto-optical trap that continuously operates on the $\mathrm{(5s^2)\:^1S_0-(5s5p)\:^1P_1}$ and $\mathrm{(5s5p)\:^3P_2-(5s5d)\:^3D_3}$ transitions in $\mathrm{^{88}Sr}$. Owing to the sub-Doppler cooling from the metastable $\mathrm{(5s5p)\:^3P_2}$ state, a bimodal momentum distribution is observed, with the cold part of the ensemble reaching a temperature of 105 $\mathrm{\mu}$K. A detailed simulation is established to explain the data. The absolute frequency of the $\mathrm{(5s5p)\:^3P_2-(5s5d)\:^3D_3}$ transition is measured to be 603 976 473 ${\pm}$ 2 MHz using a frequency comb, improving the literature value. The accompanying magnetic trap is characterized, and is shown to contribute to the sequential production of ensembles with temperatures down to 45 $\mathrm{\mu}$K.</description>

      <title>88Sr+ ion trap apparatus for generating 408 nm photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a 88Sr+ ion trap apparatus with the capability to produce high-quality 408 nm photons aimed at distributed quantum computing and networking applications. This instrument confines ion chains using a surface electrode trap with a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap as an atomic source. Several laser systems spanning 400-1100 nm are used to achieve high fidelity state preparation and readout. Photons are produced via the decay of an exited state, which is accessed using a custom 408 nm laser system that produces 150 ps optical pulses using non-linear photonics. We demonstrate single photon production through a Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurement for one to six ions.</description>

      <title>Phase-locked amplification enhanced by spin squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum lock-in amplification raises the detection sensitivity of magnetic fields to unprecedented level by phase-locked pumping the Zeeman levels of a single trapped atom. To further enhance this sensitivity, quadrature squeezing could be introduced to overcome the quantum uncertainty limit. We propose a detection scheme using an atomic ensemble whose collected spin is pumped by two lasers for simultaneous squeezing and phase locking. We derive the optimal $\pi/2$-pulse and $\pi$-pulse schemes that accomplishes this concurrent action and prove that the resulting phase sensitivity is enhanced while the usable detection window for phase locking is widened.</description>

      <title>A Liquid-Nitrogen-Cooled Ca+ Ion Optical Clock with a Systematic Uncertainty of 4.6E-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a single-ion optical clock based on the 4S_1/2-3D_5/2 transition of the 40Ca+ ion, operated in a liquid nitrogen cryogenic environment,achieving a total systematic uncertainty of 4.6E-19. We employ a refined temperature evaluation scheme to reduce the frequency uncertainty due to blackbody radiation (BBR), and the 3D sideband cooling has been implemented to minimize the second-order Doppler shift. We have precisely determined the average Zeeman coefficient of the 40Ca+ clock transition to be 14.345(40) Hz/mT^2, thereby significantly reducing the quadratic Zeeman shift uncertainty. Moreover, the cryogenic environment enables the lowest reported heating rate due to ambient electric field noise in trapped-ion optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter, fundamental high-energy processes, quantum metrology, and quantum algorithms. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Stable singular fractional skyrmion spin texture from the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology profoundly influences diverse fields of science, providing a powerful framework for classifying phases of matter and predicting nontrivial excitations, such as solitons, vortices, and skyrmions. These topological defects are typically characterized by integer numbers, called topological charges, representing the winding number in their order parameter field. The classification and prediction of topological defects, however, become challenging when singularities are included within the integration domain for calculating the topological charge. While such exotic nonlinear excitations have been proposed in the superfluid $^3$He-A phase and spinor Bose-Einstein condensate of atomic gases, experimental observation of these structures and studies of their stability have long been elusive. Here we report the observation of a singular skyrmion that goes beyond the framework of topology in a ferromagnetic superfluid. The exotic skyrmions are sustained by undergoing anomalous symmetry breaking associated with the eccentric spin singularity and carry half of the elementary charge, distinctive from conventional skyrmions or merons. By successfully realizing the universal regime of the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, we identified the eccentric fractional skyrmions, produced by emission from a magnetic domain wall and a spontaneous splitting of an integer skyrmion with spin singularities. The singular skyrmions are stable and can be observed after 2~s of hold time. Our results confirm the universality between classical and quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and broaden our understanding on complex nonlinear dynamics of nontrivial texture beyond skyrmion in topological quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Structured squeezed light allows for high-harmonic generation in classical forbidden geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a strong driving field interacts with a material, resulting in the frequency up-conversion of the driver into its high-order harmonics. This process is highly sensitive to the field's polarization: circular polarization, for instance, inhibits HHG. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of non-classical structured light enables HHG in this otherwise prohibitive configuration for classical drivers. We consider circularly polarized light with non-classical fluctuations, introduced via squeezing along one polarization direction, and show that these non-classical features prompt the HHG process. We find that the spectral properties of the emitted harmonics depend on the type of squeezing applied and, by analyzing the inner electron dynamics, we relate the observed differences to modifications of the HHG three-step mechanism induced by the specific squeezing type. This approach opens new pathways for integrating quantum optics in HHG, providing novel means of controlling the light-matter interaction dynamics.</description>
