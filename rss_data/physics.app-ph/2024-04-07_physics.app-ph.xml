      <title>Dualtronics: leveraging both faces of polar semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike non-polar semiconductors such as silicon, the broken inversion symmetry of the wide bandgap semiconductor gallium nitride leads to a large electronic polarization along a unique crystal axis. This makes the two surfaces of the semiconductor wafer perpendicular to the polar axis dramatically different in their physical and chemical properties. In the last three decades, the cation (gallium) face of gallium nitride has been used for photonic devices such as LEDs and lasers. Though the cation face has also been predominantly used for electronic devices, the anion (nitrogen) face has recently shown promise for high electron mobility transistors due to favorable polarization discontinuities. In this work we show that it is possible to make photonic devices on the cation face, and electronic devices on the anion face, of the same semiconductor wafer. This opens the possibility for dualtronics in polar semiconductors, where electronic, photonic, and acoustic properties can be implemented on opposite faces of the same wafer, dramatically enhancing the functional capabilities of this revolutionary semiconductor family.</description>

      <title>Thermal noise squeezing and amplification in parametrically driven resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we propose several methods with increasing precision for analytically estimating white noise squeezing in the frequency domain of classical parametrically-driven resonators with added noise. The analytical model is based on obtaining the response of the resonator to the added noise using Green's function. The response consists of three parts: elastic, down, and up parametric conversions. We obtain the Green's function approximately using the first-order averaging method or exactly, in principle, using Floquet theory. We characterize the noise squeezing by calculating the statistical properties of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of the resonator response to added noise. Furthermore, we observe that the squeezing effects occur only at half the parametric pump frequency. Due to correlation, the squeezing limit of $-6$~dB can be reached even with detuning around resonance near the instability threshold. Additionally, we validate some of our theoretical predictions of squeezing with the results obtained from the numerical integration of the stochastic differential equations of our model. We also applied our techniques to investigate squeezing in a pair of coupled parametric and harmonic resonators with a single noise input. The results obtained from Floquet theory can be applied generally to coupled</description>

      <title>WS$_2$ Monolayer Integration in a FAPbI$_3$-based Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating a monolayer of WS$_2$ via interface engineering enhances the overall physical properties of a FAPbI3 perovskite based heterostructure. FAPbI$_3$/WS$_2$/TiO$_2$/ITO and FAPbI$_3$/TiO$_2$/ITO heterostructures were analyzed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The configuration with WS$_2$ interlayer presents higher absorption in the visible region with a bandgap of {\aprox} 1.44 eV. WS$_2$ also enhances the deposition process of FAPbI$_3$, resulting in the formation of pure photoactive $\alpha$-phase without the non-photoactive $\delta$-phase nor residual plumbates. The incorporation of the monolayer improves the crystalline structure of the FAPbI$_3$, promoting a preferential growth in the [100] direction. The smooth surface of WS$_2$ favors a homogeneous morphology and an increase of the grain size to ~4.5 $\mu$m, the largest reported for similar structures. Furthermore, the work function obtained lets us propose an enhance an adequate energy band alignment between FAPbI$_3$ and the n-type layers for the electron flux to the cathode. These findings strongly suggest that the interfacial coupling of FAPbI$_3$/WS$_2$ could be a promising candidate in photovoltaic applications.</description>

      <title>Reliable operation in high-mobility indium oxide thin film transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transparent oxide semiconductors (TOSs) based thin-film transistors (TFTs) that exhibit higher field effect mobility (uFE) are highly required toward the realization of next-generation displays. Among numerous types of TOS-TFTs, In2O3-based TFTs are the front-running candidate because they exhibit the highest uFE ~100 cm2/Vs. However, the device operation of In2O3 TFTs is unreliable; a large voltage shift occurs especially when negative gate bias is applied due to adsorption/desorption of gas molecules. Although passivation of the TFTs is used to overcome such instability, previously proposed passivation materials did not improve the reliability. Here, we show that the In2O3 TFTs passivated with Y2O3 and Er2O3 films are highly reliable and do not show threshold voltage shifts when applying gate bias. We applied positive and negative gate bias to the In2O3 TFTs passivated with various insulating oxides and found that only the In2O3 TFTs passivated with Y2O3 and Er2O3 films did not exhibit threshold voltage shifts. We observed that only the Y2O3 grew heteroepitaxially on the In2O3 crystal. This would be the origin of the high reliability of the In2O3 TFTs passivated with Y2O3 and Er2O3 films. This finding accelerates the development of next-generation displays using high-mobility In2O3 TFTs.</description>

      <title>k-space Physics-informed Neural Network (k-PINN) for Compressed Spectral Mapping and Efficient Inversion of Vibrations in Thin Composite Laminates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vibrational response of structural components carries valuable information about their underlying mechanical properties, health status and operational conditions. This underscores the need for the development of efficient physics-based inversion algorithms which, given a limited set of sensing data points and in the presence of measurement noise, can reconstruct the response at locations where measurement data is not available and/or identify the unknown mechanical properties. Addressing this challenge, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach. PINNs seamlessly integrate governing equations into their architecture and have gained significant interest in solving inversion problems. In the context of learning and inversion of multimodal, multiscale vibrational responses, this paper introduces a novel spectral extension of PINNs, utilizing Fourier basis functions in the wavenumber domain, commonly known as k-space. The proposed k-space PINN (k-PINN), offers a robust framework for adjusting complexity and wavenumber composition of the response. Notably, the spectral formulation of k-PINN, coupled with the generally sparse representation of vibrations in k-space, facilitate efficient reconstruction and learning of broadband vibrations and alleviate the spectral bias associated with standard PINN. Additionally, the spectral solution space introduced by k-PINN substantially reduces the computational cost associated with computing physics-informed loss terms. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on reconstructing the bending vibrational mode shapes of a thin composite laminate and identifying its effective bending stiffness coefficients. It is shown that the proposed k-PINN methodology outperforms the standard PINN in terms of both learning and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Nanometer thick magneto-optical iron garnet films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we demonstrate nanometer thick iron garnet films suitable for the magneto-optical applica-tions. Bismuth-substituted iron garnet films of compositions Bi{_1}Y{_2}Fe{_5}O{_{12}} and Bi{_1}Tm{_2}Fe{_5}O{_{12}} deposited on gadolinium gallium garnet substrate are fabricated and characterized. Their thicknesses range from 2 to 10 nm, which corresponds to just a few crystal lattice constants. Faraday rotation of the nanofilms reaches 29.7 deg/{\mu}m at 420 nm which is comparable and even a bit better than single crystal micrometer thick films of similar composition. The film surface morphology by atomic force microscopy gives root mean square (RMS) roughness of the nanofilms as small as 0.13 nm that is also similar to the RMS of single crystal micrometer thick films. The Bi{_1}Tm{_2}Fe{_5}O{_{12}} films demonstrate effective uniaxial anisotropy. These all make the fabricated nanofilms very promising for their po-tential applications in magneto-optical devices and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Current-density-modulated Antiferromagnetic Domain Switching Revealed by Optical Imaging in Pt/CoO(001) Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient control of antiferromagnetic (AFM) domain switching in thin films is vital for advancing antiferromagnet-based memory devices. In this study, we directly observed the current-driven switching process of CoO AFM domains in the Pt/CoO(001) bilayer by the magneto-optical birefringence effect. The observed critical current density for AFM domain switching remains nearly constant across varying CoO thicknesses, associated with the consistent switching polarity n $\perp$ j, suggesting the dominance of the thermomagnetoelastic effect, where and stand for Neel vector and current density vector, respectively. Further confirmation comes from a similar switching process with n $\perp$ j observed in the Pt/Al2O3/CoO sample, excluding the contribution of spin current injection. Remarkably, it was also surprisingly observed that the Neel vector can be further switched parallel to the current direction (n//j) at higher current density. Our findings not only enhance the understanding of current-driven AFM domain switching but also present new avenues for manipulating AFM domains.</description>

      <title>Phase Binarization in Mutually Synchronized Bias Field-free Spin Hall Nano-oscillators for Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutually coupled spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNO) can exhibit binarized phase state, offering pathways to realize Ising machines and efficient neuromorphic hardware. Conventionally, phase binarization is achieved in coupled SHNOs via injecting an external microwave at twice of the oscillator frequency in presence of a biasing magnetic field. However, this technology poses potential challenges of higher energy consumption and complex circuit design. Moreover, fabrication-induced mismatch in SHNO dimensions may hinder mutual synchronization. Addressing these challenges, we demonstrate purely DC current-driven mutual synchronization and phase binarization of two non-identical nanoconstriction SHNOs without biasing magnetic field and microwave injection. We thoroughly investigate these phenomena and underlying mechanisms using micromagnetic simulation. We further demonstrate the bias field-free synchronized SHNO pair efficiently performing a reservoir computing benchmark learning task: sin and square wave classification, utilizing current tunable phase binarization. Our results showcase promising magnetization dynamics of coupled bias field-free SHNOs for future computing applications.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk-mitigated microelectronic control for optically-active spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To exploit the sub-nanometre dimensions of qubits for large-scale quantum information processing, corresponding control architectures require both energy and space efficiency, with the on-chip footprint of unit-cell electronics ideally micron-scale. However, the spin coherence of qubits in close packing is severely deteriorated by microwave crosstalk from neighbouring control sites. Here, we present a crosstalk-mitigation scheme using foundry microelectronics, to address solid-state spins at sub-100 um spacing without the need for qubit-detuning. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in nanodiamonds as qubit prototypes, we first demonstrate 10 MHz Rabi oscillation at milliwatts of microwave power. Implementing the active cancellation, we then prove that the crosstalk field from neighbouring lattice sites can be reduced to undetectable levels. We finally extend the scheme to show increased qubit control, tripling the spin coherence under crosstalk mitigation. Compatible with integrated optics, our results present a step towards scalable control across quantum platforms using silicon microelectronics.</description>
