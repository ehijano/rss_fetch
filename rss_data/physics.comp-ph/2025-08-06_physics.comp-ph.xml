      <title>Overcoming the Loss Conditioning Bottleneck in Optimization-Based PDE Solvers: A Novel Well-Conditioned Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization-based PDE solvers that minimize scalar loss functions have gained increasing attention in recent years. These methods either define the loss directly over discrete variables, as in Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL), or indirectly through a neural network surrogate, as in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, despite their promise, such methods often converge much more slowly than classical iterative solvers and are commonly regarded as inefficient. This work provides a theoretical insight, attributing the inefficiency to the use of the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which implicitly forms the normal equations, squares the condition number, and severely impairs optimization. To address this, we propose a novel Stabilized Gradient Residual (SGR) loss. By tuning a weight parameter, it flexibly modulates the condition number between the original system and its normal equations, while reducing to the MSE loss in the limiting case. We systematically benchmark the convergence behavior and optimization stability of the SGR loss within both the ODIL framework and PINNs-employing either numerical or automatic differentiation-and compare its performance against classical iterative solvers. Numerical experiments on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that, within the ODIL framework, the proposed SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster convergence than the MSE loss. Further validation within the PINNs framework shows that, despite the high nonlinearity of neural networks, SGR consistently outperforms the MSE loss. These theoretical and empirical findings help bridge the performance gap between classical iterative solvers and optimization-based solvers, highlighting the central role of loss conditioning, and provide key insights for the design of more efficient PDE solvers.</description>

      <title>Fermionic-Adapted Shadow Tomography for dynamical correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical correlation functions are essential for characterizing the response of the quantum many-body systems to the external perturbation. As their calculation is classically intractible in general, quantum algorithms are promising in this aspect, but most rely on brute force measurement strategies that evaluate one body observable pair per circuit. In this work, we introduce Fermionic-Adapted Shadow Tomography (FAST) protocols, a new framework for the efficient calculation of multiple dynamical correlation functions. The key idea is to reformulate these functions into forms that are compatible with shadow tomography techniques. The circuits in our protocols require at most two-copy measurements with uncontrolled Hamiltonian simulation. We show that the proposed protocols enhance sample efficiency and reduce the number of measurement circuits by an order of one or two with respect to the number of qubits across a range of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of flow in inflatable periodic structures with nonlinear effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a new type of weakly nonlinear two-scale model of inflatable periodic poroelastic structures saturated by Newtonian fluids. The periodic microstructures incorporate fluid inclusions connected to the fluid channels by admission and ejection valves respected by a 0D model. This induces a nonlinearity in the macroscopic Biot-type model, whereby the Darcy flow model governs the fluid transport due to the channels. Moreover, the fluid channels consist of compartments separated by semipermeable membranes inducing the pressure discontinuity. The homogenized model is derived under the small deformation assumption, however the equilibrium is considered in the Eulerian frame. Deformation-dependent homogenized coefficients of the incremental poroelasticity constitutive law and the permeability are approximated using the sensitivity analysis, to avoid coupled two-scale iterations. Numerical simulations illustrate the inflation process in time. Example of a bi-material cantilever demonstrates the inflation induced bending. The proposed two-scale model is intended to provide a computational tool for designing of porous metamaterials for fluid transport, or shape morphing with various potential applications.</description>

      <title>Machine learning potential for predicting thermal conductivity of {\theta}-phase and amorphous Tantalum Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tantalum nitride (TaN) has attracted considerable attention due to its unique electronic and thermal properties, high thermal conductivity, and applications in electronic components. However, for the {\theta}-phase of TaN, significant discrepancies exist between previous experimental measurements and theoretical predictions. In this study, deep potential models for TaN in both the {\theta}-phase and amorphous phase were developed and employed in molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the thermal conductivities of bulk and nanofilms. The simulation results were compared with reported experimental and theoretical results, and the mechanism for differences were discussed. This study provides insights into the thermal transport mechanisms of TaN, offering guidance for its application in advanced electronic and thermal management devices.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation of Path Integrals of Killed Processes Using Confined Stochastic Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expectations of path integrals of killed stochastic processes play a central role in several applications across physics, chemistry, and finance. Simulation-based evaluation of these functionals is often biased and numerically expensive due to the need to explicitly approximate stochastic paths and the challenge of correctly modeling them in the neighborhood of the killing boundary. We consider It\^{o} processes killed at the boundary of some set in the $n$-dimensional space and introduce a novel stochastic method with negligible bias and lower computational cost to evaluate path integrals without simulated paths. Our approach draws a connection between stochastic bridges and killed processes to sample only exit times and locations instead of the full path. We apply it to a Wiener process killed in the $n$-ball and explicitly derive the density of the Brownian bridge confined to the $n$-ball for $n = 1, 2, 3$. Finally, we present two numerical examples that demonstrate the efficiency and negligible bias of the novel procedure compared to an evaluation using the standard Euler-Maruyama method.</description>

      <title>Moment Estimate and Variational Approach for Learning Generalized Diffusion with Non-gradient Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven learning framework for identifying governing laws of generalized diffusions with non-gradient components. By combining energy dissipation laws with a physically consistent penalty and first-moment evolution, we design a two-stage method to recover the pseudo-potential and rotation in the pointwise orthogonal decomposition of a class of non-gradient drifts in generalized diffusions. Our two-stage method is applied to complex generalized diffusion processes including dissipation-rotation dynamics, rough pseudo-potentials and noisy data. Representative numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for learning physical laws in non-gradient generalized diffusions.</description>

      <title>A practical recipe for variable-step finite differences via equidistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a short, reproducible workflow for applying finite differences on nonuniform grids determined by a positive weight function g. The grid is obtained by equidistribution, mapping uniform computational coordinates $\xi\in[0,1]$ to physical space by the cumulative integral $S(x)=\int_a^x\!1/g(s)\,ds$ and its inverse, and in multiple dimensions by the corresponding variable-diffusion (harmonic) mapping with tensor $P=(1/g)I$. We then use the standard three-point central stencils on uneven spacing for first and second derivatives. We collect the formulas, state the mild constraints on g (positivity, boundedness, integrability), and provide a small reference implementation. Finally, we solve the 2D time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for a harmonic oscillator on uniform vs. variable meshes, showing the expected improvement in resolving localized eigenfunctions without increasing matrix size. We intend this note as a how-to reference rather than a new method, consolidating widely used ideas into a single, ready-to-use recipe, claiming no novelty.</description>

      <title>CrystalGRW: Generative Modeling of Crystal Structures with Targeted Properties via Geodesic Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided hierarchical neural networks for Maxwell's equations in plasmonic metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML) has found multiple applications in photonics, traditional "black box" ML models typically require prohibitively large training data sets. Generation of such data, as well as the training processes themselves, consume significant resources, often limiting practical applications of ML. Here we demonstrate that embedding Maxwell's equations into ML design and training significantly reduces the required amount of data and improves the physics-consistency and generalizability of ML models, opening the road to practical ML tools that do not need extremely large training sets. The proposed physics-guided machine learning (PGML) approach is illustrated on the example of predicting complex field distributions within hyperbolic metamaterial photonic funnels, based on multilayered plasmonic-dielectric composites. The hierarchical network design used in this study enables knowledge transfer and points to the emergence of effective medium theories within neural networks.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws Surpass Chemical Accuracy for the Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, that neural scaling laws can deliver near-exact solutions to the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation across a broad range of realistic molecules. This progress is enabled by the Lookahead Variational Algorithm (LAVA), an effective optimization scheme that systematically translates increased model size and computational resources into greatly improved energy accuracy for neural network wavefunctions. Across all tested cases, including benzene, the absolute energy error exhibits a systematic power-law decay with respect to model capacity and computation resources. The resulting energies not only surpass the 1 kcal/mol "chemical-accuracy" threshold but also achieve 1 kJ/mol subchemical accuracy. Beyond energies, the scaled-up neural network also yields better wavefunctions with improved physical symmetries, alongside accurate electron densities, dipole moments, and other important properties. Our approach offers a promising way forward to addressing many long-standing challenges in quantum chemistry. For instance, we improve energetic properties for systems such as the potential energy curve of nitrogen dimer as dissociation is approached and the cyclobutadiene automerization reaction barrier, producing definitive benchmarks, particularly in regimes where experimental data are sparse or highly uncertain. We also shed light on the decades-old puzzle of the cyclic ozone stability with highly accurate calculations for the cyclic-to-open ozone barrier. These results provide near-exact reference calculations with unprecedented accuracy, universal reliability and practical applicability, establishing a foundation for AI-driven quantum chemistry.</description>
