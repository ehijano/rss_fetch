      <title>Human Cardiac Measurements with Diamond Magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate direct, non-invasive and non-contact detection of human cardiac magnetic signals using quantum sensors based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Three configurations were employed recording magnetocardiography (MCG) signals in various shielded and unshielded environments. The signals were averaged over a few hundreds up to several thousands of heart beats to detect the MCG traces. The compact room-temperature NV sensors exhibit sensitivities of 6-26 pT/Hz^(1/2) with active sensing volumes below 0.5 mm^3, defining the performance level of the demonstrated MCG measurements. While the present signals are obtained by averaging, this performance already indicates a clear path toward single-shot MCG sensing. To move beyond shielded environments toward practical clinical use, strong noise suppression is required. To this end, we implement NV-based gradiometry and achieve efficient common-mode noise rejection, enabled by the intrinsically small sensing volume of NV sensors. Together, these multi-platform results obtained across diverse magnetic environments provide a solid foundation for translating quantum sensors into human medical diagnostics such as MCG and magnetoencephalography (MEG).</description>

      <title>On the Application of Fractional Order Derivatives for Characterizing Brain White Matter Viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional viscoelastic characterization of brain white matter (BWM), typically described using Prony series models, remains a largely empirical representation that is difficult to interpret physically. Growing evidence suggests that BWMviscoelasticity follows power-law behavior. Under the assumptions of linear viscoelasticity and causality, a power-law model in the frequency domain yields a fractional viscoelastic model in the time domain.
  A fractional viscoelastic constitutive model for the axon and extracellular matrix (ECM) is implemented via a Fortran VUMAT subroutine. A biphasic periodic finite element (FE) model of hexagonally packed representative volume elements (RVEs) of axons embedded in an ECM is constructed in Abaqus under quasi-static loading. The inverse problem of extracting homogenized material properties is solved using an optimization workflow. The model predicts that the springpot coefficient, which determines the solid-fluid behavior and, the power-law exponent, which encodes information about the underlying tissue architecture, follows a bi-logistic function along the transverse normal and shear directions. The nonlinear variation of the parameters reveals two distinct stiffening stages: a lower rate at low axon volume fractions, followed by a higher rate as increased axonal content reinforces the RVE.
  To our knowledge, this study is the first to propose and implement a 3D fractional viscoelastic FE model of the corpus callosum of BWM in the time domain. The thread-safe implementation of the VUMAT achieves significantly faster performance than existing approaches. The results reveal nonlinear variation in material parameters, directional dependence of BWM mechanics, and the complex interplay among microstructural elements.</description>

      <title>OCTA-Based Biomarker Characterization in nAMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to enhance ophthalmologists' decision-making when diagnosing the Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (nAMD). We developed three tools to analyze Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography images: (1) extracting biomarkers such as mCNV area and vessel density using image processing; (2) generating a 3D visualization of the neovascularization for a better view of the affected regions; and (3) applying an ensemble of three white box machine learning algorithms (decision tree, support vector machines and DL-Learner) for nAMD diagnosis. The learned expressions reached 100% accuracy for the training data and 68% accuracy in testing. The main advantage is that all the learned models white-box, which ensures explainability and transparency, allowing clinicians to better understand the decision-making process.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Simulation of Effective Transverse Relaxation (T2*)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To simulate effective transverse relaxation ($T_2^*$) as a part of MR simulation. $T_2^*$ consists of reversible ($T_2^{\prime}$) and irreversible ($T_2$) components. Whereas simulations of $T_2$ are easy, $T_2^{\prime}$ is not easily simulated if only magnetizations of individual isochromats are simulated.
  Theory and Methods: Efficient methods for simulating $T_2^{\prime}$ were proposed. To approximate the Lorentzian function of $T_2^{\prime}$ realistically, conventional simulators require 100+ isochromats. This approximation can be avoided by utilizing a linear phase model for simulating an entire Lorentzian function directly. To represent the linear phase model, the partial derivatives of the magnetizations with respect to the frequency axis were also simulated. To accelerate the simulations with these partial derivatives, the proposed methods introduced two techniques: analytic solutions, and combined transitions. For understanding the fundamental mechanism of the proposed method, a simple one-isochromat simulation was performed. For evaluating realistic cases, several pulse sequences were simulated using two phantoms with and without $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations.
  Results: The one-isochromat simulation demonstrated that $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations were possible. In the realistic cases, $T_2^{\prime}$ was recovered as expected without using 100+ isochromats for each point. The computational times with $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations were only 2.0 to 2.7 times longer than those without $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations. When the above-mentioned two techniques were utilized, the analytic solutions accelerated 19 times, and the combined transitions accelerated up to 17 times.
  Conclusion: Both theory and results showed that the proposed methods simulated $T_2^{\prime}$ efficiently by utilizing a linear model with a Lorentzian function, analytic solutions, and combined transitions.</description>

      <title>Experimental and computational dosimetry in an integrated workflow for remote audits in Ir-192 interstitial brachytherapy: Development and pilot implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: This work describes the development and pilot implementation of a comprehensive remote dosimetry audit for Ir-192 high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy, integrating independent experimental and computational dosimetry within a unified workflow.Methods: A compact water-equivalent phantom accommodating two plastic catheters, ten optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters (OSLDs), and two radiochromic films was designed to enable independent point-approximating and 2D dose measurements. A user-selected treatment plan with 36 source dwell positions was generated in a clinical treatment planning system (TPS), accounting for dosimeter dose ranges. Computational audit testing was performed by analyzing DICOM-RT files and conducting Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to obtain independent 3D dose calculations for the same plan and phantom geometry. Dosimetry results were compared to TPS calculations (TG43 and a Model Based Dose Calculation Algorithm, MBDCA) using the 3D Gamma Index (GI) test, dose difference maps, and dose-volume histogram comparisons, wherever applicable. Procedures were optimized to minimize clinical workload.Results:The pilot study was completed within ten days of phantom delivery. Measurement corrections were applied when necessary using correction factors from side studies. GI criteria were adapted to the uncertainty of each dosimetry system. Excellent agreement between MBDCA and experimental or MC results was observed. Within the volume of interest, TG-43 systematically overestimated dose relative to MC results (median difference: +2.16%), attributed to missing scatter conditions and phantom material.Conclusion:Despite the labor-intensive workflow, the protocol is suitable for remote Ir-192 audits with acceptable uncertainties. Combining experimental and computational dosimetry enhances audit robustness and supports comprehensive brachytherapy auditing programs.</description>

      <title>Predictive Dosimetry in PSMA-Targeted Radiopharmaceutical Therapies: A PBPK Modeling and Machine Learning Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive dosimetry is central to enabling personalized radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT), particularly in prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted theranostics. In this work, we develop a three layer computational framework that integrates physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling with machine learning (ML) to predict both physical (AUC, absorbed dose) and biological (BED, EQD2) dosimetric endpoints in tumors and major organs. In the first layer, we generated 640 virtual patients using PBPK simulations of F-18, Ga-68, and Cu-64 labeled PSMA PET tracers paired with Lu-177 PSMA therapy, producing 15360 tumor and organ time activity curves (TACs) under realistic biological variability and PET-like noise. In the second layer, TACs were transformed into quantitative kinetic features and mapped to physical and biological dose metrics. In the third layer, ML models (Random Forest, Extra Trees, Ridge, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) were trained to predict RPT doses from PET derived features, with performance evaluated using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R2. Cu-64 PSMA-617 based PET yielded the most robust predictions, achieving tumor dose MAPE as low as 8 percent and 10 to 20 percent for normal organs, while F-18 DCFPyL showed volume dependent performance and Ga-68 PSMA-11 exhibited higher variability. SHAP analysis revealed that peak uptake, clearance, and early kinetic features dominated predictive performance across organs and endpoints. This PBPK ML framework enables scalable, physiology informed predictive dosimetry and provides a foundation for trial design and patient specific treatment planning in PSMA targeted RPT. These results demonstrate that pre therapy PET can serve as a reliable surrogate for post therapy dosimetry, enabling scalable personalization of PSMA targeted RPT.</description>
