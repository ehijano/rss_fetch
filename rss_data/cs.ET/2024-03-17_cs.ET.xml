      <title>NN-Defined Modulator: Reconfigurable and Portable Software Modulator on IoT Gateways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physical-layer modulator is a vital component for an IoT gateway to map the symbols to signals. However, due to the soldered hardware chipsets on the gateway's motherboards or the diverse toolkits on different platforms for the software radio, the existing solutions either have limited extensibility or are platform-specific. Such limitation is hard to ignore when modulation schemes and hardware platforms have become extremely diverse. This paper presents a new paradigm of using neural networks as an abstraction layer for physical layer modulators in IoT gateway devices, referred to as NN-defined modulators. Our approach addresses the challenges of extensibility and portability for multiple technologies on various hardware platforms. The proposed NN-defined modulator uses a model-driven methodology rooted in solid mathematical foundations while having native support for hardware acceleration and portability to heterogeneous platforms. We conduct the evaluation of NN-defined modulators on different platforms, including Nvidia Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi. Evaluations demonstrate that our NN-defined modulator effectively operates as conventional modulators and provides significant efficiency gains (up to $4.7\times$ on Nvidia Jetson Nano and $1.1\times$ on Raspberry Pi), indicating high portability. Furthermore, we show the real-world applications using our NN-defined modulators to generate ZigBee and WiFi packets, which are compliant with commodity TI CC2650 (ZigBee) and Intel AX201 (WiFi NIC), respectively.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-enabled Circular Economy -- Collaborative Responsibility in Solar Panel Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of renewable energy resources, such as solar power, is on the rise. However, the excessive installation and lack of recycling facilities pose environmental risks. This paper suggests a circular economy approach to address the issue. By implementing blockchain technology, the end-of-life (EOL) of solar panels can be tracked, and responsibilities can be assigned to relevant stakeholders. The degradation of panels can be monetized by tracking users' energy-related activities, and these funds can be used for future recycling. A new coin, the recycling coin (RC-Coin), incentivizes solar panel recycling and utilizes decentralized finance to stabilize the coin price and supply issue.</description>

      <title>On the Theory of Quantum and Towards Practical Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing exposes the brilliance of quantum mechanics through computer science and, as such, gives oneself a marvelous and exhilarating journey to go through. This article leads along that journey with a historical and current outlook on quantum computation that is geared toward computer experts but also to experts from other disciplines as well. It is an article that will bridge the vast gap between classical and quantum computation and open an entering wedge through which one will be able to both bring himself up to speed on quantum computation and, intrinsically, in a straightforward manner, become acquainted with it. We are indeed in luck to be living in an age where computing is being reinvented, and not only seeing history in the making firsthand but, in fact, having the opportunity to be the ones who are reinventing--and that is quite a thought.</description>

      <title>A Novel Nuanced Conversation Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models in Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the conversation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can help lead to its more cautious and appropriate deployment. This is especially important for safety-critical domains like mental health, where someone's life may depend on the exact wording of a response to an urgent question. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for evaluating the nuanced conversation abilities of LLMs. Within it, we develop a series of quantitative metrics developed from literature on using psychotherapy conversation analysis literature. While we ensure that our framework and metrics are transferable by researchers to relevant adjacent domains, we apply them to the mental health field. We use our framework to evaluate several popular frontier LLMs, including some GPT and Llama models, through a verified mental health dataset. Our results show that GPT4 Turbo can perform significantly more similarly to verified therapists than other selected LLMs. We conduct additional analysis to examine how LLM conversation performance varies across specific mental health topics. Our results indicate that GPT4 Turbo performs well in achieving high correlation with verified therapists in particular topics such as Parenting and Relationships. We believe our contributions will help researchers develop better LLMs that, in turn, will more positively support people's lives.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series: Contrastive or Generative?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a powerful approach to learning representations from large-scale unlabeled data, showing promising results in time series analysis. The self-supervised representation learning can be categorized into two mainstream: contrastive and generative. In this paper, we will present a comprehensive comparative study between contrastive and generative methods in time series. We first introduce the basic frameworks for contrastive and generative SSL, respectively, and discuss how to obtain the supervision signal that guides the model optimization. We then implement classical algorithms (SimCLR vs. MAE) for each type and conduct a comparative analysis in fair settings. Our results provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and offer practical recommendations for choosing suitable SSL methods. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the broader field of representation learning and propose future research directions.

      <title>Large Language Models to Generate System-Level Test Programs Targeting Non-functional Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: System-Level Test (SLT) has been a part of the test flow for integrated circuits for over a decade and still gains importance. However, no systematic approaches exist for test program generation, especially targeting non-functional properties of the Device under Test (DUT). Currently, test engineers manually compose test suites from off-the-shelf software, approximating the end-user environment of the DUT. This is a challenging and tedious task that does not guarantee sufficient control over non-functional properties. This paper proposes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate test programs. We take a first glance at how pre-trained LLMs perform in test program generation to optimize non-functional properties of the DUT. Therefore, we write a prompt to generate C code snippets that maximize the instructions per cycle of a super-scalar, out-of-order architecture in simulation. Additionally, we apply prompt and hyperparameter optimization to achieve the best possible results without further training.</description>

      <title>The Goldilocks Principle of Learning Unitaries by Interlacing Fixed Operators with Programmable Phase Shifters on a Photonic Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable photonic integrated circuits represent an emerging technology that amalgamates photonics and electronics, paving the way for light-based information processing at high speeds and low power consumption. Programmable photonics provides a flexible platform that can be reconfigured to perform multiple tasks, thereby holding great promise for revolutionizing future optical networks and quantum computing systems. Over the past decade, there has been constant progress in developing several different architectures for realizing programmable photonic circuits that allow for realizing arbitrary discrete unitary operations with light. Here, we systematically investigate a general family of photonic circuits for realizing arbitrary unitaries based on a simple architecture that interlaces a fixed intervening layer with programmable phase shifter layers. We introduce a criterion for the intervening operator that guarantees the universality of this architecture for representing arbitrary $N \times N$ unitary operators with $N+1$ phase layers. We explore this criterion for different photonic components, including photonic waveguide lattices and meshes of directional couplers, which allows the identification of several families of photonic components that can serve as the intervening layers in the interlacing architecture. Our findings pave the way for efficiently designing and realizing novel families of programmable photonic integrated circuits for multipurpose analog information processing.</description>
