      <title>Interpolation with Automated First-Order Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider interpolation from the viewpoint of fully automated theorem proving in first-order logic as a general core technique for mechanized knowledge processing. For Craig interpolation, our focus is on the two-stage approach, where first an essentially propositional ground interpolant is calculated that is then lifted to a quantified first-order formula. We discuss two possibilities to obtain a ground interpolant from a proof, with clausal tableaux, and with resolution. Established preprocessing techniques for first-order proving can also be applied for Craig interpolation if they are restricted in specific ways. Equality encodings from automated reasoning justify strengthened variations of Craig interpolation. Also further contributions to Craig interpolation emerged from automated reasoning. As an approach to uniform interpolation we introduce second-order quantifier elimination with examples and describe the basic algorithms DLS and SCAN.</description>

      <title>LeanLTL: A unifying framework for linear temporal logics in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose LeanLTL, a unifying framework for linear temporal logics in Lean 4. LeanLTL supports reasoning about traces that represent either infinite or finite linear time. The library allows traditional LTL syntax to be combined with arbitrary Lean expressions, making it straightforward to define properties involving numerical or other types. We prove that standard flavors of LTL can be embedded in our framework. The library also provides automation for reasoning about LeanLTL formulas in a way that facilitates using Lean's existing tactics. Finally, we provide examples illustrating the utility of the library in reasoning about systems that come from applications.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on the uncolored versions of the original CFI-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CFI-graphs, named after Cai, F\"urer, and Immerman, are central to the study of the graph isomorphism testing and of first-order logic with counting. They are colored graphs, and the coloring plays a role in many of their applications. As usual, it is not hard to remove the coloring by some extra graph gadgets, but at the cost of blowing up the size of the graphs and changing some parameters of them as well. This might lead to suboptimal combinatorial bounds important to their applications. Since then for some uncolored variants of the CFI-graphs it has been shown that they serve the same purposes. We show that this already applies to the graphs obtained from the original CFI-graphs by forgetting the colors. Moreover, we will see that there is a first-order formula $\varphi(x,y)$ expressing in almost all uncolored CFI-graphs that $x$ and $y$ have the same color in the corresponding colored graphs.</description>

      <title>The Boolean Solution Problem from the Perspective of Predicate Logic -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:1706.08329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding solution values for unknowns in Boolean equations was a principal reasoning mode in the Algebra of Logic of the 19th century. Schr\"oder investigated it as Aufl\"osungsproblem (solution problem). It is closely related to the modern notion of Boolean unification. Today it is commonly presented in an algebraic setting, but seems potentially useful also in knowledge representation based on predicate logic. We show that it can be modeled on the basis of first-order logic extended by second-order quantification. A wealth of classical results transfers, foundations for algorithms unfold, and connections with second-order quantifier elimination and Craig interpolation become apparent. Although for first-order inputs the set of solutions is recursively enumerable, the development of constructive methods remains a challenge. We identify some cases that allow constructions, most of them based on Craig interpolation.</description>

      <title>Logic Optimization Meets SAT: A Novel Framework for Circuit-SAT Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) problem, a variant of the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem, plays a critical role in integrated circuit design and verification. However, existing SAT solvers, optimized for Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), often struggle with the intrinsic complexity of circuit structures when directly applied to CSAT instances. To address this challenge, we propose a novel preprocessing framework that leverages advanced logic synthesis techniques and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to optimize CSAT problem instances. The framework introduces a cost-customized Look-Up Table (LUT) mapping strategy that prioritizes solving efficiency, effectively transforming circuits into simplified forms tailored for SAT solvers. Our method achieves significant runtime reductions across diverse industrial-scale CSAT benchmarks, seamlessly integrating with state-of-the-art SAT solvers. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate up to 63\% reduction in solving time compared to conventional approaches, highlighting the potential of EDA-driven innovations to advance SAT-solving capabilities.</description>

      <title>Formalising Inductive and Coinductive Containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02603v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Containers capture the concept of strictly positive data types in programming. The original development of containers is done in the internal language of locally cartesian closed categories (LCCCs) with disjoint coproducts and W-types, and uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP) is implicitly assumed throughout. Although it is claimed that these developments can also be interpreted in extensional Martin-L\"of type theory, this interpretation is not made explicit. In this paper, we present a formalisation of the results that 'containers preserve least and greatest fixed points' in Cubical Agda, thereby giving a formulation in intensional type theory. Our proofs do not make use of UIP and thereby generalise the original results from talking about container functors on Set to container functors on the wild category of types. Our main incentive for using Cubical Agda is that its path type restores the equivalence between bisimulation and coinductive equality. Thus, besides developing container theory in a more general setting, we also demonstrate the usefulness of Cubical Agda's path type to coinductive proofs.</description>

      <title>Expressivity of AuDaLa: Turing Completeness and Possible Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AuDaLa is a recently introduced programming language that follows the new data autonomous paradigm. In this paradigm, small pieces of data execute functions autonomously. Considering the paradigm and the design choices of AuDaLa, it is interesting to determine the expressivity of the language. In this paper, we implement Turing machines in AuDaLa and prove that implementation correct. This proves that AuDaLa is Turing complete, giving an initial indication of AuDaLa's expressivity. Additionally, we give examples of how to add extensions to AuDaLa to increase its practical expressivity and to better match conventional parallel languages, allowing for a more straightforward and performant implementation of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Nets-within-Nets through the Lens of Data Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elementary Object Systems (EOSs) are a model in the nets-within-nets (NWNs) paradigm, where tokens in turn can host standard Petri nets. We study the complexity of the reachability problem of EOSs when subjected to non-deterministic token losses. It is known that this problem is equivalent to the coverability problem with no lossiness of conservative EOSs (cEOSs). We precisely characterize cEOS coverability into the framework of data nets, whose tokens carry data from an infinite domain. Specifically, we show that cEOS coverability is equivalent to the coverability of an interesting fragment of data nets that extends beyond $\nu$PNs (featuring globally fresh name creation), yet remains less expressive than Unordered Data Nets (featuring lossy name creation as well as powerful forms of whole-place operations and broadcasts). This insight bridges two apparently orthogonal approaches to PN extensions, namely data nets and NWNs. At the same time, it enables us to analyze cEOS coverability taking advantage of known results on data nets. As a byproduct, we immediately get that the complexity of cEOS coverability lies between $\mathbf{F}_{\omega 2}$ and $\mathbf{F}_{\omega^\omega}$, two classes beyond Primitive Recursive.</description>
