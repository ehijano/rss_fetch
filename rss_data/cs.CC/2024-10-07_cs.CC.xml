      <title>Asymptotic Inapproximability of Reconfiguration Problems: Maxmin $k$-Cut and Maxmin E$k$-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hardness of approximating two reconfiguration problems. One problem is Maxmin $k$-Cut Reconfiguration, which is a reconfiguration analogue of Max $k$-Cut. The other is Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration, which is a reconfiguration analogue of Max E$k$-SAT. The Probabilistically Checkable Reconfiguration Proof theorem due to Hirahara and Ohsaka (STOC 2024) and Karthik C. S. and Manurangsi (2023) implies that Maxmin 4-Cut Reconfiguration and Maxmin E3-SAT Reconfiguration are PSPACE-hard to approximate within a constant factor. However, the asymptotic behavior of approximability for these problems with respect to $k$ is not well understood.
  In this paper, we present the following hardness-of-approximation results and approximation algorithms for Maxmin $k$-Cut Reconfiguration and Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration:
  $\bullet$ For every $k \geq 2$, Maxmin $k$-Cut Reconfiguration is PSPACE-hard to approximate within a factor of $1 - \Omega\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$, whereas it can be approximated within a factor of $1-\frac{2}{k}$. Our lower and upper bounds demonstrate that Maxmin $k$-Cut Reconfiguration exhibits the asymptotically same approximability as Max $k$-Cut.
  $\bullet$ For every $k \geq 3$, Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration is PSPACE-hard (resp. NP-hard) to approximate within a factor of $1-\Omega\left(\frac{1}{9^{\sqrt{k}}}\right)$ (resp. $1-\frac{1}{8k}$). On the other hand, it admits a deterministic $\left(1-\frac{2.5}{k}\right)$-factor approximation algorithm, implying that Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration displays an asymptotically approximation threshold different from Max E$k$-SAT.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-induced provable and robust quantum learning advantages</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing holds the unparalleled potentials to enhance, speed up or innovate machine learning. However, an unambiguous demonstration of quantum learning advantage has not been achieved so far. Here, we rigorously establish a noise-robust, unconditional quantum learning advantage in terms of expressivity, inference speed, and training efficiency, compared to commonly-used classical machine learning models. Our proof is information-theoretic and pinpoints the origin of this advantage: quantum entanglement can be used to reduce the communication required by non-local machine learning tasks. In particular, we design a fully classical task that can be solved with unit accuracy by a quantum model with a constant number of variational parameters using entanglement resources, whereas commonly-used classical models must scale at least linearly with the size of the task to achieve a larger-than-exponentially-small accuracy. We further show that the quantum model can be trained with constant time and a number of samples inversely proportional to the problem size. We prove that this advantage is robust against constant depolarization noise. We show through numerical simulations that even though the classical models can have improved performance as their sizes are increased, they would suffer from overfitting. The constant-versus-linear separation, bolstered by the overfitting problem, makes it possible to demonstrate the quantum advantage with relatively small system sizes. We demonstrate, through both numerical simulations and trapped-ion experiments on IonQ Aria, the desired quantum-classical learning separation. Our results provide a valuable guide for demonstrating quantum learning advantages in practical applications with current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Formalism for Memory Compression in Selective State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modelling long-range dependencies in sequence data. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SSMs offer a structured and stable approach to sequence modelling, leveraging principles from control theory and dynamical systems. However, a key challenge in sequence modelling is compressing long-term dependencies into a compact hidden state representation without losing critical information.
  In this paper, we develop a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding memory compression in selective state space models. We introduce a selective gating mechanism that dynamically filters and updates the hidden state based on input relevance, allowing for efficient memory compression. We formalize the trade-off between memory efficiency and information retention using information-theoretic tools, such as mutual information and rate-distortion theory. Our analysis provides theoretical bounds on the amount of information that can be compressed without sacrificing model performance.
  We also derive theorems that prove the stability and convergence of the hidden state in selective SSMs, ensuring reliable long-term memory retention. Computational complexity analysis reveals that selective SSMs offer significant improvements in memory efficiency and processing speed compared to traditional RNN-based models. Through empirical validation on sequence modelling tasks such as time-series forecasting and natural language processing, we demonstrate that selective SSMs achieve state-of-the-art performance while using less memory and computational resources.</description>

      <title>On the Hardness of Learning One Hidden Layer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of learning one hidden layer ReLU neural networks with inputs from $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that this learning problem is hard under standard cryptographic assumptions even when: (1) the size of the neural network is polynomial in $d$, (2) its input distribution is a standard Gaussian, and (3) the noise is Gaussian and polynomially small in $d$. Our hardness result is based on the hardness of the Continuous Learning with Errors (CLWE) problem, and in particular, is based on the largely believed worst-case hardness of approximately solving the shortest vector problem up to a multiplicative polynomial factor.</description>

      <title>The Existential Theory of the Reals with Summation Operators</title>

Abstract: To characterize the computational complexity of satisfiability problems for probabilistic and causal reasoning within the Pearl's Causal Hierarchy, arXiv:2305.09508 [cs.AI] introduce a new natural class, named succ-$\exists$R. This class can be viewed as a succinct variant of the well-studied class $\exists$R based on the Existential Theory of the Reals (ETR). Analogously to $\exists$R, succ-$\exists$R is an intermediate class between NEXP and EXPSPACE, the exponential versions of NP and PSPACE. The main contributions of this work are threefold. Firstly, we characterize the class succ-$\exists$R in terms of nondeterministic real RAM machines and develop structural complexity theoretic results for real RAMs, including translation and hierarchy theorems. Notably, we demonstrate the separation of $\exists$R and succ-$\exists$R. Secondly, we examine the complexity of model checking and satisfiability of fragments of existential second-order logic and probabilistic independence logic. We show succ-$\exists$R- completeness of several of these problems, for which the best-known complexity lower and upper bounds were previously NEXP-hardness and EXPSPACE, respectively. Thirdly, while succ-$\exists$R is characterized in terms of ordinary (non-succinct) ETR instances enriched by exponential sums and a mechanism to index exponentially many variables, in this paper, we prove that when only exponential sums are added, the corresponding class $\exists$R^{\Sigma} is contained in PSPACE. We conjecture that this inclusion is strict, as this class is equivalent to adding a VNP-oracle to a polynomial time nondeterministic real RAM. Conversely, the addition of exponential products to ETR, yields PSPACE. Additionally, we study the satisfiability problem for probabilistic reasoning, with the additional requirement of a small model and prove that this problem is complete for $\exists$R^{\Sigma}.</description>

      <title>A characterization of efficiently compilable constraint languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central task in knowledge compilation is to compile a CNF-SAT instance into a succinct representation format that allows efficient operations such as testing satisfiability, counting, or enumerating all solutions. Useful representation formats studied in this area range from ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs) to circuits in decomposable negation normal form (DNNFs).
  While it is known that there exist CNF formulas that require exponential size representations, the situation is less well studied for other types of constraints than Boolean disjunctive clauses. The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a powerful framework that generalizes CNF-SAT by allowing arbitrary sets of constraints over any finite domain. The main goal of our work is to understand for which type of constraints (also called the constraint language) it is possible to efficiently compute representations of polynomial size. We answer this question completely and prove two tight characterizations of efficiently compilable constraint languages, depending on whether target format is structured.
  We first identify the combinatorial property of ``strong blockwise decomposability'' and show that if a constraint language has this property, we can compute DNNF representations of linear size. For all other constraint languages we construct families of CSP-instances that provably require DNNFs of exponential size. For a subclass of ``strong uniformly blockwise decomposable'' constraint languages we obtain a similar dichotomy for structured DNNFs. In fact, strong (uniform) blockwise decomposability even allows efficient compilation into multi-valued analogs of OBDDs and FBDDs, respectively. Thus, we get complete characterizations for all knowledge compilation classes between O(B)DDs and DNNFs.</description>
