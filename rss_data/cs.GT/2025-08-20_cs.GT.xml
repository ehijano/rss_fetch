      <title>Fair Division Among Couples and Small Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods across groups of agents, where each agent fully enjoys all goods allocated to their group. We focus on groups of two (couples) and other groups of small size. For two couples, an EF1 allocation -- one in which all agents find their group's bundle no worse than the other group's, up to one good -- always exists and can be found efficiently. For three or more couples, EF1 allocations need not exist.
  Turning to proportionality, we show that, whenever groups have size at most $k$, a PROP$k$ allocation exists and can be found efficiently. In fact, our algorithm additionally guarantees (fractional) Pareto optimality, and PROP1 to the first agent in each group, PROP2 to the second, etc., for an arbitrary agent ordering. In special cases, we show that there are PROP1 allocations for any number of couples.</description>

      <title>Reactive Users vs. Recommendation Systems: An Adaptive Policy to Manage Opinion Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems are used in a range of platforms to maximize user engagement through personalization and the promotion of popular content. It has been found that such recommendations may shape users' opinions over time. In this paper, we ask whether reactive users, who are cognizant of the influence of the content they consume, can prevent such changes by adaptively adjusting their content consumption choices. To this end, we study users' opinion dynamics under two types of stochastic policies: a passive policy where the probability of clicking on recommended content is fixed and a reactive policy where clicking probability adaptively decreases following large opinion drifts. We analytically derive the expected opinion and user utility under these policies. We show that the adaptive policy can help users prevent opinion drifts and that when a user prioritizes opinion preservation, the expected utility of the adaptive policy outperforms the fixed policy. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations. These findings help better understand how user-level strategies can challenge the biases induced by recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Candidate Positioning in Multi-Issue Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strategic candidate positioning in multidimensional spatial-voting elections. Voters and candidates are represented as points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and each voter supports the candidate that is closest under a distance induced by an $\ell_p$-norm. We prove that computing an optimal location for a new candidate is NP-hard already against a single opponent, whereas for a constant number of issues the problem is tractable: an $O(n^{d+1})$ hyperplane-enumeration algorithm and an $O(n \log n)$ radial-sweep routine for $d=2$ solve the task exactly. We further derive the first approximation guarantees for the general multi-candidate case and show how our geometric approach extends seamlessly to positional-scoring rules such as $k$-approval and Borda. These results clarify the algorithmic landscape of multidimensional spatial elections and provide practically implementable tools for campaign strategy.</description>

      <title>Control by Deleting Players from Weighted Voting Games Is NP^PP-Complete for the Penrose-Banzhaf Power Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted voting games are a popular class of coalitional games that are widely used to model real-life situations of decision-making. They can be applied, for instance, to analyze legislative processes in parliaments or voting in corporate structures. Various ways of tampering with these games have been studied, among them merging or splitting players, fiddling with the quota, and controlling weighted voting games by adding or deleting players. While the complexity of control by adding players to such games so as to change or maintain a given player's power has been recently settled, the complexity of control by deleting players from such games (with the same goals) remained open. We show that when the players' power is measured by the probabilistic Penrose-Banzhaf index, some of these problems are complete for NP^PP -- the class of problems solvable by NP machines equipped with a PP ("probabilistic polynomial time") oracle. Our results optimally improve the currently known lower bounds of hardness for much smaller complexity classes, thus providing protection against SAT-solving techniques in practical applications.</description>

      <title>A Mechanism for Mutual Fairness in Cooperative Games with Replicable Resources -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest developments in AI focus on agentic systems where artificial and human agents cooperate to realize global goals. An example is collaborative learning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual agents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and alignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon achieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions of cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each coalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation can be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete mechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley value, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it assumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated. Infinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized through new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal benefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and unfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a proof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the Balanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each benefits equally from the participation of the other.</description>

      <title>When Does Selfishness Align with Team Goals? A Structural Analysis of Equilibrium and Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the team-optimal solution and the Nash equilibrium (NE) to assess the impact of self-interested decisions on team performance. In classical team decision problems, team members typically act cooperatively towards a common objective to achieve a team-optimal solution. However, in practice, members may behave selfishly by prioritizing their goals, resulting in an NE under a non-cooperative game. To study this misalignment, we develop a parameterized model for team and game problems, where game parameters represent each individual's deviation from the team objective. The study begins by exploring the consistency and deviation between the NE and the team-optimal solution under fixed game parameters. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for any NE to be a team optimum, along with establishing an upper bound to measure their difference when the consistency condition fails. The exploration then focuses on aligning NE strategies towards the team-optimal solution through the adjustment of game parameters, resulting in a non-convex and non-smooth bi-level optimization problem. We propose a hypergradient-based algorithm for this problem, and establish its convergence to the critical points. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive simulation studies.</description>

      <title>The Multi-Stage Assignment Problem: A Fairness Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the problem of fair assignment on Multi-Stage graphs. A multi-stage graph consists of nodes partitioned into $K$ disjoint sets (stages) structured as a sequence of weighted bipartite graphs formed across adjacent stages. The goal is to assign node-disjoint paths to $n$ agents starting from the first stage and ending in the last stage. We show that an efficient assignment that minimizes the overall sum of costs of all the agents' paths may be highly unfair and lead to significant cost disparities (envy) among the agents. We further show that finding an envy-minimizing assignment on a multi-stage graph is NP-hard. We propose the C-Balance algorithm, which guarantees envy that is bounded by $2M$ in the case of two agents, where $M$ is the maximum edge weight. We demonstrate the algorithm's tightness by presenting an instance where the envy is $2M$. We further show that the cost of fairness ($CoF$), defined as the ratio of the cost of the assignment given by the fair algorithm to that of the minimum cost assignment, is bounded by $2$ for C-Balance. We then extend this approach to $n$ agents by proposing the DC-Balance algorithm that makes iterative calls to C-Balance. We show the convergence of DC-Balance, resulting in envy that is arbitrarily close to $2M$. We derive $CoF$ bounds for DC-Balance and provide insights about its dependency on the instance-specific parameters and the desired degree of envy. We experimentally show that our algorithm runs several orders of magnitude faster than a suitably formulated ILP.</description>

      <title>Instability and Efficiency of Non-cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that a non-cooperative game may have multiple equilibria. In this paper we consider the efficiency of games, measured by the ratio between the aggregate payoff over all Nash equilibria and that over all admissible controls. Such efficiency operator is typically unstable with respect to small perturbation of the game. This seemingly bad property can actually be a good news in practice: it is possible that a small change of the game mechanism may improve the efficiency of the game dramatically. We shall introduce a game mediator with limited resources and investigate two mechanism designs aiming to improve the efficiency. Moreover, we compare the mediator's capability of efficiency improvement when she has access to full information or only partial information. When the mechanisms contain only rewards, the mediator has the same power in the two cases. However, when the mediator can use punishments as well, in general she may have a larger power to improve the efficiency in the full information case than in the partial information case.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design for Congested Facility Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates mechanism design for congested facility location problems, where agents are partitioned into groups with conflicting interests (e.g., competition for booking a basketball court in a gymnasium), and each agent's cost increases when the facility is located closer to their competitors. We analyze three types of misreporting: location-only, group-membership-only, and combined misreporting. To minimize social cost, we propose a strategyproof mechanism that achieves optimality under location-only misreporting. For group membership and combined misreporting, we show that the median mechanism attains tight approximation bounds. For the objective of minimizing maximum cost, we introduce novel strategyproof mechanisms for location-only and group-membership-only misreporting, while employing the leftmost mechanism under combined misreporting. We prove that all proposed mechanisms achieve nearly tight performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>The equilibrium properties of obvious strategy profiles in games with many players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the equilibrium properties of the ``obvious strategy profile'' in large finite-player games. Each player in such a strategy profile simply adopts a randomized strategy as she would have used in a symmetric equilibrium of an idealized large game. We show that, under a continuity assumption, (i) obvious strategy profiles constitute a convergent sequence of approximate symmetric equilibria as the number of players tends to infinity, and (ii) realizations of such strategy profiles also form a convergent sequence of (pure strategy) approximate equilibria with probability approaching one. Our findings offer a solution that is easily implemented without coordination issues and is asymptotically optimal for players in large finite games. Additionally, we present a convergence result for approximate symmetric equilibria.</description>
