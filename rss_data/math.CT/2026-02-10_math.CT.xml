      <title>Free fibrations, lax colimits and Kan extensions for $(\infty,2)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper we study fibrations of $(\infty,2)$-categories. We give a simple characterization of such fibrations in terms of a certain square being a pullback, and apply this to show that in some cases $(\infty,2)$-categories of functors and partially (op)lax transformations preserve fibrations. We also describe free fibrations of $(\infty,2)$-categories, including in the case where we only ask for (co)cartesian lifts of specified 1- and 2-morphisms in the base, and describe the right adjoint to pullback from fibrations to such partial fibrations along an arbitrary functor. In the second part of the paper we apply these results to study colimits and Kan extensions of $(\infty,2)$-categories. Most notably, we give a fibrational description of both partially (op)lax and weighted (co)limits of $(\infty,2)$-categories and construct partially lax Kan extensions. Among other results, we also include a model-independent version of cofinality for $(\infty,2)$-categories and briefly consider presentable $(\infty,2)$-categories, characterizing them as accessible localizations of presheaves of $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>Some notes on tensor triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These are notes from the lectures I gave at the Oberwolfach seminar `Tensor Triangular Geometry and Interactions' which was held in October 2025.
  The aim of these notes is to give an introduction to tensor triangular geometry, for both small and large categories, through the lens of lattice theory. We do not try to be exhaustive and this is reflected in both the content and the bibliography. For instance we are quite light on triangulated preliminaries, especially for compactly generated categories.
  The first three sections treat the essentially small case and conclude with a tensor triangular proof of Thomason's theorem computing the spectrum of the perfect complexes on a quasi-compact and quasi-separated scheme. The last section treats the compactly generated case. This final section is somewhat experimental and contains some new thoughts.</description>

      <title>Koszul duality for algebras over infinity-operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new notion of algebra over a linear $\infty$-operad and a corresponding notion of coalgebra over an $\infty$-cooperad. We next extend the Koszul duality between linear $\infty$-operads and linear $\infty$-cooperads from our previous paper (arXiv:2105.11943) to their categories of algebras and coalgebras. This duality theorem specialises to the known duality in the case of algebras over classical (non-infinity) operads, but our proof is different. In fact, it is based on a much more general duality between presheaves and copresheaves on a category of trees. The latter duality is a priori independent of the (co)algebra structures, but we show that it can be lifted to (co)presheaves supporting such a structure. Based on this duality, we define the homology of an algebra over an $\infty$-operad, and prove that it can be described in terms of the homology of the same category of trees with coefficients in a presheaf.</description>

      <title>Equivalent definitions of fusion category arising from separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a semisimple multiring category with left duals, we prove that the unit object is simple if and only if the tensor functors by any non-zero algebra are separable (resp. faithful, resp. Maschke, resp. dual Maschke, resp. conservative). This induces a list of equivalent definitions of fusion category. As an application, we describe the connectness of a class of weak Hopf algebras by the separability of tensor functors. We also consider applications to transfer of simplicity between the unit objects, semisimple indecomposable module category and Grothendieck ring.</description>

      <title>The Game-Theoretic Kat\v{e}tov Order and Idealised Effective Subtoposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the longstanding problem of determining the structure of the $\leq_{\mathrm{LT}}$-order in the Effective Topos, known to effectively embed the Turing degrees. In a surprising discovery, we show that the $\leq_{\mathrm{LT}}$-order is in fact tightly controlled by the combinatorics of filters on $\omega$, raising deep questions about how combinatorial and computable complexity interact, both within this order and beyond it.
  To make the connection precise, we introduce a game-theoretic (''gamified'') variant of the Kat\v{e}tov order on filters over $\omega$, which turns out to exhibit a striking mix of coarseness and subtlety. For one, it is strictly coarser than the classical Rudin-Keisler order and, when viewed dually on ideals, collapses all MAD families to a single equivalence class. On the other hand, the order also supports a rich internal structure, including an infinite strictly ascending chain of ideal classes, which we identify by way of a new separation technique.
  From the computability-theoretic perspective, we show that a computable (and extended) variant of the gamified Kat\v{e}tov order is isomorphic to the original $\leq_{\mathrm{LT}}$-order. Moreover, our work brings into focus a new degree-spectrum invariant for filters $\mathcal{F}$, $$\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathcal{F}):=\{\,[f\colon\omega\to\omega] \mid f\leq_{\mathrm{LT}} \mathcal{F} \},$$
  which is shown to always determine a proper initial segment of the Turing degrees. Extending this, given any $\Delta^1_1$ filter $\mathcal{F}$, we show that $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathcal{F})$ is precisely the class of hyperarithmetic degrees. This significantly generalises previous results obtained by van Oosten \cite{vO14} and Kihara \cite{Kih23}.
  The proofs draw on ideas from general topology, descriptive set theory, and computability theory.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of finite \'etale spaces and generalized inflations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation of a simplicial complex $K$ is a construction well known in combinatorial topology. It replaces each vertex $i$ of $K$ with a finite number $n_i$ of its copies, and each simplex $\{i_0,\ldots,i_k\}$ with $n_{i_0}n_{i_1}\cdots n_{i_k}$ many copies so that the collection of vertex-copies is spanned by a simplex in the inflation if and only if their originals were spanned by a simplex in the original complex. The celebrated poset fiber theorem of Bj\"{o}rner, Wachs, and Welker describes the homotopy type of such inflation in terms of homotopy types of $K$ and its links. In the current paper, we introduce more general inflations over simplicial posets: we replace each simplex with an arbitrary finite set of copies. The way how these sets patch together is specified by a commutative diagram, or, equivalently, a sheaf on the corresponding finite topology. The generalized inflation can be understood as \'etale space of such sheaf. We prove that, whenever this inflation sheaf is flabby, the poset fiber theorem still applies. We prove all results similar to those known for vertex inflations. We also cover the previous result of the first author about homotopy types of clique complexes of multigraphs.</description>

      <title>Impredicativity in Linear Dependent Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a realizability model of linear dependent type theory from a linear combinatory algebra. Our model motivates a number of additions to the type theory. In particular, we add a universe with two decoding operations: one takes codes to cartesian types and the other takes codes to linear types. The universe is impredicative in the sense that it is closed under both large cartesian dependent products and large linear dependent products. We also add a rule for injectivity of the modality turning linear terms into cartesian terms. With all of the additions, we are able to encode (linear) inductive types. As a case study, we consider the type of lists over a linear type, and demonstrate that our encoding has the relevant uniqueness principle. The construction of the realizability model is fully formalized in the proof assistant Rocq.</description>

      <title>A monoidal Grothendieck construction for $\infty$-categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a monoidal version of Lurie's un/straightening equivalence. In more detail, for any symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathbf C$, we endow the $\infty$-category of coCartesian fibrations over $\mathbf C$ with a (naturally defined) symmetric monoidal structure, and prove that it is equivalent the Day convolution monoidal structure on the $\infty$-category of functors from $\mathbf C$ to $\mathbf{Cat}_\infty$.
  In fact, we do this over any $\infty$-operad by categorifying this statement and thereby proving a stronger statement about the functors that assign to an $\infty$-category $\mathbf C$ its category of coCartesian fibrations on the one hand, and its category of functors to $\mathbf{Cat}_\infty$ on the other hand.</description>

      <title>Enriched aspects of calculus of relations and $2$-permutability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to further develop the calculus of (internal) relations for a regular Ord-category C. To capture the enriched features of a regular Ord-category and obtain a good calculus, the relations we work with are precisely the ideals in C. We then focus on an enriched version of the 1-dimensional algebraic 2-permutable (also called Mal'tsev) property and its well-known equivalent characterisations expressed through properties on ordinary relations. We introduce the notion of Ord-Mal'tsev category and show that these may be characterised through enriched versions of the above mentioned properties adapted to ideals. Any Ord-enrichment of a 1-dimensional Mal'tsev category is necessarily an Ord-Mal'tsev category. We also give some examples of categories which are not Mal'tsev categories, but are Ord-Mal'tsev categories.</description>

Abstract: We develop the theory of locally rigid and rigid symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories over an arbitrary base $\mathcal{V}\in\mathrm{CAlg}(\mathbf{Pr}^\mathrm{L})$. Among other things, we prove that every locally rigid commutative $\mathcal{V}$-algebra arises as a ``completion'' of a rigid commutative $\mathcal{V}$-algebra.
  Along the way, we introduce and study ``$\mathcal{V}$-atomic morphisms'', which are analogues of compact morphisms over an arbitrary base $\mathcal{V}$.</description>

      <title>Additive Enrichment from Coderelictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential linear categories provide the categorical semantics of the multiplicative and exponential fragments of Differential Linear Logic. Briefly, a differential linear category is a symmetric monoidal category that is enriched over commutative monoids (called additive enrichment) and has a monoidal coalgebra modality that is equipped with a codereliction. The codereliction is what captures the ability of differentiating non-linear proofs via linearization in Differential Linear Logic. The additive enrichment plays an important role since it allows one to express the famous Leibniz rule. However, the axioms of a codereliction can be expressed without any sums or zeros. Therefore, it is natural to ask if one can consider a possible non-additive enriched version of differential linear categories. In this paper, we show that even if a codereliction can technically be defined in a non-additive setting, it nevertheless induces an additive enrichment via bialgebra convolution. Thus, we obtain a novel characterization of a differential linear category as a symmetric monoidal category with a monoidal bialgebra modality equipped with a codereliction. Moreover, we also show that coderelictions are, in fact, unique. We also introduce monoidal Hopf coalgebra modalities and discuss how antipodes relate to enrichment over Abelian groups.</description>

Abstract: We give a general notion of combinatory completeness with respect to a faithful cartesian club and use it systematically to obtain characterisations of a number of different kinds of applicative system. Each faithful cartesian club determines a notion of structured multicategory, with the different notions of structured multicategory obtained in this way giving different notions of polynomial over an applicative system, which in turn give different notions of combinatory completeness. We obtain the classical characterisation of combinatory algebras as combinatory complete applicative systems as a specific instance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The starting point of algebraic language theory is that regular languages of finite words are exactly those recognized by finite monoids. This finiteness condition gives rise to a topological space whose points, called profinite words, encode the limiting behavior of words with respect to finite monoids.
  In this work, we move from words and monoids to trees and clones, the algebraic structures underlying deterministic bottom-up tree automata. Using the categorical notion of codensity monad, we introduce a profinite completion for clones. We prove that this construction on clones simultaneously generalizes the ultrafilter monad on sets and the profinite completion of monoids. When applied to free clones on a ranked alphabet, the profinite completion of clones yields a notion of profinite tree, providing a topological approach to regular languages of finite trees. We prove that these profinite trees coincide with a well-identified fragment of the profinite lambda-calculus.</description>

      <title>Tensor products of Leibniz bimodules and Grothendieck rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we define three different notions of tensor products for Leibniz bimodules. The ``natural" tensor product of Leibniz bimodules is not always a Leibniz bimodule. In order to fix this, we introduce the notion of a weak Leibniz bimodule and show that the ``natural" tensor product of weak bimodules is again a weak bimodule. Moreover, it turns out that weak Leibniz bimodules are modules over a cocommutative Hopf algebra canonically associated to the Leibniz algebra. Therefore, the category of all weak Leibniz bimodules is symmetric monoidal and the full subcategory of finite-dimensional weak Leibniz bimodules is rigid and pivotal. On the other hand, we introduce two truncated tensor products of Leibniz bimodules which are again Leibniz bimodules. These tensor products induce a non-associative multiplication on the Grothendieck group of the category of finite-dimensional Leibniz bimodules. In particular, we prove that in characteristic zero for a finite-dimensional solvable Leibniz algebra this Grothendieck ring is an alternative power-associative commutative Jordan ring, but for a finite-dimensional non-zero semi-simple Leibniz algebra it is neither alternative nor a Jordan ring.</description>

Abstract: Non-split Real Tambara-Yamagami categories are a family of fusion categories over the real numbers that were recently introduced and classified by Plavnik, Sanford, and Sconce. We consider which of these categories admit braidings, and classify the resulting braided equivalence classes. We also prove some new results about the split real and split complex Tambara-Yamagami Categories.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the (generalized) quantum double $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H$ determined by a (skew) pairing between finite-dimensional Hopf algebras $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}$ and $H$, especially the tensor category $\mathsf{Rep}(K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H)$ of its finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we show that $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H$ is a left partially dualized (quasi-)Hopf algebra of $K^\mathrm{op}\otimes H$, and use this formulation to establish tensor equivalences from $\mathsf{Rep}(K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H)$ to the categories ${}^K_K\mathcal{M}^K_H$ and ${}^{K^\ast}_{K^\ast}\mathcal{M}^{H^\ast}_{K^\ast}$ of two-sided two-cosided relative Hopf modules, as well as the category ${}_H\mathfrak{YD}^K$ of relative Yetter-Drinfeld modules.</description>

      <title>Permutation twisted cohomology, remixed</title>

Abstract: For each endotrivial complex arising from Bredon homology of a representation sphere, we construct $p$-local quasi-isomorphisms, called forerunners, enabling us to extend Balmer--Gallauer's results in arXiv:2307.04398 Part II concerning the tensor-triangular geometry of permutation modules for elementary abelian $p$-groups to all $p$-groups. We construct an open cover of the Balmer spectrum under which all endotrivials are line bundles, that is, every endotrivial is locally isomorphic to a shifted tensor unit. We define a 'remixed' permutation twisted cohomology ring for which the canonical comparison map from the Balmer spectrum to the homogeneous spectrum of the twisted cohomology ring is injective. If the twisted cohomology ring is Noetherian, the comparison map is an open immersion, and the open cover endows the Balmer spectrum with Dirac scheme structure. We prove Noetherianity holds for Dedekind groups and all $p$-groups of order at most $p^3$, and conjecture Noetherianity holds for all finite $p$-groups.</description>

Abstract: For any length category, we establish a set of rules (necessary and sufficient) that ensure a partial order on the isomorphism classes of simple objects such that the category is equivalent to the category of finite dimensional representations of this partially ordered set.</description>
