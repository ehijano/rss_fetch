      <title>Ubiquitous order known as chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A close relation has recently emerged between two of the most fundamental concepts in physics and mathematics: chaos and supersymmetry. In striking contrast to the semantics of the word 'chaos,' the true physical essence of this phenomenon now appears to be a spontaneous order associated with the breakdown of the topological supersymmetry (TS) hidden in all stochastic (partial) differential equations, i.e., in all systems from a broad domain ranging from cosmology to nanoscience. Among the low-hanging fruits of this new perspective, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS), are theoretical explanations of 1/f noise and self-organized criticality. Central to STS is the physical meaning of TS breaking order parameter (OP). In this paper, we discuss that the OP is a field-theoretic embodiment of the 'butterfly effect' (BE) -- the infinitely long dynamical memory that is definitive of chaos. We stress that the formulation of the corresponding effective theory for the OP would mark the inception of the first consistent physical theory of the BE. Such a theory, potentially a valuable tool in solving chaos-related problems, would parallel the well-established and successful field theoretic descriptions of superconductivity, ferromagentism and other known orders arising from the spontaneous breakdown of various symmetries of nature.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Chaos: From Galactic Dynamics to Plasma Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary focus of this thesis is the numerical investigation of chaos in Hamiltonian models describing charged particle orbits in plasma, star motions in barred galaxies, and orbits' diffusion in multidimensional maps. We systematically explore the interplay between magnetic and kinetic chaos in toroidal fusion plasmas, where non-axisymmetric perturbations disrupt smooth magnetic flux surfaces, generating complex particle trajectories. Using the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) method, we efficiently quantify chaos, compare the behavior of magnetic field lines and particle orbits, visualize the radial distribution of chaotic regions, and offer GALI as a valuable tool for studying plasma physics dynamics. We also study the evolution of phase space structures in a 3D barred galactic potential, following successive 2D and 3D pitchfork and period-doubling bifurcations of periodic orbits. By employing the `color and rotation' technique to visualize the system's 4D Poincar\'e surface of sections, we reveal distinct structural patterns. We further investigate the long-term diffusion transport and chaos properties of single and coupled standard maps, focusing on parameters inducing anomalous diffusion through accelerator modes exhibiting ballistic transport. Using different ensembles of initial conditions in chaotic regions influenced by these modes, we examine asymptotic diffusion rates and time scales, identifying conditions suppressing anomalous transport and leading to long-term convergence to normal diffusion across coupled maps. Lastly, we perform the first comprehensive investigation into the GALI indices for various attractors in continuous and discrete-time dissipative systems, extending the method's application to non-Hamiltonian systems. A key aspect of our work involves analyzing and comparing GALIs' with Lyapunov Exponents for systems exhibiting hyperchaotic motion.</description>

      <title>Universal fluctuation spectrum of Vlasov-Poisson turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17278</link>

Abstract: The thermal fluctuation spectrum of the electric field arising due to particle noise in a quiescent Vlasov-Poisson plasma was derived in the 1960s. Here, we derive the universal fluctuation spectrum of the electric field, at Debye and sub-Debye scales, for a turbulent Vlasov-Poisson plasma. This spectrum arises from what is likely to be the final cascade - a universal regime to be encountered at the extreme small-scale end of any turbulent cascade in a nearly collisionless plasma. The cascaded invariant is $C_2$, the quadratic Casimir invariant of the particle distribution function. $C_2$ cascades to small scales in position and velocity space via linear and nonlinear phase mixing, in such a way that the time scales of the two processes are critically balanced at every scale. We construct a scaling theory of the fluctuation spectrum of $C_2$ and of the electric field in wavenumber space. The electric-field spectrum is sufficiently steep for the nonlinear mixing to be controlled by the largest-scale electric fields, and so the $C_2$ cascade resembles the Batchelor cascade of a passive scalar. Our theory is supported by simulations of a forced 1D-1V plasma. We predict that the cascade is terminated at the wavenumber where the turbulent electric-field spectrum gives way to the thermal noise spectrum. The time scale for this small-scale cutoff to be reached is the dynamical time of phase-space mixing times a logarithmic factor in the plasma parameter - this is the first concrete demonstration of this property of Vlasov-Poisson turbulence, akin to how fluid turbulence dissipates energy at a rate independent (or nearly independent) of molecular diffusion. In the presence of the sub-Debye phase-space cascade - a scenario that may be ubiquitous - standard collisional plasma theory ceases to be valid. This calls for the development of new collision operators suited to such turbulent environments.</description>

      <title>The study of double kicked top: a classical and quantum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</description>
