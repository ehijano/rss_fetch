      <title>Boundary-induced classical Generalized Gibbs Ensemble with angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the boundary shape on the thermalization behavior of a confined system of classical hard disks at low packing fraction and thus in the gas regime. We use both analytical calculations and numerical simulations, and leveraging on the insights from the maximum entropy principle, we explore how the geometry of the boundary influences the thermal equilibration process in such systems. Our simulations involve hard disks confined within varying boundary shapes, using both event-driven and time-driven simulations, ranging from conventional square boundaries to circular boundaries, showing that the two converge to different ensembles. The former converges to the Gibbs Ensemble, while the latter converges to the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), with angular momentum as the extra conserved quantity. We introduce an order parameter to characterize the deviations from the Gibbs ensemble, and show that the GGE is not time-reversal invariant, it violates ergodicity and leads to a near-boundary condensation phenomenon. Because of this, we argue that Monte Carlo methods should include angular momentum in this situation. We conclude by discussing how these results lead to peculiar violations of the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics as the effective field theory of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the hunt for new phases of matter in quantum mixed states, it has recently been proposed that the equivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles in statistical mechanics is a manifestation of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in an underlying many-body quantum description. Here, we build an effective field theory for SWSSB of a global U(1) symmetry; the answer exactly reproduces the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory of diffusion for the conserved charge. We conclude that hydrodynamics can be understood as a theory of "superfluidity" for the broken strong symmetry: a non-vanishing susceptibility is a measurable order parameter for SWSSB, the diffusion mode is the Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, and a generalization of Goldstone's Theorem implies that the diffusion mode is always long-lived. This perspective provides a transparent physical explanation for the unusual "reparameterization" symmetries which are a necessary ingredient of Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for "normal fluids".</description>

      <title>Effects of stickiness on the quantum states of strongly chaotic open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of classical stickiness (orbits temporarily confined to a region of the chaotic phase space) to the structures of the quantum states of an open system. We consider the standard map of the kicked rotor and verify that regions of stickiness survive in the strong chaotic regime of the closed classical map. By scanning the system's phase space with a leak, we analyze how stickiness affects the degree of localization of the states of the quantum system. We find an excellent correspondence between the classical dwell time and finite-time Lyapunov exponents with the quantum dwell time and Wehrl entropy of the quantum states. Our approach suggests that knowledge of the structure of the classically chaotic trajectories can be used to determine where to place the leak to enhance or decrease the degree of delocalization of the quantum states.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic transport from frame-indifferent kinetic theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Newton-Cartan geometry to the kinetic theory of gases that includes non-relativistic gravitational effects and the principle of general covariance. Starting with an introduction to the basics of Newton-Cartan geometry, we examine the motion of point particles within this framework, leading to a detailed analysis of kinetic theory and the derivation of conservation equations. The equilibrium distribution function is explored, and the example of a rotating gas in a gravitational field is discussed. Further, we develop covariant hydrodynamic equations and extend our analysis through a gradient expansion approach to assess first-order constitutive relations for rotating gases. Finally, we address the frame-dependence paradox, presenting a novel resolution that addresses apparent discrepancies. Our construction resolves a fifty-year-old debate about the frame-indifferent formulation of kinetic theory. The resolution is presented in a modern, symmetry-based approach.</description>

      <title>Directed Motion and Spatial Coherence in the Cell Nucleus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the dynamics of chromatin and the factors that are affecting it, has provided valuable insights into the organization and functionality of the genome in the cell nucleus. We control the expression of Lamin-A, an important organizer protein of the chromatin and nucleus structure. By simultaneously tracking tens of chromosomal loci (telomeres) in each nucleus, we find that the motion of chromosomal loci in Lamin-A depleted cells is both faster and more directed on a scale of a few micrometers, which coincides with the size of chromosome territories. Moreover, in the absence of Lamin-A we reveal the existence of correlations among neighboring telomeres. We show how these pairwise correlations are linked with the intermittent and persistent character of telomere trajectories, underscoring the importance of Lamin-A protein in chromosomal organization.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired information entropy in multi-field turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel information entropy of turbulence systems with multiple field quantities is formulated. Inspired by quantum mechanics, the von Neumann entropy (vNE) and the entanglement entropy(EE) are derived from a density matrix for the turbulence state in terms of the multi-field singular value decomposition (MFSVD). Applying the information-theoretic entropy analyses to spatio-temporal dynamics in turbulent plasmas with phase-transition-like behavior, we discover a new nontrivial transition threshold regarding the vNE, which significantly deviates from the transition threshold of the field energy considered in the conventional approaches. These findings provide us with new classifications of the turbulence state in terms of combined energy and information. It is also shown that the EE for nonlinear interactions in turbulence simultaneously describes not only the information for the strength of nonlinear mode couplings but also the direction of net energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of Non-Ideal Reaction-Diffusion Systems: Implications for Active Self-Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework describing the dynamics and thermodynamics of open non-ideal reaction-diffusion systems, which embodies Flory-Huggins theories of mixtures and chemical reaction network theories. Our theory elucidates the mechanisms underpinning the emergence of self-organized dissipative structures in these systems. It evaluates the dissipation needed to sustain and control them, discriminating the contributions from each reaction and diffusion process with spatial resolution. It also reveals the role of the reaction network in powering and shaping these structures. We identify particular classes of networks in which diffusion processes always equilibrate within the structures, while dissipation occurs solely due to chemical reactions. The spatial configurations resulting from these processes can be derived by minimizing a kinetic potential, contrasting with the minimization of the thermodynamic free energy in passive systems. This framework opens the way to investigating the energetic cost of phenomena such as liquid-liquid phase separation, coacervation, and the formation of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Understanding the approach to thermalization from the eigenspectrum of non-Abelian gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of SU(3) gauge theory with and without dynamical quarks (QCD) at thermal equilibrium using lattice gauge theory techniques. By measuring eigenstates of a massless overlap Dirac operator on the gauge configurations, we provide a gauge invariant method to study spectral properties of non-Abelian gauge theories. Whereas the majority of these eigenstates below the magnetic scale have universal nearest-neighbor level spacing fluctuations consistent with certain class of random matrix theories at temperatures away from the chiral crossover transition in QCD, a few among them start to become prominent just above the crossover forming clusters percolating over the entire volume. By matching the non-perturbative magnetic scales in a high temperature thermal state and a particular non-equilibrium chaotic state of QCD, we provide an estimate of thermalization time $\sim 1.44$ fm/c.</description>

      <title>Annealing Dynamics of Regular Rotor Networks: Universality and Its Breakdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-vector Monte Carlo model is widely used as a benchmark for the classicality of quantum annealers but severely restricts the time evolution. The spin-vector Langevin (SVL) model has been proposed and tested as an alternative, closely reproducing the real-time dynamics of physical quantum annealers such as D-Wave machines in the dissipative regime. We investigate the SVL annealing dynamics of classical O(2) rotors on regular graphs, identifying universal features in the nonequilibrium dynamics when changing the range of interactions and the topology of the graph. Regular graphs with low connectance or edge density exhibit universal scaling dynamics consistent with the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which leads to a power-law dependence of the density of defects and the residual energy as a function of the annealing time. As the interaction range is increased, the power-law scaling is suppressed, and an exponential scaling with the annealing time sets in. Our results establish a universal breakdown of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in classical systems characterized by long-range interactions, in sharp contrast with previous findings in the quantum domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on a half-filled honeycomb lattice. In particular, we investigate the model's semi-metal (SM) to Kekul{\'e} Valence Bond Solid (KVBS) phase transition at zero and finite temperatures as a function of phonon energy and interaction strength. Using hybrid Monte Carlo sampling methods we can simulate the model near the adiabatic regime, allowing us to access regions of parameter space relevant to graphene. Our simulations suggest that the SM-KVBS transition is weakly first-order at all temperatures, with graphene situated close to the phase boundary in the SM region of the phase diagram. Our results highlight the important role bond-stretching phonon modes play in the formation of KVBS order in strained graphene-derived systems.</description>

Abstract: We review recent progress regarding the double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and other $p$-local quantum mechanical random Hamiltonians. These models exhibit an expansion using chord diagrams, which can be solved by combinatorial methods. We describe exact results in these models, including their spectrum, correlation functions, and Lyapunov exponent. In a certain limit, these techniques manifest the relation to the Schwarzian quantum mechanics, a theory of quantum gravity in $AdS_2$. More generally, the theory is controlled by a rigid algebraic structure of a quantum group, suggesting a theory of quantum gravity on non-commutative $q$-deformed $AdS_2$. We conclude with discussion of related universality classes, and survey some of the current research directions.</description>

Abstract: Kinetic traps are a notorious problem in equilibrium statistical mechanics, where temperature quenches ultimately fail to bring the system to low energy configurations. Using multifarious self-assembly as a model system, we introduce a mechanism to escape kinetic traps by utilizing non-reciprocal interactions between components. Introducing non-equilibrium effects offered by broken action-reaction symmetry in the system, we can push the trajectory of the system out of arrested dynamics. The dynamics of the model is studied using tools from the physics of interfaces and defects. Our proposal can find applications in self-assembly, glassy systems and systems with arrested dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information engines model ``Maxwell's demon" mechanistically. However, the demon's strategy is pre-described by an external experimenter, and information engines are conveniently designed such that observables contain complete information about variables pertinent to work extraction. In real world scenarios, it is more realistic to encounter partial observability, which forces the physical observer, an integral part of the information engine, to make inferences from incomplete knowledge. Here, we use the fact that an algorithm for computing optimal strategies can be directly derived from maximizing overall engine work output. For a simple binary decision problem, we discover interesting optimal strategies that differ notably from naive coarse graining. They inspire a model class of simple, yet compelling, parameterized soft partitionings of the observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06994v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study thermodynamics of a heat-conducting ideal gas system. The study is based on i) the first law of thermodynamics from action formulation which expects heat-dependence of energy density and ii) the existence condition of a (local) Lorentz boost between an Eckart observer and a Landau-Lifshitz observer--a condition that extends the stability criterion of thermal equilibrium. The implications of these conditions include: i) Heat contributes to the energy density through the combination $q/n\Theta^2$ where $q$, $n$, and $\Theta$ represent heat, the number density, and the temperature, respectively. ii) The energy density has a unique minimum at $q=0$. iii) The temperature upper bound suppresses the heat dependence of the energy density inverse quadratically. This result explains why the expected heat dependence is difficult to observe in ordinary situation thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic origin of anomalous current fluctuations in a family of stochastic charged cellular automata. Using ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study both typical and large fluctuations of the charge current and reproduce microscopic results which are available for the deterministic single-file limit of the models. Our results indicate that in general initial fluctuations propagated by Euler equations fully characterize both scales of anomalous fluctuations. For stochastic dynamics, we find an additional contribution to typical fluctuations and conjecture the functional form of the typical probability distribution, which we confirm by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We extend the Carath\'eodory principle of the Second Law to quantum thermodynamics with energy levels depending on macroscopic variables, such as volume and magnetic field. This extension introduces the concept of Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability (QTI), offering an alternative foundation for statistical mechanics. QTI is characterized by the path-independence of work and heat within the thermodynamic manifold, which is locally described by energy levels and specific thermodynamic parameters. Within this framework, temperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the derivation of both canonical and non-canonical distributions from the Entropy Integrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI. Notably, non-canonical states, which become particularly significant outside the thermodynamic limit, reveal the existence of informational correlations in finite-size thermodynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating (2+1)D SU(2) Yang-Mills Lattice Gauge Theory at finite density with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate a non-Abelian lattice gauge theory in two spatial dimensions, with tensor networks (TN), up to intermediate sizes (&gt;30 matter sites) well beyond exact diagonalization. We focus on the SU(2) Yang-Mills model in Hamiltonian formulation, with dynamical matter and minimally truncated gauge field (hardcore gluon). Thanks to the TN sign-problem-free approach, we characterize the phase diagram of the model at zero and finite baryon number as a function of the quark bare mass and color charge. At intermediate system sizes, we detect a liquid phase of quark-pair bound-state quasiparticles (baryons), whose mass is finite towards the continuum limit. Interesting phenomena arise at the transition boundary where color-electric and color-magnetic terms are maximally frustrated: For low quark masses, we see traces of potential deconfinement, while for high masses, signatures of a possible topological order.</description>

      <title>Dynamic scaling relation in quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In delocalized systems, particle number fluctuations, also known as quantum surface roughness, and the mean-square displacement exhibit a temporal power-law growth followed by a saturation to a system-size-dependent value. We use simple scaling arguments to show that these quantities satisfy the Family-Vicsek scaling law and derive a dynamic scaling relation between the dynamical exponents, assuming that the saturation times of both quantities scale similarly with the system size. This relation clarifies the mechanism behind quantum surface roughness growth and suggests that diffusive quantum many-body systems belong to the Edwards-Wilkinson universality class. Moreover, it provides a convenient way to assess quantum transport in cold-atom experiments. We numerically verify our results by studying two non-interacting models and one interacting model having regimes with distinct dynamical exponents.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models: Integrability and Quantum Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems such as those with disorder or external kick terms. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</description>

      <title>The topology of data hides in quantum thermal states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15633</link>

Abstract: We provide a quantum protocol to perform topological data analysis (TDA) via the distillation of quantum thermal states. Recent developments of quantum thermal state preparation algorithms reveal their characteristic scaling defined by properties of dissipative Lindbladians. This contrasts with protocols based on unitary evolution which have a scaling depending on the properties of the combinatorial Laplacian. To leverage quantum thermal state preparation algorithms, we translate quantum TDA from a real-time to an imaginary-time picture, shifting the paradigm from a unitary approach to a dissipative one. Starting from an initial state overlapping with the ground state of the system, one can dissipate its energy via channels unique to the dataset, naturally distilling its information. Therefore calculating Betti numbers translates into a purity estimation. Alternatively, this can be interpreted as the evaluation of the R\'{e}nyi 2-entropy, Uhlmann fidelity or Hilbert-Schmidt distance relative to thermal states with the embedded topology of simplicial complexes. Our work opens the field of TDA toward a more physical interpretation of the topology of data.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum complexity via universal saturation of stabilizer entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04190</link>

Abstract: Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on R\'enyi index $\alpha$. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of $\alpha$. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for $\alpha&gt;1$, while is a constant for $\alpha&lt;1$. This highlights that $\alpha$-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on $\alpha$: $\alpha$-SREs with $\alpha&lt;1$ relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while $\alpha&gt;1$ probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE. Our results opens up new approaches to characterize the complexity of quantum systems.</description>
