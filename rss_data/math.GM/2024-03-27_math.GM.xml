      <title>Networks and their degree distribution, leading to a new concept of small worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree distribution, referred to as the delta-sequence of a network is studied. Using the non-normalized Lorenz curve, we apply a generalized form of the classical majorization partial order. Next, we introduce a new class of small worlds, namely those based on degree centralities of networks. Similar to a previous study, small worlds are defined as sequences of networks with certain limiting properties. We distinguish between three types of small worlds: those based on the highest degree, those based on the average degree, and those based on the median degree. We show that these new classes of small worlds are different from those introduced previously based on the diameter of the network or the average and median distance between nodes. However, there exist sequences of networks that qualify as small worlds in both senses of the word, with stars being an example. Our approach enables the comparison of two networks with an equal number of nodes in terms of their small-worldliness. Finally, we introduced neighboring arrays based on the degrees of the zeroth and first-order neighbors and proved that for trees, equal neighboring arrays lead to equal delta-arrays.</description>

      <title>Linear Equation over Non-Commutative Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I considered solving of the system of linear equations $$a^1_{1s0}x^1a^1_{1s1}+...+a^1_{ns0}x^na^1_{ns1}=b^1$$ $$...$$ $$a^n_{1s0}x^1a^n_{1s1}+...+a^n_{ns0}x^na^n_{ns1}=b^n$$ over non-commutative associative algebra. I considered examples in quaternion algebra. I considered also Newton's method to solve the equation $$f(x)=a$$ over non-commutative associative algebra.</description>

      <title>La relation entre $\zeta(4n-1)$, $\zeta(2p)$ et $\zeta(4n-1-2p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functional relation of the Riemann z\^eta function provides us with neither the nature nor the expression of z\^eta at positive odd numbers. From the function $F(z)=\frac{z^{-2n}}{e^z-1}$, we find a functional relation involving $\zeta(4n- 1)$, $\zeta(2p)$ and $\zeta(4n-1-2p)$. It is given by: \begin{equation} \zeta(4n-1)=\frac{1}{2n-1}\sum_{p=1}^{2n-2}\zeta(2p)\zeta(4n-1-2p). \end{equation} $n=2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...$ From this formula we introduce a new approach to study the nature of $\zeta$ on these integers.</description>

      <title>Bolzano's Conjecture: Measuring the Numerosity of Infinite Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bolzano and Cantor were the first mathematicians to make significant attempts to measure the size (numerosity) of different infinite collections. They differed in their methodological approaches, with Cantor's prevailing. This led to the foundation of the theory of sets as well as Cantor's transfinite arithmetic. This paper argues that Bolzano's conjecture is correct and that Euclid's principle, 'that the whole is greater than a part', should be considered as a necessary condition for the quantification of infinite sets (rather than bijection). Cantor had concluded that the rational and the algebraic numbers were of the same size as the natural numbers, whilst, in contrast, the real numbers were a larger set. Using Cantor's methods it is shown in this paper that the rational numbers are of larger size than the natural numbers, thus showing that bijection is not a reliable measure of the size of infinite sets. It is also concluded, using mathematical induction, that different 'countably' infinite sets can have various different sizes. The implications for theorems using bijection as a measure of size is then briefly discussed. There already exist new methods of measuring numerosity, based on Euclid's principle, which may develop a consistent system of infinite arithmetic.</description>
