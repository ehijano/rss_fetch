      <title>Well-posedness of stochastic mSQG equations with Kraichnan noise and $L^p$ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stochastic mSQG (modified Surface Quasi-Geostrophic) equations with multiplicative transport noise of Kraichnan type, and $L^p$-initial conditions. Inspired by the recent work of Coghi and Maurelli [arXiv:2308.03216], we show weak existence and pathwise uniqueness of solutions to the equations for suitable choices of parameters in the nonlinearity, the noise and the integrability of initial data.</description>

      <title>Backward Map for Filter Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a backward map is introduced for the purposes of analysis of the nonlinear (stochastic) filter stability. The backward map is important because the filter-stability in the sense of $\chisq$-divergence follows from showing a certain variance decay property for the backward map. To show this property requires additional assumptions on the model properties of the hidden Markov model (HMM). The analysis in this paper is based on introducing a Poincar\'e Inequality (PI) for HMMs with white noise observations. In finite state-space settings, PI is related to both the ergodicity of the Markov process as well as the observability of the HMM. It is shown that the Poincar\'e constant is positive if and only if the HMM is detectable.</description>

      <title>Fringe trees of Patricia tries and compressed binary search trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of fringe trees in Patricia tries and compressed binary search trees; both cases are random binary trees that have been compressed by deleting vertices of outdegree 1 so that they are random full binary trees. The main results are central limit theorems for the number of fringe trees of a given type, which imply quenched and annealed limit results for the fringe tree distribution; for Patricia tries, this is complicated by periodic oscillations in the usual manner. We also consider extended fringe trees. The results are derived from earlier results for uncompressed tries and binary search trees. In the case of compressed binary search trees, it seems difficult to give a closed formula for the asymptotic fringe tree distribution, but we provide a recursion and give examples.</description>

      <title>Weak Convergence for Self-Normalized Partial Sum Processes in the Skorokhod M1 Topology with Applications to Regularly Varying Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the weak convergence of self-normalized partial sum processes in the Skorokhod M1 topology for sequences of random variables which exhibit clustering of large values of the same sign. We show that for stationary regularly varying sequences with such properties, their corresponding properly centered self-normalized partial sums processes converge to a stable Levy process. The convergence is established in the space of cadlag functions endowed with Skorohod's M1 topology, which is more suitable especially for cases in which the standard J1 topology fails to induce weak convergence of joint stochastic functionals.</description>

      <title>The heat equation with time-correlated random potential in d=2: Edwards-Wilkinson fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic PDE:
  $\partial_tu(t,x)=\frac{1}{2}\Delta u(t,x)+{\beta}{}u(t,x)V(t,x),$
  in dimension $d=2$, where the potential V is the space and time mollification of the two-dimensional space-time white noise. We show that after renormalizing, the fluctuations of the solution converge to the Edwards-Wilkinson limit with an explicit effective variance and constant effective diffusivity. Our main tool is a Markov chain on the space of paths which we use to establish an extension of the Kallianpur-Robbins law to a specific regenerative process.</description>

      <title>On Young regimes for locally monotone SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following SPDE on a Gelfand-triple $(V, H, V^*)$: $$
  du(t)=A(t,u(t))dt+dI_t(u), \qquad u(0)=u_0\in H. $$
  Given certain local monotonicity, continuity, coercivity and growth conditions of the operator $A:[0, T]\times V\to V^*$ and a sufficiently regular operator $I$ we establish global existence of weak solutions.
  In analogy to the Young regime for SDEs, no probabilistic structure is required in our analysis, which is based on a careful combination of monotone operator theory and the recently developed Besov rough analysis by Friz and Seeger. Due to the abstract nature of our approach, it applies to various examples of monotone and locally monotone operators $A$, such as the $p$-Laplace operator, the porous medium operator, and an operator that arises in the context of shear-thickening fluids; and operators $I$, including additive Young drivers $I_t(u) = Z_t-Z_0$, abstract Young integrals $I_t(u) = \int_0^t \sigma(u_s)d X_s$, and translated integrals $I_t(u) = \int_0^t b(u_s - w_s)ds$ that arise in the context of regularization by noise. In each of the latter cases, we identify corresponding noise regimes (i.e. Young regimes) that assure our abstract result to be applicable. In the case of additive drivers, we identify the Brownian setting as borderline, i.e. noises which enjoy slightly more temporal regularity are amenable to our completely pathwise analysis.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of the exponential Euler scheme for SDEs with superlinear growth coefficients and one-sided Lipschitz drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of the discrete-time approximation of the solution of a one-dimensional SDE with piecewise locally Lipschitz drift and continuous diffusion coefficients with polynomial growth. In this paper, we study the strong convergence of a (semi-explicit) exponential-Euler scheme previously introduced in Bossy et al. (2021). We show the usual 1/2 rate of convergence for the exponential-Euler scheme when the drift is continuous. When the drift is discontinuous, the convergence rate is penalised by a factor {$\epsilon$} decreasing with the time-step. We examine the case of the diffusion coefficient vanishing at zero, which adds a positivity preservation condition and a convergence analysis that exploits the negative moments and exponential moments of the scheme with the help of change of time technique introduced in Berkaoui et al. (2008). Asymptotic behaviour and theoretical stability of the exponential scheme, as well as numerical experiments, are also presented.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Theories for Metropolis Monte Carlo Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider generalizations of the classical inverse problem to Bayesien type estimators, where the result is not one optimal parameter but an optimal probability distribution in parameter space. The practical computational tool to compute these distributions is the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. We derive kinetic theories for the Metropolis Monte Carlo method in different scaling regimes. The derived equations yield a different point of view on the classical algorithm. It further inspired modifications to exploit the difference scalings shown on an simulation example of the Lorenz system.</description>

      <title>Conditioned stochastic stability of equilibrium states on uniformly expanding repellers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a notion of conditioned stochastic stability of invariant measures on repellers: we consider whether quasi-ergodic measures of absorbing Markov processes, generated by random perturbations of the deterministic dynamics and conditioned upon survival in a neighbourhood of a repeller, converge to an invariant measure in the zero-noise limit. Under suitable choices of the random perturbation, we find that equilibrium states on uniformly expanding repellers are conditioned stochastically stable. In the process, we establish a rigorous foundation for the existence of ``natural measures'', which were proposed by Kantz and Grassberger in 1984 to aid the understanding of chaotic transients.</description>

      <title>Improved weak convergence for the long time simulation of Mean-field Langevin equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the weak convergence behaviour of the Leimkuhler--Matthews method, a non-Markovian Euler-type scheme with the same computational cost as the Euler scheme, for the approximation of the stationary distribution of a one-dimensional McKean--Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equation (MV-SDE). The particular class under study is known as mean-field (overdamped) Langevin equations (MFL). We provide weak and strong error results for the scheme in both finite and infinite time. We work under a strong convexity assumption.
  Based on a careful analysis of the variation processes and the Kolmogorov backward equation for the particle system associated with the MV-SDE, we show that the method attains a higher-order approximation accuracy in the long-time limit (of weak order convergence rate $3/2$) than the standard Euler method (of weak order $1$). While we use an interacting particle system (IPS) to approximate the MV-SDE, we show the convergence rate is independent of the dimension of the IPS and this includes establishing uniform-in-time decay estimates for moments of the IPS, the Kolmogorov backward equation and their derivatives. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical tests.</description>

      <title>$p$-Adic Brownian Motion is a Scaling Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.05492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $p$-adic Brownian motion is a continuous time stochastic process in a $p$-adic state space that has a Vladimirov operator as its infinitesimal generator. The current work shows that any such process is the scaling limit of a discrete time random walk on a discrete group. Earlier work required the exponent of the Vladimirov operator to be in $(1, \infty)$, and the convergence was the weak convergence of probability measures on the Skorohod space of paths on a compact time interval. The current approach simplifies the earlier approach, allows for any positive exponent, eliminates the restriction to compact time intervals, and establishes some moment estimates for the discrete time processes that are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we review and derive some elementary properties of the discrete renewal sequences based on a positive, finite and integer-valued random variable. Our results consider these sequences as dependent on the probability masses of the underlying random variable. In particular we study the minima and the maxima of these sequences and prove that they are attained for indices of the sequences smaller or equal than the support of the underlying random variable. Noting that the minimum itself is a minimum of multi-variate polynomials we conjecture that one universal polynomial envelopes the minimum from below and that it is maximal in some sense and largest in another. We prove this conjecture in a special case.</description>

Abstract: We introduce simple conditions ensuring that invariant distributions of a Feller Markov chain on a compact Riemannian manifold are absolutely continuous with a lower semi-continuous, continuous or smooth density with respect to the Riemannian measure. This is applied to Markov chains obtained by random composition of maps and to piecewise deterministic Markov processes obtained by random switching between flows.</description>

Abstract: Two-pointed quantum disks with a weight parameter $W&gt;0$ is a canonical family of finite-volume random surfaces in Liouville quantum gravity. We extend the conformal welding of quantum disks in [AHS23] to the non-simple regime, and give a construction of the multiple SLE associated with any given link pattern for $\kappa\in(4,8)$. Our proof is based on connections between SLE and Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT), where we show that in the conformal welding of multiple forested quantum disks, the surface after welding can be described in terms of LCFT, and the random conformal moduli contains the SLE partition function for the interfaces as a multiplicative factor. As a corollary, for $\kappa\in(4,8)$, we prove the existence of the multiple SLE partition functions, which are smooth functions satisfying a system of PDEs and conformal covariance.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Proof of the Spherical Parisi Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Parisi formula for the free energy is among the crown jewels in the theory of spin glasses. We present a simpler proof of the lower bound in the case of the spherical mean-field model. Our method follows the TAP approach developed recently in e.g. (Subag, 2018): we obtain an ultrametric tree of pure states, each with approximately the same free energy as the entire model, which are hierarchically arranged in accordance with the Parisi ansatz. We construct this tree ``layer by layer'' given the minimizer to Parisi's variational problem. On overlap intervals with full RSB, the tree is built by an optimization algorithm due to Subag. On overlap intervals with finite RSB, the tree is constructed by a new truncated second moment argument; a similar argument also characterizes the free energy of the resulting pure states. Notably we do not use the Aizenman--Sims--Starr scheme, and require interpolation bounds only up to the 1RSB level. Our methods also yield results for large deviations of the ground state, including the entire upper tail rate function for all 1RSB models without external field.</description>

Abstract: These lecture notes, adapted from the habilitation thesis of the author, survey in a first part various exact results obtained in the past few decades about KPZ fluctuations in one dimension, with a special focus on finite volume effects describing the relaxation to its stationary state of a finite system starting from a given initial condition. The second part is more specifically devoted to an approach allowing to express in a simple way the statistics of the current in the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process in terms of a contour integral on a compact Riemann surface, whose infinite genus limit leads to KPZ fluctuations in finite volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiro, Surya and Zeng (Electron. J. Combin. 2023; arXiv:2207.11272) recently studied a semi-restricted variant of the well-known game Rock, Paper, Scissors; in this variant the game is played for $3n$ rounds, but one of the two players is restricted and has to use each of the three moves exactly $n$ times. They find the optimal strategy, and they show that it results in an expected score for the unrestricted player $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$; they conjecture, based on numerical evidence, that the expectation is $\approx 1.46\sqrt{n}$.
  We analyse the result of the strategy further and show that the average is $\sim c \sqrt{n}$ with $c=3\sqrt{3}/2\sqrt{\pi}=1.466$, verifying the conjecture. We also find the asymptotic distribution of the score, and compute its variance.</description>

      <title>Conditionings to avoid points with various clocks for L\'{e}vy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss conditionings to avoid two points and one-point local time penalizations with conditioning to avoid another point, for which we adopt various clocks. We also give corrections to some of the previous results of Takeda--Yano for one-point local time penalizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1511.05240v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize McDiarmid's inequality for functions with bounded differences on a high probability set, using an extension argument. Those functions concentrate around their conditional expectations. We further extend the results to concentration in general metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Two-type branching processes with immigration, and the structured coalescents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.07645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a population constituted by two types of individuals; each of them can produce offspring in two different islands (as a particular case the islands can be interpreted as active or dormant individuals). We model the evolution of the population of each type using a two-type Feller diffusion with immigration, and we study the frequency of one of the types, in each island, when the total population size in each island is forced to be constant at a dense set of times. This leads to the solution of a SDE which we call the asymmetric two-island frequency process. We derive properties of this process and obtain a large population limit when the total size of each island tends to infinity. Additionally, we compute the fluctuations of the process around its deterministic limit. We establish conditions under which the asymmetric two-island frequency process has a moment dual. The dual is a continuous-time two-dimensional Markov chain that can be interpreted in terms of mutation, branching, pairwise branching, coalescence, and a novel mixed selection-migration term. Also, we conduct a stability analysis of the limiting deterministic dynamical system and present some numerical results to study fixation and a new form of balancing selection. When restricting to the seedbank model, we observe that some combinations of the parameters lead to balancing selection. Besides finding yet another way in which genetic reservoirs increase the genetic variability, we find that if a population that sustains a seedbank competes with one that does not, the seed producers will have a selective advantage if they reproduce faster, but will not have a selective disadvantage if they reproduce slower: their worst case scenario is balancing selection.</description>

      <title>Real roots of hypergeometric polynomials via finite free convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine two binary operations on the set of algebraic polynomials, known as multiplicative and additive finite free convolutions, specifically in the context of hypergeometric polynomials. We show that the representation of a hypergeometric polynomial as a finite free convolution of more elementary blocks, combined with the preservation of the real zeros and interlacing by the free convolutions, is an effective tool that allows us to analyze when all roots of a specific hypergeometric polynomial are real. Moreover, the known limit behavior of finite free convolutions allows us to write the asymptotic zero distribution of some hypergeometric polynomials as free convolutions of Marchenko-Pastur, reversed Marchenko-Pastur, and free beta laws, which has an independent interest within free probability.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Feature Augmentation for AIS-Based Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectory Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18948v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maritime transportation is paramount in achieving global economic growth, entailing concurrent ecological obligations in sustainability and safeguarding endangered marine species, most notably preserving large whale populations. In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</description>

      <title>Weak and Strong Solutions to Nonlinear SPDEs with Unbounded Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extended variational framework for nonlinear SPDEs with unbounded noise, defining three different solution types of increasing strength along with criteria to establish their existence. The three notions can be understood as probabilistically and analytically weak, probabilistically strong and analytically weak, as well as probabilistically and analytically strong. Our framework facilitates several well-posedness results for the Navier-Stokes Equation with transport noise, equipped with the no-slip and Navier boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for a finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for a finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (SHE). More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization of SHE by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a TPFA scheme with respect to space and the variational solution of SHE. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>
