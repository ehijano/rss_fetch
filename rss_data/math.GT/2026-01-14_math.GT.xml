      <title>Brunnian links and Kontsevich graph complex I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a natural chain map from the Kontsevich graph complex to the rational singular chain complex of $B\mathrm{Diff}_\partial(D^{2k})$ when the dimension $2k$ is sufficiently large, generalizing Goussarov and Habiro's theories of surgery on 3-valent graphs in 3-manifolds. Our construction can be considered as a topological realization of the Kontsevich graph complex. We also give new constructions of elements in the rational homotopy groups of $B\mathrm{Diff}_\partial(D^{2k})$ which are determined by well-known cycles in the graph complex.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$'s with Heegaard Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attaching a Casson handle to a slice disk complement yields a smooth 4-manifold that is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^4$. We show that if two slice knots have sufficiently different knot Floer homology, then the resulting exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$'s made using the simplest positive Casson handle are not diffeomorphic, giving us a countably infinite family of pairwise nondiffeomorphic chiral exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$'s. Our main tool is Gadgil's end Floer homology and we use this to produce families of exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ with various phenomena. As an application, we reprove a result of Bi\v{z}aca-Etnyre that $Y \times \mathbb{R}$, where $Y$ is any closed $3$-manifold, has infinitely many distinct smooth structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Heegaard diagrams and knot Floer Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a unification of the Alexander and Jones polynomials via a new geometric perspective, involving "quantum Heegaard surfaces". Then, we prove that it leads to knot Floer homology and opens avenues for explicit geometric categorifications for the Jones polynomial. This model codifies the difference between the geometry of the Alexander and Jones polynomials via a quantum deformation of the Alexander grading, constructed on the surface.
  We do so by introducing a new type of diagram, called "quantum Heegaard diagram" (encoding the knot complement) together with a "quantum Alexander grading". This grading is a refinement of the Alexander grading used in knot Floer homology. Then we define a graded Lagrangian intersection, in two variables, between concrete Lagrangian submanifolds arising from the curves of the diagram in the symmetric power of the quantum Heegaard surface. The two-variable intersection unifies and recovers the Jones and Alexander polynomials as two specialisations of coefficients. Moreover, this leads to knot Floer homology on one side and provides an intersection model for the Jones polynomial on the other. The surface and Lagrangian submanifolds are concretely constructed via braid actions on the punctured disc.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Framework for the McKay Correspondence via Gauge-Theoretic Morse Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The McKay correspondence establishes a bijection between the cohomology of a minimal resolution and the irreducible representations of a finite subgroup $\Gamma \subset \text{SU}(2)$. While traditional proofs rely on static algebraic isomorphisms, we propose a dynamical framework grounded in gauge theory and Morse-Bott theory. We analyze an $S^1$-invariant Morse-Bott function on the minimal resolution, interpreting its gradient flow lines as $1$-parameter families of holonomy representations of flat connections from $\Gamma$ to $GL(R)$. We conjecture that the flow emanating from a critical submanifold converges asymptotically at the boundary to a specific irreducible representation of $\Gamma$. This dynamical process explicitly constructs the identification between the cohomology basis and the irreducible representations of $\Gamma$ prescribed by the McKay correspondence. We prove this conjecture for cyclic cases.</description>

      <title>Cocompact Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Fuchsian group $\Gamma$ has a modular embedding if its adjoint trace field is a totally real number field and every unbounded Galois conjugate $\Gamma^\sigma$ comes equipped with a holomorphic (or conjugate holomorphic) map ${\phi^\sigma : \mathbb{B}^1 \to \mathbb{B}^1}$ intertwining the actions of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^\sigma$ on the Poincar\'e disk $\mathbb{B}^1$. This paper provides the first cocompact nonarithmetic Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding that are not commensurable with a triangle group. The main result, proved using period domains, is that any immersed totally geodesic complex curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold has a modular embedding. Another consequence is arithmeticity of totally geodesic curves on finite-volume complex hyperbolic surfaces that are commensurable with quotients of $\mathbb{B}^1$ by the group generated by reflections in quadrilaterals satisfying certain angle conditions.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion and orbit counting of Kleinian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the divergence of Kleinian groups $\Gamma$ and the recurrence of simple random walks on the Schreier graph associated with $\Gamma$. In particular, we show that if $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of a lattice and is of divergence type, then the Schreier graph is recurrent. Our approach builds connections among the growth rate of the $\Gamma$-orbit, the volume growth rate of the quotient manifolds, and the growth rate of the Schreier graph. Using the connections, we construct abundant Kleinian groups of divergence type.</description>

      <title>An Unexpected Rational Blowdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rational blowdown operation in 4-manifold topology replaces a neighborhood of a configuration of spheres by a rational homology ball. Such configurations typically arise from resolutions of surface singularities that admit rational homology disk smoothings. Conjecturally, all such singularities must be weighted homogeneous and belong to certain specific families: Stipsicz-Szab\'o--Wahl constructed QHD smoothings for these families and used Donaldson's theorem to obtain very restrictive necessary conditions on the resolution graphs for singularities with this property. In particular, these results, as well as subsequent work of Bhupal-Stipsicz, show that for certain resolution graphs, the canonical contact structure on the link of the singularity cannot admit a QHD symplectic filling. By contrast, we exhibit Stein rational homology disk fillings for the contact links of an infinite family of rational singularities that are {\em not} weighted homogeneous, producing a new symplectic rational blowdown. Inspiration for our construction comes from de Jong-van Straten's description of Milnor fibers of sandwiched singularities; we use the symplectic analog of de Jong-van Straten theory developed by the second and third authors. The unexpected Stein fillings are built using spinal open books and nearly Lefschetz fibrations.</description>

      <title>Configuration spaces of circles in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the space of all configurations of finitely many (potentially nested) circles in the plane. We prove that this space is aspherical, and compute the fundamental group of each of its connected components. It turns out these fundamental groups are obtained as iterated semidirect products of subgroups of braid groups, with the structure for each component dictated by a finite rooted tree. These groups can be viewed as "braided" versions of the automorphism groups of such trees. We also discuss connections to statistical mechanics, topological data analysis, and geometric group theory.</description>
