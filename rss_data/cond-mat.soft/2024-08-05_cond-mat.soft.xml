      <title>Morse Theory and Meron Mediated Interactions Between Disclination Lines in Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological understanding of nematic liquid crystals is traditionally centered on singularities, or defects, and their classification via homotopy theory. However, this approach has ultimately proved insufficient to properly capture a range of complex behaviours that have been reported in three dimensions. To address this, we argue that a finer understanding of topology is required, in which non-singular but non-trivial topological solitons - so-called merons - play a central role in mediating interactions between disclination lines. We present a comprehensive framework for capturing such behaviour that draws heavily on aspects of Morse theory; the key notion being that merons appear singular under projection onto a two-dimensional surface. This permits the use of singularity theory and dividing curves to characterise nematic textures via tomography, as well as an understanding of topological transitions via surgery theory. We use our ideas to understand and classify complex three-dimensional behaviours, such as the linking, rewiring and crossing of disclination lines, as well as to provide a new perspective on defect charge.</description>

      <title>Orientational order in liquid crystal surface induced by evaporation of water droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaporation of a droplet induces variety of ordered patterns near the contact line between the droplet and a substrate. This pattern formation involves both the behavior of colloidal suspensions and interactions between a droplet and a substrate. Although studies on the effect of the behavior of colloidal suspensions on the deposition process have been actively conducted, studies on the effect of the interaction between a droplet and a substrate have not been actively conducted because the observation of the interaction is difficult owing to the lack of structural changes in the substrate by the interaction. In this study, we investigated the solvent-substrate interactions by using a water droplet and liquid crystals as a substrate, where the liquid crystals were placed on a glass slide. The orientation patterns of the liquid crystals were induced at the contact line between the water droplet and the liquid crystal and were observed using a polarized optical microscope. Pinning and depinning events were observed at a certain anchoring strength of the liquid crystal on the glass slide and formed linear patterns on the surface of the liquid crystal. Additionally, the interfacial tension between the water and liquid crystal slowly varied at this anchoring strength owing to the variation in the orientation of the liquid crystals. These results indicated that the evaporation-induced patterns appeared when the strength of the solvent-substrate interactions was neutral. The interaction between a droplet and a substrate is important for the fabrication of desired ordered patterns.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of vapor-liquid transition of active matter system under quasi one-dimensional confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the kinetics of vapor-liquid phase separation in a quasi one-dimensional confined active matter system using molecular dynamics simulations. Activity is invoked via the Vicsek rule, while passive interaction follows the Lennard-Jones potential. With the system density near the vapor branch, the evolution morphology features disconnected liquid clusters. In the passive limit, coarsening begins with nucleation, followed by an evaporation-condensation growth mechanism, leading to a metastable state without complete phase separation. We aim to understand the impact of Vicsek-like self-propulsion on the structure and growth of these clusters. Our key finding is that Vicsek activity results in a distinct growth mechanism, notably rapid cluster growth and the breakdown of the metastable state through ballistic aggregation. Relevant growth laws are analyzed and explained using appropriate theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Effect of interleaflet friction on the dynamics of molecular rotors in lipid membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular rotors form twisted conformations upon photoexcitation, with their fluorescent relaxation time serving as a measure of viscosity. They have been used to assess membrane viscosities but yield higher values compared to other methods. Here, we show that the rotor's relaxation time is influenced by a combination of membrane viscosity and interleaflet friction. We present a theory for the relaxation time and obtain a correction factor that accounts for the discrepancy. If the membrane's viscosity is known, molecular rotors may enable the extraction of the elusive interleaflet friction.</description>

      <title>Tailoring anisotropy in kirigami metamaterial skins with pop-up folding hinges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kirigami metamaterial sheets and tubes, owing to their capacity to undergo large elastic deformations while developing three-dimensional surface textures, have enormous potential as skins for soft robots. Here, we propose to use kirigami skins with folding hinges in this same context. These recently-introduced kirigami feature counter-rotating panels connected by pop-up folding hinges. So far, researchers have only explored auxetic and highly-symmetric versions of such patterns. Yet, some of these attributes have to be relaxed in order to explore their full potential as robotic skins. Thus, we parameterize these patterns and relax symmetry constraints, with the goal of using this same platform to obtain a wide range of shape-morphing behaviors. We use a combination of: matrix analysis tools and analytical kinematic formulas to thoroughly explore the vast design space that ensues; experiments for validation purposes; and numerical simulations to explore the mechanics of selected planar and tubular patterns. We demonstrate that it is possible to tailor parameters to obtain skins that globally expand or contract due to axial elongation, and that present asymmetric pop-ups that can yield anisotropic friction -- the most desired attribute for one-way locomotion of soft robots.</description>

      <title>Free energy, rates, and mechanism of transmembrane dimerization in lipid bilayers from dynamically unbiased molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assembly of proteins in membranes plays a key role in many crucial cellular pathways. Despite their importance, characterizing transmembrane assembly remains challenging for experiments and simulations. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations do not cover the time scales required to sample the typical transmembrane assembly. Hence, most studies rely on enhanced sampling schemes that steer the dynamics of transmembrane proteins along a collective variable that should encode all slow degrees of freedom. However, given the complexity of the condensed-phase lipid environment, this is far from trivial, with the consequence that free energy profiles of dimerization can be poorly converged. Here, we introduce an alternative approach, which relies only on simulating short, dynamically unbiased trajectory segments, avoiding using collective variables or biasing forces. By merging all trajectories, we obtain free energy profiles, rates, and mechanisms of transmembrane dimerization with the same set of simulations. We showcase our algorithm by sampling the spontaneous association and dissociation of a transmembrane protein in a lipid bilayer, the popular coarse-grained Martini force field. Our algorithm represents a promising way to investigate assembly processes in biologically relevant membranes, overcoming some of the challenges of conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in strongly shear-thinning viscoelastic flows through channels and tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear stability of a shear-thinning, viscoelastic fluid undergoing any of the canonical rectilinear shear flows, viz., plane Couette flow and pressure-driven flow through a channel or a tube is analyzed in the creeping-flow limit using the White--Metzner model with a power-law variation of the viscosity with shear rate. While two-dimensional disturbances are considered for plane Couette and channel flows, axisymmetric disturbances are considered for pressure-driven flow in a tube. For all these flows, when the shear-thinning exponent is less than $0.3$, there exists an identical instability at wavelengths much smaller than the relevant geometric length scale (gap between the plates or tube radius). There is also a finite-wavelength instability in these configurations governed by the details of the geometry and boundary conditions at the centerline of the channel or tube. The most unstable mode could be either of the short-wave or finite-wavelength instabilities depending on model parameters. For pressure-driven channel flow, it is possible to have sinuous or varicose unstable modes depending on the symmetry of the normal velocity eigenfunction about the channel centerline. This difference in symmetry is relevant only for the finite wavelength instability, in which case sinuous modes turn out to be more unstable, in accordance with experimental observations. In all the three configurations, the short wavelength unstable modes are localized near the walls, and are insensitive to symmetry conditions at the centerline. It is argued that this instability should be a generic feature in any wall-bounded shear flow of strongly shear-thinning viscoelastic fluids. Our predictions for the finite-wavelength instability in pressure-driven channel and pipe flows are in good agreement with experimental observations for the flow of concentrated polymer solutions in these geometries.</description>

      <title>Extreme-value analysis in nano-biological systems: Applications and Implications</title>

Abstract: Extreme value analysis (EVA) is a statistical method that studies the properties of extreme values of datasets, crucial for fields like engineering, meteorology, finance, insurance, and environmental science. EVA models extreme events using distributions such as Fr\'echet, Weibull, or Gumbel, aiding in risk prediction and management. This review explores EVA's application to nanoscale biosystems. Traditionally, biological research focuses on average values from repeated experiments. However, EVA offers insights into molecular mechanisms by examining extreme data points. We introduce EVA's concepts with simulations and review its use in studying motor protein movements within cells, highlighting the importance of in vivo analysis due to the complex intracellular environment. We suggest EVA as a tool for extracting motor proteins' physical properties in vivo and discuss its potential in other biological systems. While EVA's use in nanoscale biological systems is limited, it holds promise for uncovering hidden properties in extreme data, promoting its broader application in life sciences.</description>

      <title>The escape transition of a lattice star polymer grafted in a pore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polymers in confined spaces are compressed and have reduced conformational entropy, and will partially or fully escape from confinement if conditions are suitable. This is in particular the case for a polymer grafted in a pore. The escape of the polymer from the pore may be considered a partial translocation from the pore into bulk solution, and the resulting conformational readjustment of the polymer has characteristics of a thermodynamic phase transition. In this paper a lattice self-avoiding walk model of a star polymer grafted in a pore is examined numerically using the PERM algorithm. We show that the arms of the grafted lattice star escape one at a time as the length of the pore is reduced, consistent with earlier results in the literature. Critical points for the escape transitions are estimated for square and cubic lattice models and we also examine various properties of the model as it undergoes escape transitions.</description>

      <title>Two-stage assembly of patchy ellipses: From bent-core particlesto liquid crystal analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional behavior of colloidal patchy ellipsoids specifically designed to follow a two-step assembly process from the monomer state to mesoscopic liquid-crystal phases, via the formation of so-called bent-core units at the intermediate stage. Our model comprises a binary mixture of ellipses interacting via the Gay-Berne potential and decorated by surface patches, with the binary components being mirror-image variants of each other - referred to as left-handed and right-handed ellipses according to the position of their patches. The surface patches are designed so as in the first stage of the assembly the monomers form bent-cores units, i.e. V-shaped dimers with a specific bent angle. The Gay-Berne interactions, which act between the ellipses, drive the dimers to subsequently form the characteristic phase observed in bent-core liquid crystals. We numerically investigate -- by means of both Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations -- the described two-step process: we first optimize a target bent-core unit and we then fully characterize its state diagram in temperature and density, defining the regions where the different liquid crystalline phases dominate.</description>

      <title>Thermal signature of helical molecule: Beyond nearest-neighbor electron hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate, for the first time, the thermal signature of a single-stranded helical molecule that is described beyond usual nearest-neighbor electron hopping, by analyzing electronic specific heat. Depending on the hopping of electrons, two different kinds of helical systems are considered. In one case the hopping is confined within a few neighboring lattice sites which is referred to as short-range hopping helix, while in the other case, electrons can hop in all possible sites making the system a long-range hopping one. These two helices accurately emulate the structures of single-stranded DNA and protein molecules, respectively. Each helix geometry is exposed to a transverse electric field applied perpendicular to the helix axis. The interplay among the helicity, higher-order hopping, and the electric field has significant impact on thermal response. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis reveals that, under low-temperature conditions, the short-range hopping helix exhibits greater sensitivity to temperature compared to the long-range hopping helix system. Conversely, the scenario reverses in the high-temperature limit. The thermal response of the helices can be modified selectively by means of the electric field, and the difference between the specific heats of the two helices gradually decreases with increasing the field strength. The molecular handedness, on the other hand, does not have any appreciable effect on the thermal signature. In addition, we also explore a significant application of electronic specific heat (ESH). Finally, we discuss the results of ESH by considering the spin degree of freedom and in the context of real biological helical systems.</description>

      <title>Noise-Induced Phase Separation and Time Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Active Field Theories driven by persistent noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the Landau-Ginzburg picture of phase transitions, scalar field theories develop phase separation because of a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism. This picture works in thermodynamics but also in the dynamics of phase separation. Here we show that scalar non-equilibrium field theories undergo phase separation just because of non-equilibrium fluctuations driven by a persistent noise. The mechanism is similar to what happens in Motility-Induced Phase Separation where persistent motion introduces an effective attractive force. We observe that Noise-Induced Phase Separation occurs in a region of the phase diagram where disordered field configurations would otherwise be stable at equilibrium. Measuring the local entropy production rate to quantify the time-reversal symmetry breaking, we find that such breaking is concentrated on the boundary between the two phases.</description>
