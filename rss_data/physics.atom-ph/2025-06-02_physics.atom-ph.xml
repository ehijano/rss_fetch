      <title>A chip-scale atomic beam source for non-classical light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Room temperature thermal atoms have proven to be a powerful resource for magnetometry, electrometry, atom-entanglement generation, and robust atomic clocks. Recent efforts have sought to realize compact and highly manufacturable atomic vapors and atomic beams for chip-scale magnetometry and atomic clocks. Here, we show that a chip-scale rubidium beam source can be integrated with a high finesse cavity-QED system to generate non-classical light. By demonstrating the compatibility of these two technologies, we open a new path for distributed sources of non-classical light and set the stage for using cavity-QED to enhance the performance of chip-scale magnetometers and atomic clocks.</description>

      <title>Influence of a magnetic field on the frequency of a laser stabilized to molecular iodine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the effect of a weak magnetic field applied on an iodine cell used to frequency stabilize a laser. A 1.5$~\mu$m laser is frequency tripled in order to excite the molecular transitions at 0.51$~\mu$m and frequency locked on a hyperfine line. With this frequency reference, we report short-term stability about $3\,\times\,10^{-14}~\tau^{-1/2}$, with a minimum value of $4\,\times\,10^{-15}$ at 200~s. The lower part of $10^{-15}$ frequency stability domain is reached, in our case, only by adding an efficient magnetic shield around the sealed quartz iodine cell. In order to quantify the Zeeman effect, we applied magnetic fields of several $\,\times\,10^{-4}$~T on the cell containing the iodine vapour. The Zeeman effect affects the lineshape transition in such a way that we observe a modification of the laser frequency. We have measured this linear Zeeman shift at $(1062\pm6)\,\times\,10^{4}$~Hz/T for the $a1$ hyperfine component of the R(34)~44-0 transition, near 514~nm by applying a magnetic field along the cell. Thus, in case of uncontrolled magnetic fields of an order of magnitude of 1$\,\times\,10^{-4}$~T, the frequency stability is limited in the upper of the $10^{-14}$ domain.</description>

      <title>Fast programmable entanglement of Barium ion qubits using Rydberg states and AC-Stark shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scheme for excitation and individual addressing using Rydberg states of trapped Barium ions is presented for the purpose of fast gates and entanglement. Dipole matrix elements, dynamic polarizabilities, and one- and two-photon transition strengths are computed with a Supersymmetric Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (SWKB) method. A favorable two-photon excitation transition is identified, linking the 7s$1/2$ state to high-lying Rydberg states, with the strongest transition found to be 7s12-&gt;38s12. Additionally, the 7s1/2 state exhibits high polarizability around the telecom band at 1310 nm, enabling significant AC-Stark shift control with a turnkey laser at low power. This facilitates an individual addressing scheme by varying light intensity across an ion crystal, supporting sub-microsecond entangling gates between ion pairs with the strong and microwave-tunable Rydberg dipolar interaction. Selective addressing of individual ions by laser frequency tuning using the 6p3/2-&gt;7s1/2 transition is proposed.</description>

      <title>Observation of effects of inter-atomic interaction on Autler-Townes splitting in cold Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the effect of inter-atomic interaction in highly excited Rydberg atoms via Autler- Townes splitting in cold atoms. We measure the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting of the 5S1/2, F=2 to 5P3/2, F'=3 transition of 87Rb atoms arising due to the strong coupling of the transition via the cooling beams used for the magneto-optical trap (MOT). The AT splitting is probed using a weakly coupled transition from 5P3/2, F'=3 state to highly excited Rydberg states for a wide range of principal quantum numbers (n = 35 - 117). We observe the AT splitting via trap-loss spectroscopy in the MOT by scanning the probe frequency. We observe a drastic increase in the broadening of the AT splitting signal as a result of interaction-induced dephasing effect in cold Rydberg atoms for highly excited Rydberg states with principal quantum number n &gt; 100. We explain our observations using theoretical modelling and numerical simulations based on the Lindblad Master equation. We find a good agreement of the results of the numerical simulation with the experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>A large magneto-optical trap of cadmium atoms loaded from a cryogenic buffer gas beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate rapid loading of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of cadmium atoms from a pulsed cryogenic helium buffer gas beam, overcoming strong photoionization losses. Using the $ ^1S_0 \rightarrow{} ^1P_1 $ transition at 229 nm, we capture up to $ 1.1(2) \times 10^7$ $^{112}$Cd atoms in 10 ms, achieving a peak density of $2.5 \times 10^{11}$cm$^{-3}$ and a phase-space density of $ 2 \times 10^{-9} $. The large scattering force in the deep ultraviolet enables Zeeman slowing within 5 cm of the trap, yielding a capture velocity exceeding 200 m/s. We measure the MOT trap frequency and damping constant, and determine the absolute photoionization cross section of the $^1P_1 $ state. Photoionization losses are mitigated via dynamic detuning of the trapping light's frequency, allowing efficient accumulation of multiple atomic pulses. Our results demonstrate the benefits of deep-UV (DUV) transitions and cryogenic beams for loading high-density MOTs, especially for species with significant loss channels in their main cooling cycle. The cadmium MOT provides a robust testbed that benchmarks our DUV laser cooling system and establishes the foundation for trapping and cooling polar AlF molecules, which share many optical and structural properties with Cd.</description>

      <title>Visualizing strongly focused 3D light fields in an atomic vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light, when strongly focused, generates highly confined vectorial electromagnetic field distributions which may feature a polarization component along the optical axis. Manipulating and detecting such 3D light fields is challenging, as conventional optical elements and detectors do not interact with the axial polarization component. Vector light can, however, be mapped onto atomic polarizations, making electric dipole transitions an ideal candidate to sense such 3D light configurations. Working in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime, where the electric dipole transitions are spectrally resolved, we demonstrate direct evidence of the axial polarization component of strongly focused radial light. We investigate the influence of various input polarization states, including radial, azimuthal, and higher-order optical vortices, on atomic absorption profiles. Our results confirm a clear mapping between the 3D vector light and the atomic transition strength. This work provides new insights into vectorial light-matter interaction, and opens avenues for novel quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Creation of a degenerate Bose-Bose mixture of erbium and lithium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the realization of a degenerate mixture of $^{166}$Er and $^{7}$Li atoms in their lowest spin state. The two species are sequentially laser-cooled and loaded into an optical dipole trap, then transported to a glass cell in which further cooling to degeneracy occurs. Since Er is more weakly trapped, it serves as a coolant for Li, and we observe efficient sympathetic cooling facilitated by a large interspecies elastic scattering cross section. Three-body losses are found to be small at the magnetic fields explored, making this platform promising for the study of interacting mixtures with large mass imbalance.</description>

      <title>Energy Time Ptychography for one-dimensional phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase retrieval is at the heart of adaptive optics and modern high-resolution imaging. Without phase information, optical systems are limited to intensity-only measurements, hindering full reconstruction of object structures and wavefront dynamics essential for advanced applications. Here, we address a one-dimensional phase problem linking energy and time, which arises in X-ray scattering from ultrasharp nuclear resonances. We leverage the M\"ossbauer effect, where nuclei scatter radiation without energy loss to the lattice, and are sensitive to their magneto-chemical environments. Rather than using traditional spectroscopy with radioactive gamma-ray sources, we measure nuclear forward scattering of synchrotron X-ray pulses in the time domain, providing superior sensitivity and faster data acquisition. Extracting spectral information from a single measurement is challenging due to the missing phase information, typically requiring extensive modeling. Instead, we use multiple energetically overlapping measurements to retrieve both the transmission spectrum and the phase of the scattering response, similar to ptychographic phase retrieval in imaging. Our robust approach can overcome the bandwidth limitations of gamma-ray sources, opening new research directions with modern X-ray sources and M\"ossbauer isotopes.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation with longlived Rydberg-Landau atoms featuring suppressed ionization by the Magnetic Cage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic processing units require robust entanglement between individual qubits, typically achieved via excitation to highly interacting Rydberg states. However, short Rydberg lifetimes and ionization risks limit the quantum volume score of the atomic processing units. Inspired by Landau resonances in alkaline atoms, we introduce Rydberg-Landau (rLandau) states created under a strong magnetic field (2.5 Tesla). These states exhibit significantly extended lifetimes and a magnetic confinement mechanism that prevents ionization, even under intense laser fields. We analyze their wavefunctions, excitation dynamics, dipole transition rules, lifetimes, and interactions, identifying states optimal for high-fidelity quantum operations. This approach simplifies the coherent excitation of long-lived, strongly interacting rLandau circular states akin to Coulombic counterparts, enabling deeper and more complex quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Bloch Equation Generator -- SimuF\'isica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between multilevel quantum systems and coherent radiation underlies several phenomena in modern atomic optics. The formulation and solution of the Bloch equations, which describe the dynamics of such systems, become complex as the number of levels increases. In this work, we present the Bloch Equation Generator, a free, browser-based computational tool developed to automate the generation and numerical solution of Bloch equations for systems with up to 30 levels. Users can configure the level diagram, select allowed transitions, define decay rates, and choose whether or not to apply the rotating wave approximation. The software automatically generates the complete set of equations and provides C source code for numerical solutions in both the time and frequency domains. To illustrate its applicability, we present three examples: (i) a two-level system, (ii) a $\Lambda$-type system with analysis of CPT, EIT, and the Autler-Townes effect, and (iii) a realistic 12-level system based on the Zeeman-resolved $5S_{1/2} \to 5P_{3/2}$ transition of rubidium-87.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing strong interactions between individual photons is a cornerstone for advancing photonic quantum computing and quantum nonlinear optics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate strong interactions between counter-propagating photons mediated by Rydberg polaritons, achieving a record-long anti-correlation range exceeding $1~\mu s$. This extended range enables the use of photon pulses that are long enough to fit within the polariton bandwidth, yet short enough to remain within the interaction range. Under these conditions, we observe complete photon blockade of entire pulses, tunable by the pulse timing, thus demonstrating the potential for controlled, deterministic operations. Extending to the three-photon regime, we observe enhanced interactions when a photon encounters two counter-propagating photons. Our results, supported by analytical theory and rigorous numerical simulations, establish counter-propagating Rydberg polaritons as a powerful platform for engineering interactions in quantum light fields.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of four-body scattering in one-dimensional (1D) quantum systems using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation (AHR). Focusing on dimer-dimer collisions between two species of fermions interacting via the sinh-cosh potential, we implement the slow variable discretization (SVD) method to overcome numerical challenges posed by sharp avoided crossings in the potential curves. Our numerical approach is benchmarked against exact analytical results available in integrable regimes, demonstrating excellent agreement. We further explore non-integrable regimes where no analytical solutions exist, revealing novel features such as resonant enhancement of the scattering length associated with tetramer formation. These results highlight the power and flexibility of the AHR+SVD framework for accurate few-body scattering calculations in low-dimensional quantum systems, and establish a foundation for future investigations of universal few-body physics in ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>Direct Extraction of Nuclear Structure Information Using Precision Lithium-Ion Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately describing nuclear interactions within atomic nuclei remains a challenge, which hinders our exploration of new physics beyond the Standard Model. However, these nuclear interactions can be characterized by nuclear parameters such as the Zemach radius and the electric quadrupole moment, which are reflected in atomic spectra. Our work has achieved high-precision measurements of lithium ion hyperfine splittings at the level of $10$~kHz, and directly extracted these important nuclear structure parameters. We observed significant discrepancies between our results and both nuclear theory and molecular spectra regarding the electric quadrupole moment. The result for $^7$Li deviated by $2.3\sigma$ from the currently recommended value, whereas the result for $^6$Li deviated by up to $6.2\sigma$ from the recommended value determined by molecular spectroscopy. These discrepancies motivated us to conduct independent calculations based on nuclear structure theory, which provided support for the results obtained from ion spectroscopy. Our results provide valuable information for characterizing nuclear forces, serve as sensitive benchmarks for testing nuclear structure theories, and enable critical comparisons with both electron-nuclear scattering and molecular spectroscopy.</description>

In contrast to the classical-gas experiments, where no temperature change was measured, here we observe and quantitatively explain both cooling and heating effects, which arise, respectively, due to quantum statistics and inter-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Machine Learning Potentials via Difference Vectors Based on Local Atomic Environments</title>

Abstract: Constructing efficient and diverse datasets is essential for the development of accurate machine learning potentials (MLPs) in atomistic simulations. However, existing approaches often suffer from data redundancy and high computational costs. Herein, we propose a new method--Difference Vectors based on Local Atomic Environments (DV-LAE)--that encodes structural differences via histogram-based descriptors and enables visual analysis through t-SNE dimensionality reduction. This approach facilitates redundancy detection and dataset optimization while preserving structural diversity. We demonstrate that DV-LAE significantly reduces dataset size and training time across various materials systems, including high-pressure hydrogen, iron-hydrogen binaries, magnesium hydrides, and carbon allotropes, with minimal compromise in prediction accuracy. For instance, in the $\alpha$-Fe/H system, maintaining a highly similar MLP accuracy, the dataset size was reduced by 56%, and the training time per iteration dropped by over 50%. Moreover, we show how visualizing the DV-LAE representation aids in identifying out-of-distribution data by examining the spatial distribution of high-error prediction points, providing a robust reliability metric for new structures during simulations. Our results highlight the utility of local environment visualization not only as an interpretability tool but also as a practical means for accelerating MLP development and ensuring data efficiency in large-scale atomistic modeling.</description>

      <title>Spin polarized enantio-sensitive multipolar photoelectron currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents already in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum and spin-detection axis. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules via circularly polarized light and show that the resulting spin-resolved current has three components whose magnitudes are comparable and can be larger than PECD: (i) a spin-polarization vortex in the plane of light polarization that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers, (ii) either a spin-sink or source in the plane of light polarization for opposite enantiomers, and (iii) a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality.</description>
