      <title>Measuring the Euro Area Output Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the Euro Area (EA) output gap and potential output using a non-stationary dynamic factor model estimated on a large dataset of macroeconomic and financial variables. From 2012 to 2024, we estimate that the EA economy was tighter than policy institutions estimate, suggesting that the slow EA growth results from a potential output issue, not a business cycle issue. Moreover, we find that a decline in trend inflation, not slack in the economy, kept core inflation below 2% before the pandemic and that demand forces account for at least 30% of the post-pandemic increase in core inflation.</description>

      <title>A Nonparametric Test of Slutsky Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic theory implies strong limitations on what types of consumption behavior are considered rational. Rationality implies that the Slutsky matrix, which captures the substitution effects of compensated price changes on demand for different goods, is symmetric and negative semi-definite. While negative semi-definiteness has been shown to be nonparametrically testable, a fully nonparametric test of symmetry has remained elusive due to the inherent multidimensionality of the problem. Recently, it has even been shown that the symmetry condition is not testable via the average Slutsky matrix, prompting conjectures about its non-testability. We settle this question by deriving nonparametric conditional quantile restrictions on observable data that permit construction of a fully nonparametric test for the symmetry condition. The theoretical contribution is a multivariate extension of identification results for partial effects in nonseparable models without monotonicity, which is of independent interest. The derived conditional restrictions induce challenges related to generated regressors and multiple hypothesis testing, which can be addressed using recent statistical methods. Our results provide researchers with the missing tool in many econometric models that rely on Slutsky matrices: from welfare analysis with individual heterogeneity to testing an empirical version of rationality in consumption behavior.</description>

      <title>Estimation and Inference in Boundary Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary Discontinuity Designs are used to learn about treatment effects along a continuous boundary that splits units into control and treatment groups according to a bivariate score variable. These research designs are also called Multi-Score Regression Discontinuity Designs, a leading special case being Geographic Regression Discontinuity Designs. We study the statistical properties of commonly used local polynomial treatment effects estimators along the continuous treatment assignment boundary. We consider two distinct approaches: one based explicitly on the bivariate score variable for each unit, and the other based on their univariate distance to the boundary. For each approach, we present pointwise and uniform estimation and inference methods for the treatment effect function over the assignment boundary. Notably, we show that methods based on univariate distance to the boundary exhibit an irreducible large misspecification bias when the assignment boundary has kinks or other irregularities, making the distance-based approach unsuitable for empirical work in those settings. In contrast, methods based on the bivariate score variable do not suffer from that drawback. We illustrate our methods with an empirical application. Companion general-purpose software is provided.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Mean: Limit Theory and Tests for Infinite-Mean Autoregressive Conditional Durations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) models serve as natural counterparts to the well-known integrated GARCH models used for financial returns. However, despite their resemblance, asymptotic theory for ACD is challenging and also not complete, in particular for integrated ACD. Central challenges arise from the facts that (i) integrated ACD processes imply durations with infinite expectation, and (ii) even in the non-integrated case, conventional asymptotic approaches break down due to the randomness in the number of durations within a fixed observation period. Addressing these challenges, we provide here unified asymptotic theory for the (quasi-) maximum likelihood estimator for ACD models; a unified theory which includes integrated ACD models. Based on the new results, we also provide a novel framework for hypothesis testing in duration models, enabling inference on a key empirical question: whether durations possess a finite or infinite expectation. We apply our results to high-frequency cryptocurrency ETF trading data. Motivated by parameter estimates near the integrated ACD boundary, we assess whether durations between trades in these markets have finite expectation, an assumption often made implicitly in the literature on point process models. Our empirical findings indicate infinite-mean durations for all the five cryptocurrencies examined, with the integrated ACD hypothesis rejected -- against alternatives with tail index less than one -- for four out of the five cryptocurrencies considered.</description>

      <title>Change-Point Detection in Time Series Using Mixed Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use cutting-edge mixed integer optimization (MIO) methods to develop a framework for detection and estimation of structural breaks in time series regression models. The framework is constructed based on the least squares problem subject to a penalty on the number of breakpoints. We restate the $l_0$-penalized regression problem as a quadratic programming problem with integer- and real-valued arguments and show that MIO is capable of finding provably optimal solutions using a well-known optimization solver. Compared to the popular $l_1$-penalized regression (LASSO) and other classical methods, the MIO framework permits simultaneous estimation of the number and location of structural breaks as well as regression coefficients, while accommodating the option of specifying a given or minimal number of breaks. We derive the asymptotic properties of the estimator and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive numerical experiments, confirming a more accurate estimation of multiple breaks as compared to popular non-MIO alternatives. Two empirical examples demonstrate usefulness of the framework in applications from business and economic statistics.</description>
