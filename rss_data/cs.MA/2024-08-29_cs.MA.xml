      <title>3D Topological Modeling and Multi-Agent Movement Simulation for Viral Infection Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a method to study how the design of indoor spaces and people's movement within them affect disease spread is proposed by integrating computer-aided modeling, multi-agent movement simulation, and airborne viral transmission modeling. Topologicpy spatial design and analysis software is used to model indoor environments, connect spaces, and construct a navigation graph. Pathways for agents, each with unique characteristics such as walking speed, infection status, and activities, are computed using this graph. Agents follow a schedule of events with specific locations and times. The software calculates "time-to-leave" based on walking speed and event start times, and agents are moved along the shortest path within the navigation graph, accurately considering obstacles, doorways, and walls. Precise distance calculations between agents are enabled by this setup. Viral aerosol concentration is then computed and visualized using a reaction-diffusion equation, and each agent's infection risk is determined with an extension of the Wells-Riley ansatz. Infection risk simulations are improved by this spatio-temporal and topological approach, incorporating realistic human behavior and spatial dynamics. The resulting software is designed as a rapid decision-support tool for policymakers, facility managers, stakeholders, architects, and engineers to mitigate disease spread in existing buildings and inform the design of new ones. The software's effectiveness is demonstrated through a comparative analysis of cellular and open commercial office plan layouts.</description>

      <title>Improving the Prediction of Individual Engagement in Recommendations Using Cognitive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For public health programs with limited resources, the ability to predict how behaviors change over time and in response to interventions is crucial for deciding when and to whom interventions should be allocated. Using data from a real-world maternal health program, we demonstrate how a cognitive model based on Instance-Based Learning (IBL) Theory can augment existing purely computational approaches. Our findings show that, compared to general time-series forecasters (e.g., LSTMs), IBL models, which reflect human decision-making processes, better predict the dynamics of individuals' states. Additionally, IBL provides estimates of the volatility in individuals' states and their sensitivity to interventions, which can improve the efficiency of training of other time series models.</description>

      <title>Parametrization and convergence of a primal-dual block-coordinate approach to linearly-constrained nonsmooth optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note is concerned with the problem of minimizing a separable, convex, composite (smooth and nonsmooth) function subject to linear constraints. We study a randomized block-coordinate interpretation of the Chambolle-Pock primal-dual algorithm, based on inexact proximal gradient steps. A specificity of the considered algorithm is its robustness, as it converges even in the absence of strong duality or when the linear program is inconsistent. Using matrix preconditiong, we derive tight sublinear convergence rates with and without duality assumptions and for both the convex and the strongly convex settings. Our developments are extensions and particularizations of original algorithms proposed by Malitsky (2019) and Luke and Malitsky (2018). Numerical experiments are provided for an optimal transport problem of service pricing.</description>

      <title>Consensus Planning with Primal, Dual, and Proximal Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consensus planning is a method for coordinating decision making across complex systems and organizations, including complex supply chain optimization pipelines. It arises when large interdependent distributed agents (systems) share common resources and must act in order to achieve a joint goal. In this paper, we introduce a generic Consensus Planning Protocol (CPP) to solve such problems. Our protocol allows for different agents to interact with the coordinating algorithm in different ways (e.g., as a primal or dual or proximal agent). In prior consensus planning work, all agents have been assumed to have the same interaction pattern (e.g., all dual agents or all primal agents or all proximal agents), most commonly using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) as proximal agents. However, this is often not a valid assumption in practice, where agents consist of large complex systems, and where we might not have the luxury of modifying these large complex systems at will. Our generic CPP allows for any mix of agents by combining ADMM-like updates for the proximal agents, dual ascent updates for the dual agents, and linearized ADMM updates for the primal agents. We prove convergence results for the generic CPP, namely a sublinear O(1/k) convergence rate under mild assumptions, and two-step linear convergence under stronger assumptions. We also discuss enhancements to the basic method and provide illustrative empirical results.</description>

      <title>Iterative Graph Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By compressing diverse narratives, LLMs go beyond memorization, achieving intelligence by capturing generalizable causal relationships. However, they suffer from local 'representation gaps' due to insufficient training data diversity, limiting their real-world utility, especially in tasks requiring strict alignment to rules. Traditional alignment methods relying on heavy human annotations are inefficient and unscalable. Recent self-alignment techniques also fall short, as they often depend on self-selection based prompting and memorization-based learning. To address these issues, we introduce Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA), an annotation-free rule-based alignment algorithm. A teacher model (VLM) employs Iterative Graph Prompting (IGP) to create logical graphs and reference answers. The student model (LLM) identifies local knowledge gaps by attempting to align its responses with these references, collaborating with helper models to generate diverse answers. These aligned responses are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our evaluations across five rule-based scenarios demonstrate IGP's effectiveness, with a 73.12\% alignment improvement in Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving an 86.20\% improvement, outperforming Claude Sonnet 3.5 in rule-based alignment.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Action Tendency Consistency for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient collaboration in the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm remains a challenge in cooperative multi-agent systems. We identify divergent action tendencies among agents as a significant obstacle to CTDE's training efficiency, requiring a large number of training samples to achieve a unified consensus on agents' policies. This divergence stems from the lack of adequate team consensus-related guidance signals during credit assignments in CTDE. To address this, we propose Intrinsic Action Tendency Consistency, a novel approach for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. It integrates intrinsic rewards, obtained through an action model, into a reward-additive CTDE (RA-CTDE) framework. We formulate an action model that enables surrounding agents to predict the central agent's action tendency. Leveraging these predictions, we compute a cooperative intrinsic reward that encourages agents to match their actions with their neighbors' predictions. We establish the equivalence between RA-CTDE and CTDE through theoretical analyses, demonstrating that CTDE's training process can be achieved using agents' individual targets. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel method to combine intrinsic rewards and CTDE. Extensive experiments on challenging tasks in SMAC and GRF benchmarks showcase the improved performance of our method.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Bridge Operation and maintenance with LLM-based Agents: An Overview of Applications and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In various industrial fields of human social development, people have been exploring methods aimed at freeing human labor. Constructing LLM-based agents is considered to be one of the most effective tools to achieve this goal. Agent, as a kind of human-like intelligent entity with the ability of perception, planning, decision-making, and action, has created great production value in many fields. However, the bridge O\&amp;M field shows a relatively low level of intelligence compared to other industries. Nevertheless, the bridge O\&amp;M field has developed numerous intelligent inspection devices, machine learning algorithms, and autonomous evaluation and decision-making methods, which provide a feasible basis for breakthroughs in artificial intelligence in this field. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of AI bodies based on large-scale language models on the field of bridge O\&amp;M and to analyze the potential challenges and opportunities it brings to the core tasks of bridge O\&amp;M. Through in-depth research and analysis, this paper expects to provide a more comprehensive perspective for understanding the application of intelligentsia in this field.</description>

      <title>PsychoGAT: A Novel Psychological Measurement Paradigm through Interactive Fiction Games with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Psychological measurement is essential for mental health, self-understanding, and personal development. Traditional methods, such as self-report scales and psychologist interviews, often face challenges with engagement and accessibility. While game-based and LLM-based tools have been explored to improve user interest and automate assessment, they struggle to balance engagement with generalizability. In this work, we propose PsychoGAT (Psychological Game AgenTs) to achieve a generic gamification of psychological assessment. The main insight is that powerful LLMs can function both as adept psychologists and innovative game designers. By incorporating LLM agents into designated roles and carefully managing their interactions, PsychoGAT can transform any standardized scales into personalized and engaging interactive fiction games. To validate the proposed method, we conduct psychometric evaluations to assess its effectiveness and employ human evaluators to examine the generated content across various psychological constructs, including depression, cognitive distortions, and personality traits. Results demonstrate that PsychoGAT serves as an effective assessment tool, achieving statistically significant excellence in psychometric metrics such as reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Moreover, human evaluations confirm PsychoGAT's enhancements in content coherence, interactivity, interest, immersion, and satisfaction.</description>

      <title>CityLight: A Universal Model for Coordinated Traffic Signal Control in City-scale Heterogeneous Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasingly severe congestion problem in modern cities strengthens the significance of developing city-scale traffic signal control (TSC) methods for traffic efficiency enhancement. While reinforcement learning has been widely explored in TSC, most of them still target small-scale optimization and cannot directly scale to the city level due to unbearable resource demand. Only a few of them manage to tackle city-level optimization, namely a thousand-scale optimization, by incorporating parameter-sharing mechanisms, but hardly have they fully tackled the heterogeneity of intersections and intricate between-intersection interactions inherent in real-world city road networks. To fill in the gap, we target at the two important challenges in adopting parameter-sharing paradigms to solve TSC: inconsistency of inner state representations for intersections heterogeneous in configuration, scale, and orders of available traffic phases; intricacy of impacts from neighborhood intersections that have various relative traffic relationships due to inconsistent phase orders and diverse relative positioning. Our method, CityLight, features a universal representation module that not only aligns the state representations of intersections by reindexing their phases based on their semantics and designing heterogeneity-preserving observations, but also encodes the narrowed relative traffic relation types to project the neighborhood intersections onto a uniform relative traffic impact space. We further attentively fuse neighborhood representations based on their competing relations and incorporate neighborhood-integrated rewards to boost coordination. Extensive experiments with hundreds to tens of thousands of intersections validate the surprising effectiveness and generalizability of CityLight, with an overall performance gain of 11.68% and a 22.59% improvement in transfer scenarios in throughput.</description>
