      <title>WirelessAgent: Large Language Model Agents for Intelligent Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless networks are increasingly facing challenges due to their expanding scale and complexity. These challenges underscore the need for advanced AI-driven strategies, particularly in the upcoming 6G networks. In this article, we introduce WirelessAgent, a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to develop AI agents capable of managing complex tasks in wireless networks. It can effectively improve network performance through advanced reasoning, multimodal data processing, and autonomous decision making. Thereafter, we demonstrate the practical applicability and benefits of WirelessAgent for network slicing management. The experimental results show that WirelessAgent is capable of accurately understanding user intent, effectively allocating slice resources, and consistently maintaining optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Directional WPT Charging for Routing-Asymmetric WRSNs with a Mobile Charger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Charge Scheduling for wirelessly charging nodes in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) is a promising but still evolving research area. Existing research mostly assumes a symmetric environment, where the routing costs in opposite directions between two locations are considered identical. However, various factors such as terrain restrictions and wind or water flows may invalidate the routing-symmetric assumption in practical environments, thereby significantly limiting the performance of these solutions in routing-asymmetric WRSNs (RA-WRSNs). To address the routing-asymmetric challenges in mobile charge scheduling for WRSNs, this paper systematically investigates the underlying Asymmetric Directional Mobile Charger (DMC) Charge Scheduling (ADMCCS) problem, aiming to minimize energy loss while satisfying the charging demands of the network nodes. The DMC model is assumed because its results can be easily applied to the specialized case of an Omnidirectional Mobile Charger (OMC). To solve the ADMCCS problem, we propose a four-step framework. First, a minimum-size efficient charging position set is selected using our designed K-means-based Charging Position Generation (KCPG) algorithm, addressing the challenge of the unlimited charging position selection space. Next, minimum-size functional-equivalent direction sets at these positions are determined using an optimal algorithm, tackling the challenge of infinite charging directions. Subsequently, the optimal energy transmission time lengths for all directions at the positions are obtained by formulating and solving a Nonlinear Program (NLP) problem. Finally, the Lin-Kernighan Heuristic (LKH) algorithm for the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem is adapted to obtain a highly probable optimal loop tour, addressing the routing-asymmetric challenge.</description>

      <title>External Memories of PDP Switches for In-Network Implementable Functions Placement: Deep Learning Based Reconfiguration of SFCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network function virtualization leverages programmable data plane switches to deploy in-network implementable functions, to improve QoS. The memories of switches can be extended through remote direct memory access to access external memories. This paper exploits the switches external memories to place VNFs at time intervals with ultra-low latency and high bandwidth demands. The reconfiguration decision is modeled as an optimization to minimize the deployment and reconfiguration cost, while meeting the SFCs deadlines. A DRL based method is proposed to reconfigure service chains adoptable with dynamic network and traffic characteristics. To deal with slow convergence due to the complexity of deployment scenarios, static and dynamic filters are used in policy networks construction to diminish unfeasible placement exploration. Results illustrate improvement in convergence, acceptance ratio and cost.</description>

      <title>Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MIT/IEEE/Amazon GraphChallenge encourages community approaches to developing new solutions for analyzing graphs and sparse data derived from social media, sensor feeds, and scientific data to discover relationships between events as they unfold in the field. The anonymized network sensing Graph Challenge seeks to enable large, open, community-based approaches to protecting networks. Many large-scale networking problems can only be solved with community access to very broad data sets with the highest regard for privacy and strong community buy-in. Such approaches often require community-based data sharing. In the broader networking community (commercial, federal, and academia) anonymized source-to-destination traffic matrices with standard data sharing agreements have emerged as a data product that can meet many of these requirements. This challenge provides an opportunity to highlight novel approaches for optimizing the construction and analysis of anonymized traffic matrices using over 100 billion network packets derived from the largest Internet telescope in the world (CAIDA). This challenge specifies the anonymization, construction, and analysis of these traffic matrices. A GraphBLAS reference implementation is provided, but the use of GraphBLAS is not required in this Graph Challenge. As with prior Graph Challenges the goal is to provide a well-defined context for demonstrating innovation. Graph Challenge participants are free to select (with accompanying explanation) the Graph Challenge elements that are appropriate for highlighting their innovations.</description>

      <title>Towards a graph-based foundation model for network traffic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have shown great promise in various fields of study. A potential application of such models is in computer network traffic analysis, where these models can grasp the complexities of network traffic dynamics and adapt to any specific task or network environment with minimal fine-tuning. Previous approaches have used tokenized hex-level packet data and the model architecture of large language transformer models. We propose a new, efficient graph-based alternative at the flow-level. Our approach represents network traffic as a dynamic spatio-temporal graph, employing a self-supervised link prediction pretraining task to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics in this network graph framework. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a few-shot learning experiment for three distinct downstream network tasks: intrusion detection, traffic classification, and botnet classification. Models finetuned from our pretrained base achieve an average performance increase of 6.87\% over training from scratch, demonstrating their ability to effectively learn general network traffic dynamics during pretraining. This success suggests the potential for a large-scale version to serve as an operational foundational model.</description>

      <title>LLM Honeypot: Leveraging Large Language Models as Advanced Interactive Honeypot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of cyber threats necessitates innovative solutions for detecting and analyzing malicious activity. Honeypots, which are decoy systems designed to lure and interact with attackers, have emerged as a critical component in cybersecurity. In this paper, we present a novel approach to creating realistic and interactive honeypot systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). By fine-tuning a pre-trained open-source language model on a diverse dataset of attacker-generated commands and responses, we developed a honeypot capable of sophisticated engagement with attackers. Our methodology involved several key steps: data collection and processing, prompt engineering, model selection, and supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model's performance. Evaluation through similarity metrics and live deployment demonstrated that our approach effectively generates accurate and informative responses. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to revolutionize honeypot technology, providing cybersecurity professionals with a powerful tool to detect and analyze malicious activity, thereby enhancing overall security infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Multi-Model based Federated Learning Against Model Poisoning Attack: A Deep Learning Based Model Selection for MEC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training of a global model from distributed data, while preserving data privacy. However, the singular-model based operation of FL is open with uploading poisoned models compatible with the global model structure and can be exploited as a vulnerability to conduct model poisoning attacks. This paper proposes a multi-model based FL as a proactive mechanism to enhance the opportunity of model poisoning attack mitigation. A master model is trained by a set of slave models. To enhance the opportunity of attack mitigation, the structure of client models dynamically change within learning epochs, and the supporter FL protocol is provided. For a MEC system, the model selection problem is modeled as an optimization to minimize loss and recognition time, while meeting a robustness confidence. In adaption with dynamic network condition, a deep reinforcement learning based model selection is proposed. For a DDoS attack detection scenario, results illustrate a competitive accuracy gain under poisoning attack with the scenario that the system is without attack, and also a potential of recognition time improvement.</description>

      <title>Dataset of Pathloss and ToA Radio Maps With Localization Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present a collection of radio map datasets in dense urban setting, which we generated and made publicly available. The datasets include simulated pathloss/received signal strength (RSS) and time of arrival (ToA) radio maps over a large collection of realistic dense urban setting in real city maps. The two main applications of the presented dataset are 1) learning methods that predict the pathloss from input city maps (namely, deep learning-based simulations), and, 2) wireless localization. The fact that the RSS and ToA maps are computed by the same simulations over the same city maps allows for a fair comparison of the RSS and ToA-based localization methods.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Pipeline Perspective on Video Streaming in Best-Effort Networks: A Survey and Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remaining a dominant force in Internet traffic, video streaming captivates end users, service providers, and researchers. This paper takes a pragmatic approach to reviewing recent advances in the field by focusing on the prevalent streaming paradigm that involves delivering long-form two-dimensional videos over the best-effort Internet with client-side adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms and assistance from content delivery networks (CDNs). To enhance accessibility, we supplement the survey with tutorial material. Unlike existing surveys that offer fragmented views, our work provides a holistic perspective on the entire end-to-end streaming pipeline, from video capture by a camera-equipped device to playback by the end user. Our novel perspective covers the ingestion, processing, and distribution stages of the pipeline and addresses key challenges such as video compression, upload, transcoding, ABR algorithms, CDN support, and quality of experience. We review over 200 papers and classify streaming designs by their problem-solving methodology, whether based on intuition (simple heuristics), theory (formal optimization), or machine learning (generalizable data patterns). The survey further refines these methodology-based categories and characterizes each design by additional traits such as compatible codecs and use of super resolution. We connect the reviewed research to real-world applications by discussing the practices of commercial streaming platforms. Finally, the survey highlights prominent current trends and outlines future directions in video streaming.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Ecosystem of DNS HTTPS Resource Records: An End-to-End Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The DNS HTTPS resource record is a new DNS record type designed for the delivery of configuration information and parameters required to initiate connections to HTTPS network services. In addition, it is a key enabler for TLS Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) by providing the cryptographic keying material needed to encrypt the initial exchange. To understand the adoption of this new DNS HTTPS record, we perform a longitudinal study on the server-side deployment of DNS HTTPS for Tranco top million domains, as well as an analysis of the client-side support for DNS HTTPS through snapshots from major browsers. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first longitudinal study on DNS HTTPS server deployment, and the first known study on client-side support for DNS HTTPS. Despite the rapidly growing trend of DNS HTTPS adoption, our study highlights challenges and concerns in the deployment by both servers and clients, such as the complexity in properly maintaining HTTPS records and connection failure in browsers when the HTTPS record is not properly configured.</description>

      <title>A First Look at Immersive Telepresence on Apple Vision Pro</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the widespread adoption of "work-from-home" policies, videoconferencing applications (e.g., Zoom) have become indispensable for remote communication. However, they often lack immersiveness, leading to the so-called "Zoom fatigue" and degrading communication efficiency. The recent debut of Apple Vision Pro, a mobile headset that supports "spatial persona", aims to offer an immersive telepresence experience. In this paper, we conduct a first-of-its-kind in-depth and empirical study to analyze the performance of immersive telepresence with Apple FaceTime, Cisco Webex, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom on Vision Pro. We find that only FaceTime provides a truly immersive experience with spatial personas, whereas others still operate 2D personas. Our measurement results reveal that (1) FaceTime delivers semantic data to optimize bandwidth consumption, which is even lower than that of 2D persona for other applications, and (2) it employs visibility-aware optimizations to reduce rendering overhead. However, the scalability of FaceTime remains limited, with a simple server-allocation strategy that potentially leads to high network delay for users.</description>

      <title>Gemini: Integrating Full-fledged Sensing upon Millimeter Wave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating millimeter wave (mmWave)technology in both communication and sensing is promising as it enables the reuse of existing spectrum and infrastructure without draining resources. Most existing systems piggyback sensing onto conventional communication modes without fully exploiting the potential of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mmWave radios (not full-fledged). In this paper, we design and implement a full-fledged mmWave ISAC system Gemini; it delivers raw channel states to serve a broad category of sensing applications. We first propose the mmWave self-interference cancellation approach to extract the weak reflected signals for near-field sensing purposes. Then, we develop a joint optimization scheduling framework that can be utilized in accurate radar sensing while maximizing the communication throughput. Finally, we design a united fusion sensing algorithm to offer a better sensing performance via combining monostatic and bistatic modes. We evaluate our system in extensive experiments to demonstrate Gemini's capability of simultaneously operating sensing and communication, enabling mmWave ISAC to perform better than the commercial off-the-shelf mmWave radar for 5G cellular networks.</description>

      <title>J\"ager: Automated Telephone Call Traceback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsolicited telephone calls that facilitate fraud or unlawful telemarketing continue to overwhelm network users and the regulators who prosecute them. The first step in prosecuting phone abuse is traceback -- identifying the call originator. This fundamental investigative task currently requires hours of manual effort per call. In this paper, we introduce J\"ager, a distributed secure call traceback system. J\"ager can trace a call in a few seconds, even with partial deployment, while cryptographically preserving the privacy of call parties, carrier trade secrets like peers and call volume, and limiting the threat of bulk analysis. We establish definitions and requirements of secure traceback, then develop a suite of protocols that meet these requirements using witness encryption, oblivious pseudorandom functions, and group signatures. We prove these protocols secure in the universal composibility framework. We then demonstrate that J\"ager has low compute and bandwidth costs per call, and these costs scale linearly with call volume. J\"ager provides an efficient, secure, privacy-preserving system to revolutionize telephone abuse investigation with minimal costs to operators.</description>
