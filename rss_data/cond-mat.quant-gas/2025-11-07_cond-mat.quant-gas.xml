      <title>Fast Transport of Trapped Ultracold Atoms Using Shortcuts-to-Adiabaticity by Counterdiabatic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the fast spatial transport of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using shortcuts-to-adiabaticity (STA) by counterdiabatic driving (CD). The trapping potential and the required auxiliary potential were simulated as painted potentials. We compared STA transport to transport that follows a constant-acceleration scheme (CA). Experimentally feasible values of trap depth and atom number were used in the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) simulations. Different transport times, trap depths, and trap lengths were investigated. In all simulations, there exists a minimum amount of time necessary for fast transport, which is consistent with previous results from quantum speed limit studies.</description>

      <title>Stability of dark solitons in a bubble Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic stability of dark solitons trapped on the surface of a two-dimensional spherical bubble is investigated. In this spherical geometry of the Bose-Einstein condensate, dark solitons are found to be unstable for the interaction parameter ${\epsilon} \gtrsim 8.37$, since discrete angular modes drive snake instabilities, with the generation of vortex dipoles. We show analytically and numerically that, for each angular mode $m \ge 2$, there exists exactly one unstable mode whose dominance determines the number m of vortex dipoles. Time-dependent simulations confirm the formation of vortex dipoles.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of magnon flux toward a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of angle-dependent parametric pumping of magnons in Yttrium Iron Garnet films, with a focus on the mechanisms that transfer parametrically injected magnons toward the spectral minimum where Bose-Einstein condensation occurs. Using a classical Hamiltonian formalism, we analyze the threshold conditions for parametric instability as a function of the angle between the microwave pumping field and the external magnetic field, continuously tracing the transition between parallel and transverse pumping. We also describe two competing four-magnon scattering mechanisms that transfer parametric magnons toward the bottom of their frequency spectrum: The step-by-step Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade, which is allowed for all magnetic field values, and the kinetic instability mechanisms that provide a much more efficient single-step channel in transferring magnons directly to the lowest-energy states, but occurs within specific regions of the pumping angle and the external magnetic field where the conservation laws permit it. In the experimental part, we employ microfocused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy in combination with a vector magnet, allowing for angle-resolved mapping of the magnon population spectrum under controlled pumping angle. We observe that transverse pumping, although characterized by a higher instability threshold, yields a markedly stronger population at the spectral minimum compared to parallel pumping. These observations demonstrate that the kinetic instability channel plays a dominant role in transferring magnons to the spectral minimum under such conditions. These results reveal the crucial role of pumping geometry in shaping the magnon distribution and provide guidelines for optimizing the flux of magnons into the condensate, thereby advancing the control of magnon Bose-Einstein condensation in magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Fraction of a 2D Bose-Einstein Condensate in a Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the superfluid properties of a two-dimensional, weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in the zero-temperature regime, when it is subjected to a triangular optical lattice potential. We implement an original method, which involves solving the hydrodynamic continuity equation to extract the superfluid fraction tensor from the measured in situ density distribution of the fluid at rest. In parallel, we apply an independent dynamical approach that combines compressibility and sound velocity measurements to determine the superfluid fraction. Both methods yield consistent results in good agreement with simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation as well as with the Leggett bounds determined from the measured density profiles.</description>

      <title>Measuring non-Abelian quantum geometry and topology in a multi-gap photonic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries in semi-metallic multi-gap systems featuring band singularities have galvanized enormous interest in particular due to the emergence of non-Abelian braiding properties of band nodes. This previously uncharted set of topological phases necessitates novel approaches to probe them in laboratories, a pursuit that intricately relates to evaluating non-Abelian generalizations of the Abelian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) that characterizes geometric responses. Here, we pioneer the direct measurement of the non-Abelian QGT. We achieve this by implementing a novel orbital-resolved polarimetry technique to probe the full Bloch Hamiltonian of a six-band two-dimensional (2D) synthetic lattice, which grants direct experimental access to non-Abelian quaternion charges, the Euler curvature, and the non-Abelian quantum metric associated with all bands. Quantum geometry has been highlighted to play a key role on macroscopic phenomena ranging from superconductivity in flat-bands, to optical responses, transport, metrology, and quantum Hall physics. Therefore, our work unlocks the experimental probing of a wide phenomenology of multi-gap systems, at the confluence of topology, geometry and non-Abelian physics.</description>

      <title>A General Strategy for Realizing Mpemba Effects in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a state farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to it, is a striking phenomenon in both classical and quantum systems. In open quantum systems, however, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) typically occurs only for specifically chosen initial states, which limits its universality. Here we present a general and experimentally feasible strategy to realize both QME and anti-QME. By applying a temporary bond-dissipation quench, we selectively suppresses or enhances slow relaxation modes, thereby reshaping relaxation pathways independently of both the system and the initial state. We demonstrate this mechanism in systems with dephasing and boundary dissipation, and outline feasible cold-atom implementations. Our results establish controllable dissipation as a versatile tool for quantum control, accelerated relaxation, and efficient nonequilibrium protocols.</description>

      <title>Quantum doubles in symmetric blockade structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exactly solvable models of topologically ordered phases with non-abelian anyons typically require complicated many-body interactions which do not naturally appear in nature. This motivates the "inverse problem" of quantum many-body physics: given microscopic systems with experimentally realistic two-body interactions, how to design a Hamiltonian that realizes a desired topological phase? Here we solve this problem on a platform motivated by Rydberg atoms, where elementary two-level systems couple via simple blockade interactions. Within this framework, we construct Hamiltonians that realize topological orders described by non-abelian quantum double models. We analytically prove the existence of topological order in the ground state, and present efficient schemes to prepare these states. We also introduce protocols for the controlled adiabatic braiding of anyonic excitations to probe their non-abelian statistics. Our construction is generic and applies to quantum doubles $\mathcal{D}(G)$ for arbitrary finite groups $G$. We illustrate braiding for the simplest non-abelian quantum double $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$.</description>

      <title>Estimating ground-state properties in quantum simulators with global control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately determining ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems remains one of the major challenges of quantum simulation. In this work, we present a protocol for estimating the ground-state energy using only global time evolution under a target Hamiltonian. This avoids the need for controlled operations that are typically required in conventional quantum phase estimation and extends the algorithm applicability to analog simulators. Our method extracts energy differences from measurements of the Loschmidt echo over an initial ground-state approximation, combines them with direct energy measurements, and solves a set of equations to infer the individual eigenenergies. We benchmark this protocol on free-fermion systems, showing orders-of-magnitude precision gains over direct energy measurements on the initial state, with accuracy improving rapidly with initial-state fidelity and persisting for hundreds of modes. We further demonstrate applicability to the 2D Ising and Fermi-Hubbard models and show that the approach extends naturally to other observables such as order parameters. Finally, we analyze the effect of experimental imperfections and propose error-mitigation strategies. These results establish a practical route to compute physically relevant quantities with high precision using globally controlled quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg-atom quantum simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22461v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field and, in particular, that it changes drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Extended Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <title>A quasi-particle picture for entanglement cones and horizons in analogue cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of cosmological particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics through the lens of entanglement. We use the entanglement contour (EC) to analyse the spatio-temporal structure of particle production, showing that a quasi-particle picture for the EC captures the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifests through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04853v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</description>

      <title>General theory for geometry-dependent non-Hermitian bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two- and higher-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices, systems can exhibit geometry-dependent bands, where the spectrum and eigenstates under open boundary conditions depend on the bulk geometry even in the thermodynamic limit. Although geometry-dependent bands are widely observed, the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon remains unclear. In this work, we address this problem by establishing a higher-dimensional non-Bloch band theory based on the concept of "strip generalized Brillouin zones" (SGBZs), which describe the asymptotic behavior of non-Hermitian bands when a lattice is extended sequentially along its linearly independent axes. Within this framework, we demonstrate that geometry-dependent bands arise from the incompatibility of SGBZs and, for the first time, derive a general criterion for the geometry dependence of non-Hermitian bands: non-zero area of the complex energy spectrum or the imaginary momentum spectrum. Our work opens an avenue for future studies on the interplay between geometric effects and non-Hermitian physics, such as non-Hermitian band topology.</description>

      <title>Universality in Ionic Three-body Systems Near an Ion-atom Feshbach Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate bound and scattering properties of a system of two neutral atoms and an ion near an atom-ion Feshbach resonance. Our results indicate that long-range atom-ion interactions lead to significant deviations from universal behavior derived from contact or van der Waals potentials. We find that ionic systems display an overall suppression of inelastic transitions leading to recombination rates and lifetimes of Efimov state orders of magnitude smaller with respect to those for neutral atoms. We further characterize the dense spectra of triatomic molecular ions with extended lifetimes. Our results provide a deeper insight on the universality and structure of three-body ionic systems and establishing them as a promising platform for exploring novel few- and many-body phenomena with long-range interactions.</description>
