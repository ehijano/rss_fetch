      <title>Isometric embeddings into $C(K)$-spaces doing stable phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a question posed by Freeman, Oikhberg, Pineau and Taylor, we prove that if $K$ is a compact Hausdorff space with $K^{(\alpha)}\neq\varnothing$, where $2&lt;\alpha&lt;\omega$, then $C[1,\omega^\alpha]$ isometrically embeds into $C(K)$ doing stable phase retrieval (SPR). We also show that the latter cannot be extended to the case $\alpha=2$.</description>

      <title>On the existence of large subspaces of $C(K)$ that perform stable phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to address an open problem posed by Freeman-Oikhberg-Pineau-T.~(\textit{Math.~Ann.}~2024) regarding the existence of large subspaces of $C(K)$ that perform stable phase retrieval (SPR). We begin by proving that for both the real and complex fields, the space $C(K)$ admits an infinite-dimensional SPR subspace if and only if the second Cantor-Bendixson derivative $K{''}$ is nonempty. We then show how to construct ``large" SPR subspaces of $C(K)$, where the size of the subspace depends quantitatively on the number of non-trivial Cantor-Bendixson derivatives that the compact Hausdorff space $K$ possesses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(T,{\cal F},\mu)$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure space, $E$ a separable real Banach space and $p\geq 1$. Given a sequence of functions $f, f_1, f_2,...$ from $T\times E$ to ${\bf R}$, under general assumptions, we prove that, for each closed hyperplane $V$ of $L^p(T,E)$, for each $u\in V$, and for each sequence $\{\lambda_n\}$ converging to $\int_Tf(t,u(t))d\mu$, there exists a sequence $\{u_n\}$ in $V$ converging to $u$ and such that $\int_Tf_n(t,u_n(t))d\mu=\lambda_n$ for all $n$ large enough.</description>

      <title>On the stochastic proof of the Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2024, Courtade, Fathi and Mikulincer gave a proof of the symmetrized Talagrand inequality based on stochastic calculus, in the spirit of Borell's proof of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality. The symmetrized Talagrand inequality can be seen as a dual form of the functional Santal\'o inequality. The modest purpose of this note is to give a simplified version of the Courtade, Fathi and Mikulincer argument. Namely we first recall briefly Borell's original argument, and we then explain a simple twist in his proof that allows to recover the functional Santal\'o inequality directly, rather than in its dual form.</description>

      <title>Quasiconformal symbols and projected composition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study projected composition operators K_g with quasiconformal symbols g on weighted Bergman spaces on the open unit disc D. If the symbol were conformal, i.e.a M\"obius transform of D, the corresponding composition operator would be automatically invertible at least in standard weighted spaces. We show that the invertibility remains, if the Beltrami coefficient is small enough, in particular, it satisfies a certain vanishing condition at the boundary of the disc. We also consider the invertibility of K_g for symbols g which are conformal in an annulus { R &lt; |z| &lt; 1 }. The weight classes in our considerations include both standard and exponentially decreasing weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the weakly $\mathcal U(d)$-homogeneous commuting tuple of operators. We provide a sufficient condition under which a weakly $\mathcal U(d)$-homogeneous tuple is similar to a $\mathcal U(d)$-homogeneous tuple. Further, we focus our attention to multishifts and completely characterize weakly $\mathcal U(d)$-homogeneous multishifts. In particular, we show that a multishift is weakly $\mathcal U(d)$-homogeneous if and only if it similar to a $\mathcal U(d)$-homogeneous multishift. The results for multishifts are further refined for the class of spherically balanced multishifts.</description>

      <title>The Cahill-Casazza-Daubechies problem on H\"older stable phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase retrieval using a frame for a finite-dimensional Hilbert space is known to always be Lipschitz stable. However, phase retrieval using a frame or a continuous frame for an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space is always unstable. In order to bridge the gap between the finite and infinite dimensional phenomena, Cahill-Casazza-Daubechies (Trans.Amer.Math.Soc. 2016) gave a construction of a family of nonlinear subsets of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space where phase retrieval could be performed with a H\"older stability estimate. They then posed the question of whether these subsets satisfied Lipschitz stable phase retrieval. We solve this problem both by giving examples which fail Lipschitz stability and by giving examples which satisfy Lipschitz stability.</description>

      <title>On the discrete to continuous condensing aggregation equation: A weak convergence approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the passage of limits from discrete to continuous condensing aggregation equation which comprises of Oort-Hulst-Safronov (OHS) equation together with inverse aggregation process. We establish the relation between discrete and continuous condensing aggregation equations in its most generalized form, where kinetic-kernels with respect to OHS and inverse aggregation equations are not always equal. Convergence criterion is proved under suitable a priori estimates by approximating the continuous equation through a sequence of discrete equations, which subsequently converges towards the solution of the continuous equation by weak compactness principles. Existence of solution to the discrete model and uniform bounds on different order moments over finite time under particular conditions on kinetic-kernels are investigated. We analyze long-time dynamics and blowup of the solution leading to mass-loss or gelation for specific kernels. Three numerical experiments show the accuracy and convergence of approximated solutions to the exact solution of the continuous equation when $\varepsilon$ approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Generalized Interlacing Families: New Error Bounds for CUR Matrix Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of generalized interlacing families of polynomials, which extends the classical interlacing polynomial method to handle polynomials of varying degrees. We establish a fundamental property for these families, proving the existence of a polynomial with a desired degree whose smallest root is greater than or equal to the smallest root of the expected polynomial. Applying this framework to the generalized CUR matrix approximation problem, we derive a theoretical upper bound on the spectral norm of a residual matrix, expressed in terms of the largest root of the expected polynomial. We then explore two important special cases: the classical CUR matrix decompositions and the row subset selection problem. For classical CUR matrix decompositions, we derive an explicit upper bound for the largest root of the expected polynomial. This yields a tighter spectral norm error bound for the residual matrix compared to many existing results. Furthermore, we present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for solving the classical CUR problem under certain matrix conditions. For the row subset selection problem, we establish the first known spectral norm error bound. This paper extends the applicability of interlacing families and deepens the theoretical foundations of CUR matrix decompositions and related approximation problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A characterization of valuations on the space of convex Lipschitz functions whose domain is a polytope in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is obtained. It is shown that every upper semicontinuous, equi-affine and dually epi-translation invariant valuation can be written as a linear combination of a constant term, the volume of the domain, and a functional affine surface area. In addition, dual statements for finite-valued convex functions are established.</description>

      <title>Global Leray-Schauder continuation for Fredholm operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper ascertains the global behavior of the forward and backward branches of solutions provided by the Leray-Schauder continuation theorem for orientable $\mathcal{C}^1$ Fredholm maps, as developed by the authors in [54]. Under properness on bounded sets and a nonzero local index at the given base solution, each branch satisfies the following alternative: either it is unbounded, or it reaches the boundary of the domain, or it accumulates at a different solution on the base parameter level. When the component is bounded and stays in the interior, there is a degree balance on the base slice entailing a vanishing sum of local indices and, in particular, the existence of an even number of non-degenerate contact points. For real-analytic maps we construct locally injective parameterizations that exhibit blow-up, approach to the boundary, or return to the base level. An application to a quasilinear boundary value problem driven by the mean-curvature and Minkowski operators illustrates the global results.</description>

      <title>Learned iterative networks: An operator learning perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learned image reconstruction has become a pillar in computational imaging and inverse problems. Among the most successful approaches are learned iterative networks, which are formulated by unrolling classical iterative optimisation algorithms for solving variational problems. While the underlying algorithm is usually formulated in the functional analytic setting, learned approaches are often viewed as purely discrete. In this chapter we present a unified operator view for learned iterative networks. Specifically, we formulate a learned reconstruction operator, defining how to compute, and separately the learning problem, which defines what to compute. In this setting we present common approaches and show that many approaches are closely related in their core. We review linear as well as nonlinear inverse problems in this framework and present a short numerical study to conclude.</description>

      <title>Elliptic functions, Floquet transform and Bergman spaces on doubly periodic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Bergman spaces A^2(D), their kernels and Toeplitz operators on unbounded, doubly periodic domains D in the complex plane. We establish the mapping properties of the Floquet transform operator defined in A^2(D) and derive a general formula connecting the Bergman kernel and projection of the domain D to a kernel and projection on the bounded periodic cell B. As an application, we prove, for Toeplitz operators T_a with doubly periodic symbols, a spectral band formula, which describes the spectrum and essential spectrum of T_a in terms of the spectra of a family of Toeplitz-type operators on the cell B. Technical challenges arise from the fact that double quasiperiodic boundary conditions have to be taken into account in the definitions of the spaces and operators on the periodic cell B. This requires novel operator theoretic tools, which are based on modifications of certain elliptic functions, e.g. the Weierstrass p-function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the weak disjointness of hypercyclic operators to advance the classifications of hypercyclic operators. We establish an analogue of the Weiss-Akin-Glasner Theorem from topological dynamics within the framework of linear dynamics, which gives a characterization of the weak disjointness of each class of mixing operators with respect to a given Furstenberg family. The key ingredient is the analogues of Weiss-Akin-Glasner Lemma from topological dynamics, which gives a characterization of subsets of non-negative integers which can be realized by the return time sets of mixing operators with respect to a given Furstenberg family. We also provide several examples to distinguish some classes of hypercyclic operators and end with the characterization of the weak disjointness of backward shifts on Fr\'echet sequence spaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a carr\'e du champ operator for Banach-valued random elements, taking values in the projective tensor product, and use it to control the bounded Lipschitz distance between a Malliavin-smooth random element satisfying mild regularity assumptions and a Radon Gaussian taking values in the Skorokhod space equipped with the uniform topology. In the case where the random element is a Banach-valued multiple integral, the carr\'e du champ expression is further bounded by norms of the contracted integral kernel. The main technical tool is an integration by parts formula, which might be of independent interest.
  As a by-product, we recover a bound obtained recently by D\"uker and Zoubouloglou in the Hilbert space setting and complement it by providing contraction bounds.</description>

Abstract: Results on the upper and lower semicontinuity of functionals defined on spaces of convex and more general functions are established. In particular, the following result is obtained. Let $\phi(v; \cdot)$ be the density of the absolutely continuous part of a Radon measure $\Phi(v; \cdot)$ associated to a function $v\colon X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined on the topological measure space $(X,\lambda)$. For concave $\zeta\colon [0, \infty)\rightarrow[0,\infty)$ with $\lim_{t\to 0} \zeta(t)=0$ and $\lim_{t\to\infty}\zeta(t)/t= 0$, it is shown that the functional $v \mapsto \int_{X} \zeta(\phi(v;x))d\lambda(x)$ depends upper semicontinuously on $v$. Examples include functional affine surface areas for convex functions.</description>

Abstract: Answering questions of A. Avil\'es, F. Cabello S\'anchez, J. Castillo, M. Gonz\'alez and Y. Moreno we show that the following statements are independent of the usual axioms ZFC with arbitrarily large continuum: for every (some) $\omega&lt;\kappa&lt;2^\omega$
  (1) any linear bounded operator $T: c_0(\kappa)\rightarrow\ell_\infty/c_0$ extends to any superspace of $c_0(\kappa)$.
  (2) any isomorphism between any two copies of $c_0(\kappa)$ inside $\ell_\infty/c_0$ extends to an automorphism of $\ell_\infty/c_0$.
  This contrasts with Boolean, Banach algebraic or isometric levels, where the objects known as Hausdorff gap and Luzin gap witness the failure in ZFC of the corresponding properties for the corresponding structures already at the first uncountable cardinal $\kappa=\omega_1$. In particular, consistently, any two pairwise disjoint families in $\wp(\mathbb N)/Fin$ of the same cardinality $\omega&lt;\kappa&lt;2^\omega$ can be mapped onto each other by a linear automorphism of $\ell_\infty/c_0$ regardless of their different combinatorial, algebraic or topological positions in $\wp(\mathbb N)/Fin$.
  Our positive consistency results use a restricted version of Martin's axiom for a partial order that adds an infinite block diagonal matrix of an operator on $\ell_\infty$ which induces an operator on $\ell_\infty/c_0$. The construction of its finite blocks relies on a lemma of Bourgain and Tzafriri on finite dimensional Banach spaces.
  Our negative consistency results rely on an analysis of almost disjoint families of $\mathbb N$, the embeddings of $c_0(\kappa)$ into $\ell_\infty/c_0$ they induce and their extensions to $\ell_\infty^c(\kappa)$.</description>

      <title>L- and M-weakly compact multilinear operators and their linear adjoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X_1, \ldots, X_m$ be Banach spaces and let $E_1, \ldots, E_m,F$ be Banach lattices. Our main results read as follows: (i) The linear adjoint $A^*$ of a continuous multilinear operator $A \colon X_1 \times \cdots \times X_m \to F$ is $M$-weakly compact if and only if $A$ is $L$-weakly compact. (ii) The linear adjoint $A^*$ of a multilinear operator of order bounded variation $A \colon E_1 \times \cdots \times E_m \to F$ is $L$-weakly compact if and only if the linearization of $A$ on the positive projective tensor product is $M$-weakly compact. In our way to prove these results, we develop the basic theory of linear adjoints of multilinear operators between Riesz spaces, we prove that multilinear operators of order bounded variation between Banach lattices are continuous, and we explore different notions of multilinear operators of $M$-weakly compact-type.</description>

      <title>A simplified formula for the matched projection of an idempotent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}(H)$ be the set of all adjointable operators on a Hilbert $C^*$-module $H$. For each $T\in\mathcal{L}(H)$, $T^*$ denotes its adjoint operator, and $|T^*|$ is the positive square root of $TT^*$. We establish a simplified formula for the matched projection $m(Q)$ of an idempotent $Q\in\mathcal{L}(H)$ as $$m(Q)=\frac{I+|Q^*|-|I-Q^*|}{2},$$ where $I$ is the identity operator on $H$. This explicit expression allows for the direct derivation of some basic properties of $m(Q)$.</description>

      <title>A connection between Lipschitz and Kazhdan constants for groups of homeomorphisms of the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit an obstruction for groups with Relative Property (T) to act on the real line by bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms. This condition is expressed in terms of the Lipschitz and Kazhdan constants associated to finite generating subsets. As an application, we obtain an explicit lower bound for the Lipschitz constants associated to actions of the semidirect product $\mathbb{F}_2\ltimes\mathbb{Z}^2$. We also obtain an upper bound for the Kazhdan constants of pairs of orderable groups, depending only on the cardinal of the generating subset.</description>

      <title>Schauder Bases for $C[0, 1]$ Using ReLU, Softplus and Two Sigmoidal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct four Schauder bases for the space $C[0,1]$, one using ReLU functions, another using Softplus functions, and two more using sigmoidal versions of the ReLU and Softplus functions. This establishes the existence of a basis using these functions for the first time, and improves on the universal approximation property associated with them. We also show an $O(\frac{1}{n})$ approximation bound based on our ReLU basis, and a negative result on constructing multivariate functions using finite combinations of ReLU functions.</description>
