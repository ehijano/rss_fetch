      <title>Direct transfer to $^{46,48}$K as a survey of the $\pi(s_{1/2})$$-\nu(sdpf)$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collapse of the canonical $N=28$ magic number in nuclei with $Z&lt;20$ has drawn significant interest as it relates to the emergence of an island of inversion centered on $^{42}$Si and $^{44}$S. In particular, interactions between the $\pi s_{1/2}$ orbital -- empty in $^{42}$Si and full in $^{44}$S -- and the neutron orbitals just above and below the $N=28$ gap are expected to be critical in this region, but remain relatively unexplored. In this paper, we expand upon the results of our previous study of the direct transfer reaction $^{47}$K(d,p$\gamma$)$^{48}$K [C.\,J.~Paxman \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 162504 (2025)] with the results of the complementary $^{47}$K(d,t$\gamma$)$^{46}$K reaction. Through this study, we present a comprehensive scan of the interaction between the critical $\pi s_{1/2}$ orbital and a broad range of neutron orbitals spanning nearly two full shells. We identify several discrepancies between the experimental results and state-of-the-art shell model calculations, which suggest a deficiency of the shell model to fully capture the complex proton configuration mixing in this region, highlighting a significant challenge for single-particle descriptions of the island of inversion.</description>

      <title>Determination of $^{170,172}$Yb($\alpha,n$)$^{173,175}$Hf reaction cross sections in a stacked-target experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ytterbium isotopic chain offers multiple stable isotopes on which cross sections can be measured and insights into the evolution of the $\alpha$ optical-model potential with the neutron-to-proton ratio can be gained. It also includes the $p$ nucleus $^{168}$Yb, the abundance of which is significantly impacted by the $^{164,166}$Yb($\alpha,\gamma$) reactions. In order to study the $^{170,172}$Yb($\alpha,n$)$^{173,175}$Hf reaction cross sections and compare them with $^{168}$Yb($\alpha,n$)$^{171}$Hf cross sections, that have already been measured, the activation method was used. During irradiation the targets were arranged in stacks of four to reduce the required irradiation time. The average interaction energy inside each ytterbium layer was determined via Geant4 simulations. A manganese layer was used to verify the simulations by comparing the measured $^{55}$Mn($\alpha,(2)n$)$^{57,58}$Co reaction cross sections to previous results. For irradiation the 10 MV FN tandem accelerator located at the University of Cologne was used and the activation measurement was performed utilizing the Cologne Clover Counting setup. For the $^{170}$Yb($\alpha,n$) reaction seven cross sections at center-of-mass energies between 12.7 and 16.5 MeV were measured. For the $^{172}$Yb($\alpha,n$) reaction six cross sections for center-of-mass energies of 13.1 to 16.5 MeV could be determined with an additional upper limit at E$_{c.m.}$ = 12.3 MeV. Comparisons to theoretical models show that state-of-the-art $\alpha$-optical model potentials are able to reproduce the measured cross sections very well. The ratios of ($\alpha, n$) reaction cross sections in the ytterbium isotopic chain can be accurately reproduced as well.</description>

      <title>CR-39 track detector signatures of slow neutron like signals in Heavy-water electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report reproducible track-detector signals consistent with slow neutron capture events, recorded in D$_2$O electrolysis involving D-Pd deposited on Pt cathode. Sensitivity to slow neutrons was achieved using boron-coated CR-39 (BCR) detectors, which register charged particle tracks arising from the $^{10}$B$(n,\alpha)^{7}$Li reaction. These detectors were positioned adjacent to identically prepared uncoated CR-39 control detectors (CCR), which are effectively insensitive to slow neutrons and serve to quantify background contributions from charged particles and fast neutrons under the present experimental conditions. A reproducible differential detector signature (BCR $&gt;$ CCR) would thus indicative of slow neutron fluences. Across multiple independent D$_2$O electrolysis experiments in $0.25~\mathrm{T}$ field, the BCR exhibited significantly excess track signals relative to CCRs. Under these conditions, the observed differential response corresponds to an inferred detector-equivalent slow neutron flux of approximately $(6.7 \pm 0.2)~\mathrm{cm^{-2},s^{-1}}$. Removal of the magnetic field resulted in a reduction of the differential signal by a factor of $\sim6$, indicating a strong empirical dependence on the applied field. In contrast, H$_2$O electrolysis performed under otherwise identical conditions produced no measurable differential detector response, establishing the necessity of deuterated electrochemical conditions for the observed effect. The results are reported strictly as detector signatures consistent with slow neutron capture and do not assert any theoretical explanation. Instead, this work establishes a control verified and detector validated experimental protocol for detecting low flux slow neutrons, and provides empirical constraints relevant to slow neutron studies in experiments involving metal-deuteride systems.</description>

      <title>Constellation: The Autonomous Control and Data Acquisition System for Dynamic Experimental Setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operation of instruments and detectors in laboratory or beamline environments presents a complex challenge, requiring stable operation of multiple concurrent devices, often controlled by separate hardware and software solutions. These environments frequently undergo modifications, such as the inclusion of different auxiliary devices depending on the experiment or facility, adding further complexity. The successful management of such dynamic configurations demands a flexible and robust system capable of controlling data acquisition, monitoring experimental setups, enabling seamless reconfiguration, and integrating new devices with limited effort.
  This paper presents Constellation, a flexible and network-distributed control and data acquisition software framework tailored to laboratory and beamline environments, that addresses the limitations of existing solutions. The framework is designed with a focus on extensibility, providing a streamlined interface for instrument integration. It supports efficient system setup via network discovery mechanisms, promotes stability through autonomous operational features, and provides comprehensive documentation and supporting tools for operators and application developers such as controllers and logging interfaces.
  At the core of the architectural design is the autonomy of the individual components, called satellites, which can make independent decisions about their operation and communicate these decisions to other components. This paper introduces the design principles and framework architecture of Constellation, presents the available graphical user interfaces, shares insights from initial successful deployments, and provides an outlook on future developments and applications.</description>

      <title>Entanglement study in the island of inversion region using \textit{ab initio} approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement provides a unique perspective for probing nuclear structure. In this work, we employ quantum entanglement measures, including proton-neutron entanglement entropy, mutual information, and quantum relative entropy, to investigate the evolution of entanglement patterns as we approach neutron-rich nuclei. The study is carried out in the vicinity of the $N=20$ island of inversion region consisting of even-$A$ Ne, Mg, and Si isotopes, and also for isotones corresponding to $N=20$. The state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} valence space in-medium similarity renormalization group method has been used for this purpose. We have highlighted the role of proton-neutron entanglement entropy in the formation of the island of inversion region. While mutual information provides insight into the strong correlations between proton-proton and neutron-neutron single-particle orbitals. The correlations are weak between proton and neutron for ground states, but become comparable to like-particle correlations for excited states. The quantum relative entropy is also studied between $0^+$ and $2^+$ states of the Ne, Mg, and Si isotopes, as well as $N=20$ isotones, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence and Jensen-Shannon divergence. We have performed these calculations using partitions based on proton-neutron, single-particle states, and Slater determinants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AMBER (NA66) is a fixed-target facility at the M2 beam line of CERN SPS, which performs worldwide unique research on the internal structure and the excitation spectrum of hadrons. The approved first phase of the experiment focuses on three main physics topics: (i) the measurement of the production cross section of antiprotons in $p-\text{He}$ and $p-p/d$ collisions over a wide energy range; (ii) the precise measurement of the electric form factor of protons at small momentum transfers using a high-energy muon beam; (iii) the determination of pion and kaon quark PDFs through Drell-Yan and charmonium production measurements with negative and positive meson beams. Phase-2 will focus on measurements with an intense kaon beam. The high-energy muon, pion and kaon beams required for these measurements are only available at CERN.</description>

      <title>Performance evaluation of Luxium Solutions BCF-XL wavelength-shifting fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of single-clad wavelength-shifting fibers newly developed by Luxium Solutions, BCF-92XL, BCF-9929AXL, and BCF-9995XL and compare them with the multi-clad Kuraray Y-11 fiber. The BCF-XL fibers exhibit faster decay times (92XL: $2.10\pm0.01$ ns, 9929AXL: $2.10\pm0.02$ ns, 9995XL: $2.41\pm0.03$ ns) than Y-11 ($7.44\pm0.06$ ns). The attenuation lengths are comparable to that of Y-11 within the measurement range up to 3.2 m. When coupled to an EJ-204 plastic scintillator, the BCF-XL fibers achieve superior time resolution while maintaining light yields comparable to those expected for a single-clad Y-11 fiber.</description>

      <title>Probing the microscopic origin of prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ production through event-shape engineering in proton-proton collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy-flavour hadrons are produced in the early stages of ultra-relativistic collisions at the LHC via hard partonic interactions and experience the whole system evolution. The study of prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ mesons provides an independent avenue to test the theories of quantum chromodynamics and to investigate beauty hadron production. Moreover, the production of both prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ is influenced by microscopic processes such as multi-partonic interactions (MPI) and hadronisation through fragmentation. In this study, an attempt is made to understand the production of prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ mesons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV using the PYTHIA8 event generator, which offers a qualitative description of charm production. The role of the transverse momentum transfer in the hardest partonic scattering ($\hat{p}_{\rm T}$), MPI, and color reconnection is systematically explored. In addition, the charged particle production in different topological regions with respect to the leading $D^{0}$ meson is studied to assess the influence of the $D^{0}$ meson on the event topology and to examine the selection biases arising from the use of charged particle multiplicity as an event classifier.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nuclear Reaction Rates on Calcium Production in Population III Stars: A Global Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of calcium production to nuclear reaction rates of a 40 solar-mass Population III star using 1D multi-zone stellar models. A comprehensive nuclear reaction network was constructed, and all $(p,\gamma)$ and $(p,\alpha)$ reaction rates were individually varied by a factor of 10 up and down, identifying 13 preliminary key reactions for calcium production. To propagate the reaction rate uncertainties on calcium production, two sets of Monte Carlo simulations were performed for these key reactions: one adopting STARLIB reaction rates and the other incorporating updated rates from recent experimental data and evaluations. Our results show that Monte Carlo simulations using the updated rates show good agreement with the observed calcium abundance of the extremely iron-poor star SMSS J031300.36-670839.3 within the 68% confidence interval predicted by the models. In contrast, the observed calcium abundance lies marginally outside the 68% C.I. when using the STARLIB rates. Spearman rank-order correlation analysis and SHAP values show that the $(p,\gamma)$ and $(p,\alpha)$ reactions of F18 and F19 exhibit strong coupled effects on calcium production. These reaction-rate uncertainties need to be reduced to constrain the stellar model predictions. Our study provides insights for future nuclear physics experiments aimed at reducing reaction rate uncertainties in the nucleosynthesis of Population III Stars.
  Additionally, comparisons between 20 solar-mass and 40 solar-mass Population III stellar models confirm that the latter, with updated reaction rates, is more capable of reproducing the observed Ca abundance and [Ca/Mg] ratio.</description>

      <title>Performance Benchmarks for 2-View and 3-View Fiber-Projection Fine-Grained Particle Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained scintillator detectors are critical for precision measurements in nuclear and particle physics, where accurate reconstruction of interaction vertices and secondary particle directions enables separation of signal from background events. A well-known design choice is the fiber readout geometry: traditional 2-View systems use orthogonal X and Y fibers, while next-generation 3-View designs add a third Z-fiber layer that provides unambiguous 3D voxel identification. The 2-View approach suffers from combinatorial ghost hits, that the false 3D candidates arising from fiber projection ambiguities, degrading reconstruction performance in high-multiplicity events. This paper presents comprehensive simulation benchmarks quantifying the performance difference between 2-View and 3-View geometries across key metrics. We find that the 3-View geometry reduces ghost hits by 30--90\% depending on event topology, provides robust vertex resolution across complex topologies, and maintains superior angular resolution for shower direction reconstruction. These benchmarks inform the design optimization of future detectors and provide quantitative guidance for reconstruction algorithm development across a broad range of experiments including neutrino physics, rare kaon/pion decays, and collider calorimetry.</description>

      <title>Learning the relations between neutron star and nuclear matter properties with symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in neutron stars (NSs) remains uncertain, particularly at supra-nuclear densities where complex nuclear interactions and the potential presence of exotic matter, like hyperons, come into play. The complex relationships existing between nuclear matter and neutron star properties are investigated. The focus is on their nonlinearities and interdependencies. In our analysis, we apply a machine learning algorithm known as symbolic regression, paired with principal component analysis, to datasets generated from Bayesian inference over relativistic mean-field models. A systematic Principal Component Analysis has allowed to break down the percentage contribution of each element or feature in the relationships obtained. This study examines two main models (datasets): the NL model, which includes nucleonic degrees of freedom; and the NL-hyp model, which includes hyperons in addition to nucleons. Our analysis confirms a robust correlation between the tidal deformability of a 1.4 \(M_\odot\) neutron star and $\beta$-equilibrium pressure at twice the nuclear saturation density. This correlation remains once hyperons are included. The contribution of the different nuclear matter properties at saturation to the radius and tidal deformability was calculated. It was shown that the isovector properties have the largest impact, with a contribution of about 90\%. We also studied the relationship between the proton fraction at different densities and various symmetry energy parameters defined at saturation density. For the hyperon data set, we took into account the effects of the negatively charged hyperon $\Xi$ in order to recover the relationships. Our study reveals the individual impact of various symmetry energy parameters on proton fractions at different densities.</description>

      <title>$t$+$t$ cluster states in $^{6}$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of $t$+$t$ cluster states in $^{6}$He provides valuable insights into exotic nuclear structures and the behavior of fermionic cluster systems. This study shows rich cluster resonant state structures above the threshold, identified by experimental reconstruction and theoretical calculations. The excitation energy spectrum above the $t$+$t$ threshold in $^{6}$He is measured via the fragmentation excitation process during the breakup reaction of $^{9}$Li on a $^{208}$Pb target at an incident energy of 32.7 MeV/nucleon. The resonant states are reconstructed from the final state coincident particles $t$+$t$ using the invariant mass method, while the non-resonant background is estimated using the event mixing method. Two states of energy level peaks at $13.9\pm0.3$ and $15.0\pm0.3$ MeV are observed. Microscopic cluster model calculations exploring the $t+t$ resonant states in $^6\mathrm{He}$ yield theoretical energy spectra which are then compared with the current experimental results. The calculated reduced width amplitudes (RWA) of the $t+t$ channels further confirm the clustering structure of the identified $t+t$ resonant states.</description>

      <title>Measurement of medium-induced acoplanarity in central Au-Au and pp collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV using direct-photon+jet and $\pi^{0}$+jet correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The STAR Collaboration reports measurements of acoplanarity using semi--inclusive distributions of charged--particle jets recoiling from direct photon and $\pi^{0}$ triggers, in central Au+Au and $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV. Significant medium--induced acoplanarity broadening is observed for large but not small recoil jet resolution parameter, corresponding to recoil jet yield enhancement up to a factor of $\approx20$ for trigger--recoil azimuthal separation far from $\pi$. This phenomenology is indicative of the response of the Quark--Gluon Plasma to excitation, but not the scattering of jets off of its quasiparticles. The measurements are not well--described by current theoretical models which incorporate jet quenching.</description>

      <title>KATRIN experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the discovery of neutrino oscillations, it is known that neutrinos have small but non-zero masses. The neutrino mass scale, which is of fundamental importance for cosmology, astrophysics and particle physics, can be measured directly from the kinematics of weak decays. The Karlsruhe tritium neutrino experiment KATRIN measures the end point region of the tritium \b{eta}-spectrum with unrivalled t statistics and an unprecedented precision. This world-leading direct neutrino mass search experiment is characterised by a windowless, gaseous molecular tritium source and a giant MAC- E filter-type spectrometer. The precision measurement of the tritium \b{eta}-spectrum also allows the search for many other phenomena beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The KATRIN experiment is about to reach its target sensitivity of the neutrino mass of less than 300 meV and will then turn its attention to the search for sterile keV neutrinos before the neutrino mass sensitivity is to be significantly increased once again by applying quantum read-out technology combined with an atomic tritium source with KATRIN++.</description>

      <title>Community input to the European Strategy on particle physics: Searches for Permanent Electric Dipole Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searches for electric dipole moments (EDMs) in fundamental particles and quantum systems with spin are pivotal experiments at the intersection of low-energy and high-precision particle physics. These investigations offer a complementary pathway to uncovering new physics beyond the Standard Model, parallel to high-energy collider searches. EDM experiments are among the most sensitive probes for detecting non-standard time-reversal (T) symmetry violations and, via the CPT theorem, CP-violation (CPV). Current EDM measurements test new physics at mass scales in or above the 10TeV to 100TeV range. This community input to the European Particle Physics Strategy Update highlights the status of the field, and describes challenges and opportunities in Europe.</description>

      <title>Reducing Hadronic Uncertainty in Low-Energy Neutral-Current Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the hadronic uncertainty from light-quark loops coupled to (anti)neutrino in low-energy neutral-current (anti)neutrino scattering, estimated at the $3$-$4$ permille level. This uncertainty arises from limited knowledge of the charge-isospin correlation function of quark currents. We study the charge-charge and charge-isospin correlators within $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). In $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ ChPT, the two correlators are identical to all orders in the chiral and electromagnetic expansions. We further perform a leading-order $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ ChPT calculation and discuss the relevant counterterms. Our findings reduce the hadronic uncertainty in neutral-current processes such as (anti)neutrino-electron and coherent elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleus scattering by a factor $\sim 35$.</description>

      <title>Online Electron Reconstruction at CLAS12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online reconstruction is key for monitoring purposes and real time analysis in High Energy and Nuclear Physics experiments. A necessary component of reconstruction algorithms is particle identification that combines information left by a particle passing through several detector components to identify the particle's type. Of particular interest to electroproduction Nuclear Physics experiments such as CLAS12 is electron identification which is used to trigger data recording. A machine learning approach was developed for CLAS12 to reconstruct and identify electrons by combining raw signals at the data acquisition level from several detector components. This approach achieves an electron identification purity above 75% whilst retaining an efficiency close to 100%. The machine learning tools are capable of running at high rates exceeding the data acquisition rates and will allow electron reconstruction in real time. This work enhances online analyses and monitoring and can contribute to improved triggering at CLAS12. This machine learning driven approach will also be crucial for experiments aiming to transition to streaming readout operations where online reconstruction will be a key component of the data taking paradigm.</description>

      <title>Resonance Contributions to Radiative Corrections in Charged-Current (Anti)Neutrino-Nucleon Elastic Scattering at GeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first evaluation of virtual resonance contributions to the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies, focusing on the dominant $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. We approximate the vector part of the $N \to \Delta$ transition by the leading magnetic dipole term. Our results for the cross-section corrections at fixed neutrino energy indicate the permille-level contribution of resonance intermediate states to the elastic and radiative scattering cross sections. This calculation exhibits the expected infrared behavior of the invariant amplitudes and unpolarized cross sections. Our findings provide important insights into inelastic excitations in the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies.</description>

      <title>Weak Charge Form Factor Determination at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the weak charge form factor, $F_W(Q^2)$, of nuclei over a continuous range of momentum transfers, $0\lesssim Q^2 \lesssim 0.1$ GeV$^2$, is essential for mapping out the distribution of neutrons in nuclei. The neutron density distribution has significant implications for a broad range of areas, including studies of nuclear structure, neutron stars, and physics beyond the Standard Model. Currently, our knowledge of $F_W(Q^2)$ comes primarily from fixed target experiments that measure the parity-violating longitudinal electron spin asymmetry in coherent elastic electron-ion scattering. Fixed target experiments, such as CREX and PREX-1,2, have provided high-precision weak charge form factor extractions for the $^{48}{\rm Ca}$ and $^{208}{\rm Pb}$ nuclei, respectively. However, a major limitation of fixed target experiments is that they each provide data only at a single value of $Q^2$. With the proposed Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) on the horizon, we explore its potential to impact the determination of the weak charge form factor. While it cannot compete with the precision of fixed target experiments, it can provide data over a wide and continuous range of $Q^2$ values, and for a wide variety of nuclei. We show that for integrated luminosities of $\mathcal{L} &gt; $ 200/$A$ fb$^{-1}$, where $A$ denotes the nucleus atomic weight, the EIC can be complementary to fixed target experiments, and can significantly impact constraints from CREX and PREX-1,2 by lifting degeneracies in theoretical models of the neutron density distribution.</description>
