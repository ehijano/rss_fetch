      <title>CNN+FoF: application of deep learning to the identification of dark matter haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep-learning-based approach for identifying dark matter haloes in cosmological N-body simulations. Our framework consists of a volumetric Convolutional Neural Network to classify individual simulation particles as either halo or non-halo members, followed by a highly optimised and parallelised Friends-of-Friends clustering algorithm that groups the classified halo members into distinct haloes. The training data comprise simulations generated using GADGET-4, with labels obtained with the ROCKSTAR halo finder. Our models incorporate two main halo mass definitions, $M_{200\mathrm{b}}$ and $M_{\text{vir}}$, with similar performance. For haloes defined by the ROCKSTAR $M_{200\mathrm{b}}$ criterion, the classification network demonstrated stable performance across multiple simulation resolutions. For the highest resolution, it achieved over $98\%$ across all primary performance metrics when identifying halo particles. Furthermore, the FoF algorithm yielded halo catalogues with a purity generally exceeding $95\%$ and a stable completeness of $93\%$ for masses above $5\times10^{11} \, M_\odot$. Our pipeline recovered the centre-of-mass positions, velocities and halo masses with high fidelity, yielding a halo mass function consistent to within $5\%$ of the reference while faithfully reconstructing the internal density profiles. The primary objective of this study is to offer a faster and scalable alternative to conventional halo finders, achieving a speed-up of approximately one order of magnitude relative to ROCKSTAR, offering a promising pathway for modern simulation-based inference methods that rely on rapid and accurate structure identification.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Cosmic Voids: Structure, Galaxies, and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural, photometric, and dynamical evolution of cosmic voids and their galaxy populations from $z=2.09$ to the present, focusing on void size as a key evolutionary parameter. Using void catalogs from four Millennium Simulation snapshots and SDSS data at $z&lt;0.04$, we perform a unified analysis of void demographics, galaxy properties, and internal kinematics. Our analysis reveals clear evidence that cosmic voids exhibit a significant evolutionary trend of becoming progressively emptier toward low redshift, accompanied by a marked decline in the brightness and clustering of their galaxy populations. The void galaxy luminosity function evolves significantly: $M^{*}$ fades and $\alpha$ flattens with time, with large voids hosting brighter, more rapidly evolving galaxies than small voids. Stacked density profiles exhibit a universal shape when scaled by void radius, deepening and building more pronounced walls toward $z=0$. Galaxy spatial distributions reveal persistent size-dependent segregation, with galaxies in large voids lying farther from the center and more strongly clustered. Dynamical analysis of simulations shows coherent outward flows in all voids, with amplitudes decreasing toward $z=0$, providing a physical basis for observed redshift-space distortions. Comparison with SDSS broadly confirms these evolutionary trends but uncovers a non-zero central galaxy population in observed voids -- absent in $\Lambda$CDM predictions -- that may challenge current galaxy formation models in extreme underdensities. Future comparisons with additional simulations and deeper high-redshift surveys will provide stronger tests of $\Lambda$CDM in the most underdense regions.</description>

      <title>Implications for PBH Dark Matter from a single Sub-Solar$\unicode{x2013}$GW Detection in LVK O1$\unicode{x2013}$O4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of sub-solar mass black holes is a milestone of modern astrophysics as it would open a window either onto new stellar physics or could potentially unveil the nature of Dark Matter as Primordial Black Holes. On November 12, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration reported the compact binary merger candidate S251112cm, a system with no obvious EM counterpart, consistent with binary black hole merger with a chirp mass in the range $0.1-0.87 \, M_\odot$. The probability that at least one component has mass $&lt;$1 $M_{\odot}$ is $&gt;99\%$. Inspired by this trigger, we tested if a population of PBHs formed at Quantum Chromodynamics epoch with a broad mass function could account for a signal of this type. Our results, corresponding to a predicted event rate of $0.8 \,\text{yr}^{-1}$ as seen by LVK O3b, suggest that the observed merger rate of $0.23^{+0.86}_{-0.218}\,\text{yr}^{-1}\;(95\%\;\text{C.L.})$ if the trigger is confirmed as an astrophysical event would be compatible with such a model. Our predicted detection rate is also in agreement with current LVK expectations for stellar-mass binaries, remaining consistent with a scenario in which a non-negligible fraction of the $3-200 \;M_\odot$ mergers observed by LVK originate from Primordial Black Holes. If confirmed, this detection would place a lower limit to the PBH abundance $f_{PBH}&gt;0.04$ for our adopted model.</description>

      <title>Intracluster Medium Fluctuations on Scales up to 1 Mpc: A Combined eROSITA and SPT/Planck Analysis of Abell 3266</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters form through hierarchical assembly, where smaller substructures merge to build the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe. These mergers, combined with feedback from AGN, filamentary accretion, and other energy injection processes, generate turbulence and perturbations within the intra-cluster medium (ICM). X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations can be utilized to measure these ICM density and pressure inhomogeneities, in turn providing constraints on the effective Equation of State (EOS) of the perturbations and ICM velocities. In this work, we analyze deep SRG-eROSITA and Planck/SPT observations of Abell 3266 (A3266), a dynamically complex merging cluster with elongated morphology and significant substructure. We measure pressure and density fluctuations, and compute the power spectra and deprojected 3D amplitudes of these perturbations. We estimate the ratio of pressure-to-density fluctuation amplitudes as $1.00 \pm 0.55$ and non-thermal pressure support $0.068 \pm 0.050$. Density fluctuations are found to be stronger in the northern sector of the cluster compared to the south, consistent with ongoing accretion along a filamentary structure revealed by eROSITA. Further, we find the amplitude of density fluctuations increases with radius, qualitatively consistent with the trend found in cosmological simulations. Uncertainties in our results are dominated by the relatively low sensitivity of current Planck/SPT data, suggesting that improvements in SZ data quality could substantially improve our understanding of ICM energy injection, transport, and dissipation from this technique.</description>

      <title>Resurgence and Hyperasymptotics in Wave Optics Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the discovery of gravitational waves and fast radio bursts, wave optics has become increasingly relevant in astrophysics. This paper studies the behaviour of random gravitational and plasma lenses, presenting the refractive and diffractive expansions, with higher-order terms that allow error estimates and embody the counterintuitive resurgence phenomenon.
  Specifically, we show that the diffractive expansion converges for a broad class of bounded lens models and provides an efficient description of interference patterns across frequency regimes. Next, building on Picard-Lefschetz techniques, we derive the full refractive expansion to arbitrary order, organising it into a transseries. Near caustics, the standard transseries is supplemented with uniform asymptotics. We study this transseries, with both Borel and hyperasymptotic resummation yielding systematic approximations to lensing integrals at all frequencies. Our results give a framework for modelling wave optics lensing near caustics and beyond the geometric optics approximation and thereby illustrate how tools from resurgence and asymptotic analysis can be applied to practical problems in astrophysics.
  Near caustic singularities, the post-refractive corrections diverge, while the uniform asymptotic expansion becomes accurate. We use the leading uniform approximation to derive the strong wave optics suppression of off-axis caustics, which clarifies their subdominant role.</description>

      <title>Bulk and turbulent gas motions in the interacting galaxy cluster Abell 3395 South observed with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gas motions in the core region of the Abell~3395 South subcluster (A3395S) using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM/Resolve. By analyzing the Fe~XXV He$\alpha$ emission line, we directly measure the line-of-sight bulk and turbulent velocities of the intracluster medium. We find that the one-dimensional turbulent velocity is low, at the level of $124\pm21~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, while a significant line-of-sight bulk velocity of $263\pm23~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ is detected. The coexistence of low turbulence and finite bulk motion suggests that A3395S has not yet reached a dynamically relaxed state. These results are consistent with the non-detection of a radio halo in A3395S, implying that turbulent particle reacceleration is currently inefficient in the cluster core. This study demonstrates that high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM provides a powerful means to directly constrain intracluster medium dynamics in merging galaxy clusters, and it provides a reference for future comparative studies of A3395N and A3391 within the same large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>A sound horizon independent measurement of $H_0$ from BOSS, DESI and DES Y3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sound horizon independent measurement of the Hubble parameter using a multiprobe large-scale structure analysis. Removing the dependency on the sound horizon with a rescaling procedure at the matter power spectrum level, we analyse the BOSS full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum (for the first time) using the effective field theory of large-scale structure up to one loop. We combine this analysis with the auto- and cross-angular power spectra from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey DR9, the $3 \times 2$pt analysis from DES Y3, and the CMB gravitational lensing power spectrum from Planck PR3. Our baseline analysis, that does not rely on supernovae data, yields $h = 0.702^{+0.022}_{-0.024}$, $\Omega_m = 0.310 \pm 0.013$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.799 \pm 0.020$, corresponding to $3-4 \%$ precision measurements. When adding supernovae data from Pantheon+, we obtain a $2.6 \%$ measurement of $h$, with $h = 0.686 \pm 0.018$. We further note that our EFTBOSS analysis indicates a slight deviation of the BAO scale parameter (at $1.8 \sigma$) from its $\Lambda$CDM value, caused by the small scales of the bispectrum. We finally use the sound horizon-free EFTBOSS analysis as a diagnosis for the presence of new physics, finding that our results are consistent with the recent hints of evolving dark energy.</description>

      <title>Linear Perturbations and Multi-Probe Diagnostics in Dark-Sector Selective $f(R,T_{\chi})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a dark-sector selective trace-coupled extension of gravity in which the matter--curvature coupling depends exclusively on the trace of the dark-matter energy--momentum tensor, $T_{\chi}$, defined from a canonical dark-matter field $\chi$. This construction provides a microphysically specified trace sector, removes the usual matter-Lagrangian ambiguity of $f(R,T)$-type models, and preserves minimal coupling of visible matter by design. We derive the full field equations, the exact dark-sector exchange structure, and the linear scalar-perturbation system in gauge-ready form. In the sub-horizon regime, we derive effective modified-gravity functions governing structure growth and light deflection, and show that the model generically produces correlated, scale- and time-dependent departures from General Relativity in growth and lensing observables. Building on this structure, we formulate a perturbation-focused multi-probe framework based on redshift-space distortions, weak lensing, and CMB lensing, explicitly targeting degeneracy breaking beyond background-expansion tests. The analysis establishes the action-level and perturbation-level foundations of the model and provides a conservative, reproducible framework for translated linear-regime constraints within a dark-sector selective modified-gravity setting.</description>

      <title>Impact and interplay of $\Lambda$CDM analysis choices for LSST cosmic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We forecast cosmological parameter constraints for a cosmic shear analysis of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), defining an analysis framework that can accurately recover the $\Lambda$CDM model in the presence of astrophysical and data-related systematics. When accounting for our present uncertainty on the suppression of the non-linear matter power spectrum through baryon feedback, we find that the error on the composite parameter $S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ almost doubles compared to an LSST analysis which neglects this astrophysical phenomenon. After the first year of observations, LSST will extend beyond the magnitude limit of existing representative spectroscopic calibration samples, requiring photometric redshifts to be calibrated using an alternative strategy. Adopting literature measurements of the reduced redshift calibration precision found from galaxy cross-correlation techniques, combined with current levels of baryon feedback uncertainty, we forecast final year LSST cosmic shear constraints that barely improve upon the first year analysis. This forecast therefore serves as encouragement to the community to develop methodology and observations to constrain models of baryon feedback and enhance photometric redshift calibration at depths where spectroscopy is unrepresentative. With tight priors on both these systematic terms, we forecast that LSST cosmic shear can deliver constraints on $S_8$ that are more than five times as constraining as existing cosmic shear surveys.</description>

      <title>The impact of cosmic filaments on starburst galaxies across cosmic times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations suggest that various galaxy properties depend on their location within the cosmic web. Yet direct observational evidence of the dependence of star formation activity on distance to filaments remains scarce and is missing at z&gt;1. We investigate how starburst, main-sequence (MS), and quenched galaxies are distributed with respect to cosmic web filaments, and how this distribution evolves with redshift. We first use the SIMBA cosmological simulation to predict the redshift evolution of the mean distance to the closest filament from z=3 to z=0 for different galaxy populations after removing stellar-mass dependencies. We then measure the corresponding signal in the COSMOS field, using COSMOS2020 and COSMOS-Web data, where accurate photometric redshifts enable reconstruction of the projected cosmic web from z=2 to z=0.5, and starbursts are identified through far-infrared spectral energy distribution fitting. In agreement with the results from SIMBA, starburst galaxies are found closer to filaments at z&gt;1 and at larger distances at z&lt;1, MS galaxies occupy intermediate environments with little evolution, and quenched galaxies show progressively shorter distances to filaments toward low redshift, with a crossing between starburst and MS populations around z~1. In COSMOS-Web, the relative evolution in the average distance to filaments between starburst and MS galaxies is detected at a significance level of at least 5{\sigma}. We show that a minimal toy model in which the only environmental ingredient is the sSFR-filament distance modulation measured in simulations is sufficient to reproduce the observed differential evolution of the average filament distance between starburst and MS galaxies. These results show that the imprint of large-scale environmental effects on the star formation activity of galaxies, predicted by simulations, is detectable from z=2 down to z=0.5.</description>

      <title>How does a MOND cosmology fare on Gpc scales? - Collisionless $N$-body simulations of $\nu$HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest collisionless $N$-body cosmological simulations in a MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) cosmology to date. Our 4 simulations cover $\Lambda$CDM as a baseline, a MOND with hot dark matter model known as $\nu$HDM, and 2 unphysical models we call $\Lambda$HDM and $\nu$CDM to test the individual contributions of hot dark matter and MOND gravity, respectively. $\nu$HDM reproduces the CMB power spectrum whilst also theoretically matching cluster dynamics and preserving MOND predictions for galactic rotation curves. We test its viability on cosmological scales using simulations with $256^{3}$ particles in a box of size $800/h$ comoving Mpc. We find generically that the MOND models massively overproduce large-scale structures by $z=0$, with a most massive cluster in $\nu$HDM of $\approx 5 \times 10^{17} M_{\odot}/h$ and typical peculiar velocities of several thousand km/s. We also explore a local void solution to the Hubble tension in these models. Analogues to the observed "Local Hole'' do form in the MOND models, but values for the deceleration parameter $&lt;-1.5$ in these regions prevent a satisfactory resolution to the Hubble tension. Whilst $\Lambda$CDM significantly underpredicts the observed bulk flow in Cosmicflows-4, the high peculiar velocities that arise in the MOND models create the opposite problem, ruling out $\nu$HDM at $&gt;5\sigma$ confidence. Observations clearly require a much milder enhancement to the rate of structure growth in $\Lambda$CDM than is provided by the $\nu$HDM paradigm. Our results also suggest that replacing cold dark matter with hot dark matter is unlikely to provide a viable cosmological model, regardless of the gravity law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unify one of the most widely studied frameworks to explain the hierarchical structure of the flavor sector in the Standard Model, the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, with cosmic inflation. We propose that the complex scalar field, the so-called flavon, which breaks the Froggatt-Nielsen $U(1)$ symmetry and generates the Yukawa couplings of the Standard Model, to also drive inflation, which we dub as Inflavon. After inflation ends, the decay of the inflavon reheats the Universe, establishing a novel link between early Universe cosmology and flavor physics. As concrete examples, we present realizations where the inflavon potential is described by an $\alpha$-attractor potential. We then compute the resulting CMB observables, specifically the spectral index ($n_s$), the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$), and the amplitude of scalar perturbations ($A_s$) as functions of the underlying Froggatt-Nielsen model parameters. We identify the parameter space in Froggatt-Nielsen models involving the scale of Flavor symmetry breaking $\Lambda_{\rm FN}$ and FN charges which is ruled out by Planck and ACT data, as well as the region that could be probed by next-generation CMB experiments like CMB-S4, SO and LiteBIRD. We also discuss inflavon as dark matter and its isocurvature constraints.</description>

      <title>A Path to an All-Sky Survey with Roman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep, space-based, all-sky near-infrared survey carried out with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope would constitute a foundational astronomical infrastructure for decades to come. In this white paper, we present a concrete and feasible path to imaging the entire sky at $\sim0.1''$ resolution, beginning with high-impact fields in Cycle 1 and scaling to ultra-wide coverage within the nominal mission. This first-epoch survey will reach $\mathrm{H}\sim25.5$ AB mag (5$\sigma$) and maximize synergies with contemporaneous observatories, while preserving substantial time for other ambitious Roman programs. We outline representative scheduling scenarios and an example Cycle 1 program that triples early Roman-LSST overlap and delivers high-value community data products such as LSST forced photometry, joint \textit{Gaia}-Roman astrometry, and catalogs of Galactic substructure, stong lenses, and other rare systems. The Cycle 1 program will lay the foundation for an eventual all-sky survey, while also delivering high-impact early science. We invite broad community participation in shaping and carrying out both the initial program and the long-term vision of an all-sky Roman survey.</description>

      <title>Galaxy and black hole coevolution in dark matter haloes not captured by cosmological simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation in galaxies is governed by internal and environmental processes, yet their relative roles are not well understood. In particular, uncertainties in measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies, combined with modeling limitations, obfuscate the impact of supermassive black hole feedback across environments and over time. Here we address this with a comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs (z &lt; 0.15 and new environment and halo-mass measurements for ~500,000 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies. This benchmark enables unified comparisons with three prominent cosmological simulations--SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE--and reveals major, contrasting shortcomings. Simulations fail to reproduce observed trends linking star formation, quiescence, AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and halo mass. While simulations qualitatively capture that AGNs are more common in low-mass halos than in rich groups or clusters, detailed host demographics diverge strongly from observations. Partial agreement exists in the stellar mass distribution within large-scale structures, yet all simulations overproduce quenched low-mass satellites in massive halos, while misrepresenting quenched fractions of massive central galaxies and those in low-density environments, which are sensitive to feedback implementation. Improved AGN physics and modeling of multi-phase gas cooling and flows are required to capture the observed interplay between black holes, galaxies, and halos.</description>

      <title>On the Kalb-Ramond field with non-minimal coupling to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a massive Kalb-Ramond field with a general non-minimal coupling to gravity. We first study the theory in flat space-time, taking into account the non-linearities. We show that the coupling with the Ricci scalar gives rise to the strong coupling of the two transverse pseudo-vector degrees of freedom, which are absent in the massless theory. We then show that if the theory is instead coupled to the Ricci tensor or the Riemann tensor, the two tensor modes become strongly coupled in addition to the transverse pseudo-vector modes. We then extend our analysis to homogeneous and isotropic space-time, with vanishing background value of the Kalb-Ramond field. We show that in this case, the couplings with the Ricci and Riemann tensor give rise to the runaway instability. Finally, we discuss the inclusion of the disformal coupling as a possible resolution to this unnatural behavior.</description>

      <title>The supersonic nature of jellyfish galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All gas-rich galaxies in cluster environments are expected to experience ram-pressure stripping from the intra-cluster medium. However, only a fraction of these develop ongoing star-formation in their stripped tail, becoming the so-called ``jellyfish'' galaxies. In this work we provide observational evidence that magnetic fields can signal differences in the extraplanar star formation and explore what are the physical conditions that lead to the formation of a jellyfish galaxy. We first focus on JO147, a jellyfish galaxy that features weak star formation activity in its tail. Using MeerKAT radio continuum observations, we discover polarized emission only in a small fraction of its tail, with an average fraction of $~10\%$, and a low Mach number $\mathcal{M}=1.3-1.6$, which suggests a possible association between magnetic field draping, shock-compression of the gas, and extraplanar star formation activity. Then, we test this scenario in a sample of 17 jellyfish galaxies from the GASP project. We combine dynamical models for their orbits within the host clusters with realistic cluster temperature profiles to infer their Mach number, and we find a positive correlation between it and the star formation activity in their tail. We conclude that supersonic motion is a necessary condition for triggering star formation in the stripped tails of jellyfish galaxies. Our findings provide empirical evidence that the critical factor preventing the stripped gas evaporation is the shock compression induced by the supersonic motion through the cluster. This process likely enhances the magnetic field surrounding the galaxy and the properties of the stripped material.</description>

      <title>Probing Large-scale Structure and the Multi-Phase IGM at the Cosmic Noon -- Insights from a Joint Survey with Euclid, CSST, JPCam, and JUST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present scientific and technical justifications of a potential coordinated Euclid/CSST/JPCam/JUST survey of the Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N), aimed at probing the multi-phase circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (CGM/IGM) at the cosmic noon over ~20 deg$^2$. The survey is structured around three connected goals: (1) improving photometric redshift (photo-z) accuracy through the combination of broad- and narrow-band photometry, enabling reliable identification of large-scale structures; (2) probing extended CGM emission with dedicated narrow-band imaging; and (3) mapping foreground IGM via absorption-line spectroscopy of background galaxies. Together, these components establish an integrated observational framework to investigate galactic ecosystems -- linking galaxies to their circumgalactic and intergalactic environments -- at cosmic noon. We show that the J-PAS-like narrow-band system used in JPCam substantially improves photo-z accuracies from only the Euclid/CSST broad-band data, especially for star-forming galaxies at z~1.0-1.4. This enables the identification of galaxy groups and (proto-)clusters directly from photo-z measurements. Stacked JPCam narrow-band imaging should also detect extended [O II]-emitting CGM halos. We then construct mock 3D gas distribution model and realistic galaxy catalog, and further construct mock CSST and JUST background galaxy spectra adding Lyalpha and Mg II absorptions. The reconstructed 3D H I field from CSST Lyalpha forest reliably recovers large-scale structures; however, our simulations indicate that detecting diffuse IGM Mg II absorption with JUST is infeasible, either through spectral stacking or via the two-point correlation function method. We conclude that constraining the metallicity of the diffuse IGM will require significantly deeper and higher-resolution spectroscopy expected from future facilities such as the 39 m E-ELT.</description>

      <title>Choice of Quantum Vacuum for Inflation Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the modifications to inflationary observables that arise when adopting an $\alpha$-vacuum instead of the standard Bunch--Davies vacuum for quantum fluctuations during inflation. Within the Starobinsky inflationary model, we compute and compare the scalar spectral index, its running, and the running of the running arising from different choices of the initial vacuum state. We further examine the energy scales associated with $\alpha$-vacua and argue that, for any number of extra spatial dimensions, the relevant scale can be truncated at the Hubble scale, $\sim$$\mathcal{O}(10^{13})\,\mathrm{GeV}$, without conflict with current Cavendish-type experimental bounds on sub-millimeter gravity ($\sim$$250\,\mu\mathrm{m}$). Our analysis demonstrates that the $\alpha$-vacuum is subject to stringent constraints as a viable de~Sitter-invariant alternative to the Euclidean (Bunch--Davies) vacuum, with the corrections that it induces in the inflationary observables being strongly limited by the latest Planck data.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the absorbed atomic Universe with the [OI]63um line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of strongly absorbed [OI]63um in a sample of 12 DSFGs at 4.2&lt;z&lt;5.8 selected from the SPT survey. This is the first systematic survey of the [OI]63um fine-structure line at z&gt;4. Using ALMA Bands 9 and 10, we obtain spatially and spectrally resolved observations that probe the interstellar medium on sub-kpc scales. Despite reaching sensitivities 10-100x deeper than most previous studies, we detect [OI]63um in emission in only 2 sources at low significance, with the remaining galaxies yielding stringent non-detections over the full velocity range covered by robust detections of other far-infrared lines, including [CII] and [NII]205um. We identify several compact (0.05-0.2") regions having [OI]63um absorption against the far-infrared dust continuum, some of which are possibly reaching below rest-frame CMB radiation level. We also detect narrow, spatially localised [OI]63um emission "escape channels" preferentially detected in regions with weak or absent dust continuum emission. We predict that similar absorption effects may appear in the [CII] line, particularly when concentrating on the regions with the densest foreground material along the line of sight. The [OI]63um line appears to be originate from a mix of compact, high optical depth [OI]63um emitting regions and sub-thermally excited, oxygen-rich molecular clouds dispersed throughout high-redshift starbursts that are capable of absorbing the ground-state line emission. Combined with a comparison to cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations, this supports the interpretation that regions with higher gas and dust column densities may lead to weakening an intrinsically strong [OI]63um line emission. We argue that the high [OI]63um optical depth is the dominant effect causing the strong absorption, limiting the diagnostic power of this line to trace regions of massive star formation in high-redshift DSFGs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming that dark matter is an ultralight pseudoscalar particle which couples to electromagnetism like an axion (an ALP), we demonstrate that the coupling of the cosmological magnetic field produced by the ALP field oscillations to the primordial dark matter fluctuations yields a spectrum of gauge field fluctuations which can produce a sufficient flux of Lyman-Werner photons to enable the Direct Collapse Black Hole formation scenario. The induced flux is consistent with the bounds on the excess flux of radio photons from ARCADE2 and EDGES measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel, model-independent technique for fitting the cross-component of weak lensing shear, $\gamma_\times$, along a line of sight by combining kinematic and photometric measurements of a single lensed galaxy. Rather than relying on parametric models, we fit for the shear parameter that best transforms the velocity field to restore its underlying symmetries, while also incorporating photometric data for the change in position angle due to shear. We first validate our technique with idealized mock data, exploring the method's response to variations in shear, position angle, inclination, and noise. On this idealized mock data, our combined kinematic and photometric model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional parametric or kinematic-only approaches. We also explore the effects of asymmetric warps and show that rotation direction can impart a small bias on the fit of $\gamma_\times$. Subsequently, we apply our method to a dataset of 358 halos from the Illustris TNG simulations, achieving a notable reduction in the uncertainty of $\gamma_\times$ to 0.039, marking a substantial improvement over previous analysis of the dataset with a parametric model. Finally, we introduce an outlier rejection method based on Moran's $I$ test for spatial autocorrelation. Identifying and filtering out halos with spatially correlated residuals reduces the overall uncertainty to 0.028. Our results underscore the efficacy of combining kinematic and photometric data for weak lensing studies, providing a more precise and targeted measurement of shear along an individual line of sight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use legacy data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) to search for a spectral line from the spontaneous decay of axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter. The HST data consist of blank sky observations taken with the Faint Object Spectrograph in the 165--240~nm wavelength range, while the IUE data consist of observations of the Virgo Cluster obtained with the long- and short-wavelength spectrographs, covering 195--325~nm and 123--200~nm, respectively. We set a 95\% C.L. upper limit on the ALP--photon coupling $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 10^{-11}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ across the whole probed ALP mass range. Notably, we rule out values of $g_{a\gamma}$ above $2.3 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses between 12.4 and 14.5\,eV, improving upon previous limits by a factor of seven.</description>

      <title>Effective bias expansion for circumventing 21 cm foregrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) but suffers from contamination by spectrally smooth foregrounds, which obscure the large-scale signal along the line of sight. We explore the possibility of indirectly extracting the 21 cm signal in the presence of foregrounds by taking advantage of nonlinear couplings between large and small scales, both at the level of the density field and a biased tracer of that field. When combined with effective field theory techniques, bias expansions allow for a systematic treatment of nonlinear mode-couplings in the map between the underlying density field and the 21 cm field. We apply an effective bias expansion to density information generated with $\texttt{21cmFAST}$ using a variety of assumptions about which information can be recovered by different surveys and density estimation techniques. We find that the 21 cm signal produced by our effective bias expansion, combined with our least optimistic foreground assumptions, produces $\sim30\%$ cross-correlations with the true 21 cm field. Providing complementary density information from high-redshift galaxy surveys yields a cross-correlation of 50-70%. The techniques presented here may be combined with foreground mitigation strategies in order to improve the recovery of the large-scale 21 cm signal.</description>

      <title>Efficient evaluation of the dark-matter two-loop power spectrum in the EFT of LSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid progress in cosmological Large Scale Structure (LSS) surveys motivates precise theoretical predictions. The Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) is routinely applied to data, and requires fast computation of its predictions when sampling the large space of cosmological parameters. Going beyond existing one-loop techniques, we present a method to rapidly evaluate the two-loop power spectrum. Our method decomposes the typically small difference between a given linear power spectrum and a reference power spectrum into a cosmology-independent basis of functions resembling massive scalar propagators in Quantum Field Theory. By taking the leading terms in such a small difference, we numerically evaluate the cosmology-independent loop integrals where in the integrand only the relevant combinations of basis functions appear. We achieve an efficient numerical evaluation via physically motivated local ultraviolet subtractions and by arranging the cancellation of infrared singularities locally in the integrands. Final predictions are obtained by contracting these precomputed integrals with the cosmology-dependent coordinates of the expansion in the fixed basis. We present and publicly release the precomputed integrals for the renormalized two-loop dark-matter power spectrum in the EFTofLSS. These require eight EFT counterterms, which include the effect of generated vorticity, and are sufficient to analyze the lensing galaxy signal in LSS surveys at this order.</description>

      <title>CMB component-separated power spectrum estimation by Spectral Internal Linear Combination (SpILC)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Component separation methods mitigate the cross-contamination between different extragalactic and galactic contributions to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. This is often done by linearly combining CMB maps from different frequency channels using internal linear combination (ILC) methods. We demonstrate that deriving power spectrum estimators directly by linearly combining auto- and cross-spectra instead of maps allows us to obtain a different constrained-optimization problem that allows fewer (deprojection) constraint equations than combining at map level using the constrained ILC method. Through simulations, we show that our Spectral internal linear combination (SpILC) produces CMB power spectrum estimators with more than 7 times smaller errorbars than constrained ILC (with thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and cosmic infrared background deprojections) at $\ell\gtrsim 4000$ for Simons Observatory-like observations. Spectral ILC outperforms constrained ILC methods when some modeled components are spatially uncorrelated, e.g. the primary CMB is uncorrelated with foregrounds, and the difference in performance is most significant at noise-dominated scales. More generally, our work shows that component-separated maps with foreground deprojections do not necessarily produce minimum-variance two-or-higher-point estimators.</description>

      <title>From Dark Radiation to Dark Energy: Unified Cosmological Evolution in K-essence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of Unified Dark Matter (UDM) models based on generalized K-essence, where a single scalar field with non-canonical kinetic terms accounts for dark radiation, dark matter, and dark energy. Starting from the purely kinetic Lagrangian proposed by Scherrer (2004), we extend the analysis to quadratic and exponential scalar potentials and explore their phenomenology. All models are implemented in a modified version of \texttt{Hi\_CLASS} and confronted with data from \textit{Planck} 2018, DESI DR1, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The scenarios reproduce the full sequence of cosmic epochs: an early radiation-like phase, a matter-dominated era, and late-time accelerated expansion. The new models predict slightly higher values of the Hubble constant compared to $\Lambda$CDM, thereby partially alleviating the respective tensions from $\sim 4.4 \sigma$ to $\sim 3.4 \sigma$. The quadratic potential requires an ultralight mass that makes it effectively indistinguishable from the Scherrer solution. Overall, generalized K-essence provides a minimal and observationally viable realization of UDM, offering a unified description of the dark sector with distinctive signatures in both early- and late-time cosmology.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Clustering-redshifts and importance sampling of Self-Organised-Maps $n(z)$ realizations for $3\times2$pt samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is part of a series establishing the redshift framework for the $3\times2$pt analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (DES Y6). For DES Y6, photometric redshift distributions are estimated using self-organizing maps (SOMs), calibrated with spectroscopic and many-band photometric data. To overcome limitations from color-redshift degeneracies and incomplete spectroscopic coverage, we enhance this approach by incorporating clustering-based redshift constraints (clustering-z, or WZ) from angular cross-correlations with BOSS and eBOSS galaxies, and eBOSS quasar samples. We define a WZ likelihood and apply importance sampling to a large ensemble of SOM-derived $n(z)$ realizations, selecting those consistent with the clustering measurements to produce a posterior sample for each lens and source bin. The analysis uses angular scales of 1.5-5 Mpc to optimize signal-to-noise while mitigating modeling uncertainties, and marginalizes over redshift-dependent galaxy bias and other systematics informed by the N-body simulation Cardinal. While a sparser spectroscopic reference sample limits WZ constraining power at $z&gt;1.1$, particularly for source bins, we demonstrate that combining SOMPZ with WZ improves redshift accuracy and enhances the overall cosmological constraining power of DES Y6. We estimate an improvement in $S_8$ of approximately 10\% for cosmic shear and $3\times2$pt analysis, primarily due to the WZ calibration of the source samples.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Primordial Gravitational Wave Inference from the CMB with SMICA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of primordial gravitational waves in Cosmic Microwave Background B-mode polarization observations requires accurate and robust subtraction of astrophysical contamination. We show, using a blind Spectral Matching Independent Component Analysis, that it is possible to infer unbiased estimates of the primordial B-mode signal from ground-based observations of a small patch of sky even for highly complex foreground contamination. This work, originally performed in the context of configuration studies for a future CMB-S4 observatory, is highly relevant for the analysis of observations by the current generation of CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton observations of ten high-redshift CAMIRA clusters of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from XMM-Newton observations of ten high-redshift ($0.81 &lt; z &lt; 1.17$) galaxy clusters selected from the CAMIRA catalog based on high richness ($N &gt; 40$). These massive clusters, identified in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program field, provide an ideal sample for probing the dynamical state of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the early Universe. We performed uniform X-ray imaging and spectral analyses to measure the ICM temperature and bolometric luminosity, and investigated cluster morphology through offsets between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the X-ray peak. Extended X-ray emission was detected from all targets, but only one system was classified as dynamically relaxed, indicating a low relaxed fraction ($\sim 10\%$) at high redshift. By combining this high-$z$ sample with a lower-redshift CAMIRA cluster sample, we derived scaling relations among richness, temperature, luminosity, and mass. The results are broadly consistent with predictions from both the self-similar model and the baseline model incorporating the mass--concentration relation. We find no significant redshift evolution, strengthening the view that cluster scaling relations are largely established by $z \sim 1$. We also examined the AGN fraction among member galaxies and found significantly higher AGN activity in high-redshift clusters, particularly in the outskirts, suggesting enhanced AGN triggering during early cluster assembly and a possible connection to the thermodynamic state of dynamically young clusters. These findings provide new insights into the formation and evolution of massive clusters and the thermodynamic history of the ICM, and complement large-area X-ray surveys such as eROSITA.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with galaxy clusters using machine learning. Application to eROSITA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: We present the first Cosmological Parameter inferences from eROSITA X-ray observations of galaxy clusters using a Machine Learning algorithm. Methods: We train a Random Forest using mock catalogs of clusters from Magneticum multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations. We apply the trained ML algorithm to observed X-ray features (gas luminosity, mass, and temperature) at different redshifts from the eROSITA eFEDS and eRASS1 catalogs. Results: We obtain cosmological constraints with precision comparable to those from standard analyses, such as weak lensing and cluster abundances. We infer $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.30^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $\sigma_8=0.81\pm0.01$, and $h_0=0.710\pm0.004$. The recovered parameters show no tension in the $\Omega_{\rm m}-\sigma_8$ space, but a significant deviation of $h_0$ from the Planck estimates. These inferences remain rather stable against variations of the input observable set and parameter space coverage. These results indicate that correlations among intracluster properties contain cosmological information beyond that encoded in the cluster abundance alone, which can be captured by machine learning trained on multi-cosmology simulations. Conclusions: ML algorithms trained on multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations can effectively infer cosmological parameters directly from galaxy cluster data. This is a change of paradigm in the context of cosmological parameter inferences. This approach complements traditional cluster-count analyses and is particularly suited to large upcoming surveys, where systematic uncertainties in mass calibration may otherwise dominate the error budget. It also highlights the potential of large-scale X-ray surveys to deliver independent tests of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1305.6977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Einstein$-$Cartan$-$Sciama$-$Kibble theory of gravity naturally extends general relativity to include quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum of matter by equipping spacetime with torsion. Using the Einstein energy$-$momentum pseudotensor for the gravitational field in this theory, we show that the energy and momentum of the closed Universe are equal to zero. Since the positive energy from mass and motion of the observed matter in the Universe exceeds in magnitude the negative energy from gravity, the Universe must contain another form of matter whose energy is negative. This form, which cannot be composed from particles, might be the observed dark matter.</description>

      <title>Supercool subtleties of cosmological phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate rarely explored details of supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions at the electroweak scale, which may lead to strong gravitational wave signals or explain the cosmic baryon asymmetry. The nucleation temperature is often used in phase transition analyses, and is defined through the nucleation condition: on average one bubble has nucleated per Hubble volume. We argue that the nucleation temperature is neither a fundamental nor essential quantity in phase transition analysis. We illustrate scenarios where a transition can complete without satisfying the nucleation condition, and conversely where the nucleation condition is satisfied but the transition does not complete. We also find that simple nucleation heuristics, which are defined to approximate the nucleation temperature, break down for strong supercooling. Thus, studies that rely on the nucleation temperature $\unicode{x2014}$ approximated or otherwise $\unicode{x2014}$ may misclassify the completion of a transition. Further, we find that the nucleation temperature decouples from the progress of the transition for strong supercooling. We advocate use of the percolation temperature as a reference temperature for gravitational wave production, because the percolation temperature is directly connected to transition progress and the collision of bubbles. Finally, we provide model-independent bounds on the bubble wall velocity that allow one to predict whether a transition completes based only on knowledge of the bounce action curve. We apply our methods to find empirical bounds on the bubble wall velocity for which the physical volume of the false vacuum decreases during the transition. We verify the accuracy of our predictions using benchmarks from a high temperature expansion of the Standard Model and from the real scalar singlet model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nontopological solitons formed during first-order phase transitions can serve as macroscopic dark matter candidates, with their stability ensured by a charge asymmetry traditionally assumed to originate from baryogenesis. Following this generic pattern, we demonstrate that solitogenesis after baryogenesis makes the solitons a coincident dark matter candidate, providing new explanations for the coincidence problem between baryon and dark matter energy densities. We derive a novel and robust conclusion: asteroid-mass coincident soliton dark matter is always accompanied by detectable gravitational waves observable by LISA, $\mu$Ares, and Theia, providing a new candidate beyond primordial black holes in this mass window. Additionally, we propose a simple neutrino-ball scenario that addresses baryon asymmetry, dark matter, and neutrino masses, featuring new particles below the electroweak scale and correlated observable signals, including lensing, gravitational waves, and soliton evaporation or collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the drizzling pipeline and contents of the drizzled database for Hubble Space Telescope Cycle 27-29 Archival Legacy project "SKYSURF," the largest archival project ever approved for Hubble. SKYSURF aims to investigate the extragalactic background light using all 143,914 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR images that have been taken by Hubble since its launch in 2002. SKYSURF has produced 38,027 single-visit mosaics and 7,893 multi-visit mosaics across 28 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR filters using nonstandard drizzling methods, which include preserving the lowest sky-level of each visit/group in the drizzled products, applying wider apertures for cosmic-ray rejection, correcting effects caused by charge transfer efficiency degradation, and removing potential light gradients from input images via sky-map subtraction. We generate source catalogs for all drizzled products with SExtractor and provide updated star-galaxy separation parameters and integrated galaxy light (IGL) estimates for 25 of the 28 SKYSURF filters (wavelength range 0.2-1.7 um) using a novel IGL fitting method made possible by the vast SKYSURF dataset. We discuss the data processing and data analysis challenges encountered, detail our solutions, and offer suggestions that may facilitate future large-scale IGL investigations with Webb, SPHEREx, and Roman.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological dynamics and predictions in the theory of warped massive gravity. This set-up postulates a five-dimensional ghost-free massive graviton with a brane-localized four-dimensional massive gravity potential, and has the virtue of raising the strong-coupling scale of the 4D theory. We identify two classes of models that lead to decoupled equations for the scale factor on the brane: one characterized by a particular choice of boundary conditions for the St\"uckelberg fields and one characterized by a special tuning between the coefficients of the 5D and 4D potentials. In the first case, we find interesting solutions including a cosmological bounce without the need of exotic matter. The second case leads to a modified Friedmann equation, and comparison with data shows the potential of the model to alleviate the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>When inverse seesaw meets inverse electroweak phase transition: a novel path to leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new nonthermal leptogenesis mechanism triggered by the cosmic first-order phase transition. The Standard Model is extended with two generations of TeV-scale vectorlike leptons. The lighter generation gives rise to an inverse electroweak phase transition of the Higgs field at $T\sim200~{\rm GeV}$, restoring the symmetry, and resulting in relativistic bubble expansion in the space. The heavier generation is responsible for neutrino masses via the inverse seesaw mechanism. The interaction between bubble walls and particles in the plasma abundantly produces the vectorlike leptons, and they subsequently undergo CP-violating decay to generate the baryon asymmetry. This mechanism is testable at current and future particle experiments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the prospects for detecting a parity-violating gravitational-wave background (GWB) with third-generation ground-based detector networks. We focus on a network consisting of one Einstein Telescope (ET) and two Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors. In our analysis we vary the ET design, detector orientations, and arm lengths to assess the impact of geometry and scale on detection capabilities. We find that, among the configurations studied, networks with a $15$ km triangular ET design provide the strongest parity-violation constraining power, followed by networks with an L-shaped ET design, while networks with $10$ km triangular ET configurations are the least sensitive. Under current bounds, ET alone cannot confidently detect parity violation.</description>

      <title>Probing a minimal dark gauge sector via microlensing of compact dark objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal Dark Standard Model (DSM) consisting of a single spin-0 particle with dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and completely decoupled from the visible sector. Characterized only by the scalar mass $\mu$ and the dark charge $q$, this framework naturally gives rise to a rich phenomenology, including stable solitonic configurations that behave as dark "mini-MACHOs". We numerically build and evolve these gauged scalar-field solitons, derive their mass-radius relations, and identify a critical charge beyond which no gravitationally bound configurations exist. By combining these results with microlensing surveys that exclude compact objects heavier than the asteroid-mass scale ($M\lesssim 10^{-11}M_\odot$), we obtain the constraint $\mu\gtrsim 10\,\rm eV$ for viable configurations, depending on $q$. Our results represent a step forward in showing that purely gravitational observations can constrain the internal parameters of a dark gauge sector, and provide a framework for exploring broader DSM scenarios through future probes such as gravitational wave detections.</description>
