      <title>An analytic method for quadratic polarons in non-parabolic bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Including the effect of lattice anharmonicity on electron-phonon interactions has recently garnered attention due to its role as a necessary and significant component in explaining various phenomena, including superconductivity, optical response, and the temperature dependence of mobility. This study focuses on analytically treating the effects of anharmonic electron-phonon coupling on the polaron self-energy, combined with numerical Diagrammatic Monte Carlo data. Specifically, we incorporate a quadratic interaction into the method of squeezed phonon states, which has proven effective for analytically calculating the polaron parameters. Additionally, we extend this method to non-parabolic finite-width conduction bands while maintaining the periodic translation symmetry of the system. Our results are compared with those obtained from Diagrammatic Monte Carlo, partially reported in a recent study [Phys. Rev. B 107, L121109(2023)], covering a wide range of coupling strengths for the nonlinear interaction. Remarkably, our analytic method predicts the same features as the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition in a Two-dimensional Dipolar Bose Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions induce complex order in quantum systems. It becomes particularly interesting in two-dimension (2D), where the superfluidity with quasi-long-range order emerges via Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism, which still remains elusive with dipolar interactions. Here, we observe the BKT transition from a normal gas to the superfluid phase in a quasi-2D dipolar Bose gas of erbium atoms. Controlling the orientation of dipoles, we characterize the transition point by monitoring extended coherence and measuring the equation of state. This allows us to gain a systematic understanding of the BKT transition based on an effective short-range description of dipolar interaction in 2D. Additionally, we observe anisotropic density fluctuations and non-local effects in the superfluid regime, which establishes the dipolar nature of the 2D superfluid. Our results lay the ground for understanding the behavior of dipolar bosons in 2D and open up opportunities for examining complex orders in a dipolar superfluid.</description>

      <title>Markovian and non-Markovian master equations versus an exactly solvable model of a qubit in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of open quantum systems, but their accuracy is rarely compared with the analytical solution of exactly solvable models. In this work, we perform such a comparison for the damped Jaynes-Cummings model of a qubit in a leaky cavity, for which an analytical solution is available in the one-excitation subspace. We consider the non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation up to the second (Redfield) and fourth orders as well as three types of Markovian master equations: the coarse-grained, cumulant, and standard rotating-wave approximation (RWA) Lindblad equations. We compare the exact solution to these master equations for three different spectral densities: impulse, Ohmic, and triangular. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained master equation outperforms the standard RWA-based Lindblad master equation for weak coupling or high qubit frequency (relative to the spectral density high-frequency cutoff $\omega_c$), where the Markovian approximation is valid. In the presence of non-Markovian effects characterized by oscillatory, non-decaying behavior, the TCL approximation closely matches the exact solution for short evolution times (in units of $\omega_c^{-1}$) even outside the regime of validity of the Markovian approximations. For long evolution times, all master equations perform poorly, as quantified in terms of the trace-norm distance from the exact solution. The fourth-order time-convolutionless master equation achieves the top performance in all cases. Our results highlight the need for reliable approximation methods to describe open-system quantum dynamics beyond the short-time limit.</description>
