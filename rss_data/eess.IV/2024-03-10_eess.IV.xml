      <title>Beyond Multiple Instance Learning: Full Resolution All-In-Memory End-To-End Pathology Slide Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has great potential to improve health outcomes by training systems on vast digitized clinical datasets. Computational Pathology, with its massive amounts of microscopy image data and impact on diagnostics and biomarkers, is at the forefront of this development. Gigapixel pathology slides pose a unique challenge due to their enormous size and are usually divided into tens of thousands of smaller tiles for analysis. This results in a discontinuity in the machine learning process by separating the training of tile-level encoders from slide-level aggregators and the need to adopt weakly supervised learning strategies. Training models from entire pathology slides end-to-end has been largely unexplored due to its computational challenges. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach to jointly train both a tile encoder and a slide-aggregator fully in memory and end-to-end at high-resolution, bridging the gap between input and slide-level supervision. While more computationally expensive, detailed quantitative validation shows promise for large-scale pre-training of pathology foundation models.</description>

      <title>C2P-GCN: Cell-to-Patch Graph Convolutional Network for Colorectal Cancer Grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based learning approaches, due to their ability to encode tissue/organ structure information, are increasingly favored for grading colorectal cancer histology images. Recent graph-based techniques involve dividing whole slide images (WSIs) into smaller or medium-sized patches, and then building graphs on each patch for direct use in training. This method, however, fails to capture the tissue structure information present in an entire WSI and relies on training from a significantly large dataset of image patches. In this paper, we propose a novel cell-to-patch graph convolutional network (C2P-GCN), which is a two-stage graph formation-based approach. In the first stage, it forms a patch-level graph based on the cell organization on each patch of a WSI. In the second stage, it forms an image-level graph based on a similarity measure between patches of a WSI considering each patch as a node of a graph. This graph representation is then fed into a multi-layer GCN-based classification network. Our approach, through its dual-phase graph construction, effectively gathers local structural details from individual patches and establishes a meaningful connection among all patches across a WSI. As C2P-GCN integrates the structural data of an entire WSI into a single graph, it allows our model to work with significantly fewer training data compared to the latest models for colorectal cancer. Experimental validation of C2P-GCN on two distinct colorectal cancer datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Hadamard U-Net for MRI Bias Field Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field inhomogeneity correction remains a challenging task in MRI analysis. Most established techniques are designed for brain MRI by supposing that image intensities in the identical tissue follow a uniform distribution. Such an assumption cannot be easily applied to other organs, especially those that are small in size and heterogeneous in texture (large variations in intensity), such as the prostate. To address this problem, this paper proposes a probabilistic Hadamard U-Net (PHU-Net) for prostate MRI bias field correction. First, a novel Hadamard U-Net (HU-Net) is introduced to extract the low-frequency scalar field, multiplied by the original input to obtain the prototypical corrected image. HU-Net converts the input image from the time domain into the frequency domain via Hadamard transform. In the frequency domain, high-frequency components are eliminated using the trainable filter (scaling layer), hard-thresholding layer, and sparsity penalty. Next, a conditional variational autoencoder is used to encode possible bias field-corrected variants into a low-dimensional latent space. Random samples drawn from latent space are then incorporated with a prototypical corrected image to generate multiple plausible images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PHU-Net in correcting bias-field in prostate MRI with a fast inference speed. It has also been shown that prostate MRI segmentation accuracy improves with the high-quality corrected images from PHU-Net. The code will be available in the final version of this manuscript.</description>

      <title>From Registration Uncertainty to Segmentation Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the uncertainty inherent in deep learning-based image registration models has been an ongoing area of research. Existing methods have been developed to quantify both transformation and appearance uncertainties related to the registration process, elucidating areas where the model may exhibit ambiguity regarding the generated deformation. However, our study reveals that neither uncertainty effectively estimates the potential errors when the registration model is used for label propagation. Here, we propose a novel framework to concurrently estimate both the epistemic and aleatoric segmentation uncertainties for image registration. To this end, we implement a compact deep neural network (DNN) designed to transform the appearance discrepancy in the warping into aleatoric segmentation uncertainty by minimizing a negative log-likelihood loss function. Furthermore, we present epistemic segmentation uncertainty within the label propagation process as the entropy of the propagated labels. By introducing segmentation uncertainty along with existing methods for estimating registration uncertainty, we offer vital insights into the potential uncertainties at different stages of image registration. We validated our proposed framework using publicly available datasets, and the results prove that the segmentation uncertainties estimated with the proposed method correlate well with errors in label propagation, all while achieving superior registration performance.</description>

      <title>Noise Level Adaptive Diffusion Model for Robust Reconstruction of Accelerated MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general, diffusion model-based MRI reconstruction methods incrementally remove artificially added noise while imposing data consistency to reconstruct the underlying images. However, real-world MRI acquisitions already contain inherent noise due to thermal fluctuations. This phenomenon is particularly notable when using ultra-fast, high-resolution imaging sequences for advanced research, or using low-field systems favored by low- and middle-income countries. These common scenarios can lead to sub-optimal performance or complete failure of existing diffusion model-based reconstruction techniques. Specifically, as the artificially added noise is gradually removed, the inherent MRI noise becomes increasingly pronounced, making the actual noise level inconsistent with the predefined denoising schedule and consequently inaccurate image reconstruction. To tackle this problem, we propose a posterior sampling strategy with a novel NoIse Level Adaptive Data Consistency (Nila-DC) operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets and an in-house clinical dataset with field strength ranging from 0.3T to 3T, showing that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods, and is highly robust against various noise levels. The code will be released after review.</description>

      <title>LightM-UNet: Mamba Assists in Lightweight UNet for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UNet and its variants have been widely used in medical image segmentation. However, these models, especially those based on Transformer architectures, pose challenges due to their large number of parameters and computational loads, making them unsuitable for mobile health applications. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, have emerged as competitive alternatives to CNN and Transformer architectures. Building upon this, we employ Mamba as a lightweight substitute for CNN and Transformer within UNet, aiming at tackling challenges stemming from computational resource limitations in real medical settings. To this end, we introduce the Lightweight Mamba UNet (LightM-UNet) that integrates Mamba and UNet in a lightweight framework. Specifically, LightM-UNet leverages the Residual Vision Mamba Layer in a pure Mamba fashion to extract deep semantic features and model long-range spatial dependencies, with linear computational complexity. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world 2D/3D datasets demonstrate that LightM-UNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art literature. Notably, when compared to the renowned nnU-Net, LightM-UNet achieves superior segmentation performance while drastically reducing parameter and computation costs by 116x and 21x, respectively. This highlights the potential of Mamba in facilitating model lightweighting. Our code implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/MrBlankness/LightM-UNet.</description>

      <title>DuDoUniNeXt: Dual-domain unified hybrid model for single and multi-contrast undersampled MRI reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-contrast (MC) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction aims to incorporate a reference image of auxiliary modality to guide the reconstruction process of the target modality. Known MC reconstruction methods perform well with a fully sampled reference image, but usually exhibit inferior performance, compared to single-contrast (SC) methods, when the reference image is missing or of low quality. To address this issue, we propose DuDoUniNeXt, a unified dual-domain MRI reconstruction network that can accommodate to scenarios involving absent, low-quality, and high-quality reference images. DuDoUniNeXt adopts a hybrid backbone that combines CNN and ViT, enabling specific adjustment of image domain and k-space reconstruction. Specifically, an adaptive coarse-to-fine feature fusion module (AdaC2F) is devised to dynamically process the information from reference images of varying qualities. Besides, a partially shared shallow feature extractor (PaSS) is proposed, which uses shared and distinct parameters to handle consistent and discrepancy information among contrasts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses state-of-the-art SC and MC models significantly. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid backbone, AdaC2F, PaSS, and the dual-domain unified learning scheme.</description>

      <title>Embedded Deployment of Semantic Segmentation in Medicine through Low-Resolution Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When deploying neural networks in real-life situations, the size and computational effort are often the limiting factors. This is especially true in environments where big, expensive hardware is not affordable, like in embedded medical devices, where budgets are often tight. State-of-the-art proposed multiple different lightweight solutions for such use cases, mostly by changing the base model architecture, not taking the input and output resolution into consideration. In this paper, we propose our architecture that takes advantage of the fact that in hardware-limited environments, we often refrain from using the highest available input resolutions to guarantee a higher throughput. Although using lower-resolution input leads to a significant reduction in computing and memory requirements, it may also incur reduced prediction quality. Our architecture addresses this problem by exploiting the fact that we can still utilize high-resolution ground-truths in training. The proposed model inputs lower-resolution images and high-resolution ground truths, which can improve the prediction quality by 5.5% while adding less than 200 parameters to the model. %reducing the frames per second only from 25 to 20. We conduct an extensive analysis to illustrate that our architecture enhances existing state-of-the-art frameworks for lightweight semantic segmentation of cancer in MRI images. We also tested the deployment speed of state-of-the-art lightweight networks and our architecture on Nvidia's Jetson Nano to emulate deployment in resource-constrained embedded scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hybridized Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory for Improved Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis from MRI Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-related diseases are more sensitive than other diseases due to several factors, including the complexity of surgical procedures, high costs, and other challenges. Alzheimer's disease is a common brain disorder that causes memory loss and the shrinking of brain cells. Early detection is critical for providing proper treatment to patients. However, identifying Alzheimer's at an early stage using manual scanning of CT or MRI scans is challenging. Therefore, researchers have delved into the exploration of computer-aided systems, employing Machine Learning and Deep Learning methodologies, which entail the training of datasets to detect Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to present a hybrid model that combines a CNN model's feature extraction capabilities with an LSTM model's detection capabilities. This study has applied the transfer learning called VGG16 in the hybrid model to extract features from MRI images. The LSTM detects features between the convolution layer and the fully connected layer. The output layer of the fully connected layer uses the softmax function. The training of the hybrid model involved utilizing the ADNI dataset. The trial findings revealed that the model achieved a level of accuracy of 98.8%, a sensitivity rate of 100%, and a specificity rate of 76%. The proposed hybrid model outperforms its contemporary CNN counterparts, showcasing a superior performance.</description>

      <title>A Data Augmentation Pipeline to Generate Synthetic Labeled Datasets of 3D Echocardiography Images using a GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to privacy issues and limited amount of publicly available labeled datasets in the domain of medical imaging, we propose an image generation pipeline to synthesize 3D echocardiographic images with corresponding ground truth labels, to alleviate the need for data collection and for laborious and error-prone human labeling of images for subsequent Deep Learning (DL) tasks. The proposed method utilizes detailed anatomical segmentations of the heart as ground truth label sources. This initial dataset is combined with a second dataset made up of real 3D echocardiographic images to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize realistic 3D cardiovascular Ultrasound images paired with ground truth labels. To generate the synthetic 3D dataset, the trained GAN uses high resolution anatomical models from Computed Tomography (CT) as input. A qualitative analysis of the synthesized images showed that the main structures of the heart are well delineated and closely follow the labels obtained from the anatomical models. To assess the usability of these synthetic images for DL tasks, segmentation algorithms were trained to delineate the left ventricle, left atrium, and myocardium. A quantitative analysis of the 3D segmentations given by the models trained with the synthetic images indicated the potential use of this GAN approach to generate 3D synthetic data, use the data to train DL models for different clinical tasks, and therefore tackle the problem of scarcity of 3D labeled echocardiography datasets.</description>

      <title>FedFMS: Exploring Federated Foundation Models for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis. The Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) serves as a powerful foundation model for visual segmentation and can be adapted for medical image segmentation. However, medical imaging data typically contain privacy-sensitive information, making it challenging to train foundation models with centralized storage and sharing. To date, there are few foundation models tailored for medical image deployment within the federated learning framework, and the segmentation performance, as well as the efficiency of communication and training, remain unexplored. In response to these issues, we developed Federated Foundation models for Medical image Segmentation (FedFMS), which includes the Federated SAM (FedSAM) and a communication and training-efficient Federated SAM with Medical SAM Adapter (FedMSA). Comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets are conducted to investigate the performance disparities between centralized training and federated learning across various configurations of FedFMS. The experiments revealed that FedFMS could achieve performance comparable to models trained via centralized training methods while maintaining privacy. Furthermore, FedMSA demonstrated the potential to enhance communication and training efficiency. Our model implementation codes are available at https://github.com/LIU-YUXI/FedFMS.</description>

      <title>Selective Encryption using Segmentation Mask with Chaotic Henon Map for Multidimensional Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A user-centric design and resource optimization should be at the center of any technology or innovation. The user-centric perspective gives the developer the opportunity to develop with task-based optimization. The user in the medical image field is a medical professional who analyzes the medical images and gives their diagnosis results to the patient. This scheme, having the medical professional user's perspective, innovates in the area of Medical Image storage and security. The architecture is designed with three main segments, namely: Segmentation, Storage, and Retrieval. This architecture was designed owing to the fact that the number of retrieval operations done by medical professionals was toweringly higher when compared to the storage operations done for some handful number of times for a particular medical image. This gives room for our innovation to segment out the medically indispensable part of the medical image, encrypt it, and store it. By encrypting the vital parts of the image using a strong encryption algorithm like the chaotic Henon map, we are able to keep the security intact. Now retrieving the medical image demands only the computationally less stressing decryption of the segmented region of interest. The decryption of the segmented region of interest results in the full recovery of the medical image which can be viewed on demand by the medical professionals for various diagnosis purposes. In this scheme, we were able to achieve a retrieval speed improvement of around 47% when compared to a full image encryption of brain medical CT images.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Translation for Refinement of Image Generation (STIG) Based on Contrastive Learning and Spectral Filter Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, image generation and synthesis have remarkably progressed with generative models. Despite photo-realistic results, intrinsic discrepancies are still observed in the frequency domain. The spectral discrepancy appeared not only in generative adversarial networks but in diffusion models. In this study, we propose a framework to effectively mitigate the disparity in frequency domain of the generated images to improve generative performance of both GAN and diffusion models. This is realized by spectrum translation for the refinement of image generation (STIG) based on contrastive learning. We adopt theoretical logic of frequency components in various generative networks. The key idea, here, is to refine the spectrum of the generated image via the concept of image-to-image translation and contrastive learning in terms of digital signal processing. We evaluate our framework across eight fake image datasets and various cutting-edge models to demonstrate the effectiveness of STIG. Our framework outperforms other cutting-edges showing significant decreases in FID and log frequency distance of spectrum. We further emphasize that STIG improves image quality by decreasing the spectral anomaly. Additionally, validation results present that the frequency-based deepfake detector confuses more in the case where fake spectrums are manipulated by STIG.</description>

      <title>Hide in Thicket: Generating Imperceptible and Rational Adversarial Perturbations on 3D Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attack methods based on point manipulation for 3D point cloud classification have revealed the fragility of 3D models, yet the adversarial examples they produce are easily perceived or defended against. The trade-off between the imperceptibility and adversarial strength leads most point attack methods to inevitably introduce easily detectable outlier points upon a successful attack. Another promising strategy, shape-based attack, can effectively eliminate outliers, but existing methods often suffer significant reductions in imperceptibility due to irrational deformations. We find that concealing deformation perturbations in areas insensitive to human eyes can achieve a better trade-off between imperceptibility and adversarial strength, specifically in parts of the object surface that are complex and exhibit drastic curvature changes. Therefore, we propose a novel shape-based adversarial attack method, HiT-ADV, which initially conducts a two-stage search for attack regions based on saliency and imperceptibility scores, and then adds deformation perturbations in each attack region using Gaussian kernel functions. Additionally, HiT-ADV is extendable to physical attack. We propose that by employing benign resampling and benign rigid transformations, we can further enhance physical adversarial strength with little sacrifice to imperceptibility. Extensive experiments have validated the superiority of our method in terms of adversarial and imperceptible properties in both digital and physical spaces.

      <title>OmniCount: Multi-label Object Counting with Semantic-Geometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object counting is pivotal for understanding the composition of scenes. Previously, this task was dominated by class-specific methods, which have gradually evolved into more adaptable class-agnostic strategies. However, these strategies come with their own set of limitations, such as the need for manual exemplar input and multiple passes for multiple categories, resulting in significant inefficiencies. This paper introduces a new, more practical approach enabling simultaneous counting of multiple object categories using an open vocabulary framework. Our solution, OmniCount, stands out by using semantic and geometric insights from pre-trained models to count multiple categories of objects as specified by users, all without additional training. OmniCount distinguishes itself by generating precise object masks and leveraging point prompts via the Segment Anything Model for efficient counting. To evaluate OmniCount, we created the OmniCount-191 benchmark, a first-of-its-kind dataset with multi-label object counts, including points, bounding boxes, and VQA annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation in OmniCount-191, alongside other leading benchmarks, demonstrates OmniCount's exceptional performance, significantly outpacing existing solutions and heralding a new era in object counting technology.</description>

      <title>Near Field Computational Imaging with RIS Generated Virtual Masks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near field computational imaging has been recognized as a promising technique for non-destructive and highly accurate detection of the target. Meanwhile, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can flexibly control the scattered electromagnetic (EM) fields for sensing the target and can thus help computational imaging in the near field. In this paper, we propose a near-field imaging scheme based on holograghic aperture RIS. Specifically, we first establish an end-to-end EM propagation model from the perspective of Maxwell equations. To mitigate the inherent ill conditioning of the inverse problem in the imaging system, we design the EM field patterns as masks that help translate the inverse problem into a forward problem. Next, we utilize RIS to generate different virtual EM masks on the target surface and calculate the cross-correlation between the mask patterns and the electric field strength at the receiver. We then provide a RIS design scheme for virtual EM masks by employing a regularization technique. The cross-range resolution of the proposed method is analyzed based on the spatial spectrum of the generated masks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high-quality imaging. Moreover, the imaging quality can be improved by generating more virtual EM masks, by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver, or by placing the target closer to the RIS.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Image Compression with Score-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous success of diffusion generative models in text-to-image generation, replicating this success in the domain of image compression has proven difficult. In this paper, we demonstrate that diffusion can significantly improve perceptual quality at a given bit-rate, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches PO-ELIC and HiFiC as measured by FID score. This is achieved using a simple but theoretically motivated two-stage approach combining an autoencoder targeting MSE followed by a further score-based decoder. However, as we will show, implementation details matter and the optimal design decisions can differ greatly from typical text-to-image models.</description>

      <title>ContriMix: Scalable stain color augmentation for domain generalization without domain labels in digital pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04527v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differences in staining and imaging procedures can cause significant color variations in histopathology images, leading to poor generalization when deploying deep-learning models trained from a different data source. Various color augmentation methods have been proposed to generate synthetic images during training to make models more robust, eliminating the need for stain normalization during test time. Many color augmentation methods leverage domain labels to generate synthetic images. This approach causes three significant challenges to scaling such a model. Firstly, incorporating data from a new domain into deep-learning models trained on existing domain labels is not straightforward. Secondly, dependency on domain labels prevents the use of pathology images without domain labels to improve model performance. Finally, implementation of these methods becomes complicated when multiple domain labels (e.g., patient identification, medical center, etc) are associated with a single image. We introduce ContriMix, a novel domain label free stain color augmentation method based on DRIT++, a style-transfer method. Contrimix leverages sample stain color variation within a training minibatch and random mixing to extract content and attribute information from pathology images. This information can be used by a trained ContriMix model to create synthetic images to improve the performance of existing classifiers. ContriMix outperforms competing methods on the Camelyon17-WILDS dataset. Its performance is consistent across different slides in the test set while being robust to the color variation from rare substances in pathology images. We make our code and trained ContriMix models available for research use. The code for ContriMix can be found at https://gitlab.com/huutan86/contrimix</description>

      <title>RetSeg: Retention-based Colorectal Polyps Segmentation Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05446v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized medical imaging analysis, showcasing superior efficacy compared to conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in vital tasks such as polyp classification, detection, and segmentation. Leveraging attention mechanisms to focus on specific image regions, ViTs exhibit contextual awareness in processing visual data, culminating in robust and precise predictions, even for intricate medical images. Moreover, the inherent self-attention mechanism in Transformers accommodates varying input sizes and resolutions, granting an unprecedented flexibility absent in traditional CNNs. However, Transformers grapple with challenges like excessive memory usage and limited training parallelism due to self-attention, rendering them impractical for real-time disease detection on resource-constrained devices. In this study, we address these hurdles by investigating the integration of the recently introduced retention mechanism into polyp segmentation, introducing RetSeg, an encoder-decoder network featuring multi-head retention blocks. Drawing inspiration from Retentive Networks (RetNet), RetSeg is designed to bridge the gap between precise polyp segmentation and resource utilization, particularly tailored for colonoscopy images. We train and validate RetSeg for polyp segmentation employing two publicly available datasets: Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB. Additionally, we showcase RetSeg's promising performance across diverse public datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, ETIS-LaribPolypDB, CVC-300, and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp. While our work represents an early-stage exploration, further in-depth studies are imperative to advance these promising findings.</description>

      <title>Brain decoding: toward real-time reconstruction of visual perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past five years, the use of generative and foundational AI systems has greatly improved the decoding of brain activity. Visual perception, in particular, can now be decoded from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with remarkable fidelity. This neuroimaging technique, however, suffers from a limited temporal resolution ($\approx$0.5 Hz) and thus fundamentally constrains its real-time usage. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on magnetoencephalography (MEG), a neuroimaging device capable of measuring brain activity with high temporal resolution ($\approx$5,000 Hz). For this, we develop an MEG decoding model trained with both contrastive and regression objectives and consisting of three modules: i) pretrained embeddings obtained from the image, ii) an MEG module trained end-to-end and iii) a pretrained image generator. Our results are threefold: Firstly, our MEG decoder shows a 7X improvement of image-retrieval over classic linear decoders. Second, late brain responses to images are best decoded with DINOv2, a recent foundational image model. Third, image retrievals and generations both suggest that high-level visual features can be decoded from MEG signals, although the same approach applied to 7T fMRI also recovers better low-level features. Overall, these results, while preliminary, provide an important step towards the decoding -- in real-time -- of the visual processes continuously unfolding within the human brain.</description>

      <title>Boosting Neural Representations for Videos with a Conditional Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach for video storage and processing, showing remarkable versatility across various video tasks. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage their representation capabilities, primarily due to inadequate alignment of intermediate features during target frame decoding. This paper introduces a universal boosting framework for current implicit video representation approaches. Specifically, we utilize a conditional decoder with a temporal-aware affine transform module, which uses the frame index as a prior condition to effectively align intermediate features with target frames. Besides, we introduce a sinusoidal NeRV-like block to generate diverse intermediate features and achieve a more balanced parameter distribution, thereby enhancing the model's capacity. With a high-frequency information-preserving reconstruction loss, our approach successfully boosts multiple baseline INRs in the reconstruction quality and convergence speed for video regression, and exhibits superior inpainting and interpolation results. Further, we integrate a consistent entropy minimization technique and develop video codecs based on these boosted INRs. Experiments on the UVG dataset confirm that our enhanced codecs significantly outperform baseline INRs and offer competitive rate-distortion performance compared to traditional and learning-based codecs.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Learning of Generalized Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) to replace dense unstructured weight matrices with structured ones that possess desired properties. The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. On the image and language tasks, our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Generative Adversarial Networks for Binary Semantic Segmentation on Imbalanced Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous crack region detection is a typical binary semantic segmentation task, which aims to detect pixels representing cracks on pavement surface images automatically by algorithms. Although existing deep learning-based methods have achieved outcoming results on specific public pavement datasets, the performance would deteriorate dramatically on imbalanced datasets. The input datasets used in such tasks suffer from severely between-class imbalanced problems, hence, it is a core challenge to obtain a robust performance on diverse pavement datasets with generic deep learning models. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a deep learning framework based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) for the anomalous crack region detection tasks at the pixel level. In particular, the proposed framework containing a cGANs and a novel auxiliary network is developed to enhance and stabilize the generator's performance under two alternative training stages, when estimating a multiscale probability feature map from heterogeneous and imbalanced inputs iteratively. Moreover, several attention mechanisms and entropy strategies are incorporated into the cGANs architecture and the auxiliary network separately to mitigate further the performance deterioration of model training on severely imbalanced datasets. We implement extensive experiments on six accessible pavement datasets. The experimental results from both visual and quantitative evaluation show that the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art results on these datasets efficiently and robustly without acceleration of computation complexity.</description>
