      <title>A continuously-cooled 3He/4He phase separation refrigerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel cooling method that uses the phase separation and evaporative cooling of 3He to reach and continuously maintain sub-kelvin temperatures. While less complex than a dilution refrigerator, the system performs similarly to a continuous 3He cryostat but with a simpler design, a more efficient cooldown process, and a significantly smaller 3He requirement. Our prototype demonstrated a base temperature of 585 mK and 3 mW cooling power at 700 mK using just two gaseous liters of 3He. Lower temperatures could be expected in systems with improved heat exchangers and pumping efficiency.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of angular momentum transfer among crystal lattice modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete rotational symmetry of crystals leads to the conservation of quantized angular momentum in solids. While the exchange of energy and linear momentum between lattice vibrations (phonons) via anharmonic coupling is a cornerstone of solid-state physics, conservation and transfer of angular momentum within the lattice remains a postulate. Recently, phonon angular momentum, often in the form of chiral phonons, has been linked to giant magnetic fields, thermal Hall conductivity, dynamical multiferroicity, ultrafast demagnetization, or magnetic switching. However, the inherent process of phonon to phonon angular momentum transfer, fundamentally required to reach any magnetization equilibrium and imperative for all spin relaxation phenomena in solids, remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the coherent transfer of angular momentum from one lattice mode to another by establishing helical nonlinear phononics. We directly observe rotational phonon-phonon Umklapp scattering dictated by pseudo angular momentum conservation and the threefold rotational symmetry of the topological insulator bismuth selenide. We identify nonlinear phonon-phonon coupling as an angular momentum transfer channel, confirmed by our ab-initio calculations. Besides bearing universal implications for angular momentum dissipation abundant in nature, our work actively reverses the natural flow, leading to the nonlinear upconversion of lattice angular momentum. We thus open the field of helical and chiral nonlinear phononics, representing a selective handle for ultrafast control of spins, topology and chiral quasi-particles.</description>

      <title>ARES-Phonon: Phonon Calculation Package using Nondiagonal Supercell Finite Displacement Method with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a phonon calculation software based on the supercell finite displacement method: ARES-Phonon. It can perform phonon and related property calculations using either non-diagonal or diagonal supercell approaches. Particularly for the non-diagonal supercell method, for phonons with wave vectors $(\frac{n_1}{m_1},\frac{n_2}{m_2},\frac{n_3}{m_3})$, only a non-diagonal supercell of size equal to the least common multiple of $m_1 m_2 m_3$ needs to be constructed, significantly reducing the computational burden. We have tested this method on Diamond, $MoS_2$, and $Si_3O_6$ systems, and the results indicate that this approach can achieve the same level of accuracy as density functional perturbation theory. Speed tests were conducted for systems of different sizes, varying symmetries, and sampling densities of Brillouin zone \textbf{\textit{q}} points, showing that compared to the diagonal supercell method, the non-diagonal approach is approximately an order of magnitude faster and becomes even more efficient with increasing system complexity. Combining this method with machine learning potentials based on synchronous learning techniques, a further reduction of approximately $90\%$ in computational cost can be achieved while maintaining reliable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous flexoelectricity in cubic lead-halide perovskite MAPbBr$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead-halide perovskites exhibit remarkable efficiency in photovoltaics, driven by exceptionally long carrier diffusion lengths and recombination times. Paradoxically, this performance persists even in defect-rich, solution-grown samples. Here, we use a suite of optical and charge transport measurements to reveal that key optoelectronic properties of perovskites arise from localized flexoelectric polarization confined to the interfaces between domains of spontaneous strain, present even in nominally cubic single crystals. This insight provides a microscopic link between structural composition and charge transport in these materials, reconciling conflicting prior observations and offering new design principles for perovskite-based solar cells.</description>

      <title>Large Thermal Hall Effect in MnPS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the thermal Hall effect can originate from magnons (magnon Hall effect), phonons (phonon Hall effect), or their combination (magnon-polaron Hall effect). The magnon-polaron Hall effect, first observed in Fe2Mo3O8, is particularly intriguing as its thermal Hall signal can be remarkably large. In this study, we explore the thermal Hall effect in MnPS3, an insulating antiferromagnetic material exhibiting a spin-flop transition and significant magnetoelastic coupling, making it a strong candidate for studying the thermal Hall effect originating from spin-lattice coupling. We report an exceptionally large thermal Hall angle down to 4 K and show that it cannot be accounted for by standard calculations based on the intrinsic magnon-polaron Berry curvature. Our findings provide an in-depth analysis of the role of the spin-flop transition in the thermal properties of MnPS3 and call for further theory development on magnon-phonon coupling and scattering to reveal their influence on transverse heat transport.</description>

      <title>Stability frontiers in the AM$_6$X$_6$ kagome metals: The LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Lu,Y) family and density-wave transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kagome motif is a versatile platform for condensed matter physics, hosting rich interactions between magnetic, electronic, and structural degrees of freedom. In recent years, the discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductors and structurally-derived bond density waves in FeGe and ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ have stoked the search for new kagome platforms broadly exhibiting density wave (DW) transitions. In this work, we evaluate the known AM$_6$X$_6$ chemistries and construct a stability diagram that summarizes the structural relationships between the $\approx$125 member family. Subsequently we introduce our discovery of the broader LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Nd,Sm,Gd-Tm,Lu,Y) family of kagome metals and an analogous DW transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. Our X-ray scattering measurements clearly indicate a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) ordering wave vector ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ superlattice) and diffuse scattering on half-integer $L$-planes. Our analysis of the structural data supports the ``rattling mode'' DW model proposed for ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and paints a detailed picture of the steric interactions between the rare-earth filler element and the host Nb-Sn kagome scaffolding. We also provide a broad survey of the magnetic properties within the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ members, revealing a number of complex antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions throughout the family. This work integrates our new LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ series of compounds into the broader AM$_6$X$_6$ family, providing new material platforms and forging a new route forward at the frontier of kagome metal research.</description>

      <title>Relative knot probabilities in confined lattice polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the relative knotting probabilities in a lattice model of ring polymers confined in a cavity. The model is of a lattice knot of size $n$ in the cubic lattice, confined to a cube of side-length $L$ and with volume $V=(L{+}1)^3$ sites. We use Monte Carlo algorithms to approximately enumerate the number of conformations of lattice knots in the confining cube. If $p_{n,L}(K)$ is the number of conformations of a lattice polygon of length $n$ and knot type $K$ in a cube of volume $L^3$, then the relative knotting probability of a lattice polygon to have knot type $K$, relative to the probability that the polygon is the unknot (the trivial knot, denoted by $0_1$), is $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1) = p_{n,L}(K)/p_{n,L}(0_1)$. We determine $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1)$ for various knot types $K$ up to six crossing knots. Our data show that these relative knotting probabilities are small so that the model is dominated by lattice polygons of knot type the unknot. Moreover, if the concentration of the monomers of the lattice knot is $\varphi = n/V$, then the relative knot probability increases with $\varphi$ along a curve that flattens as the Hamiltonian state is approached.</description>
