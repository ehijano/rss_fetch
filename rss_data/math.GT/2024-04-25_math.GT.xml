      <title>The quasi-isometry invariance of the Coset Intersection Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$ consisting of a finitely generated group and finite collection of subgroups, we introduce a simplicial $G$-complex $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ called the coset intersection complex. We prove that the quasi-isometry type and the homotopy type of $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ are quasi-isometric invariants of the group pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$. Classical properties of $\mathcal{P}$ in $G$ correspond to topological or geometric properties of $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$, such as having finite height, having finite width, being almost malnormal, admiting a malnormal core, or having thickness of order one. As applications, we obtain that a number of algebraic properties of $\mathcal{P}$ in $G$ are quasi-isometry invariants of the pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$. For a certain class of right-angled Artin groups and their maximal parabolic subgroups, we show that the complex $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ is quasi-isometric to the Deligne complex; in particular, it is hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Links and the Diaconis-Graham Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1977 Diaconis and Graham proved two inequalities relating different measures of disarray in permutations, and asked for a characterization of those permutations for which equality holds in one of these inequalities. Such a characterization was first given in 2013. Recently, another characterization was given by Woo, using a topological link in $\mathbb R^3$ that can be associated to the cycle diagram of a permutation. We show that Woo's characterization extends much further: for any permutation, the discrepancy in Diaconis and Graham's inequality is directly related to the Euler characteristic of the associated link. This connection provides a new proof of the original result of Diaconis and Graham. We also characterize permutations with a fixed discrepancy in terms of their associated links and find that the stabilized-interval-free permutations are precisely those whose associated links are nonsplit.</description>

      <title>Minimal volume entropy and fiber growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.04551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article deals with topological assumptions under which the minimal volume entropy of a closed manifold $M$, and more generally of a finite simplicial complex $X$, vanishes or is positive. These topological conditions are expressed in terms of the growth of the fundamental group of the fibers of maps from a given finite simplicial complex $X$ to lower dimensional simplicial complexes $P$. We also give examples of finite simplicial complexes with zero simplicial volume and arbitrarily large minimal volume entropy.</description>

      <title>On second eigenvalues of closed hyperbolic surfaces for large genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the second eigenvalues of closed hyperbolic surfaces for large genus. We show that for every closed hyperbolic surface $X_g$ of genus $g$ $(g\geq 3)$, up to uniform positive constants multiplications, the second eigenvalue $\lambda_2(X_g)$ of $X_g$ is greater than $\frac{\mathcal{L}_2(X_g)}{g^2}$ and less than $\mathcal{L}_2(X_g)$; moreover these two bounds are optimal as $g\to \infty$. Here $\mathcal{L}_2(X_g)$ is the shortest length of simple closed multi-geodesics separating $X_g$ into three components.
  Furthermore, we also investigate the quantity $\frac{\lambda_2(X_g)}{\mathcal{L}_2(X_g)}$ for random hyperbolic surfaces of large genus. We show that as $g\to \infty$, a generic hyperbolic surface $X_g$ has $\frac{\lambda_2(X_g)}{\mathcal{L}_2(X_g)}$ uniformly comparable to $\frac{1}{\ln(g)}$.</description>

      <title>Constructions of $q$-hyperbolic knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Dehn surgery methods to construct infinite families of hyperbolic knots in the 3-sphere satisfying a weak form of the Turaev--Viro invariants volume conjecture. The results have applications to a conjecture of Andersen, Masbaum, and Ueno about quantum representations of surface mapping class groups. We obtain an explicit family of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes acting on surfaces of any genus and with one boundary component that satisfy the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Multiplicities in the length spectrum and growth rate of Salem numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that mean multiplicities in the length spectrum of a non-compact arithmetic hyperbolic orbifold of dimension $n \ge 4$ have exponential growth rate $$ \langle g(L) \rangle \geqslant c \frac{e^{([n/2] - 1)L}}{L^{1 + \delta_{5, 7}(n) }}, $$ extending the analogous result for even dimensions of Belolipetsky, Lal\'in, Murillo and Thompson. Our proof is based on the study of (square-rootable) Salem numbers.
  As a counterpart, we also prove an asymptotic formula for the distribution of square-rootable Salem numbers by adapting the argument of G\"otze and Gusakova. It shows that one can not obtain a better estimate on mean multiplicities using our approach.</description>

Abstract: In 1974, Kaplinskaja classified all simplicial straight hyperbolic Coxeter prisms. In this paper, we determine precisely which of these prisms are properly quasi-arithmetic or arithmetic. We also present some observations regarding commensurability classes and systoles of the associated orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Generalized Morse Theory for Tubular Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04034v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a notion of Morse function and establish Morse theory-like theorems over offsets of any compact set in a Euclidean space at regular values of their distance function. Using non-smooth analysis and tools from geometric measure theory, we prove that the homotopy type of the sublevels sets of these Morse functions changes at a critical value by gluing exactly one cell around each critical point.</description>

      <title>Isolated regions of a link projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of regions of a link projection is said to be isolated if any pair of regions in the set share no crossings. The isolate-region number of a link projection is the maximum value of the cardinality of an isolated set of regions of the link projection. In this paper, all the link projections of isolate-region number one are determined. Also, estimations for welded unknotting number and combinatorial way to find the isolate-region number are discussed, and a formula of the generating function of isolated-region sets is given for the standard projections of $(2, n)$-torus links.</description>

      <title>Volume growth on manifolds with more than one end</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an open manifold $M$ and a function $v$ with bounded growth of derivative, there exists a Riemannian metric of bounded geometry on $M$ such that the volume growth function lies in the same growth class as $v$. This was proved by R. Grimaldi and P. Pansu with the proof focusing on the case of manifolds with a single end. We prove this in the case of manifolds with multiple ends and call the constructed metrics Grimaldi-Pansu metrics. We give uniform bounds for the volume growth function of these metrics in terms of the given bgd-function in the case of a certain class of manifolds which can be written as connected sums of a finite collection of closed and compact manifolds. We study the volume doubling condition and the Relatively Connected Annulus (R.C.A.) property of the Grimaldi-Pansu metrics, which play an important role in studying geometric analysis on manifolds with finitely many ends.</description>

      <title>Commensurated hyperbolic subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if H is a non-elementary hyperbolic commensurated subgroup of infinite index in a hyperbolic group G, then H is virtually a free product of hyperbolic surface groups and free groups. We prove that whenever a one-ended hyperbolic group H is a fiber of a non-trivial hyperbolic bundle then H virtually splits over a 2-ended subgroup.</description>
