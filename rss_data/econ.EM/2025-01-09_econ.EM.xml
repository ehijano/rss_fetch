      <title>Monthly GDP Growth Estimates for the U.S. States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a mixed frequency vector autoregressive (MF-VAR) model to produce nowcasts and historical estimates of monthly real state-level GDP for the 50 U.S. states, plus Washington DC, from 1964 through the present day. The MF-VAR model incorporates state and U.S. data at the monthly, quarterly, and annual frequencies. Temporal and cross-sectional constraints are imposed to ensure that the monthly state-level estimates are consistent with official estimates of quarterly GDP at the U.S. and state-levels. We illustrate the utility of the historical estimates in better understanding state business cycles and cross-state dependencies. We show how the model produces accurate nowcasts of state GDP three months ahead of the BEA's quarterly estimates, after conditioning on the latest estimates of U.S. GDP.</description>

      <title>Some models are useful, but for how long?: A decision theoretic approach to choosing when to refit large-scale prediction models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale prediction models using tools from artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) are increasingly common across a variety of industries and scientific domains. Despite their effectiveness, training AI and ML tools at scale can cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars (or more); and even after a model is trained, substantial resources must be invested to keep models up-to-date. This paper presents a decision-theoretic framework for deciding when to refit an AI/ML model when the goal is to perform unbiased statistical inference using partially AI/ML-generated data. Drawing on portfolio optimization theory, we treat the decision of {\it recalibrating} a model or statistical inference versus {\it refitting} the model as a choice between ``investing'' in one of two ``assets.'' One asset, recalibrating the model based on another model, is quick and relatively inexpensive but bears uncertainty from sampling and may not be robust to model drift. The other asset, {\it refitting} the model, is costly but removes the drift concern (though not statistical uncertainty from sampling). We present a framework for balancing these two potential investments while preserving statistical validity. We evaluate the framework using simulation and data on electricity usage and predicting flu trends.</description>
