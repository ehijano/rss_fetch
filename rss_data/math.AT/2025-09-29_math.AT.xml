      <title>On the attaching map of the 3-cell skeleton of the homotopy fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localize spaces at 2. Let $f\in\pi_{n+k}(S^{n})$, ($n\geq2$ and $k\geq0$) and let $F$ be the homotopy fibre of the pinch map $\Sigma C_{f}=S^{n+1}\cup e^{n+k+2} \rightarrow S^{n+k+2}$, (in the case $k=0$, further assume $\Sigma C_{f}\not\Simeq*$). As a type of Gray's relative James constructions, it is known that $ F$ has a CW decomposition $F=(S^{n+1}\cup_{\af} e^{2n+k+2})\cup_{\beta} e^{3n+2k+3}\cup \cdots$, where $\af=[1_{S^{n+1}},\s f]\in\pi_{n+k+1}(S^{n})$ is the Whitehead product and $\beta$ is a higher Whitehead product. However, higher Whitehead products are hard to control in general. In this paper, by use of Selick-Wu's $A^{\text{min}}$-theory together with the machinery of Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequences, we show that in the 2-local case, the attaching map $\beta\in \pi_{3n+2k+2}(S^{n+1}\cup_{\af} e^{2n+k+2})$ is decomposed to be $\s^{2n+k+2}f$ composing with certain inclusion map. By this, we are able to calculate the higher unstable homotopy groups $\pi_{*}(\Sigma C_{f})$ by the homoptopy fibration $F\rightarrow \Sigma C_{f} \rightarrow S^{n+k+2}$ in the range requiring the 3-cell skeleton of $F$ if the involved homotopy groups of spheres are known. As an application, we determine the homotopy group $\pi_{18}(\Sigma^{3}\mathbb{C}P^{2}),$ a higher unstable homotopy group.</description>

      <title>Models for rational $(\infty, 1)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce rational $(\infty, 1)$-categories, which are $(\infty, 1)$-categories enriched in spaces whose higher homotopy groups are rational vector spaces. We provide two models for rational $(\infty, 1)$-categories, rational complete Segal spaces and rational Segal categories, and we show that they are equivalent.</description>

      <title>The Morita $(\infty,2)$-category of a monoidal category as a $2$-complicial set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an explicit and elementary construction of the Morita $(\infty,2)$-category of a monoidal category which satisfies minimal conditions. We construct it as a $3$-coskeletal $2$-complicial set, in which the vertices encode the monoids, the edges encode the bimodules, the triangles encode the bimodule maps out of a balanced tensor product, and tetrahedra encode composition of bimodule maps. The marked edges encode invertible bimodules, and the marked triangles encode bimodule isomorphisms with a balanced tensor product.</description>

      <title>Open-closed maps and spectral local systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a graded Liouville domain. Fix a pair of infinite loop spaces $\Psi = (\Theta \to \Phi)$ living over $(BO \to BU)$. This determines a spectral Fukaya category $\mathcal{F}(X;\Psi)$ whenever $TX$ lifts to $\Phi$, containing closed exact Lagrangians $L$ for which $TL$ lifts compatibly to $\Theta$; and by Bott periodicity and index theory, a Thom spectrum $R$ with bordism theory $R_*$.
  This paper has two main goals: we incorporate rank one spectral local systems $\xi: L \to BGL_1(R)$ into the spectral category; and we prove that the bordism class $[(L,\xi)]$ defined by the open-closed map differs from the class $[L]$ by a multiplicative two-torsion element in $R^0(L)^{\times}$ determined by an action of the stable homotopy class of the Hopf map $\eta \in \pi_1^{st}$ on $\xi$. Methods include a twisting construction associating flow categories to spectral local systems, and a model for the open-closed map incorporating Schlichtkrull's construction of the trace map $BGL_1(R) \subseteq K(R) \to R$.
  The companion paper \cite{PS4} shows that (for Lagrangians which themselves admit spectral lifts) one can lift quasi-isomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\Psi$ at the cost of introducing rank one local systems. Together with the open-closed computation given here, this gives an essentially complete picture of the bordism-theoretic consequences of quasi-isomorphism in the classical exact Fukaya category.</description>

      <title>Bordism from quasi-isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a graded Liouville domain. Fix a pair of infinite loop spaces $\Psi = (\Theta \to \Phi)$ living over $(BO \to BU)$. This determines a spectral Fukaya category $\mathcal{F}(X;\Psi)$ whenever $TX$ lifts to $\Phi$, containing closed exact Lagrangians $L$ for which $TL$ lifts compatibly to $\Theta$; and by Bott periodicity and index theory, a Thom spectrum $R$ with bordism theory $R_*$.
  Suppose that $L$ and $K$ are quasi-isomorphic in the Fukaya category over $\mathbb{Z}$. We prove that:
  (a) if both lift to $\mathcal{F}(X;\Psi)$, then there is a rank one $R$-local system $\xi: L \to BGL_1(R)$ over $L$ so that $(L,\xi)$ and $K$ are quasi-isomorphic in the spectral Fukaya category;
  (b) when $X$ is polarised and $\Psi = (BO \times F \to BO)$, if only $K$ lifts to $\mathcal{F}(X;\Psi)$, then the composition $L \to B^2GL_1(R)$ of the stable Gauss map of $L$ and the delooped $J$-homomorphism is nullhomotopic.
  Combined with the computation of the open-closed fundamental class associated to $(L,\xi)$ in \cite{PS3}, these results have applications to bordism and stable homotopy types of quasi-isomorphic Lagrangians, to Hamiltonian monodromy groups, and to smooth structures on nearby Lagrangians.
  A key ingredient in the proofs is a new form of obstruction theory for flow categories `lying over' a manifold $L$, closely related to a `spectral Viterbo restriction functor' also introduced here.</description>

      <title>Normalisers of parabolic subgroups of Artin--Tits groups and Tits cone intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Coxeter diagram and let $J \subseteq \Gamma$. Motivated by 3-fold flops, Iyama and Wemyss study the hyperplane arrangement in the Tits cone intersection of $J$, which is a $J$-relative generalisation of the classical Coxeter arrangement. For $\Gamma$ of finite-type, we show that its complexified hyperplane complement is a $K(\pi,1)$ space for the normaliser (quotient) of the standard parabolic subgroup of the Artin--Tits group attached to $J$. For general $\Gamma$ we show that Brink--Howlett's groupoid, which describes normalisers of parabolic subgroups of Coxeter groups, has its universal cover described by the wall-and-chamber structure of the Tits cone intersection. We use this to show that wall crossing sequences satisfy an "atomic Matsumoto relation", generalising a theorem of Ko and answering questions raised by Iyama and Wemyss.</description>

      <title>Symmetric monoidal extensions and graph cobordisms between finite sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathcal{C}$ and a space $X$, we address the problem of explicitly describing the symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category freely obtained from $\mathcal{C}$ by adjoining $X$ new $n$-morphisms with prescribed sources and targets. We develop an apparatus of tools that allow one to detect in concrete situations such a free symmetric monoidal extension. As motivating application, we introduce a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,2)$-category ${\mathbb{G}\mathrm{r}}$ of graph cobordisms between finite sets, following classical constructions of Gersten, Culler--Vogtmann and Hatcher--Vogtmann, and we exhibit it as an extension of the symmetric monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathrm{Fin}$ of finite sets, obtained by freely adjoining a specific list of new 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms. We recover results of Barkan--Steinebrunner and of Galatius.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Verbose Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The persistence diagram is a central object in the study of persistent homology and has also been investigated in the context of random topology. The more recent notion of the verbose diagram (a.k.a. verbose barcode) is a refinement of the persistence diagram. Whereas the persistence diagram is a complete invariant of persistent homology, the verbose persistence diagram is a complete invariant of the one-level higher object -- a filtered chain complex. It therefore strictly contains the persistence diagram, both in form and in the amount of information it encodes. Concretely, the verbose diagram incorporates ephemeral features that arise in a filtered topological space, representing them as additional points along the diagonal.
  In this work, we initiate the study of random verbose diagrams. We establish a strong law of large numbers for verbose diagrams as a random point cloud grows in size -- that is, we prove the existence of a limiting verbose diagram, viewed as a measure on the half-plane on and above the diagonal. Also, we characterize its support and compute its total mass. Along the way, we extend the notion of the persistent Betti number, reveal the relation between this extended notion and the verbose diagram (which is an extension of the fundamental lemma of persistent homology), and establish results on the asymptotic behavior of the extended persistent Betti numbers.
  This work extends the main results of the work by Hiraoka, Shirai, and Trinh and its sequel by Shirai and Suzaki to the setting of verbose diagrams.</description>

      <title>BV bialgebra structures in Floer theory and string topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the notions of BV unital infinitesimal bialgebra and BV Frobenius algebra from the topology of suitable compactifications of moduli spaces of decorated genus 0 curves. We construct these structures respectively on reduced symplectic homology and Rabinowitz Floer homology. As an application, we construct these structures in nonequivariant string topology. We also show how the Lie bialgebra structure in equivariant string topology, and more generally on $S^1$-equivariant symplectic homology, is obtained as a formal consequence.</description>
