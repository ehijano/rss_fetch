      <title>Suboptimal Shapley Value Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated strong capacity in supporting a wide variety of applications. Shapley value has emerged as a prominent tool to analyze feature importance to help people understand the inference process of deep neural models. Computing Shapley value function requires choosing a baseline to represent feature's missingness. However, existing random and conditional baselines could negatively influence the explanation. In this paper, by analyzing the suboptimality of different baselines, we identify the problematic baseline where the asymmetric interaction between $\bm{x}'_i$ (the replacement of the faithful influential feature) and other features has significant directional bias toward the model's output, and conclude that $p(y|\bm{x}'_i) = p(y)$ potentially minimizes the asymmetric interaction involving $\bm{x}'_i$. We further generalize the uninformativeness of $\bm{x}'_i$ toward the label space $L$ to avoid estimating $p(y)$ and design a simple uncertainty-based reweighting mechanism to accelerate the computation process. We conduct experiments on various NLP tasks and our quantitative analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty-based reweighting mechanism. Furthermore, by measuring the consistency of explanations generated by explainable methods and human, we highlight the disparity between model inference and human understanding.</description>

      <title>The Majority Vote Paradigm Shift: When Popular Meets Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliably labelling data typically requires annotations from multiple human workers. However, humans are far from being perfect. Hence, it is a common practice to aggregate labels gathered from multiple annotators to make a more confident estimate of the true label. Among many aggregation methods, the simple and well known Majority Vote (MV) selects the class label polling the highest number of votes. However, despite its importance, the optimality of MV's label aggregation has not been extensively studied. We address this gap in our work by characterising the conditions under which MV achieves the theoretically optimal lower bound on label estimation error. Our results capture the tolerable limits on annotation noise under which MV can optimally recover labels for a given class distribution. This certificate of optimality provides a more principled approach to model selection for label aggregation as an alternative to otherwise inefficient practices that sometimes include higher experts, gold labels, etc., that are all marred by the same human uncertainty despite huge time and monetary costs. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kernel Inducing Points by Duality Gap for Dataset Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Duality Gap KIP (DGKIP), an extension of the Kernel Inducing Points (KIP) method for dataset distillation. While existing dataset distillation methods often rely on bi-level optimization, DGKIP eliminates the need for such optimization by leveraging duality theory in convex programming. The KIP method has been introduced as a way to avoid bi-level optimization; however, it is limited to the squared loss and does not support other loss functions (e.g., cross-entropy or hinge loss) that are more suitable for classification tasks. DGKIP addresses this limitation by exploiting an upper bound on parameter changes after dataset distillation using the duality gap, enabling its application to a wider range of loss functions. We also characterize theoretical properties of DGKIP by providing upper bounds on the test error and prediction consistency after dataset distillation. Experimental results on standard benchmarks such as MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that DGKIP retains the efficiency of KIP while offering broader applicability and robust performance.</description>

      <title>Federated Variational Inference for Bayesian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a federated learning approach for Bayesian model-based clustering of large-scale binary and categorical datasets. We introduce a principled 'divide and conquer' inference procedure using variational inference with local merge and delete moves within batches of the data in parallel, followed by 'global' merge moves across batches to find global clustering structures. We show that these merge moves require only summaries of the data in each batch, enabling federated learning across local nodes without requiring the full dataset to be shared. Empirical results on simulated and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method performs well in comparison to existing clustering algorithms. We validate the practical utility of the method by applying it to large scale electronic health record (EHR) data.</description>

      <title>Green LIME: Improving AI Explainability through Design of Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI), the complexity of many models and processes often surpasses human interpretability, making it challenging to understand why a specific prediction is made. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic in critical fields like healthcare, where trust in a model's predictions is paramount. As a result, the explainability of machine learning (ML) and other complex models has become a key area of focus. Efforts to improve model interpretability often involve experimenting with AI systems and approximating their behavior through simpler mechanisms. However, these procedures can be resource-intensive. Optimal design of experiments, which seeks to maximize the information obtained from a limited number of observations, offers promising methods for improving the efficiency of these explainability techniques.
  To demonstrate this potential, we explore Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), a widely used method introduced by Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin, 2016. LIME provides explanations by generating new data points near the instance of interest and passing them through the model. While effective, this process can be computationally expensive, especially when predictions are costly or require many samples. LIME is highly versatile and can be applied to a wide range of models and datasets. In this work, we focus on models involving tabular data, regression tasks, and linear models as interpretable local approximations.
  By utilizing optimal design of experiments' techniques, we reduce the number of function evaluations of the complex model, thereby reducing the computational effort of LIME by a significant amount. We consider this modified version of LIME to be energy-efficient or "green".</description>

      <title>Composition and Control with Distilled Energy Diffusion Models and Sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models may be formulated as a time-indexed sequence of energy-based models, where the score corresponds to the negative gradient of an energy function. As opposed to learning the score directly, an energy parameterization is attractive as the energy itself can be used to control generation via Monte Carlo samplers. Architectural constraints and training instability in energy parameterized models have so far yielded inferior performance compared to directly approximating the score or denoiser. We address these deficiencies by introducing a novel training regime for the energy function through distillation of pre-trained diffusion models, resembling a Helmholtz decomposition of the score vector field. We further showcase the synergies between energy and score by casting the diffusion sampling procedure as a Feynman Kac model where sampling is controlled using potentials from the learnt energy functions. The Feynman Kac model formalism enables composition and low temperature sampling through sequential Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Anomaly Detection through Mass Repulsing Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in datasets is a longstanding problem in machine learning. In this context, anomalies are defined as a sample that significantly deviates from the remaining data. Meanwhile, optimal transport (OT) is a field of mathematics concerned with the transportation, between two probability measures, at least effort. In classical OT, the optimal transportation strategy of a measure to itself is the identity. In this paper, we tackle anomaly detection by forcing samples to displace its mass, while keeping the least effort objective. We call this new transportation problem Mass Repulsing Optimal Transport (MROT). Naturally, samples lying in low density regions of space will be forced to displace mass very far, incurring a higher transportation cost. We use these concepts to design a new anomaly score. Through a series of experiments in existing benchmarks, and fault detection problems, we show that our algorithm improves over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Time-series attribution maps with regularized contrastive learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-based attribution methods aim to explain decisions of deep learning models but so far lack identifiability guarantees. Here, we propose a method to generate attribution maps with identifiability guarantees by developing a regularized contrastive learning algorithm trained on time-series data plus a new attribution method called Inverted Neuron Gradient (collectively named xCEBRA). We show theoretically that xCEBRA has favorable properties for identifying the Jacobian matrix of the data generating process. Empirically, we demonstrate robust approximation of zero vs. non-zero entries in the ground-truth attribution map on synthetic datasets, and significant improvements across previous attribution methods based on feature ablation, Shapley values, and other gradient-based methods. Our work constitutes a first example of identifiable inference of time-series attribution maps and opens avenues to a better understanding of time-series data, such as for neural dynamics and decision-processes within neural networks.</description>

      <title>Statistically Significant $k$NNAD by Selective Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised anomaly detection using the k-Nearest Neighbor method. The k-Nearest Neighbor Anomaly Detection (kNNAD) is a simple yet effective approach for identifying anomalies across various domains and fields. A critical challenge in anomaly detection, including kNNAD, is appropriately quantifying the reliability of detected anomalies. To address this, we formulate kNNAD as a statistical hypothesis test and quantify the probability of false detection using $p$-values. The main technical challenge lies in performing both anomaly detection and statistical testing on the same data, which hinders correct $p$-value calculation within the conventional statistical testing framework. To resolve this issue, we introduce a statistical hypothesis testing framework called Selective Inference (SI) and propose a method named Statistically Significant NNAD (Stat-kNNAD). By leveraging SI, the Stat-kNNAD method ensures that detected anomalies are statistically significant with theoretical guarantees. The proposed Stat-kNNAD method is applicable to anomaly detection in both the original feature space and latent feature spaces derived from deep learning models. Through numerical experiments on synthetic data and applications to industrial product anomaly detection, we demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the Stat-kNNAD method.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Optimism of Random-Design Linear and Kernel Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derived the closed-form asymptotic optimism of linear regression models under random designs, and generalizes it to kernel ridge regression. Using scaled asymptotic optimism as a generic predictive model complexity measure, we studied the fundamental different behaviors of linear regression model, tangent kernel (NTK) regression model and three-layer fully connected neural networks (NN). Our contribution is two-fold: we provided theoretical ground for using scaled optimism as a model predictive complexity measure; and we show empirically that NN with ReLUs behaves differently from kernel models under this measure. With resampling techniques, we can also compute the optimism for regression models with real data.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Ratio Regularized Quantile Regression: Adapting Conformal Prediction to High-Dimensional Covariate Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of conformal prediction under covariate shift. Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted target domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal coverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the unknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce the likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which combines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to construct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown likelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired level in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our proofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning theory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms existing methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression task for the Communities and Crime dataset, and an image classification task from the WILDS repository.</description>

Abstract: Estimating Mutual Information (MI), a key measure of dependence of random quantities without specific modelling assumptions, is a challenging problem in high dimensions. We propose a novel mutual information estimator based on parametrizing conditional densities using normalizing flows, a deep generative model that has gained popularity in recent years. This estimator leverages a block autoregressive structure to achieve improved bias-variance trade-offs on standard benchmark tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09609v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Score-of-Mixture Training (SMT), a novel framework for training one-step generative models by minimizing a class of divergences called the $\alpha$-skew Jensen-Shannon divergence. At its core, SMT estimates the score of mixture distributions between real and fake samples across multiple noise levels. Similar to consistency models, our approach supports both training from scratch (SMT) and distillation using a pretrained diffusion model, which we call Score-of-Mixture Distillation (SMD). It is simple to implement, requires minimal hyperparameter tuning, and ensures stable training. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64x64 show that SMT/SMD are competitive with and can even outperform existing methods.</description>

      <title>Hallucinations are inevitable but statistically negligible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations, a phenomenon where a language model (LM) generates nonfactual content, pose a significant challenge to the practical deployment of LMs. While many empirical methods have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations, a recent study established a computability-theoretic result showing that any LM will inevitably generate hallucinations on an infinite set of inputs, regardless of the quality and quantity of training datasets and the choice of the language model architecture and training and inference algorithms. Although the computability-theoretic result may seem pessimistic, its significance in practical viewpoints has remained unclear. In contrast, we present a positive theoretical result from a probabilistic perspective. Specifically, we prove that hallucinations can be made statistically negligible, provided that the quality and quantity of the training data are sufficient. Interestingly, our positive result coexists with the computability-theoretic result, implying that while hallucinations on an infinite set of inputs cannot be entirely eliminated, their probability can always be reduced by improving algorithms and training data. By evaluating the two seemingly contradictory results through the lens of information theory, we argue that our probability-theoretic positive result better reflects practical considerations than the computability-theoretic negative result.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Rank-One Quasi-Newton Methods for Deep Learning Using Cubic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent and other first-order variants, such as Adam and AdaGrad, are commonly used in the field of deep learning due to their computational efficiency and low-storage memory requirements. However, these methods do not exploit curvature information. Consequently, iterates can converge to saddle points or poor local minima. On the other hand, Quasi-Newton methods compute Hessian approximations which exploit this information with a comparable computational budget. Quasi-Newton methods re-use previously computed iterates and gradients to compute a low-rank structured update. The most widely used quasi-Newton update is the L-BFGS, which guarantees a positive semi-definite Hessian approximation, making it suitable in a line search setting. However, the loss functions in DNNs are non-convex, where the Hessian is potentially non-positive definite. In this paper, we propose using a limited-memory symmetric rank-one quasi-Newton approach which allows for indefinite Hessian approximations, enabling directions of negative curvature to be exploited. Furthermore, we use a modified adaptive regularized cubics approach, which generates a sequence of cubic subproblems that have closed-form solutions with suitable regularization choices. We investigate the performance of our proposed method on autoencoders and feed-forward neural network models and compare our approach to state-of-the-art first-order adaptive stochastic methods as well as other quasi-Newton methods.x</description>

      <title>Adversarial Debiasing for Unbiased Parameter Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in machine learning and the increasing availability of high-dimensional data have led to the proliferation of social science research that uses the predictions of machine learning models as proxies for measures of human activity or environmental outcomes. However, prediction errors from machine learning models can lead to bias in the estimates of regression coefficients. In this paper, we show how this bias can arise, propose a test for detecting bias, and demonstrate the use of an adversarial machine learning algorithm in order to de-bias predictions. These methods are applicable to any setting where machine-learned predictions are the dependent variable in a regression. We conduct simulations and empirical exercises using ground truth and satellite data on forest cover in Africa. Using the predictions from a naive machine learning model leads to biased parameter estimates, while the predictions from the adversarial model recover the true coefficients.</description>

      <title>Stability Bounds for Smooth Optimal Transport Maps and their Statistical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study estimators of the optimal transport (OT) map between two probability distributions. We focus on plugin estimators derived from the OT map between estimates of the underlying distributions. We develop novel stability bounds for OT maps which generalize those in past work, and allow us to reduce the problem of optimally estimating the transport map to that of optimally estimating densities in the Wasserstein distance. In contrast, past work provided a partial connection between these problems and relied on regularity theory for the Monge-Ampere equation to bridge the gap, a step which required unnatural assumptions to obtain sharp guarantees. We also provide some new insights into the connections between stability bounds which arise in the analysis of plugin estimators and growth bounds for the semi-dual functional which arise in the analysis of Brenier potential-based estimators of the transport map. We illustrate the applicability of our new stability bounds by revisiting the smooth setting studied by Manole et al., analyzing two of their estimators under more general conditions. Critically, our bounds do not require smoothness or boundedness assumptions on the underlying measures. As an illustrative application, we develop and analyze a novel tuning parameter-free estimator for the OT map between two strongly log-concave distributions.</description>

      <title>A Novel Unified Parametric Assumption for Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonconvex optimization is central to modern machine learning, but the general framework of nonconvex optimization yields weak convergence guarantees that are too pessimistic compared to practice. On the other hand, while convexity enables efficient optimization, it is of limited applicability to many practical problems. To bridge this gap and better understand the practical success of optimization algorithms in nonconvex settings, we introduce a novel unified parametric assumption. Our assumption is general enough to encompass a broad class of nonconvex functions while also being specific enough to enable the derivation of a unified convergence theorem for gradient-based methods. Notably, by tuning the parameters of our assumption, we demonstrate its versatility in recovering several existing function classes as special cases and in identifying functions amenable to efficient optimization. We derive our convergence theorem for both deterministic and stochastic optimization, and conduct experiments to verify that our assumption can hold practically over optimization trajectories.</description>

      <title>A Pathwise Coordinate Descent Algorithm for LASSO Penalized Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\ell_1$ penalized quantile regression is used in many fields as an alternative to penalized least squares regressions for high-dimensional data analysis. Existing algorithms for penalized quantile regression either use linear programming, which does not scale well in high dimension, or an approximate coordinate descent (CD) which does not solve for exact coordinatewise minimum of the nonsmooth loss function. Further, neither approaches build fast, pathwise algorithms commonly used in high-dimensional statistics to leverage sparsity structure of the problem in large-scale data sets. To avoid the computational challenges associated with the nonsmooth quantile loss, some recent works have even advocated using smooth approximations to the exact problem. In this work, we develop a fast, pathwise coordinate descent algorithm to compute exact $\ell_1$ penalized quantile regression estimates for high-dimensional data. We derive an easy-to-compute exact solution for the coordinatewise nonsmooth loss minimization, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported in the literature. We also employ a random perturbation strategy to help the algorithm avoid getting stuck along the regularization path. In simulated data sets, we show that our algorithm runs substantially faster than existing alternatives based on approximate CD and linear program, while retaining the same level of estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Time Series Treatment Effects Analysis with Always-Missing Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating treatment effects in time series data presents a significant challenge, especially when the control group is always unobservable. For example, in analyzing the effects of Christmas on retail sales, we lack direct observation of what would have occurred in late December without the Christmas impact. To address this, we try to recover the control group in the event period while accounting for confounders and temporal dependencies. Experimental results on the M5 Walmart retail sales data demonstrate robust estimation of the potential outcome of the control group as well as accurate predicted holiday effect. Furthermore, we provided theoretical guarantees for the estimated treatment effect, proving its consistency and asymptotic normality. The proposed methodology is applicable not only to this always-missing control scenario but also in other conventional time series causal inference settings.</description>

      <title>Computational Safety for Generative AI: A Signal Processing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI safety is a rapidly growing area of research that seeks to prevent the harm and misuse of frontier AI technology, particularly with respect to generative AI (GenAI) tools that are capable of creating realistic and high-quality content through text prompts. Examples of such tools include large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. As the performance of various leading GenAI models approaches saturation due to similar training data sources and neural network architecture designs, the development of reliable safety guardrails has become a key differentiator for responsibility and sustainability. This paper presents a formalization of the concept of computational safety, which is a mathematical framework that enables the quantitative assessment, formulation, and study of safety challenges in GenAI through the lens of signal processing theory and methods. In particular, we explore two exemplary categories of computational safety challenges in GenAI that can be formulated as hypothesis testing problems. For the safety of model input, we show how sensitivity analysis and loss landscape analysis can be used to detect malicious prompts with jailbreak attempts. For the safety of model output, we elucidate how statistical signal processing and adversarial learning can be used to detect AI-generated content. Finally, we discuss key open research challenges, opportunities, and the essential role of signal processing in computational AI safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of causality is critical for navigating and operating within today's complex real-world systems. The absence of realistic causal models with known data generating processes complicates fair benchmarking. In this paper, we present the CausalMan simulator, modeled after a real-world production line. The simulator features a diverse range of linear and non-linear mechanisms and challenging-to-predict behaviors, such as discrete mode changes. We demonstrate the inadequacy of many state-of-the-art approaches and analyze the significant differences in their performance and tractability, both in terms of runtime and memory complexity. As a contribution, we will release the CausalMan large-scale simulator. We present two derived datasets, and perform an extensive evaluation of both.</description>

      <title>Portable Reward Tuning: Towards Reusable Fine-Tuning across Different Pretrained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While foundation models have been exploited for various expert tasks through fine-tuning, any foundation model will become outdated due to its old knowledge or limited capability. Thus the underlying foundation model should be eventually replaced by new ones, which leads to repeated cost of fine-tuning these new models. Existing work addresses this problem by inference-time tuning, i.e., modifying the output probabilities from the new foundation model with the outputs from the old foundation model and its fine-tuned model, which involves an additional overhead in inference by the latter two models. In this paper, we propose a new fine-tuning principle, Portable Reward Tuning (PRT), that reduces the inference overhead by its nature, based on the reformulation of fine-tuning as the reward maximization. Specifically, instead of fine-tuning parameters of the foundation models, PRT trains the reward model explicitly through the same loss function as in fine-tuning. During inference, the reward model can be used with any foundation model (with the same set of vocabularies or labels) through the formulation of reward maximization. Experimental results, covering both vision and language models, demonstrate that the PRT-trained model can achieve comparable accuracy to the existing work of inference-time tuning, with less inference cost.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Online Adaption for Time Series Foundation Model Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a promising approach for time series forecasting. While effective, FMs typically remain fixed during deployment due to the high computational costs of learning them online. Consequently, deployed FMs fail to adapt their forecasts to current data characteristics, despite the availability of online feedback from newly arriving data. This raises the question of whether FM performance can be enhanced by the efficient usage of this feedback. We propose AdapTS to answer this question.
  AdapTS is a lightweight mechanism for the online adaption of FM forecasts in response to online feedback. AdapTS consists of two parts: a) the AdapTS-Forecaster which is used to learn the current data distribution; and b) the AdapTS-Weighter which is used to combine the forecasts of the FM and the AdapTS-Forecaster. We evaluate the performance of AdapTS in conjunction with several recent FMs across a suite of standard time series datasets. In all of our experiments we find that using AdapTS improves performance. This work demonstrates how efficient usage of online feedback can be used to improve FM forecasts.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning Under Density Shift in Incremental Settings Using Cram\'er-Rao-Based Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous surge in data volume and velocity is often dealt with using data orchestration and distributed processing approaches, abstracting away the machine learning challenges that exist at the algorithmic level. With growing interest in automating the learning loop, training with data that arrive in a sequence rather than in the classical in-memory training data form will face a machine learning challenge because of evolving feature distributions across batches of training data biasing the cross-validation step (\cite{sugiyama2012machine}). This work takes a distributed density estimation angle to the problem where data are temporally distributed. It processes data in batches and allows a neural network to treat a batch as training data. The method accumulates knowledge about the data density via posterior probability absorption using the Fisher Information Matrix, which contains information about the local optimization gradients for the batch. This is then used as a regularizer for the loss in the following batch, and therefore the density estimate for the entire dataset constructively gets more robust to the non-iid distribution shift. This needs the presence of a pair of batches in memory at a time, so the space cost is not a function of the size of the complete, distributed dataset. We proposed a novel regularization-based approach Covariate Shift Correction $C^{2}A$ that leverages Fisher information and Kullback-Leibler divergence to adapt to both natural and sequential covariate shift caused by dataset fragmentation. $C^{2}A$ achieves $19\%$ accuracy at maximum against state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the problem of private learning in generalized linear contextual bandits. Our approach is based on a novel method of re-weighted regression, yielding an efficient algorithm with regret of order $\sqrt{T}+\frac{1}{\alpha}$ and $\sqrt{T}/\alpha$ in the joint and local model of $\alpha$-privacy, respectively. Further, we provide near-optimal private procedures that achieve dimension-independent rates in private linear models and linear contextual bandits. In particular, our results imply that joint privacy is almost "for free" in all the settings we consider, partially addressing the open problem posed by Azize and Basu (2024).</description>

      <title>Learning to Defer for Causal Discovery with Imperfect Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating expert knowledge, e.g. from large language models, into causal discovery algorithms can be challenging when the knowledge is not guaranteed to be correct. Expert recommendations may contradict data-driven results, and their reliability can vary significantly depending on the domain or specific query. Existing methods based on soft constraints or inconsistencies in predicted causal relationships fail to account for these variations in expertise. To remedy this, we propose L2D-CD, a method for gauging the correctness of expert recommendations and optimally combining them with data-driven causal discovery results. By adapting learning-to-defer (L2D) algorithms for pairwise causal discovery (CD), we learn a deferral function that selects whether to rely on classical causal discovery methods using numerical data or expert recommendations based on textual meta-data. We evaluate L2D-CD on the canonical T\"ubingen pairs dataset and demonstrate its superior performance compared to both the causal discovery method and the expert used in isolation. Moreover, our approach identifies domains where the expert's performance is strong or weak. Finally, we outline a strategy for generalizing this approach to causal discovery on graphs with more than two variables, paving the way for further research in this area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider gradient-based optimisation of wide, shallow neural networks, where the output of each hidden node is scaled by a positive parameter. The scaling parameters are non-identical, differing from the classical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) parameterisation. We prove that for large such neural networks, with high probability, gradient flow and gradient descent converge to a global minimum and can learn features in some sense, unlike in the NTK parameterisation. We perform experiments illustrating our theoretical results and discuss the benefits of such scaling in terms of prunability and transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Invariant Subspace Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of predicting a response Y from a set of covariates X in settings where the conditional distribution of Y given X changes over time. For this to be feasible, assumptions on how the conditional distribution changes over time are required. Existing approaches assume, for example, that changes occur smoothly over time so that short-term prediction using only the recent past becomes feasible. To additionally exploit observations further in the past, we propose a novel invariance-based framework for linear conditionals, called Invariant Subspace Decomposition (ISD), that splits the conditional distribution into a time-invariant and a residual time-dependent component. As we show, this decomposition can be utilized both for zero-shot and time-adaptation prediction tasks, that is, settings where either no or a small amount of training data is available at the time points we want to predict Y at, respectively. We propose a practical estimation procedure, which automatically infers the decomposition using tools from approximate joint matrix diagonalization. Furthermore, we provide finite sample guarantees for the proposed estimator and demonstrate empirically that it indeed improves on approaches that do not use the additional invariant structure.</description>

      <title>ProDAG: Projection-Induced Variational Inference for Directed Acyclic Graphs</title>

Abstract: Directed acyclic graph (DAG) learning is a rapidly expanding field of research. Though the field has witnessed remarkable advances over the past few years, it remains statistically and computationally challenging to learn a single (point estimate) DAG from data, let alone provide uncertainty quantification. Our paper addresses the difficult task of quantifying graph uncertainty by developing a Bayesian variational inference framework based on novel distributions that have support directly on the space of DAGs. The distributions, which we use to form our prior and variational posterior, are induced by a projection operation, whereby an arbitrary continuous distribution is projected onto the space of sparse weighted acyclic adjacency matrices (matrix representations of DAGs) with probability mass on exact zeros. Though the projection constitutes a combinatorial optimization problem, it is solvable at scale via recently developed techniques that reformulate acyclicity as a continuous onstraint. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed method, ProDAG, can perform higher quality Bayesian inference than possible with existing state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

      <title>Satisficing Regret Minimization in Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the concept of satisficing in decision-making, we consider the problem of satisficing exploration in bandit optimization. In this setting, the learner aims at selecting satisficing arms (arms with mean reward exceeding a certain threshold value) as frequently as possible. The performance is measured by satisficing regret, which is the cumulative deficit of the chosen arm's mean reward compared to the threshold. We propose SELECT, a general algorithmic template for Satisficing REgret Minimization via SampLing and LowEr Confidence Bound Testing, that attains constant satisficing regret for a wide variety of bandit optimization problems in the realizable case (i.e., a satisficing arm exists). Specifically, given a class of bandit optimization problems and a corresponding learning oracle with sub-linear (standard) regret upper bound, SELECT iteratively makes use of the oracle to identify a potential satisficing arm with low regret. Then, it collects data samples from this arm, and continuously compares the LCB of the identified arm's mean reward against the threshold value to determine if it is a satisficing arm. As a complement, SELECT also enjoys the same (standard) regret guarantee as the oracle in the non-realizable case. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to validate the performance of SELECT for several popular bandit optimization settings.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Non-Convex Two-Stage Stochastic Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a sample-efficient method for solving expensive, black-box optimization problems. Stochastic programming concerns optimization under uncertainty where, typically, average performance is the quantity of interest. In the first stage of a two-stage problem, here-and-now decisions must be made in the face of uncertainty, while in the second stage, wait-and-see decisions are made after the uncertainty has been resolved. Many methods in stochastic programming assume that the objective is cheap to evaluate and linear or convex. We apply Bayesian optimization to solve non-convex, two-stage stochastic programs which are black-box and expensive to evaluate as, for example, is often the case with simulation objectives. We formulate a knowledge-gradient-based acquisition function to jointly optimize the first- and second-stage variables, establish a guarantee of asymptotic consistency, and provide a computationally efficient approximation. We demonstrate comparable empirical results to an alternative we formulate with fewer approximations, which alternates its focus between the two variable types, and superior empirical results over the state of the art and the standard, na\"ive, two-step benchmark.</description>

      <title>Selective Reviews of Bandit Problems in AI via a Statistical View</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a widely researched area in artificial intelligence that focuses on teaching agents decision-making through interactions with their environment. A key subset includes stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) and continuum-armed bandit (SCAB) problems, which model sequential decision-making under uncertainty. This review outlines the foundational models and assumptions of bandit problems, explores non-asymptotic theoretical tools like concentration inequalities and minimax regret bounds, and compares frequentist and Bayesian algorithms for managing exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Additionally, we explore K-armed contextual bandits and SCAB, focusing on their methodologies and regret analyses. We also examine the connections between SCAB problems and functional data analysis. Finally, we highlight recent advances and ongoing challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Coreset Selection under Covariate Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coreset selection, which involves selecting a small subset from an existing training dataset, is an approach to reducing training data, and various approaches have been proposed for this method. In practical situations where these methods are employed, it is often the case that the data distributions differ between the development phase and the deployment phase, with the latter being unknown. Thus, it is challenging to select an effective subset of training data that performs well across all deployment scenarios. We therefore propose Distributionally Robust Coreset Selection (DRCS). DRCS theoretically derives an estimate of the upper bound for the worst-case test error, assuming that the future covariate distribution may deviate within a defined range from the training distribution. Furthermore, by selecting instances in a way that suppresses the estimate of the upper bound for the worst-case test error, DRCS achieves distributionally robust training instance selection. This study is primarily applicable to convex training computation, but we demonstrate that it can also be applied to deep learning under appropriate approximations. In this paper, we focus on covariate shift, a type of data distribution shift, and demonstrate the effectiveness of DRCS through experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regression, the task of predicting a continuous scalar target y based on some features x is one of the most fundamental tasks in machine learning and statistics. It has been observed and theoretically analyzed that the classical approach, meansquared error minimization, can lead to suboptimal results when training neural networks. In this work, we propose a new method to improve the training of these models on regression tasks, with continuous scalar targets. Our method is based on casting this task in a different fashion, using a target encoder, and a prediction decoder, inspired by approaches in classification and clustering. We showcase the performance of our method on a wide range of real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for simulating conditioned diffusion processes (diffusion bridges) in Euclidean spaces. By training a neural network to approximate bridge dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for computationally intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods or reverse-process modeling. Compared to existing methods, it offers greater robustness across various diffusion specifications and conditioning scenarios. This applies in particular to rare events and multimodal distributions, which pose challenges for score-learning- and MCMC-based approaches. We propose a flexible variational family for approximating the diffusion bridge path measure which is partially specified by a neural network. Once trained, it enables efficient independent sampling at a cost comparable to sampling the unconditioned (forward) process.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference of Constrained Stochastic Optimization via Sketched Sequential Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13687v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider online statistical inference of constrained stochastic nonlinear optimization problems. We apply the Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (StoSQP) method to solve these problems, which can be regarded as applying second-order Newton's method to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In each iteration, the StoSQP method computes the Newton direction by solving a quadratic program, and then selects a proper adaptive stepsize $\bar{\alpha}_t$ to update the primal-dual iterate. To reduce dominant computational cost of the method, we inexactly solve the quadratic program in each iteration by employing an iterative sketching solver. Notably, the approximation error of the sketching solver need not vanish as iterations proceed, meaning that the per-iteration computational cost does not blow up. For the above StoSQP method, we show that under mild assumptions, the rescaled primal-dual sequence $1/\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}\cdot (x_t - x^\star, \lambda_t - \lambda^\star)$ converges to a mean-zero Gaussian distribution with a nontrivial covariance matrix depending on the underlying sketching distribution. To perform inference in practice, we also analyze a plug-in covariance matrix estimator. We illustrate the asymptotic normality result of the method both on benchmark nonlinear problems in CUTEst test set and on linearly/nonlinearly constrained regression problems.</description>

      <title>Natural Language-Based Synthetic Data Generation for Cluster Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14301v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster analysis relies on effective benchmarks for evaluating and comparing different algorithms. Simulation studies on synthetic data are popular because important features of the data sets, such as the overlap between clusters, or the variation in cluster shapes, can be effectively varied. Unfortunately, creating evaluation scenarios is often laborious, as practitioners must translate higher-level scenario descriptions like "clusters with very different shapes" into lower-level geometric parameters such as cluster centers, covariance matrices, etc. To make benchmarks more convenient and informative, we propose synthetic data generation based on direct specification of high-level scenarios, either through verbal descriptions or high-level geometric parameters. Our open-source Python package repliclust implements this workflow, making it easy to set up interpretable and reproducible benchmarks for cluster analysis. A demo of data generation from verbal inputs is available at https://demo.repliclust.org.</description>

      <title>G-Mapper: Learning a Cover in the Mapper Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06634v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mapper algorithm is a visualization technique in topological data analysis (TDA) that outputs a graph reflecting the structure of a given dataset. However, the Mapper algorithm requires tuning several parameters in order to generate a ``nice" Mapper graph. This paper focuses on selecting the cover parameter. We present an algorithm that optimizes the cover of a Mapper graph by splitting a cover repeatedly according to a statistical test for normality. Our algorithm is based on G-means clustering which searches for the optimal number of clusters in $k$-means by iteratively applying the Anderson-Darling test. Our splitting procedure employs a Gaussian mixture model to carefully choose the cover according to the distribution of the given data. Experiments for synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm generates covers so that the Mapper graphs retain the essence of the datasets, while also running significantly faster than a previous iterative method.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Categorical and Hierarchical Concepts in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis is the informal idea that semantic concepts are encoded as linear directions in the representation spaces of large language models (LLMs). Previous work has shown how to make this notion precise for representing binary concepts that have natural contrasts (e.g., {male, female}) as directions in representation space. However, many natural concepts do not have natural contrasts (e.g., whether the output is about an animal). In this work, we show how to extend the formalization of the linear representation hypothesis to represent features (e.g., is_animal) as vectors. This allows us to immediately formalize the representation of categorical concepts as polytopes in the representation space. Further, we use the formalization to prove a relationship between the hierarchical structure of concepts and the geometry of their representations. We validate these theoretical results on the Gemma and LLaMA-3 large language models, estimating representations for 900+ hierarchically related concepts using data from WordNet.</description>

      <title>ETGL-DDPG: A Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm for Sparse Reward Continuous Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) in the context of reinforcement learning with sparse rewards. To enhance exploration, we introduce a search procedure, \emph{${\epsilon}{t}$-greedy}, which generates exploratory options for exploring less-visited states. We prove that search using $\epsilon t$-greedy has polynomial sample complexity under mild MDP assumptions. To more efficiently use the information provided by rewarded transitions, we develop a new dual experience replay buffer framework, \emph{GDRB}, and implement \emph{longest n-step returns}. The resulting algorithm, \emph{ETGL-DDPG}, integrates all three techniques: \bm{$\epsilon t$}-greedy, \textbf{G}DRB, and \textbf{L}ongest $n$-step, into DDPG. We evaluate ETGL-DDPG on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that it outperforms DDPG, as well as other state-of-the-art methods, across all tested sparse-reward continuous environments. Ablation studies further highlight how each strategy individually enhances the performance of DDPG in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models excel in generative tasks but exhibit inefficiencies in structured text selection, particularly in extractive question answering. This challenge is magnified in resource-constrained environments, where deploying multiple specialized models for different tasks is impractical. We propose a Learning-to-Defer framework that allocates queries to specialized experts, ensuring high-confidence predictions while optimizing computational efficiency. Our approach integrates a principled allocation strategy with theoretical guarantees on optimal deferral that balances performance and cost. Empirical evaluations on SQuADv1, SQuADv2, and TriviaQA demonstrate that our method enhances answer reliability while significantly reducing computational overhead, making it well-suited for scalable and efficient EQA deployment.</description>

      <title>SPARC: Spectral Architectures Tackling the Cold-Start Problem in Graph Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs play a central role in modeling complex relationships in data, yet most graph learning methods falter when faced with cold-start nodes--new nodes lacking initial connections--due to their reliance on adjacency information. To tackle this, we propose SPARC, a groundbreaking framework that introduces a novel approach to graph learning by utilizing generalizable spectral embeddings. With a simple yet powerful enhancement, SPARC empowers state-of-the-art methods to make predictions on cold-start nodes effectively. By eliminating the need for adjacency information during inference and effectively capturing the graph's structure, we make these methods suitable for real-world scenarios where new nodes frequently appear. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing models on cold-start nodes across tasks such as node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. SPARC provides a solution to the cold-start problem, advancing the field of graph learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating the positions of points from distance measurements corrupted by sparse outliers. Specifically, we consider a setting with two types of nodes: anchor nodes, for which exact distances to each other are known, and target nodes, for which complete but corrupted distance measurements to the anchors are available. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel algorithm powered by Nystr\"om method and robust principal component analysis. Our method is computationally efficient as it processes only a localized subset of the distance matrix and does not require distance measurements between target nodes. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets, designed to mimic sensor localization, and on molecular experiments, demonstrate that our algorithm achieves accurate recovery with a modest number of anchors, even in the presence of high levels of sparse outliers.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Graph Neural Networks for Robust Power Grid Topology Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy transition necessitates new congestion management methods. One such method is controlling the grid topology with machine learning (ML). This approach has gained popularity following the Learning to Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a class of ML models that reflect graph structure in their computation, which makes them suitable for power grid modeling. Various GNN approaches for topology control have thus been proposed. We propose the first GNN model for grid topology control that uses only GNN layers. Additionally, we identify the busbar information asymmetry problem that the popular homogeneous graph representation suffers from, and propose a heterogeneous graph representation to resolve it. We train both homogeneous and heterogeneous GNNs and fully connected neural networks (FCNN) baselines on an imitation learning task. We evaluate the models according to their classification accuracy and grid operation ability. We find that the heterogeneous GNNs perform best on in-distribution networks, followed by the FCNNs, and lastly, the homogeneous GNNs. We also find that both GNN types generalize better to out-of-distribution networks than FCNNs.</description>

      <title>Gradient Equilibrium in Online Learning: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new perspective on online learning that we refer to as gradient equilibrium: a sequence of iterates achieves gradient equilibrium if the average of gradients of losses along the sequence converges to zero. In general, this condition is not implied by, nor implies, sublinear regret. It turns out that gradient equilibrium is achievable by standard online learning methods such as gradient descent and mirror descent with constant step sizes (rather than decaying step sizes, as is usually required for no regret). Further, as we show through examples, gradient equilibrium translates into an interpretable and meaningful property in online prediction problems spanning regression, classification, quantile estimation, and others. Notably, we show that the gradient equilibrium framework can be used to develop a debiasing scheme for black-box predictions under arbitrary distribution shift, based on simple post hoc online descent updates. We also show that post hoc gradient updates can be used to calibrate predicted quantiles under distribution shift, and that the framework leads to unbiased Elo scores for pairwise preference prediction.</description>

      <title>False Discovery Rate Control via Frequentist-assisted Horseshoe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The horseshoe prior, a widely used handy alternative to the spike-and-slab prior, has proven to be an exceptional default global-local shrinkage prior in Bayesian inference and machine learning. However, designing tests with frequentist false discovery rate (FDR) control using the horseshoe prior or the general class of global-local shrinkage priors remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a frequentist-assisted horseshoe procedure that not only resolves this long-standing FDR control issue for the high dimensional normal means testing problem but also exhibits satisfactory finite-sample FDR control under any desired nominal level for both large-scale multiple independent and correlated tests. We carry out the frequentist-assisted horseshoe procedure in an easy and intuitive way by using the minimax estimator of the global parameter of the horseshoe prior while maintaining the remaining full Bayes vanilla horseshoe structure. The results of both intensive simulations under different sparsity levels, and real-world data demonstrate that the frequentist-assisted horseshoe procedure consistently achieves robust finite-sample FDR control. Existing frequentist or Bayesian FDR control procedures can lose finite-sample FDR control in a variety of common sparse cases. Based on the intimate relationship between the minimax estimation and the level of FDR control discovered in this work, we point out potential generalizations to achieve FDR control for both more complicated models and the general global-local shrinkage prior family.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Regret for Online KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have shown that KL-regularization plays a pivotal role in improving the efficiency of RL fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs). Despite its empirical advantage, the theoretical difference between KL-regularized RL and standard RL remains largely under-explored. While there is a recent line of work on the theoretical analysis of KL-regularized objective in decision making \citep{xiong2024iterative, xie2024exploratory,zhao2024sharp}, these analyses either reduce to the traditional RL setting or rely on strong coverage assumptions. In this paper, we propose an optimism-based KL-regularized online contextual bandit algorithm, and provide a novel analysis of its regret. By carefully leveraging the benign optimization landscape induced by the KL-regularization and the optimistic reward estimation, our algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}\big(\eta\log (N_{\mathcal R} T)\cdot d_{\mathcal R}\big)$ logarithmic regret bound, where $\eta, N_{\mathcal R},T,d_{\mathcal R}$ denote the KL-regularization parameter, the cardinality of the reward function class, number of rounds, and the complexity of the reward function class. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm and analysis to reinforcement learning by developing a novel decomposition over transition steps and also obtain a similar logarithmic regret bound.</description>

      <title>Distributional Instrumental Variable Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The instrumental variable (IV) approach is commonly used to infer causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. Existing methods typically aim to estimate the mean causal effects, whereas a few other methods focus on quantile treatment effects. The aim of this work is to estimate the entire interventional distribution. We propose a method called Distributional Instrumental Variable (DIV), which uses generative modelling in a nonlinear IV setting. We establish identifiability of the interventional distribution under general assumptions and demonstrate an 'under-identified' case, where DIV can identify the causal effects while two-step least squares fails to. Our empirical results show that the DIV method performs well for a broad range of simulated data, exhibiting advantages over existing IV approaches in terms of the identifiability and estimation error of the mean or quantile treatment effects. Furthermore, we apply DIV to an economic data set to examine the causal relation between institutional quality and economic development and our results align well with the original study. We also apply DIV to a single-cell data set, where we study the generalizability and stability in predicting gene expression under unseen interventions. The software implementations of DIV are available in R and Python.</description>
