      <title>Learning the Exact SABR Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SABR model is a cornerstone of interest rate volatility modeling, but its practical application relies heavily on the analytical approximation by Hagan et al., whose accuracy deteriorates for high volatility, long maturities, and out-of-the-money options, admitting arbitrage. While machine learning approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, they have often been limited by simplified SABR dynamics or a lack of systematic validation against the full spectrum of market conditions.
  We develop a novel SABR DNN, a specialized Artificial Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture that learns the true SABR stochastic dynamics using an unprecedented large training dataset (more than 200 million points) of interest rate Cap/Floor volatility surfaces, including very long maturities (30Y) and extreme strikes consistently with market quotations. Our dataset is obtained via high-precision unbiased Monte Carlo simulation of a special scaled shifted-SABR stochastic dynamics, which allows dimensional reduction without any loss of generality.
  Our SABR DNN provides arbitrage-free calibration of real market volatility surfaces and Caps/Floors prices for any maturity and strike with negligible computational effort and without retraining across business dates. Our results fully address the gaps in the previous machine learning SABR literature in a systematic and self-consistent way, and can be extended to cover any interest rate European options in different rate tenors and currencies, thus establishing a comprehensive functional SABR framework that can be adopted for daily trading and risk management activities.</description>

      <title>Integrating Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning for Sentiment-Driven Quantitative Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research develops a sentiment-driven quantitative trading system that leverages a large language model, FinGPT, for sentiment analysis, and explores a novel method for signal integration using a reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3). We compare the performance of strategies that integrate sentiment and technical signals using both a conventional rule-based approach and a reinforcement learning framework. The results suggest that sentiment signals generated by FinGPT offer value when combined with traditional technical indicators, and that reinforcement learning algorithm presents a promising approach for effectively integrating heterogeneous signals in dynamic trading environments.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Quantifying Financial Bubbles with the Hyped Log-Periodic Power Law Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel model, the Hyped Log-Periodic Power Law Model (HLPPL), to the problem of quantifying and detecting financial bubbles, an ever-fascinating one for academics and practitioners alike. Bubble labels are generated using a Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model, sentiment scores, and a hype index we introduced in previous research on NLP forecasting of stock return volatility. Using these tools, a dual-stream transformer model is trained with market data and machine learning methods, resulting in a time series of confidence scores as a Bubble Score. A distinctive feature of our framework is that it captures phases of extreme overpricing and underpricing within a unified structure.
  We achieve an average yield of 34.13 percentage annualized return when backtesting U.S. equities during the period 2018 to 2024, while the approach exhibits a remarkable generalization ability across industry sectors. Its conservative bias in predicting bubble periods minimizes false positives, a feature which is especially beneficial for market signaling and decision-making. Overall, this approach utilizes both theoretical and empirical advances for real-time positive and negative bubble identification and measurement with HLPPL signals.</description>

      <title>Crisis-Aware Regime-Conditioned Diffusion with CVaR Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE) denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance. In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.</description>

      <title>Attention Factors for Statistical Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S. equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are important for arbitrage trading.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Importance Sampling with Markov Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although stochastic models driven by latent Markov processes are widely used, the classical importance sampling methods based on the exponential tilting for these models suffers from the difficulties in computing the eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions and the plausibility of the indirect asymptotic large deviation regime for the variance of the estimator. We propose a general importance sampling framework that twists the observable and latent processes separately using a link function that directly minimizes the estimator's variance. An optimal choice of the link function is chosen within the locally asymptotically normal family. We show the logarithmic efficiency of the proposed estimator. As applications, we estimate an overflow probability under a pandemic model and the CoVaR, a measurement of the co-dependent financial systemic risk. Both applications are beyond the scope of traditional importance sampling methods due to their nonlinear features.</description>

      <title>Intraday Battery Dispatch for Hybrid Renewable Energy Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical model for intraday dispatch of co-located wind-battery energy assets. Focusing on the primary objective of firming grid-side actual production vis-a-vis the preset day-ahead hourly generation targets, we conduct a comprehensive study of the resulting stochastic control problem across different firming formulations and wind generation dynamics. Among others, we provide a closed-form solution in the special case of a quadratic objective and linear dynamics, as well as design a novel adaptation of a Gaussian Process-based Regression Monte Carlo algorithm for our setting. Extensions studied include an asymmetric loss function for peak shaving, capturing the cost of battery cycling, and the role of battery duration. In the applied portion of our work, we calibrate our model to a collection of 140+ wind-battery assets in Texas, benchmarking the economic benefits of firming based on outputs of a realistic unit commitment and economic dispatch solver.</description>

      <title>A Set-Sequence Model for Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many prediction problems across science and engineering, especially in finance and economics, involve large cross-sections of individual time series, where each unit (e.g., a loan, stock, or customer) is driven by unit-level features and latent cross-sectional dynamics. While sequence models have advanced per-unit temporal prediction, capturing cross-sectional effects often still relies on hand-crafted summary features. We propose Set-Sequence, a model that learns cross-sectional structure directly, enhancing expressivity and eliminating manual feature engineering. At each time step, a permutation-invariant Set module summarizes the unit set; a Sequence module then models each unit's dynamics conditioned on both its features and the learned summary. The architecture accommodates unaligned series, supports varying numbers of units at inference, integrates with standard sequence backbones (e.g., Transformers), and scales linearly in cross-sectional size. Across a synthetic contagion task and two large-scale real-world applications, equity portfolio optimization and loan risk prediction, Set-Sequence significantly outperforms strong baselines, delivering higher Sharpe ratios, improved AUCs, and interpretable cross-sectional summaries.</description>
