      <title>Even the vague specification property implies density of ergodic measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if a topological dynamical system $(X,T)$ is surjective and has the vague specification property, then its ergodic measures are dense in the space of all invariant measures. The vague specification property generalises Bowen's classical specification property and encompasses the majority of the extensions of the specification property introduced so far.
  The proof proceeds by first considering the natural extension $X_T$ of $(X,T)$ as a subsystem of the shift action on the space $X^\mathbb{Z}$ of $X$-valued biinfinite sequences. We then construct a sequence of subsystems of $X^\mathbb{Z}$ that approximate $X_T$ in the Hausdorff metric induced by a metric compatible with the product topology on $X^\mathbb{Z}$. The approximating subsystems consist of $\delta$-chains for $\delta$ decreasing to $0$. We show that chain mixing implies that each approximating system possesses the classical periodic specification property. Furthermore, we use vague specification to prove that our approximating subsystems of $X^\mathbb{Z}$ converge to $X_T$ in the Hausdorff metric induced the Besicovitch pseudometric. It follows that the simplices of invariant measures of these subsystems of $\delta$-chains converge to the simplex of invariant measures of $X_T$ with respect to a generalised version of Ornstein's $\bar{d}$ metric. What is more, the density of ergodic measures is preserved in the limit. The proof concludes by observing that the simplices of invariant measures for $X_T$ and $(X,T)$ coincide.
  The approximation technique developed in this paper appears to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Equivariant isomorphism of Quantum Lens Spaces of low dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum lens spaces form a natural and well-studied class of noncommutative spaces which can be subjected to classification using algebraic invariants by drawing on the fully developed classification theory of unital graph $C^*$-algebras. We introduce the problem of deciding when two quantum lens spaces are equivariantly isomorphic, and solve it in certain basic cases. As opposed to classification up to isomorphism, we can not appeal to a complete general classification theory in the equivariant case, but by combining existing partial results with an ad hoc analysis we can solve the case with dimension 3 completely, and the case with dimension 5 in the prime case. Our results can be formulated directly in terms of the parameters defining the quantum lens spaces, and here occasionally take on a rather complicated form which convinces us that there is a deep underlying explanation for our findings. We complement the fully established partial results with computer experiments that may indicate the way forward.</description>

      <title>Weyl groups of groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the theory of C*-algebras, the Weyl groups were defined for the Cuntz algebras and graph algebras by Cuntz and Conti et al. respectively. In this paper, we introduce and investigate the Weyl groups of groupoid C*-algebras as a natural generalization of the existing Weyl groups. Then we analyse several groups of automorphisms on groupoid C*-algebras. Finally, we apply our results to Cuntz algebras, graph algebras and C*-algebras associated with Deaconu-Renault systems.</description>
