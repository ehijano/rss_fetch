      <title>Cardinal characteristics associated with small subsets of reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Bartoszy\'nski's work on small sets, we introduce a new ideal defined by interval partitions on natural numbers and summable sequences of positive reals. Similarly, we present another ideal that relies on Bartoszy\'nski's and Shelah's characterization of $F_\sigma$ measure zero sets. We demonstrate that they are $\sigma$-ideals and provide characterizations of the families of all small sets and the ideal induced by $F_\sigma$ measure zero sets. We also study the cardinal characteristics associated with the introduced ideals. We discuss their connection to Cicho\'n's diagram and present related consistency results.</description>

      <title>On a Generalization of Heyting Algebras I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\nabla$-algebra is a natural generalization of Heyting algebra, unifying many algebraic structures including bounded lattices, Heyting algebras, temporal Heyting algebras and the algebraic presentation of the dynamic topological systems. In a series of two papers, we will systematically study the algebro-topological properties of different varieties of $\nabla$-algebras. In the present paper, we start with investigating the structure of these varieties by characterizing their subdirectly irreducible and simple elements. Then, we prove the closure of these varieties under the Dedekind-MacNeille completion and provide the canonical construction and the Kripke representation for $\nabla$-algebras by which we establish the amalgamation property for some varieties of $\nabla$-algebras. In the sequel of the present paper, we will complete the study by covering the logics of these varieties and their corresponding Priestley-Esakia and spectral duality theories.</description>

      <title>The Logical Art of Keeping a True Secret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logical investigations of the notion of secrecy are typically concentrated on tools for deducing whether private information is well hidden from unauthorized, direct, or indirect access attempts. This paper proposes a multi-agent, normal multi-modal logic to capture salient features of secrecy. We focus on the intentions, beliefs and knowledge of secret keepers and, more generally, of all the actors involved in secret-keeping scenarios. In particular, we investigate the notion of a true secret, namely a secret concerning information known (and so true) by the secret keeper. The resulting characterization of intending to keep a true secret provides useful insights into conditions ensuring or undermining secrecy depending on agents' attitudes and links between secrets and their surrounding context. We present soundness, completeness, and decidability results of the proposed logical system. Furthermore, we outline some theorems with applications in several contexts from computer science and social sciences.</description>

      <title>Automorphism groups of prime models, and invariant measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt the notion of a (relatively) definable subset of Aut(M) when M is a saturated model to the case Aut(M/A) when M is atomic and strongly omega-homogeneous over A. We discuss the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures on the Boolean algebra of definable subsets of Aut(M/A). For example when Th(M) is stable we have existence and uniqueness. We also discuss the compatibility of our definability notions with definable Galois cohomology and differential Galois theory.</description>

      <title>Equivalence and Conditional Independence in Atomic Sheaf Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a semantic foundation for logics for reasoning in settings that possess a distinction between equality of variables, a coarser equivalence of variables, and a notion of conditional independence between variables. We show that such relations can be modelled naturally in atomic sheaf toposes.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional F-definable sets in F((t))</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:1503.05803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we study one-dimensional definable sets in power series fields with perfect residue fields. Using the description of automorphisms given by Schilling, in \cite{S44}, we show that such sets are unions of existentially definable in the language of rings, allowing parameters. We deduce that if $F$ is a perfect field of positive characteristic $p$, and $X$ is a subset of the $t$-adically valued $F((t))$ that is definable in the language of valued fields with parameters from $F$, then the subfield $(X)$ generated by $X$ is either contained in $F$ or equal to $F((t^{p^n}))$, for some $n\geq0$. The proof uses our earlier work on existentially definable subsets of henselian and large fields, of which power series fields are examples.</description>

      <title>On Probabilistic and Causal Reasoning with Summation Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ibeling et al. (2023). axiomatize increasingly expressive languages of causation and probability, and Mosse et al. (2024) show that reasoning (specifically the satisfiability problem) in each causal language is as difficult, from a computational complexity perspective, as reasoning in its merely probabilistic or "correlational" counterpart. Introducing a summation operator to capture common devices that appear in applications -- such as the $do$-calculus of Pearl (2009) for causal inference, which makes ample use of marginalization -- van der Zander et al. (2023) partially extend these earlier complexity results to causal and probabilistic languages with marginalization. We complete this extension, fully characterizing the complexity of probabilistic and causal reasoning with summation, demonstrating that these again remain equally difficult. Surprisingly, allowing free variables for random variable values results in a system that is undecidable, so long as the ranges of these random variables are unrestricted. We finally axiomatize these languages featuring marginalization (or more generally summation), resolving open questions posed by Ibeling et al. (2023).</description>

      <title>Large-scale geometry of Borel graphs of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04727v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study graphs of polynomial growth from the perspective of asymptotic geometry and descriptive set theory. The starting point of our investigation is a theorem of Krauthgamer and Lee who showed that every connected graph of polynomial growth admits an injective contraction mapping to $(\mathbb Z^n, \|\cdot\|_\infty)$ for some $n\in\mathbb N$. We strengthen and generalize this result in a number of ways. In particular, answering a question of Papasoglu, we construct coarse embeddings from graphs of polynomial growth to $\mathbb Z^n$. Moreover, we only require $n$ to be linear in the asymptotic polynomial growth rate of the graph; this confirms a conjecture of Levin and Linial, London, and Rabinovich "in the asymptotic sense." (The exact form of the conjecture was refuted by Krauthgamer and Lee.) All our results are proved for Borel graphs, which allows us to settle a number of problems in descriptive combinatorics. Roughly, we prove that graphs generated by free Borel actions of $\mathbb Z^n$ are universal for the class of Borel graphs of polynomial growth. This provides a general method for extending results about $\mathbb Z^n$-actions to all Borel graphs of polynomial growth. For example, an immediate consequence of our main result is that all Borel graphs of polynomial growth are hyperfinite, which answers a well-known question in the area. As another illustration, we show that Borel graphs of polynomial growth support a certain combinatorial structure called toast. An important technical tool in our arguments is the notion of padded decomposition from computer science, which is closely related to the concept of asymptotic dimension due to Gromov. Along the way we find an alternative, probabilistic proof of a theorem of Papasoglu that graphs of asymptotic polynomial growth rate $\rho&lt;\infty$ have asymptotic dimension at most $\rho$ and establish the same bound in the Borel setting.</description>

      <title>Preservation theorems on sparse classes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the work studying homomorphism preservation for first-order logic in sparse classes of structures initiated in [Atserias et al., JACM 2006] and [Dawar, JCSS 2010]. These established that first-order logic has the homomorphism preservation property in any sparse class that is monotone and addable. It turns out that the assumption of addability is not strong enough for the proofs given. We demonstrate this by constructing classes of graphs of bounded treewidth which are monotone and addable but fail to have homomorphism preservation. We also show that homomorphism preservation fails on the class of planar graphs. On the other hand, the proofs of homomorphism preservation can be recovered by replacing addability by a stronger condition of amalgamation over bottlenecks. This is analogous to a similar condition formulated for extension preservation in [Atserias et al., SiCOMP 2008].</description>
