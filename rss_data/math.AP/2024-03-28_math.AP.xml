      <title>Generalized Chern-Simons-Schrodinger system with critical exponential growth: the zero mass case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the existence of ground state solutions for a class of zero-mass Chern-Simons-Schr\"{o}dinger systems \[
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle -\Delta u +A_0 u+\sum\limits_{j=1}^2A_j^2 u=f(u)-a(x)|u|^{p-2}u, \newline
  \displaystyle \partial_1A_2-\partial_2A_1=-\frac{1}{2}|u|^2,~\partial_1A_1+\partial_2A_2=0, \newline
  \displaystyle \partial_1A_0=A_2|u|^2,~ \partial_2A_0=-A_1|u|^2,
  \end{array} \right. \] where $a:\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R^+$ is an external potential, $p\in(1,2)$ and $f\in \mathcal{C}(\mathbb R)$ denotes a nonlinearity that fulfills the critical exponential growth in the Trudinger-Moser sense at infinity. By introducing an improvement of the version of Trudinger-Moser inequality, we are able to investigate the existence of positive ground state solutions for the given system using variational method.</description>

      <title>Global solution of 2D hyperbolic liquid crystal system for small initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the global stability of small perturbation near the the constant equilibrium for the two dimensional simplified Ericksen-Leslie's hyperbolic system for incompressible liquid crystal model, where the direction function of liquid crystal molecules satisfies a wave map equation with an acoustical metric. This improves the almost global existence result by Huang-Jiang-Zhao. As byproducts, we obtain the sharp (same as the linear solution) decay estimates for the nonlinear velocity and the nonlinear wave part. Moreover the nonlinear wave part scatters to a linear solution as time goes to infinity.
  The main novelty of this paper is that we uncover a null structure inside the velocity equation on the Fourier side for the nonlinear interaction between nonlinear heat equation and nonlinear wave equation.</description>

      <title>Morrey-Lorentz estimates for Hodge-type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove up to the boundary regularity estimates in Morrey-Lorentz spaces for weak solutions of the linear system of differential forms with regular anisotropic coefficients
  \begin{equation*}
  d^{\ast} \left( A d\omega \right) + B^{\intercal}d d^{\ast} \left( B\omega \right) = \lambda B\omega + f \text{ in } \Omega,
  \end{equation*}
  with either $ \nu\wedge \omega$ and $\nu\wedge d^{\ast} \left( B\omega \right)$ or $\nu\lrcorner B\omega$ and
  $\nu\lrcorner \left( A d\omega \right)$ prescribed on $\partial\Omega.$ We derive these estimates from the $L^{p}$ estimates obtained in \cite{Sil_linearregularity} in the spirit of Campanato's method. Unlike Lorentz spaces, Morrey spaces are neither interpolation spaces nor rearrangement invariant. So Morrey estimates can not be obtained directly from the $L^{p}$ estimates using interpolation. We instead adapt an idea of Lieberman \cite{Lieberman_morrey_from_Lp} to our setting to derive the estimates. Applications to Hodge decomposition in Morrey-Lorentz spaces, Gaffney type inequalities and estimates for related systems such as Hodge-Maxwell systems and `div-curl' systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>A consistent kinetic Fokker-Planck model for gas mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rarefied gas dynamics is usually described by the Boltzmann equation. Unfortunately, the expense of evaluating this operator can be very prohibitive. This made it worthwhile to look for approximations that convey essentially an equivalent amount of physical information. One widely known approximative collision operator is the Bathnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) operator. However, recently, the Foker-Planck approximation has become increasingly popular. Nevertheless, the modeling of gas mixtures in the context of the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation has so far only been addressed in a very few papers. In this paper, we propose a general multi-species Fokker-Planck model. We prove consistency of our model: conservation properties, positivity of all temperatures, H-Theorem and the shape of equilibrium as Maxwell distributions with the same mean velocity and temperature. Moreover, we derive the usual macroscopic equations.</description>

      <title>Global unique solutions to the planar inhomogeneous Navier--Stokes--Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of an electrically conducting imcompressible fluid with nonconstant density can be described by a set of equations combining the continuity, momentum and Maxwell's equations; altogether known as the inhomogeneous Navier--Stokes--Maxwell system.
  In this paper, we focus on the global well-posedness of these equations in two dimensions. Specifically, we are able to prove the existence of global energy solutions, provided that the initial velocity field belongs to the Besov space $\dot{B}^{r}_{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, with $r=-1+\frac{2}{p}$, for some $p\in (1,2)$, while the initial electromagnetic field enjoys some $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ Sobolev regularity, for some $s \geq 2-\frac{2}{p} \in (0,1)$, and whenever the initial fluid density is bounded pointwise and close to a nonnegative constant. Moreover, if it is assumed that $s&gt;\frac{1}{2}$, then the solution is shown to be unique in the class of all energy solutions.
  It is to be emphasized that the solutions constructed here are global and uniformly bounded with respect to the speed of light $c\in (0,\infty)$. This important fact allows us to derive the inhomogeneous MHD system as the speed of light tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Existence and compactness of global weak solutions of three-dimensional axisymmetric Ericksen-Leslie system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dimension three, the existence of global weak solutions to the axisymmetric simplified Ericksen-Leslie system without swirl is established. This is achieved by analyzing weak convergence of solutions of the axisymmetric Ginzburg-Landau approximated solutions as the penalization parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to zero. The proof relies on the one hand on the use of a blow-up argument to rule out energy concentration off the $z$-axis, which exploits the topological restrictions of the axisymmetry. On the other hand, possible limiting energy concentrations on the $z$-axis can be dealt by a cancellation argument at the origin. Once more, the axisymmetry plays a substantial role. We will also show that the set of axisymmetric solutions without swirl $(u,d)$ to the simplified Ericksen-Leslie system is compact under weak convergence in $L^\infty_tL^2_x\times L^2_tH^1_x$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the monotonicity method for an anisotropic scatterer with a conductive boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the inverse scattering problem associated with an anisotropic medium with a conductive boundary. We will assume that the corresponding far-field pattern is known/measured and we consider two inverse problems. First, we show that the far-field data uniquely determines the boundary coefficient. Next, since it is known that anisotropic coefficients are not uniquely determined by this data we will develop a qualitative method to recover the scatterer. To this end, we study the so-called monotonicity method applied to this inverse shape problem. This method has recently been applied to some inverse scattering problems but this is the first time it has been applied to an anisotropic scatterer. This method allows one to recover the scatterer but considering the eigenvalues of an operator associated with the far--field operator. We present some simple numerical reconstructions to illustrate our theory in two dimensions. For our reconstructions, we need to compute the adjoint of the Herglotz wave function as an operator mapping into $H^1$ of a small ball.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a closed analytic manifold $(M,g)$, let $\phi_i$ be the eigenfunctions of $\Delta_g$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_i^2$ and let $f:=\prod \phi_{k_j}$ be a finite product of Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions. We show that $\left\langle f, \phi_i \right\rangle_{L^2(M)}$ decays exponentially as soon as $\lambda_i &gt; C \sum \lambda_{k_j}$ for some constant $C$ depending only on $M$. Moreover, by using a lower bound on $\| f \|_{L^2(M)} $, we show that $99\%$ of the $L^2$-mass of $f$ can be recovered using only finitely many Fourier coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the notion of globally integrable quantum system that we introduced in [BL22]: we motivate it using the spectral theory of pseudodifferential operators and then we give some results on linear and nonlinear perturbations of a globally integrable quantum system. In particular, we give a spectral result ensuring stability of most of its eigenvalues under relatively bounded perturbations, and two results controlling the growth of Sobolev norms when it is subject either to linear unbounded time dependent perturbations or a small nonlinear Hamiltonian nonlinear perturbation.</description>

      <title>Constructive proofs of existence and stability of solitary waves in the capillary-gravity Whitham equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a method to prove constructively the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves (solitons) in the capillary-gravity Whitham equation. By employing Fourier series analysis and computer-aided techniques, we successfully approximate the Fourier multiplier operator in this equation, allowing the construction of an approximate inverse for the linearization around an approximate solution $u_0$. Then, using a Newton-Kantorovich approach, we provide a sufficient condition under which the existence of a unique solitary wave $\tilde{u}$ in a ball centered at $u_0$ is obtained. The verification of such a condition is established combining analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, we derive a methodology to control the spectrum of the linearization around $\tilde{u}$, enabling the study of spectral stability of the solution. As an illustration, we provide a (constructive) computer-assisted proof of existence of a stable soliton in both the case with capillary effects ($T&gt;0$) and without capillary effects ($T=0$). The methodology presented in this paper can be generalized and provides a new approach for addressing the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves in nonlocal nonlinear equations. All computer-assisted proofs, including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.</description>

      <title>The extension of traces for Sobolev mappings between manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compact Riemannian manifolds $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ for which the trace operator from the first-order Sobolev space of mappings $\smash{\dot{W}}^{1, p} (\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N})$ to the fractional Sobolev-Slobodecki\u{\i} space $\smash{\smash{\dot{W}}^{1 - 1/p, p}} (\partial \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N})$ is surjective when $1 &lt; p &lt; m$ are characterised. The traces are extended using a new construction which can be carried out assuming the absence of the known topological and analytical obstructions. When $p \ge m$ the same construction provides a Sobolev extension with linear estimates for maps that have a continuous extension, provided that there are no known analytical obstructions to such a control.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Boundary Control of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation Under Intermittent Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in this paper boundary stabilization, in the L2 sense, of the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation subject to intermittent sensing. We assume that we measure the state of this spatio-temporal equation on a given spatial subdomain during certain intervals of time, while we measure the state on the remaining spatial subdomain during the remaining intervals of time. As a result, we assign a feedback law at the boundary of the spatial domain and force to zero the value of the state at the junction of the two subdomains. Throughout the study, the destabilizing coefficient is assumed to be space-dependent and bounded but unknown. Adaptive boundary controllers are designed under different assumptions on the forcing term. In particular, when the forcing term is null, we guarantee global exponential stability of the origin. Furthermore, when the forcing term is bounded and admits a known upper bound, we guarantee input-to-state stability, and only global uniform ultimate boundedness is guaranteed when the upper bound is unknown. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate our results</description>

      <title>From Sontag s to Cardano-Lyapunov Formula for Systems Not Affine in the Control: Convection-Enabled PDE Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first generalization of Sontag s universal controller to systems not affine in the control, particularly, to PDEs with boundary actuation. We assume that the system admits a control Lyapunov function (CLF) whose derivative, rather than being affine in the control, has either a depressed cubic, quadratic, or depressed quartic dependence on the control. For each case, a continuous universal controller that vanishes at the origin and achieves global exponential stability is derived. We prove our result in the context of convectionreaction-diffusion PDEs with Dirichlet actuation. We show that if the convection has a certain structure, then the L2 norm of the state is a CLF. In addition to generalizing Sontag s formula to some non-affine systems, we present the first general Lyapunov approach for boundary control of nonlinear PDEs. We illustrate our results via a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Frozen Gaussian approximation for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA) for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation in the semi-classical regime, where the solution is highly oscillatory when the scaled Planck constant $\varepsilon$ is small. This method approximates the solution to the Schr\"odinger equation by an integral representation based on asymptotic analysis and provides a highly efficient computational method for high-frequency wave function evolution. In particular, we revise the standard FGA formula to address the singularities arising in the higher-order derivatives of coefficients of the associated Hamiltonian flow that are second-order continuously differentiable or smooth in conventional FGA analysis. We then establish its convergence to the true solution. Additionally, we provide some numerical examples to verify the accuracy and convergence behavior of the frozen Gaussian approximation method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore various equivalences of Ekeland's variational principle within the framework of group-invariant mappings. We introduce and analyze several key theorems, including the Drop theorem, the Petal theorem, Caristi-Kirk fxed-point theorem, and Takahashi's theorem, all of them within this context. Moreover, we extend the classical Drop theorem and Petal theorem to a more generalized setting. We also demonstrate the practical signifcance of these findings through numerous applications to diverse areas of mathematics. In particular, in the context of partial differential equations, we explore their implications on the solution of the Plateau problem, and in control theory. We also extend the classical Pontyargin maximum principle.</description>

      <title>Numerical optimisation of Dirac eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by relativistic materials, we develop a numerical scheme to support existing or state new conjectures in the spectral optimisation of eigenvalues of the Dirac operator, subject to infinite-mass boundary conditions. We study the optimality of the regular polygon (respectively, disk) among all polygons of a given number of sides (respectively, arbitrary sets), subject to area or perimeter constraints. We consider the three lowest positive eigenvalues and their ratios. Roughly, we find results analogous to known or expected for the Dirichlet Laplacian, except for the third eigenvalue which does not need to be minimised by the regular polygon (respectively, the disk) for all masses. In addition to the numerical results, a new, mass-dependent upper bound to the lowest eigenvalue in rectangles is proved and its extension to arbitrary quadrilaterals is conjectured.</description>

      <title>Dimension-independent functional inequalities by tensorization and projection arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stability under tensorization and projection-type operations of gradient-type estimates and other functional inequalities for Markov semigroups on metric spaces. Using transportation-type inequalities obtained by F. Baudoin and N. Eldredge in 2021, we prove that constants in the gradient estimates can be chosen to be independent of the dimension. Our results are applicable to hypoelliptic diffusions on sub-Riemannian manifolds and some hypocoercive diffusions. As a byproduct, we obtain dimension-independent reverse Poincar\'{e}, reverse logarithmic Sobolev, and gradient bounds for Lie groups with a transverse symmetry and for non-isotropic Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for quasi-linear SPDEs in the full sub-critical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.11039v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with quasi-linear parabolic equations driven by an additive forcing $\xi \in C^{\alpha-2}$, in the full sub-critical regime $\alpha \in (0,1)$. We are inspired by Hairer's regularity structures, however we work with a more parsimonious model indexed by multi-indices rather than trees. This allows us to capture additional symmetries which play a crucial role in our analysis. Assuming bounds on this model, which is modified in agreement with the concept of algebraic renormalization, we prove local a priori estimates on solutions to the quasi-linear equations modified by the corresponding counter terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the following parabolic-parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with singular sensitivity and Lotka-Volterra competitive kinetics,
  \begin{equation} \begin{cases} u_t=\Delta u-\chi_1 \nabla\cdot (\frac{u}{w} \nabla w)+u(a_1-b_1u-c_1v) ,\quad &amp;x\in \Omega\cr v_t=\Delta v-\chi_2 \nabla\cdot (\frac{v}{w} \nabla w)+v(a_2-b_2v-c_2u),\quad &amp;x\in \Omega\cr 0=\Delta w-\mu w +\nu u+ \lambda v,\quad &amp;x\in \Omega \cr \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}=\frac{\partial w}{\partial n}=0,\quad &amp;x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded smooth domain, and $\chi_i$, $a_i$, $b_i$, $ c_i$ ($i=1,2$) and $\mu,\, \nu, \, \lambda$ are positive constants. This is the first work on two-species chemotaxis-competition system with singular sensitivity and Lotka-Volterra competitive kinetics. Among others, we prove that for any given nonnegative initial data $u_0,v_0\in C^0(\bar\Omega)$ with $u_0+v_0\not \equiv 0$, (0.1) has a unique globally defined classical solution $(u(t,x;u_0,v_0),v(t,x;u_0,v_0),w(t,x;u_0,v_0))$ with $u(0,x;u_0,v_0)=u_0(x)$ and $v(0,x;u_0,v_0)=v_0(x)$ provided that $\min\{a_1,a_2\}$ is large relative to $\chi_1,\chi_2$ and $u_0+v_0$ is not small. Moreover, under the same condition, we prove that \begin{equation*}
  \limsup_{t\to\infty} \|u(t,\cdot;u_0,v_0)+v(t,\cdot;u_0,v_0)\|_\infty\le M^*, \end{equation*} and \begin{equation*}
  \liminf_{t\to\infty} \inf_{x\in\Omega}(u(t,x,u_0,v_0)+v(t,x;u_0,v_0))\ge m^*, \end{equation*} for some positive constants $M^*,m^*$ independent of $u_0,v_0$, the latter is referred to as combined pointwise persistence.</description>

      <title>Large time behavior for the 3D Navier-Stokes with Navier boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a smooth bounded domain $\Omega$ with initial velocity $u_0$ square-integrable, divergence-free and tangent to $\partial \Omega$. We supplement the equations with the Navier friction boundary conditions $u \cdot n = 0$ and $[(2Su)n + \alpha u]_{\rm tang} = 0$, where $n$ is the unit exterior normal to $\partial \Omega$, $Su = (Du + (Du)^t)/2$, $\alpha \in C^0(\partial\Omega)$ is the boundary friction coefficient and $[\cdot]_{\rm tang}$ is the projection of its argument onto the tangent space of $\partial \Omega$. We prove global existence of a weak Leray-type solution to the resulting initial-boundary value problem and exponential decay in energy norm of these solutions when friction is positive. We also prove exponential decay if friction is non-negative and the domain is not a solid of revolution. In addition, in the frictionless case $\alpha = 0$, we prove convergence of the solution to a steady rigid rotation, if the domain is a solid of revolution. We use the Galerkin method for existence, Poincar\'{e}-type inequalities, with suitable adaptations to account for the differential geometry of the boundary, and a global-in-time, integral Gronwall-type inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a well-posedness theory for a class of nonlocal continuity equations on co-evolving graphs. We describe the connection among vertices through an edge weight function and we let it evolve in time, coupling its dynamics with the dynamics on the graph. This is relevant in applications to opinion dynamics and transportation networks. Existence and uniqueness of suitably defined solutions is obtained by exploiting the Banach fixed-point Theorem. We consider different time scales for the evolution of the weight function: faster and slower than the flow defined on the graph. The former leads to graphs whose weight functions depend nonlocally on the density configuration at the vertices, while the latter induces static graphs. Furthermore, we prove a discrete-to-continuum limit for the PDEs under study as the number of vertices converges to infinity.</description>

      <title>Rigid Lid limit in shallow water over a flat bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the so-called rigid lid limit on different shallow water models such as the abcd Bousssinesq systems or the Green-Naghdi equations. To do so we consider an appropriate nondimensionalization of these models where two small parameters are involved: the shallowness parameter {\mu} and a parameter {\epsilon} which can be interpreted as a Froude number. When parameter {\epsilon} tends to zero, the surface deformation formally goes to the rest state, hence the name rigid lid limit. We carefully study this limit for different topologies. We also provide rates of convergence with respect to {\epsilon} and a careful attention is given to the dependence on the shallowness parameter {\mu}.</description>

      <title>On the maximum principle for general linear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider maximum principles and related estimates for linear second order elliptic partial differential operators in n-dimensional Euclidean space, which improve previous results, with H-J Kuo, through sharp Lp dependence on the drift coefficient b. As in our previous work, the ellipticity is determined through the principal coefficient matrix A lying in sub-cones of the positive cone, which are dual cones of the Garding k-cones. Our main results are maximum principles for bounded domains, which extend those of Aleksandrov in the case k = n, together with extensions to unbounded domains, depending on appropriate integral norms of A, and corresponding local maximum principles. We also consider applications to local estimates in the uniformly elliptic case, including extensions of the Krylov-Safonov Holder and Harnack estimates.</description>

      <title>On the Ashbaugh-Benguria type conjecture about lower-order Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An isoperimetric inequality for lower order nonzero Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian on bounded domains in a Euclidean space or a hyperbolic space has been proven in this paper. About this conclusion, we would like to point out two things:
  It strengthens the well-known Szeg\H{o}-Weinberger inequality for nonzero Neumann eigenvalues of the classical free membrane problem given in [J. Rational Mech. Anal. 3 (1954) 343-356] and [J. Rational Mech. Anal. 5 (1956) 633-636];
  Recently, Xia-Wang [Math. Ann. 385 (2023) 863-879] gave a very important progress to the celebrated conjecture of M. S. Ashbaugh and R. D. Benguria proposed in [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 24 (1993) 557-570]. It is easy to see that our conclusion here covers Xia-Wang's this progress as a special case.
  In this paper, we have also proposed two open problems which can be seen as a generalization of Ashbaugh-Benguria's conjecture mentioned above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, by mainly using the rearrangement technique and suitably constructing trial functions, under the constraint of fixed weighted volume, we can successfully obtain several isoperimetric inequalities for the first and the second Dirichlet eigenvalues, the first nonzero Neumann eigenvalue of the Witten-Laplacian on bounded domains in space forms. These spectral isoperimetric inequalities extend those classical ones (i.e. the Faber-Krahn inequality, the Hong-Krahn-Szeg\H{o} inequality and the Szeg\H{o}-Weinberger inequality) of the Laplacian.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for geodesic diameter. Part III. A Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequality and applications to a variety of geometric variational problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.05504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a novel type of Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequality (for generalised weakly differentiable functions on varifolds), we establish a finite upper bound of the geodesic diameter of generalised compact connected surfaces-with-boundary of arbitrary dimension in Euclidean space in terms of the mean curvatures of the surface and its boundary. Our varifold setting includes smooth immersions, surfaces with finite Willmore energy, two-convex hypersurfaces in level-set mean curvature flow, integral currents with prescribed mean curvature vector, area minimising integral chains with coefficients in a complete normed commutative group, varifold solutions to Plateau's problem furnished by min-max methods or by Brakke flow, and compact sets solving Plateau problems based on \v{C}ech homology. Due to the generally inevitable presence of singularities, path-connectedness was previously known neither for the class of varifolds (even in the absence of boundary) nor for the solutions to the Plateau problems considered.</description>

      <title>A boundary integral equation method for the complete electrode model in electrical impedance tomography with tests on experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a boundary integral equation-based numerical method to solve for the electrostatic potential in two dimensions, inside a medium with piecewise constant conductivity, where the boundary condition is given by the complete electrode model (CEM). The CEM is seen as the most accurate model of the physical setting where electrodes are placed on the surface of an electrically conductive body, and currents are injected through the electrodes and the resulting voltages are measured again on these same electrodes. The integral equation formulation is based on expressing the electrostatic potential as the solution to a finite number of Laplace equations which are coupled through boundary matching conditions. This allows us to re-express the solution in terms of single layer potentials; the problem is thus re-cast as a system of integral equations on a finite number of smooth curves. We discuss an adaptive method for the solution of the resulting system of mildly singular integral equations. This solver is both fast and accurate. We then present a numerical inverse solver for electrical impedance tomography (EIT) which uses our forward solver at its core. To demonstrate the applicability of our results we test our numerical methods on an open electrical impedance tomography data set provided by the Finnish Inverse Problems Society.</description>

      <title>Weak uniqueness by noise for singular stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove weak uniqueness of mild solutions for a general class of SPDEs on a Hilbert space. The main novelty is that the drift is only defined on a Sobolev-type subspace and no H\"older-continuity assumptions are required. This allows us to cover examples such as equations with divergence-form and non-divergence-form drift, and Cahn--Hilliard-type equations with possibly singular perturbations. The main idea is to consider a suitable coloured Wiener noise so that both the solvability of the SPDE and the regularising effect of the Kolmogorov operator are preserved via stochastic maximal regularity results. As a by-product, this also allows us to generalise the available results of uniqueness by noise for perturbations of the heat equation to higher dimensions.</description>
