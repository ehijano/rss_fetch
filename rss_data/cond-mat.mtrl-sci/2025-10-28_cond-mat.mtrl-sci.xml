      <title>Vertex and front-tracking methods for the modeling of microstructure evolution at the solid state: a brief review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mesoscopic scale microstructure evolution modeling, two primary numerical frameworks are used: Front-Capturing (FC) and Front-Tracking (FT) ones. FC models, like phase-field or level-set methods, indirectly define interfaces by tracking field variable changes. On the contrary, FT models explicitly define interfaces using interconnected segments or surfaces. In historical FT methodologies, Vertex models were first developed and consider the description of the evolution of polygonal structures in terms of the motion of points where multiple boundaries meet. Globally, FT-type approaches, often associated with Lagrangian movement, enhance spatial resolution in 3D surfacic and 2D lineic problems using techniques derived from finite element meshing and remeshing algorithms. These efficient approaches, by nature, are well adapted to physical mechanisms correlated to interface properties and geometries. They also face challenges in managing complex topological events, especially in 3D. However, recent advances highlight their potential in computational efficiency and analysis of mobility and energy properties, with possible applications in intragranular phenomena.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Pores Play a Limited Role in Diffusion Through Hydrated Na-MMT: Insights from a Multiscale, Experimentally Anchored Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the interlayer diffusion dynamics in sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT), a smectite clay with significant applications in environmental science, pharmaceuticals, and advanced materials. We present a multiscale computational framework that integrates atomistic simulations with mesoscale modelling to explore the influence of interlayer and free pores on water and ion diffusion under varying dry densities (0.8--1.3 g/cm$^3$). The model incorporates experimentally determined platelet size distributions and explicitly accounts for polydispersity and anisotropic transport. The study results reveal that interlayer pores contribute minimally to overall water diffusion at the studied dry densities. Water diffusion predominantly occurs through free pores, with diffusion scaling factors closely aligning with experimental tritium tracer measurements when interlayer throttling was considered. The study also highlights the anisotropic nature of diffusion in Na-MMT, with diffusion parallel-to-compaction being significantly slower than in the normal direction which is consistent with experiments. The computational model, validated against lattice Boltzmann simulations and experimental data, provides insights into the geometric tortuosity and pore size distribution of Na-MMT. Despite its limitations, such as the absence of three-water minima energy profiles and rigid platelet assumptions, the model offers a robust framework for understanding nanoconfined diffusion. Future work will focus on refining interlayer energy profiles and incorporating flexible platelet dynamics to enhance predictive accuracy with implications for optimizing materials in environmental, industrial, and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism, Kagome Flat Band, and Weyl Fermion States in Magnetically Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) compounds have recently emerged as a promising platform for realizing unconventional quantum phases, enabled by their unique spin-split band structure at zero net magnetization. Here, we present a first-principles investigation of magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) of the form XY$_4$Z$_8$ (X $=$ Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, or V; Y $=$ Nb or Ta; and Z $=$ Se or S), identifying a subset of new versatile AM candidates. Our results establish a direct correlation between interatomic geometry, quantified by the ratio of interlayer to intralayer spacing, and the selection of magnetic ground states. Systems with A-type antiferromagnetic order exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting consistent with AM behavior. Crucially, the combination of the AM spin-splitting and the spin-orbit coupling leads to the emergence of Weyl nodes together with the corresponding topological Fermi arc surface states. Moreover, we identify flat bands near the Fermi level that originate from the intercalant-induced formation of an effective kagome-like sublattice in the TMD layer. These results collectively establish magnetically intercalated TMDs as a promising platform for engineering altermagnetism, flat bands, and Weyl fermions within a single material family, facilitating the development of topological and spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic transition in B2 Al-Cr-Co alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations, we investigate the recently reported magnetic transition in B2 Al-Cr-Co alloys. The Cr sublattice is alloyed with different amounts of Co in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) B2 AlCr binary alloy and the resulting exchange interactions are analyzed within the Heisenberg Hamiltonian framework. DFT results reveal that at low Co concentrations the system favors the AFM order, while at high Co contents a transition to the ferromagnetic (FM) state is observed. Within the FM stability field, the Curie temperature (TC), obtained within the mean-field approximation, is below ~160 K and decreases with Co concentration. The calculated exchange parameters evolve systematically with Co content, and the trends are consistent with the DFT total energies. The magnetic configurations obtained from MC simulations follow the DFT results at low Cr levels but predict a spin-glass behavior for alloys containing more than 40 at.% Co on Cr sublattice. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how the chemistry-driven changes in exchange interactions affect magnetism in the B2 Al-Cr-Co alloys.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of phase stability and magnetic properties of B2 AlCr, AlMn, AlFe, AlCo and AlNi aluminides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using ab initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we investigate the electronic structure, phase stability, and magnetic properties of equiatomic binary alloys between Al and 3d magnetic transition elements (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni). Thermodynamically, all five binary aluminides are more stable in the ordered B2 phase than in the disordered body centered cubic phase, and Co is found to be the strongest B2 forming element with Al. The AlCo and AlNi compounds with B2 structure are verified to be non-magnetic, whereas AlFe turns out to be weakly magnetic, which is consistent with other DFT calculations employing similar exchange-correlation approximations. Magnetic simulations based on the Heisenberg Hamiltonian predict an antiferromagnetic ground state for the hypothetical B2 AlCr, which is also confirmed by direct DFT calculations. Doping AlCr with Co leads to an antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition, where ferromagnetism is to a large extent attributed to Cr atoms. The phase stability and magnetic trends are explained using electronic structure arguments. The present findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the phase stability and magnetic properties of AlX binary alloys, providing insights into the formation mechanisms of the B2 structure with 3d magnetic transition metals.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the oxygen influence in cubic bixbyite In$_2$O$_3$ on Raman active phonon modes by isotope studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we performed comprehensive investigations on the Raman active phonon modes in cubic bixbyite In$_2$O$_3$, an important oxide based, wide-bandgap semiconductor. Fundamental insights into the lattice dynamics are revealed, by determining the atomistic contribution to all modes and their frequencies by density functional perturbation theory calculations. Those simulations were performed for different compositions of $^{16}$O and $^{18}$O isotope ratios, including their pure states. An increasing red-shift of the mode frequencies with increasing $^{18}$O content for all modes, due to the increased atomic mass, is revealed. For the seven lowest energy modes, this relative shift is below 1%, whereas for the remaining 15 higher energetic modes a shift of about 5.5% was identified. All modes have energy contributions of both indium and oxygen lattice sites, except for one, which corresponds to a pure oxygen vibrational state. Applying Raman spectroscopy, those results could be verified experimentally with excellent agreement. Investigated samples consisted of a bulk single crystal with $^{16}$O isotopes and a MBE grown thin film as the $^{18}$O sample. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry confirms the purity of the oxygen isotope in the sample. These isotopologue studies allow for a direct experimental access to fundamental material properties in cubic In$_2$O$_3$ by means of Raman spectroscopy. For example, we speculate, that the presence of oxygen vacancies in In$_2$O$_3$ would result in a shift of modes that are dominated by O-vibrations, e. g., $E_{g}^{(4)}$ or $A_{g}^{(4)}$, towards lower frequencies.</description>

      <title>Highly Tunable Phonon Polaritons via Metal Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons in van der Waals crystals offer mid-infrared light confinement deep below the diffraction limit, making them promising for nanophotonics applications. However, the practical use of phonon polaritons remains limited, in part due to the lack of precise control over the phonon polariton dispersion, as crystal lattice vibrations are often inert to external stimuli. Here, we address this challenge by zerovalent metal intercalation of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$. Photo-induced force microscopy shows that introducing tin into the van der Waals gap modulates the phonon polariton dispersion by up to $38.5\pm0.5\%$, which is the highest amount of tunability among non-mechanical modulation approaches, to the best of our knowledge. Intercalation with various metal species preserves the phonon polariton lifetimes, while modulating the dielectric permittivity in agreement with the density functional theory and analytical calculations. Our results establish metal intercalation as a practical route to reconfigurable mid-infrared nanophotonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals ferroelectrics are conventionally switched by sliding the different layers between stacking orders with opposing electric polarizations. Ultrashort laser pulses have been proposed to launch shear modes and induce switching, with often unfeasible large pulse energies however. Here, we demonstrate switching of ferroelectricity in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride through nonlinearly excited phonons. We show that the efficiencies of conventional coherent phonon excitation mechanisms, including infrared absorption and Raman scattering techniques, are too low to overcome the energy barrier separating the two ferroelectric states. We demonstrate instead that excitation of high-frequency intralayer modes leads to a tilting of the interlayer potential-energy landscape that enables changing the stacking order. Our results provide an avenue towards efficient phononic slidetronics, enabling ultrafast control of the stacking order in van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Functionalization of hBN with Lithium Oxalate: A Multifunctional Platform for Composites, Ion Transport, and Spin Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of multifunctional solid-state materials is key to advancing lithium-ion batteries with enhanced safety and simplified architectures. Here, we report a scalable, highly efficient (near $100\%$), solvent-free mechanochemical synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) functionalized with lithium oxalate (Li$_2$C$_2$O$_4$), yielding a novel lamellar composite that functions both as a lithium-ion conductor and separator. The high-energy milling process promotes exfoliation of hBN and covalent attachment of oxalate groups at edge and defect sites, forming a brown, nanocrystalline material with uniform lithium distribution. The composite exhibits room-temperature ionic and negligible electronic conductivity, thermal stability at least up to $350~^{\circ}$C, and hosts stable free radicals enabling its use as a spin label. The synthesis produces no byproducts and can be extended towards lithium doping via secondary mechanochemical steps, creating highly doped, chemically stable phases that host additional Li for ionic conduction. These results introduce a new class of lithium-rich, boron nitride-based solids for solid-state batteries, combining ion conduction, mechanical robustness, and thermal resilience in a single material platform.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and formation of antiferromagnetic textures in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ single crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report coherent X-ray imaging of antiferromagnetic (AFM) domains and domain walls in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, an intrinsic AFM topological insulator. This technique enables direct visualization of domain morphology without reconstruction algorithms, allowing us to resolve antiphase domain walls as distinct dark lines arising from the A-type AFM structure. The wall width is determined to be 550(30) nm, in good agreement with earlier magnetic force microscopy results. The temperature dependence of the AFM order parameter extracted from our images closely follows previous neutron scattering data. Remarkably, however, we find a pronounced hysteresis in the evolution of domains and domain walls: upon cooling, dynamic reorganizations occur within a narrow $\sim$1 K interval below $T_N$, whereas upon warming, the domain configuration remains largely unchanged until AFM order disappears. These findings reveal a complex energy landscape in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, governed by the interplay of exchange, anisotropy, and domain-wall energies, and underscore the critical role of AFM domain-wall dynamics in shaping its physical properties.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Enables Optimization of Diamond for Quantum Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spins in solid-state materials, molecules, and other chemical systems have the potential to impact the fields of quantum sensing, communication, simulation, and computing. In particular, color centers in diamond, such as negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV$^-$) and silicon vacancy centers (SiV$^-$), are emerging as quantum platforms poised for transition to commercial devices. A key enabler stems from the semiconductor-like platform that can be tailored at the time of growth. The large growth parameter space makes it challenging to use intuition to optimize growth conditions for quantum performance. In this paper, we use supervised machine learning to train regression models using different synthesis parameters in over 100 quantum diamond samples. We train models to optimize NV$^-$ defects in diamond for high sensitivity magnetometry. Importantly, we utilize a magnetic-field sensitivity figure of merit (FOM) for NV magnetometry and use Bayesian optimization to identify critical growth parameters that lead to a 300% improvement over an average sample and a 55% improvement over the previous champion sample. Furthermore, using Shapley importance rankings, we gain new physical insights into the most impactful growth and post-processing parameters, namely electron irradiation dose, diamond seed depth relative to the plasma, seed miscut angle, and reactor nitrogen concentration. As various quantum devices can have significantly different material requirements, advanced growth techniques such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) can provide the ability to tailor material development specifically for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field-Tunable Luttinger compensated antiferromagnetism in double CrCl2 chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luttinger compensated antiferromagnets (LcAFMs), combining spin polarization with vanishing net magnetization, offering distinct advantages for next-generation spintronic applications. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that conventional antiferromagnetic CrCl2 double chains can be transformed into one-dimensional LcAFMs under an external electric field, exhibiting pronounced isotropic spin splitting. The magnitude of the splitting, as well as the band gap, can be effectively tuned by both in-plane and out-of-plane fields, thereby providing greater controllability than in two-dimensional counterparts. To further enhance the tunability, we design a nearly lattice-matched CrCl2/MoTe2 heterostructure and uncover that interfacial charge transfer generates a built-in electric field, inducing spin splitting comparable to that driven by external fields. These results establish interfacial engineering as a highly efficient route to realize and manipulate LcAFM states in low-dimensional magnets, expanding the design principles for spintronic functionalities at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Thin-Film Thermal Conductivity due to Surface Roughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding thermal transport in silicon nanostructures is crucial for effective thermal management in semiconductor devices. In such nanostructures, boundary scattering can significantly reduce thermal conductivity. Diffusive boundary scattering explains the experimentally observed thickness dependence of thermal conductivity in thin films with thicknesses of tens of nanometers; however, introducing surface roughness further reduces the thermal conductivity, which falls far below the theoretical lower limit. In this study, we calculated the thermal conductivity and phonon transport properties of rough thin films with thicknesses of up to 25 nm using anharmonic lattice dynamics and investigated the mechanisms underlying the suppression of thermal conductivity arising from surface roughness. We found that in ultrathin films with rough surfaces, thermal conductivity was suppressed by a reduction in group velocity caused by hybridization with surface-localized modes, as well as a reduction in relaxation time due to the modulation of the anharmonic interatomic force constants of surface atoms. The reduction in group velocity significantly suppressed thermal conductivity across a wide range of thicknesses and surface-roughness values. In contrast, the reduction in relaxation time exhibited strong thickness dependence. Thus, this relaxation-time reduction should be considered in ultrathin films with roughness of approximately 0.1 nm and thicknesses below 5 nm. These thermal-conductivity suppression mechanisms due to surface roughness were not considered in the boundary-scattering model, resulting in an overestimation of the thermal conductivity of the roughened thin films by up to approximately 100%.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetic and optical properties of oxygen deficient TiO$_{2-\delta}$ nanoparticles synthesized by environment-friendly green route using whole plant extract of Phyllanthus niruri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report magnetic, optical and oxidation states of oxygen deficient TiO$_{2-\delta}$ nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by environment-friendly green route using Phyllanthus niruri (PN) whole plant extract instead of leaf extract. Rietveld refinement of room temperature XRD pattern confirms the formation of pure phase anatase TiO$_2$ crystals in a tetragonal structure with space group I41/amd. TEM and SEM microstructure shows agglomerated spherical shape NPs exhibiting average particle size $\sim$ 35~nm. FTIR result confirms the presence of biomolecules and functional group attached to the surface of TiO$_2$ NPs. The core level XPS of O-1s and Ti-2p confirms the presence of oxygen vacancies that leads to the mixed oxidation states of Ti (Ti$^{4+}$ and Ti$^{3+}$). UV-vis result shows a strong absorption peak ($\sim$ 250~nm) along with reduced optical band gap energy E$_g$ $\sim$ 2.75~eV, possibly arises due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) caused by lower band gap energy emerging from oxygen vacancies. Magnetization as a function of applied magnetic field shows ferromagnetic nature at room temperature [M$_S$ $\sim$ 0.029~emu/g and H$_C$ $\sim$ 0.0143~T]. The observed ferromagnetic behaviour can be understood by virtual hopping of electrons from Ti$^{3+}$(3d$^1$) to Ti$^{4+}$(3d$^0$)-sites, however, vice versa is prohibited.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-guided optimization of critical current in high-temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductors are essential for next-generation energy and quantum technologies, yet their performance is often limited by the critical current density ($J_c$), which is strongly influenced by microstructural defects. Optimizing $J_c$ through defect engineering is challenging due to the complex interplay of defect type, density, and spatial correlation. Here we present an integrated workflow that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations to autonomously identify optimal defect configurations that maximize $J_c$. In our framework, TDGL simulations generate current-voltage characteristics to evaluate $J_c$, which serves as the reward signal that guides the RL agent to iteratively refine defect configurations. We find that the agent discovers optimal defect densities and correlations in two-dimensional thin-film geometries, enhancing vortex pinning and $J_c$ relative to the pristine thin-film, approaching 60\% of theoretical depairing limit with up to 15-fold enhancement compared to random initialization. This RL-driven approach provides a scalable strategy for defect engineering, with broad implications for advancing HTS applications in fusion magnets, particle accelerators, and other high-field technologies.</description>

      <title>Paradoxical Topological Soliton Lattice in Anisotropic Frustrated Chiral Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional chiral magnets are known to host a variety of skyrmions, characterized by an integer topological charge. However, these systems typically favor uniform lattices as a thermodynamically stable phase composed of either skyrmions (Q = -1) or antiskyrmions (Q = 1). In isotropic chiral magnets, skyrmion-antiskyrmion coexistence is typically transient due to mutual annihilation, making the observation of a stable, long-range ordered lattice a significant challenge. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating a skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice as a magnetic field-induced topological ground state in chiral magnets with competing anisotropic interactions, specifically Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and frustrated exchange interactions. This unique lattice exhibits a net-zero global topological charge due to the balanced populations of skyrmions and antiskyrmions. Furthermore, density functional theory and spin-lattice simulations identify 2Fe/InSb(110) as an ideal candidate material for realizing this phase. This finding reveals new possibilities for manipulating magnetic solitons and establishes anisotropic frustrated chiral magnets as a promising material class for future spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric effect of multiferroic metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much is known about the magnetoelectric effect of multiferroic insulators, yet little is understood about multiferroic metals. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to identify the sliding van der Waals bilayer $1T$-NbTe$_2$ as a multiferroic metal, where in-plane metallicity coexists with out-of-plane polarization and magnetism. It exhibits linear magnetoelectric response, originating from direct spin-charge interactions as a result of external field-modulated Fermi energy, which differs from the spin-charge-lattice or spin-orbit coupling mechanisms in multiferroic insulators. We derive a universal formula for magnetoelectric coupling parameters of multiferroic metals, which highlights the crucial role of interlayer dielectric permittivity in enhancing performance. Our work provides insights for exploring magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms and designing functional materials with strong magnetoelectric coupling.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Photoinduced Carrier Transfer in Fluorinated Quasi-2D Perovskites Governing Enhanced Photocurrent Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) metal halide perovskites exhibit rich phase heterogeneity that profoundly influences light-matter interactions and charge transport. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing carrier transfer across distinct phases remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate effective electron-hole separation in fluorinated multilayered quasi-2D perovskite films nominally prepared for three layers, using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The films are revealed to comprise a heterogeneous phase distribution (with 1, 2, 3 layers and bulk) naturally stacked along the growth direction. Our ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, show the type-two band alignment between the small-n (layer number) phases and the bulk. This alignment drives charge separation via both direct and sequential carrier transfer mechanisms, whereby electrons preferentially migrate into the bulk domains while holes accumulate in the small-n layers, extending even to single layer phase-a process only rarely observed in previous studies. The nearly symmetric transfer times of electrons and holes yield an efficient and balanced spatial separation of carriers. Global target analysis employing a carrier transfer model quantitatively reproduces the spectral evolution, providing a rigorous validation of the mechanism. Nonetheless, we found photocurrent enhancement in the diode devices of this quasi-2D perovskite as a consequence of the efficient transfer of photocarriers in the opposite directions. This work delivers a comprehensive picture of interphase charge transfer in fluorinated quasi-2D perovskites and highlights strategies to engineer directional separation pathways for high-performance photovoltaic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Normal Dirac Semimetal Phase and Zeeman-Induced Topological Fermi Arc in PtSr5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pt-Sr binary intermetallics encompass a broad range of stoichiometries and crystal structures, stabilized by complex bonding and multivalent chemistry. The Sr-rich end member, PtSr5, is recently identified via artificial-intelligence-guided materials design as a body-centered tetragonal compound (I4/m). Using first-principles calculations, we show that PtSr5 hosts a Dirac semimetal phase with trivial Z2 topology, classified as a normal Dirac semimetal. A symmetry-indicator analysis based on parity eigenvalues at the eight time-reversal-invariant momenta confirms that all Z2 invariants-evaluated on time-reversal-invariant two-dimensional subspaces of momentum space with a direct band gap-are trivial, thereby establishing the topologically trivial nature of the Dirac semimetal phase. Nonetheless, our calculations reveal that applying an external Zeeman magnetic field along the z-axis drives the system into a Weyl semimetal phase, as corroborated by characteristic changes in the computed surface states. This work demonstrates the tunability of topological phases in PtSr5 via external perturbations and highlights the effectiveness of AI-based materials exploration in discovering new quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Switching between Skyrmions and Yoshimori Spin Spirals via Li Absorption in Janus Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral magnetic textures have attracted considerable attention owing to their topological properties and potential applications in spintronic devices. Here, we employ first-principles calculations together with atomic spin dynamics simulations to explore the switching between skyrmions and Yoshimori-type spin spirals induced by Li adsorption in Janus two-dimensional (2D) CrTeSe. We show that selective Li adsorption on either the Se- or Te-terminated surface stabilizes distinct magnetic phases: Li adsorption on the Se side favors a Yoshimori-type spin spiral, whereas adsorption on the Te side stabilizes the skyrmionic state. This contrast originates from site-dependent modifications of exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy (MA), and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In addition, the response of magnetic textures to out-of-plane magnetic fields differs strongly between the two systems. These results demonstrate that surface adsorption provides an effective strategy for reversible control of chiral magnetic states in 2D magnets, while also offering fundamental insights into the competing interactions that govern the stability of skyrmions and Yoshimori spin spirals. Our findings highlight the potential of Janus 2D materials as a versatile platform for engineering tunable spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Novel A2CrH6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) hydrides explored by first-principles calculations for hydrogen storage applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical study of a number of properties of A2CrH6 (where A = Ba, Sr, and Ca) hydride perovskites with the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP). These include structural, hydrogen storage, mechanical, phonon, thermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties. The lattice constants of the compounds studied are in the range from 7.220 {\AA} to 8.082 {\AA}, and they exhibit stable cubic crystal structures. Negative formation energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion and AIMD simulations testify to their thermodynamic, mechanical, dynamic and thermal stability, respectively. For the perovskite hydrides Ba2CrH6, Sr2CrH6 and Ca2CrH6, the corresponding specific hydrogen storage capacities are 1.82 wt.%, 2.69 wt.%, and 4.37 wt.%, respectively. Among these compounds, Sr2CrH6 exhibits the lowest applicable hydrogen desorption temperature, at 463.7 K. The electronic bands show remarkable spin activity, demonstrating that the change of A2+ cation (where A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) immediately influences the spin polarization and electronic behavior of hydride perovskites. On the basis of the elastic moduli studied, the mechanical behavior determines that Ca2CrH6 is the strongest material. The present results highlight the potential of A2CrH6 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) perovskite hydrides, in particular Ca2CrH6, for applications in advanced energy systems and hydrogen storage, as well as for electrical and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Guided Insights into Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Conductivity: Are Amorphous Lithium Fluorophosphates the Key?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of study, the identity of the dominant \ce{Li+}-conducting phase within the inorganic SEI of Li-ion batteries remains unresolved. While the mosaic model describes LiF/\ce{Li2O}/\ce{Li2CO3} nanocrystallites within a disordered matrix, these crystalline phases inherently offer limited ionic conductivity. Growing evidence suggests that interfaces, grain boundaries, and amorphous phases may instead host the primary fast-ion pathways. Motivated by mixed-anion electrolyte decomposition products, we combine diffusion-based generative structure prediction with machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to interrogate lithium difluorophosphate (\ce{LiPO2F2}), a key decomposition product of phosphorus- and fluorine-containing electrolytes. We identify a stable crystalline polymorph and, through MLIP-accelerated molecular dynamics, show that the amorphous counterpart is more conductive, with projected room-temperature $\sigma$ $\approx$ 0.18 mS cm$^{-1}$ and $E_\mathrm{a}$ $\approx$ 0.40 eV. This enhancement is attributed to structural disorder, which flattens the Li site-energy landscape, and to a low formation energy for Li-interstitial defects, which supplies additional mobile carriers. We present mixed-anion, amorphous Li--P--O--F phases as promising candidates for the \ce{Li+}-conducting medium of the inorganic SEI, offering a path forward for engineering improved battery interfaces.</description>

      <title>AQCat25: Unlocking spin-aware, high-fidelity machine learning potentials for heterogeneous catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for general-purpose heterogeneous catalysis modeling. There are, however, some limitations in what can be treated with these potentials because of gaps in the underlying training data. To extend these capabilities, we introduce AQCat25, a complementary dataset of 13.5 million density functional theory (DFT) single point calculations designed to improve the treatment of systems where spin polarization and/or higher fidelity are critical. We also investigate methodologies for integrating new datasets, such as AQCat25, with the broader Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset to create spin-aware models without sacrificing generalizability. We find that directly tuning a general model on AQCat25 leads to catastrophic forgetting of the original dataset's knowledge. Conversely, joint training strategies prove effective for improving accuracy on the new data without sacrificing general performance. This joint approach introduces a challenge, as the model must learn from a dataset containing both mixed-fidelity calculations and mixed-physics (spin-polarized vs. unpolarized). We show that explicitly conditioning the model on this system-specific metadata, for example by using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), successfully addresses this challenge and further enhances model accuracy. Ultimately, our work establishes an effective protocol for bridging DFT fidelity domains to advance the predictive power of foundational models in catalysis.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical quantum theory of demagnetization in L1$_0$ FePt and FePd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now well established that a laser pulse can demagnetize a
  ferromagnet. However, for a long time, it has not had an analytic
  theory because it falls into neither nonlinear optics (NLO) nor
  magnetism. Here we attempt to fill this gap by developing a
  nonlinear optical theory centered on the spin moment, instead of
  the more popular susceptibility. We first employ group theory to
  pin down the lowest order of the nonzero spin moment in a
  centrosymmetric system to be the second order, where the
  second-order density matrix contains four terms of sum frequency
  generation (SFG) and four terms of difference frequency generation
  (DFG). By tracing over the product of the density matrix and the
  spin matrix, we are now able to compute the light-induced spin
  moment. We apply our theory to FePt and FePd, two most popular
  magnetic recording materials with identical crystal and electronic
  structures. We find that the theory can clearly distinguish the
  difference between those two similar systems. Specifically, we
  show that FePt has a stronger light-induced spin moment than FePd,
  in agreement with our real-time ultrafast demagnetization
  simulation and the experimental results. Among all the possible
  NLO processes, DFGs produce the largest spin moment change, a
  manifestation of optical rectification. Our research lays a solid
  theoretical foundation for femtomagnetism, so the light-induced spin moment reduction can now be computed and compared among
  different systems, without time-consuming real-time calculations,
  representing a significant step forward.</description>

Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials have emerged as efficient tool for material simulation fields,yet their reliability for elastic property prediction remains unclear. Here we present a systematic benchmark of four uMLIPs-MatterSim, MACE, SevenNet, and CHGNet-against theoretical data for nearly 11,000 elastically stable materials from the Materials Project database. The results show SevenNet achieves the highest accuracy,MACE and MatterSim balance accuracy with efficiency, while CHGNet performs less effectively overall. This benchmark establishes a framework for guiding model selection and advancing uMLIPs in mechanical property applications.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap -- Imaging Buried Interfaces in Twisted Oxide Moir\'es</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to tune electronic structure in twisted stacks of layered, two-dimensional (2D) materials has motivated the exploration of similar moir\'e physics with stacks of twisted oxide membranes. Due to the intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) nature of bonding in many oxides, achieving atomic-level coupling is significantly more challenging than in 2D van der Waals materials. Although clean interfaces with atomic level proximity have been demonstrated in ceramic bicrystals using high-temperature and high-pressure processing to facilitate atomic diffusion that flattens rough interfaces, such conditions are not readily accessible when bonding oxide membranes. This study shows how topographic mismatch due to surface roughness of the membranes can restrict atomic-scale proximity at the interface to isolated patches even after obvious issues of contaminants and amorphous interlayers are eliminated. In hybrid interfaces between a chemically inert 2D material and an oxide membrane, the reduced ability of the 2D material to conform to the membrane's step-terrace topography also limits atomic-scale contact. In all these material systems, the interface morphology is best characterized using cross-sectional imaging and is necessary to corroborate investigations of interlayer coupling. When imaging the bicrystal in projection, conventional through-focal imaging is found to be relatively insensitive to the buried interface, whereas electron ptychography reliably resolves structural variations on the order of a nanometer. These findings highlight interface roughness as a key challenge for the field of oxide twistronics and emphasizes the need for reliable characterization methods.</description>

      <title>Amplified Photocurrent in Heterojunctions comprising Nano-rippled Zinc Oxide and Perovskite-inspired Cs3Cu2I5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular zero-dimensional (0D) halide perovskite-inspired cesium copper iodide (Cs3Cu2I5) is a highly promising candidate for optoelectronic applications due to their low toxicity, high stability, and intense blue emission. However, their intrinsically poor electrical conductivity, stemming from isolated conductive copper iodide tetrahedra by cesium atoms, severely limits charge transport which poses a critical challenge for optoelectronic applications. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to overcome this limitation by utilizing precisely optimized zinc oxide nanoripple structures within a lateral Cs3Cu2I5 photodetector (PD) architecture featuring interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). The ZnO nanoripple was systematically tuned to improve the percolation paths, providing efficient routes for photogenerated carriers to migrate to the IDEs. Consequently, the optimized heterojunctions comprising Cs3Cu2I5 and ZnO exhibited superior photocurrent compared to the pristine Cs3Cu2I5 counterparts. This nanostructure-mediated charge transport engineering strategy for lateral structured PDs offers a new pathway for utilizing low-conductivity 0D materials for conventional optoelectronics, next-generation Internet of Things sensor networks, and plausibly biosensing applications.</description>

      <title>LightPFP: A Lightweight Route to Ab Initio Accuracy at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic simulation methods have evolved through successive computational levels, each building upon more fundamental approaches: from quantum mechanics to density functional theory (DFT), and subsequently, to machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While universal MLIPs (u-MLIPs) offer broad transferability, their computational overhead limits large-scale applications. Task-specific MLIPs (ts-MLIPs) achieve superior efficiency but require prohibitively expensive DFT data generation for each material system. In this paper, we propose LightPFP, a data-efficient knowledge distillation framework. Instead of using costly DFT calculations, LightPFP generates a distilled ts-MLIP by leveraging u-MLIP to generate high-quality training data tailored for specific materials and utilizing a pre-trained light-weight MLIP to further enhance data efficiency. Across a broad spectrum of materials, including solid-state electrolytes, high-entropy alloys, and reactive ionic systems, LightPFP delivers three orders of magnitude faster model development than conventional DFT-based methods, while maintaining accuracy on par with first-principles predictions. Moreover, the distilled ts-MLIPs further sustain the computational efficiency essential for large-scale molecular dynamics, achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude faster inference than u-MLIPs. The framework further enables efficient precision transfer learning, where systematic errors from the u-MLIP can be corrected using as few as 10 high-accuracy DFT data points, as demonstrated for MgO melting point prediction. This u-MLIP-driven distillation approach enables rapid development of high-fidelity, efficient MLIPs for materials science applications.</description>

      <title>Topological Control of Transition Metal Networks for Reversible High-Capacity Li-rich Cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23098v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing high-energy-density batteries is essential for advancing sustainable energy technologies. However, leading cathode materials such as Li-rich oxides, including Li$_2$MnO$_3$, suffer from capacity loss due to irreversible oxygen release and structural degradation, both consequences of the oxygen redox activity that also enables their high capacity. The atomic-scale mechanisms behind this degradation, and whether it can be made reversible, remain open questions. Here, using submicrosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles accuracy, we directly visualize the entire charge-discharge cycle of Li$_2$MnO$_3$, uncovering the full lifecycle of the O$_2$-filled nanovoids responsible for degradation and identifying the critical size limit for voids to remain fully repairable upon discharge. Our results reveal that the topology of the Mn cation network is the key factor governing void growth, coalescence, and reparability. Based on a structural topology-informed design principle, we computationally develop a novel Li$_2$MnO$_3$ structure featuring a Mn lattice with a Kagome-like pattern, demonstrating full electrochemical reversibility even under extreme 80% delithiation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-energy cathodes, shifting the focus from mitigating damage to engineering inherent stability through atomic-level topological control of transition metal network.</description>

      <title>Thermal Transport in Ag8TS6 (T= Si, Ge, Sn) Argyrodites: An Integrated Experimental, Quantum-Chemical, and Computational Modelling Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Argyrodite-type Ag-based sulfides combine exceptionally low lattice thermal and high ionic conductivity, making them promising candidates for thermoelectric and solid-state energy applications. In this work, we studied Ag8TS6 (T= Si, Ge, Sn) argyrodite family by combining chemical-bonding analysis, lattice vibrational properties simulation, and experimental measurements to investigate their structural and thermal transport properties. Furthermore, we propose a two-channel lattice-dynamics model based on Gr\"uneisen-derived phonon lifetimes and compare it to an approach using machine-learned interatomic potentials. Both approaches are able to predict thermal conductivity in agreement with experimental lattice thermal conductivities along the whole temperature range, highlighting their potential suitability for future high-throughput predictions. Our findings also reveal a relationship between bond heterogeneity arising from weakly bonded Ag+ ions and occupied antibonding states in Ag-S and Ag-Ag interactions and strong anharmonicity, including large Gr\"uneisen parameters, and low sound velocities, which are responsible for the low lattice thermal conductivity of Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6, and Ag8SiS6. We furthermore show that thermal and ionic conductivities in all three compounds are independent of each other and can likely be tuned individually.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the delicate hidden conditions at the interface of 2D materials by advanced atomic force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The delicate interfacial conditions and behaviors play critical roles in determining the valuable physical properties of two-dimensional materials and their heterostructures on substrates. However, directly probing these complex interface conditions remains challenging. Here, we reveal the complex in-plane strain and out-of-plane bonding interface conditions in strain-engineered WS2 flakes by combined dual-harmonic electrostatic force microscopy (DH-EFM) and scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM). A significant contradiction is observed between the intrinsically compressive-strain-induced larger bandgap (lower electrical conductivity) detected by DH-EFM, and the higher electrical conductivity measured by sMIM. Comparative electrical conductivity measurements under different sMIM modes demonstrate that this contradiction arises from the tip-loading-force-induced dynamic puckering effect, which is modulated by interfacial bonding strength. Furthermore, the accumulation and release of electrical conductivity during forward/backward sMIM-contact measurements further confirmed the dynamic puckering effect, revealing the difference in interface conditions between open ring and closed ring regions of WS2. This work resolves the correlation between electrical properties and interface conditions, providing insights for interface-engineered devices.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed diffusion models for extrapolating crystal structures beyond known motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering materials with previously unreported crystal frameworks is key to achieving transformative functionality. Generative artificial intelligence offers a scalable means to propose candidate crystal structures, however existing approaches mainly reproduce decorated variants of established motifs rather than uncover new configurations. Here we develop a physics-informed diffusion method, supported by chemically grounded validation protocol, which embeds descriptors of compactness and local environment diversity to balance physical plausibility with structural novelty. Conditioning on these metrics improves generative performance across architectures, increasing the fraction of structures outside 100 most common prototypes up to 67%. When crystal structure prediction (CSP) is seeded with generative structures, most candidates (97%) are reconstructed by CSP, yielding 145 (66%) low-energy frameworks not matching any known prototypes. These results show that while generative models are not substitutes for CSP, their chemically informed, diversity-guided outputs can enhance CSP efficiency, establishing a practical generative-CSP synergy for discovery-oriented exploration of chemical space.</description>

      <title>A platform for zero-field isolated skyrmions: 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers on Re(0001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) combined with atomistic spin simulations, we explore the possibility of realizing zero-field isolated skyrmions in three 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers -- Rh/Co, Pd/Co, and Ru/Co -- grown on the Re(0001) surface. Our investigation employs an extended atomistic spin model, which goes beyond the standard model by including the multi-spin higher-order exchange interactions (HOI) in addition to the Heisenberg pairwise exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). All magnetic interactions of the extended spin model are calculated using DFT. The phase diagram obtained from atomistic spin simulations based on this spin model for Rh/Co and Pd/Co on Re(0001) reveals that isolated skyrmions emerge spontaneously on the ferromagnetic background even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The radius of zero-field isolated skyrmions in Rh/Co/Re(0001) is around 6 nm, whereas the radius of those skyrmions in Pd/Co/Re(0001) is about 12 nm. Transition-state theory calculations show that the skyrmions are protected by substantial energy barriers, approximately 150 meV, which predominantly arise from DMI, with a small contribution from the HOI interactions. The height of the barriers suggests that skyrmions could be observed in low-temperature experiments. Based on this work, we propose 4$d$/Co bilayers on Re(0001) as a new platform to realize nanoscale zero-field isolated skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Design principles for amorphous solid-state electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer unique advantages for next-generation batteries, but their rational design is hindered by an unclear structure-property relationship. This study establishes universal design principles through atomistic simulations of 32 amorphous Li-M-X systems (M = B, Al, Si, P; X = F, Cl, Br, I, O, S, Se, N). We identify four structure types governed by a rule that saturated M-X groups with more negative charges preferentially form M-X-M chains, identify paddle-wheel and cooperative migration as two favorable transport mechanisms that are significantly enhanced in amorphous structures. We also pinpoint Oxides and fluorides as optimal for electrochemical and hydrolytic stability, and reveal bulk modulus as a simple predictor for $Li^+$ mobility. These insights are integrated into a practical design diagram, providing a novel and valuable framework for advancing high-performance amorphous SSEs.</description>

      <title>All-Altermagnetic Tunnel Junction of RuO2/NiF2/RuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23269v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets-exemplified by experiment-feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistance of 11704%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% in both spin channels are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of electrode and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and no stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and zero magnetic moment, combining advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a realistically versatile platform to develop revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.</description>

      <title>User-defined Electrostatic Potentials in DFT Supercell Calculations: Implementation and Application to Electrified Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing electric fields into density functional theory (DFT) calculations is essential for understanding electrochemical processes, interfacial phenomena, and the behavior of materials under applied bias. However, applying user-defined electrostatic potentials in DFT is nontrivial and often requires direct modification to the specific DFT code. In this work, we present an implementation for supercell DFT calculations under arbitrary electric fields and discuss the required corrections to the energies and forces. The implementation is realized through the recently released VASP-Python interface, enabling the application of user-defined fields directly within the standard VASP software and providing great flexibility and control. We demonstrate the application of this approach with diverse case studies, including molecular adsorption on electrified surfaces, field ion microscopy, electrochemical solid-water interfaces, and implicit solvent models.</description>

      <title>Elastic modeling and total energy calculations of the structural characteristics of "free-standing",periodic, pseudomorphic GaN/AlN superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strain states of the components of pseudomorphic superlattices can be accurately modeled analytically through the application of linear elasticity. In this particular case of GaN/AlN 'free-standing' superlattices, the predictions derived from elastic modeling have been compared with total energy calculations of several systems made of components with varying thicknesses. We demonstrate that the elastic predictions for the lattice constants of the components align with the values obtained from their total energy counterparts, within the limits of computational errors and uncertainties. Furthermore, a phenomenological analysis of the elastic energy stored in the superlattices facilitates the evaluation of the excess energies associated with the interfaces present in these systems. The results mentioned above are briefly contrasted with findings reported in previous literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity and volume of data generated by high-throughput computational materials science require robust tools to ensure their accessibility, reproducibility, and reuse. In particular, integrating the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) into computational workflows is essential to enable open science practices. TribChem is an open source Python software developed for the automated simulation of solid-solid interfaces using density functional theory (DFT). While TribChem already incorporates several FAIR-aligned features, we present here a dedicated FAIR utility designed to transform TribChem results into FAIR-compliant datasets. This utility comprises two tools: fair_data.py, which automatically generates standardized machine- and human-readable outputs from the TribChem database, and retrieve_data.py, which facilitates efficient data extraction through a keyword-based interface. In this paper we show the capabilities of the fair utility with examples for bulk, surface, and interface systems. The implementation allows seamless integration with public repositories such as Zenodo, paving the way for reproducible research and fostering data-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport and the role of different scattering processes in the half-Heusler NbFeSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an ab initio computational investigation of the electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of one of the best performance half-Heusler (HH) alloys, NbFeSb. We use Boltzmann Transport equation while taking into account the full energy/momentum/band dependence of all relevant electronic scattering rates, i.e. with acoustic phonons, non-polar optical phonons (intra- and inter-valley), polar optical phonons (POP), and ionized impurity scattering (IIS). We use a highly efficient and accurate computational approach, where the scattering rates are derived using only a few ab initio extracted matrix elements, while we account fully for intra-/inter valley/band transitions, screening from both electrons and holes, and bipolar transport effects. Our computed thermoelectric power-factor (PF) values show good agreement with experiments across densities and temperatures, while they indicate the upper limit of PF performance for this material. We show that the polar optical phonon and ionized impurity scattering (importantly including screening), influence significantly the transport properties, whereas the computationally expensive non-polar phonon scattering part (acoustic and non-polar optical) is somewhat weaker, especially for electrons, and at lower to intermediate temperatures. This insight is relevant in the study of half-Heusler and other polar thermoelectric materials in general. Although we use NbFeSb as an example, the method we employ is material agnostic and can be broadly applied efficiently for electronic and thermoelectric materials in general, with more than 10x reduction in computational cost compared to fully ab initio methods, while retaining ab-initio accuracy.</description>

      <title>dynsight: an Open Python Platform for Simulation and Experimental Trajectory Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23493v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of complex many-body systems via analysis of the trajectories of the units that dynamically move and interact within them is a non-trivial task. The workflow for extracting meaningful information from the raw trajectory data is often composed of a series of interconnected steps, such as, (i) identifying and tracking the constitutive objects/particles, resolving their trajectories (e.g., in experimental cases, where these are not automatically available as in typical molecular simulations), (ii) translating the trajectories into data that are easier to handle/analyze by using well suited descriptors, and (iii) extracting meaningful information from such data. Each of these different tasks often requires non-negligible programming skills, the use of various types of representations or methods, and the availability/development of an interface between them. Despite the considerable potential that new tools contributed to each of these individual steps, their integration under a common framework would decrease the barrier to usage (especially by diverse communities of users), avoid fragmentation, and ultimately facilitate the development of new approaches in data analysis. To this end, here we introduce dynsight, an open Python platform that streamlines the extraction and analysis of time-series data from simulation - or experimentally - resolved trajectories. dynsight simplifies workflows, enhances accessibility, and facilitates time-series and trajectories data analysis offering a useful tool to unraveling the dynamic complexity of a variety of systems (or signals) across different scales. dynsight is open source (https://github.com/GMPavanLab/dynsight) and can be easily installed using pip.</description>

      <title>DeFecT-FF: Accelerated Modeling of Defects in Cd-Zn--Te-Se-S Compounds Combining High-Throughput DFT and Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants, impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.</description>

      <title>Laser Patterning of Superhydrophobic transparent glass surfaces with anti-fogging and anti-icing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the fabrication of transparent glass surfaces with superior water-repellence (i.e., superhydrophobicity), and related functional properties such as omniphobicity, anti-fogging and anti-icing responses. Surfaces have been processed by means of mild femtosecond laser patterning combined with the grafting of fluorinated tethered molecules. Controlling the laser scan and ablation conditions permits the fabrication of under-design grooves with cross and lineal morphologies and separations between 10 and 500 um. These patterns provide a high transparency and repellence to liquids and ice over large areas. The best performance is obtained for cross or parallel line patterned glass with microgrooves separated by 100 um and 15 um depth thanks to 5 laser scanning repetitions. These surfaces present a stable Cassie-Baxter wetting state and very low ice-adhesion strength while keeping up to 80 % of optical transmittance in the visible region. Anti-fouling tests, along with freezing and thawing cycles on these surfaces, have demonstrated a remarkable and durable self-cleaning response, even under environmentally stressful conditions. Water condensation experiments conducted under atmospheric conditions, as well as in an environmental electron scanning microscope, have revealed important issues related to the formation of supercooled water droplets. These experiments show that the patterned breakdown of surface properties effectively prevents extensive fogging and water accumulation. This feature is particularly crucial for outdoors and low temperature applications where the preservation of transparency is essential.</description>

      <title>Beam shaping techniques for pulsed laser ablation in liquids: Unlocking tunable control of nanoparticle synthesis in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoparticle synthesis via pulsed laser ablation in liquids has gained prominence as a versatile and environmentally friendly approach for producing ligand-free colloids with controlled composition, size, and morphology. While pulsed laser ablation in liquids offers unparalleled advantages in terms of nanoparticle purity and material versatility, enhancing the size control and productivity require modifications of the standard pulsed laser ablation in liquid technique such as the incorporation of beam shaping techniques. Recent developments in spatial and temporal beam shaping have demonstrated their potential to revolutionize pulsed laser ablation in liquids by enabling more precise energy deposition and modified nanoparticle production dynamics. This review highlights the critical role of beam shaping, encompassing spatial shaping of the beam to influence laser-material interaction, and temporal modification to optimize pulse duration and energy delivery. The current advancements in beam shaping techniques, their impact on the nanoparticle characteristics, and their broader implications for scaling pulsed laser ablation in liquids to meet industrial demands are highlighted, offering a comprehensive perspective on the future of this dynamic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marcus theory is fundamental to describing electron transfer reactions and quantifying their rates, effectively representing the energy surface associated with an electron transfer from the reactant to the product ionic state via parabolas within a reaction coordinate diagram. Here, we present an intuitive and computationally efficient generalised reaction coordinate amenable to molecular dynamics simulations. By utilising the nuclear charge of the ion, we are able to quantify in a targeted approach changes in the ion's solvation shell, thereby efficiently obtaining the free energy profile associated with the electron transfer, the transition state geometry and the evolution of the water network.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Study of Surface Wettability Effects on Pool Boiling of Water over Nanoscale Aluminum Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations were used to study pool boiling of water films on an ultra-thin planar aluminum substrate as well as the effect of surface wettability. The simulation geometry is a 10 nm-thick water film on an FCC aluminum substrate heated from 300 K to 900 K. The first peak acceleration onset time of the film, as the measure of the nucleation start, has been observed. The average heating rates of the near-wall water were 0.064, 0.048, and 0.035 K/ps for hydrophilic, neutral, and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. Boiling curves shows that the critical heat flux (CHF) equals 5216, 3979, and 2525 MW/m^2 at wall temperatures of 466, 502, and 561 K, respectively. The minimum heat flux (MHF, Leidenfrost point) is equal to 2157, 2463, and 2366 MW/m^2 at wall temperatures of 767, 784, and 746 K, respectively. Interfacial HTC remains higher for longer times under the hydrophilic condition, whereas Kapitza resistance is low initially but then increases sharply after transition to film boiling with the highest values for the hydrophobic surface. In general, the results demonstrate that engineering aluminum wettability towards intense hydrophilicity diminishes the explosive boiling point, increases CHF, and enhances nanoscale thermal management performance.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Materials Design via LLM-Guided Evolutionary Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties; and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics, energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation, memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

      <title>Mesoscopic Modeling of High-Density Carbon Nanotube Films for Memristive Device Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon nanotube (CNTs) materials, which exhibit intrinsically high electrical conductivity, are promising candidates for energy-efficient electronic devices. Recently, high-density CNT films have also been successfully employed as switching elements in non-volatile memory cells. However, the mechanism of electrical conduction through such complex systems is still poorly understood. To identify structural parameters that govern the electrical current in CNT films, we employed coarse-grained molecular dynamics to construct dense mesoscale CNT film models, where we considered CNTs with different chiralities and lengths. The effects of CNT geometrical features on the film morphologies were quantified by devising a set of structural descriptors and analyzing their mutual correlations. The impact of varying the concentration of amorphous carbon (aC) inclusions on the film structure was assessed. Finally, we employed a nodal analysis framework to compute the electrical current across the networks and correlate the charge transport characteristics to the underlying structural descriptors. Transport is found to be enhanced in films that exhibit high curvature and buckling, low bundling, and strong connectivity, with amorphous carbon components playing a nontrivial configuration-dependent role. These findings provide a framework for the rational design of CNT-based memristor architectures and highlight the potential of mesoscale modeling to guide the engineering of advanced nanostructured materials.</description>

      <title>Radiation enhanced diffusion in cartilages as a physical mechanism underlying radiation treatments of osteoarthritis and related disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22903v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Degradation of joint cartilages can result in osteoarthritis (OA) affecting about 10\% of the US population and responsible for significant hospitalization costs. While observations show that low dose radiation treatments (LDRT) bring improvements for a majority of OA patients, the underlying mechanism is not sufficiently understood. Here, we show how the radiation enhanced diffusion (RED) can boost the molecular transport in cartilages promoting cartilage self-healing rendering a mechanism for the observed positive LDRT effects on OA. Along with quantitative estimates for RED, we predict a related phenomenon of the electric charge build up that allows LDRT schedules promoting desirable types of molecular transports dominated by either positive or negative molecular species. Our analyses call upon further experimental verifications and clinical trials with curative rather than palliative intent. In addition to OA applications, our developed approaches can be useful for sports medicine dealing with damage or degeneration of the articular cartilages.</description>

      <title>Mastering energy landscapes via liquid liquid phase separation to program active supramolecular coassembly from the nano to macro scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy landscape dictates pathways and outcomes in supramolecular selfassembly, yet harnessing it from the nano to the macro scales remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate liquid liquid phase separation (LLPS) as a powerful tool to navigate and engineer the energy landscapes of coassembly systems comprising disordered proteins and peptides. We quantitatively map the energy barriers and transition states governing structural transitions, enabling predictive on off control of assembly and hierarchical order from nano to macro scales. By integrating supramolecular biofabrication, we achieve spatially organized architectures with life like non equilibrium behaviour. Crucially, assembly stability and scalable selfsorting are shown to depend on accessing minimum energy states, regardless of whether the co assembled structures are disordered or ordered. This work establishes energy landscape mediation via LLPS as a general framework for designing lifelike, hierarchically structured materials.</description>

      <title>LLM Meets Diffusion: A Hybrid Framework for Crystal Material Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities, effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints.

      <title>Robust and tuneable ion selectivity in vermiculite membranes intercalated with unexchangeable ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membranes selective to ions of the same charge are increasingly sought for wastewater processing and valuable element recovery. However, while narrow channels are known to be essential, other membrane parameters remain difficult to identify and control. Here we show that Zr$^{4+}$, Sn$^{4+}$, Ir$^{4+}$, and La$^{3+}$ ions intercalated into vermiculite laminate membranes become effectively unexchangeable, creating stable channels, one to two water layers wide, that exhibit robust and tuneable ion selectivity. Ion permeability in these membranes spans five orders of magnitude, following a trend dictated by the ions' Gibbs free energy of hydration. Unexpectedly, different intercalated ions lead to two distinct monovalent ion selectivity sequences, despite producing channels of identical width. The selectivity instead correlates with the membranes' stiffness and the entropy of hydration of the intercalated ions. These results introduce a new ion selectivity mechanism driven by entropic and mechanical effects, beyond classical size and charge exclusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of ionization potentials (IPs) is central to understanding molecular reactivity, redox behavior, and spectroscopic properties. While vertical IPs can be accessed directly from electronic excitations at fixed nuclear geometries, the computation of adiabatic IPs requires nuclear gradients of the ionized states, posing a major theoretical and computational challenge, especially within correlated frameworks. Among the most promising approaches for IP calculations is the many-body Green's function $GW$ method, which provides a balanced compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, it is applicable to both finite and extended systems. Recent work has established formal connections between $GW$ and coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) theory, leading to the first derivation of analytic $GW$ nuclear gradients via a unitary CCD framework. In this work, we present an alternative, fully analytic formulation of $GW$ nuclear gradients based on a modified version of the traditional equation-of-motion CCD formalism, enabling the inclusion of missing correlation effects in the traditional CCD methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic phase transitions between ordered phases are often understood on the basis of semi-classical spin models. Deviations from the classical description due to the quantum nature of the atomic spins as well as quantum fluctuations are usually treated as negligible if long-range order is preserved, and are rarely quantified for actual materials. Here, we demonstrate that a fully quantum-mechanical framework is required for a quantitatively correct description of the spin-flop transition in the insulating altermagnet hematite between the collinear antiferromagnetic and the weakly ferromagnetic spin-flop phase at low temperature. By applying both exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group theory to the quantum Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we show how a quantum-mechanical treatment of an ab initio parametrized spin model can significantly improve the predicted low-temperature spin-flop field over a classical description when compared to measurements. Our results imply that quantum fluctuations have a measurable influence on selecting the ground state of a system out of competing ordered magnetic phases at low temperature.</description>

Abstract: Porous microstructures, while central to many functional materials, remain difficult to characterize quantitatively by atom probe tomography (APT). Although several strategies have been proposed over the past decade, most remain constrained by significant practical or technical limitations. Here, we introduce an in situ pore filling approach that integrates seamlessly into conventional specimen preparation workflows. The method employs a vacuum compatible resin that is rapidly cured by the electron beam during standard ion beam based preparation, eliminating the need for additional instrumentation or extensive sample handling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using a porous SnSe + MXene electrode, a material system otherwise difficult to analyze via APT characterisation. This method offers a robust, accessible solution for extending APT analysis to porous materials</description>

      <title>High-Speed Imagery Analysis of Droplet Impact on Van der Waals and Non-Van der Waals Soft-Textured Oil-Infused Surfaces</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of surface functionalization, oil coating, and oil absorption on droplet impact behavior on textured polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) substrates. The textured surfaces were fabricated with square micro-posts having spacings of 5 and 20 microns. The PDMS samples were functionalized with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) to improve water repellency. Following, the surfaces were either coated with or allowed to absorb two different lubricants, silicone oil (SO-5cSt) and hexadecane. We performed detailed wetting measurements on both untreated and OTS-functionalized substrates. These measurements provided useful insights into how water and lubricants were retained and distributed under static conditions. High-speed imaging was used to capture droplet impact across a range of Weber numbers. On SO-5cSt-absorbed substrates, droplets consistently showed complete rebound at all Weber numbers, regardless of post spacing. This robust rebound was attributed to the oil's ability to fill the gaps between the posts through capillary action, while also forming a stable lubricating layer above the texture. This thin oil film reduced friction between the droplet and the surface, enabling the droplet to retain sufficient energy for complete rebound. In contrast, hexadecane-absorbed substrates displayed different dynamics. At low Weber numbers, only partial rebound was observed, while at intermediate values, droplets rebounded completely. However, droplets no longer rebounded at higher Weber numbers and remained deposited. Repeated droplet impacts further demonstrated that hexadecane-infused surfaces gradually lost oil from the textured gaps, resulting in a decline in rebound performance over time. This effect was not observed with SO-5cSt, underscoring the importance of lubricant affinity and stability.</description>

      <title>Prediction of a topological phase transition in exchange alternating spin-1 nanographene chains</title>

Abstract: The use of magnetic nanographenes as building blocks for artificial spin lattices is enabling the exploration of flagship model Hamiltonians of one-dimensional quantum magnetism with an unprecedented degree of control. The spin-1 Heisenberg model, incorporating both linear and quadratic exchange interactions, was first realized using [3]-triangulenes, where the hallmark Haldane phase with spin fractionalization was observed. Later, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian with exchange alternation was realized with Clar's goblets, where two additional topological phases were identified. Here we show that spin-1 nanographenes can also be used to explore the topological phase transition between the Haldane phase and a dimerized phase predicted for spin-1 chains with bond-alternation. We first study how the boundary of the phase transition is modified by non-linear exchange, known to be present in spin-1 nanographenes, using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Combining multiconfigurational with first-principles calculations, we propose two candidates to realize different topological phases of the model: a recently synthesized extended Clar's goblet, and a passivated [4]-triangulene. Moreover, we show how these two phases can be identified experimentally using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). This work paves the way for the experimental realization of these topological phases, which can be locally probed with scanning tunneling microscopy.</description>

      <title>A First Experiment at Interfacing Crystal Plasticity and Continuum Dislocation Dynamics</title>

Abstract: A computational approach has been developed for the analysis of the properties of 3D dislocation substructures generated by the vector density continuum dislocation dynamics (CDD), within the framework of crystal plasticity. In the CDD framework, the dislocation density on the individual slip systems is represented by vector fields with a unique dislocation line direction at each point in space. The evolution of these density fields is governed by a set of transport-reaction equations coupled with crystal mechanics. This detailed picture of the dislocation system enables mesoscale plasticity simulations based on dislocation properties at the lattice level. In the current work, a computational approach based on streamline construction is proposed to obtain the statistical properties of the dislocation substructures generated by CDD. Streamlines are obtained by travelling along the tangent of the vector density and velocity fields of the dislocation system, which enables us to construct the dislocation lines and their paths in the deformed crystal in 3D. The streamlines are computed by numerical integration of a set of partial differential equations for the parameterized tangent fields. Here, we use this approach to extract microstructure parameters from the CDD simulations that are relevant to substructure-sensitive crystal plasticity models. These parameters include the mean free path and average mobile dislocation segment length, as well as the dislocation wall volume fraction, together with the corresponding distributions. The results show that, past a short initial rise during monotonic loading, both the mobile dislocation segment length and dislocation mean free path decrease with the applied strain, which is consistent with the models used in the crystal plasticity literature.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising platforms for quantum technologies and optoelectronics, with defects playing a crucial role in their properties. We present a comprehensive density functional theory study of silicon and carbon vacancies in monolayer silicon carbide (1L-SiC), a wide-bandgap 2D semiconductor with potential for room-temperature quantum applications. Using PBE, SCAN, r$^2$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals, we reveal distinct characteristics between Si and C vacancies. Formation energies and charge transition levels show strong functional dependence, with HSE06 consistently predicting higher values and deeper transition levels compared to PBE calculations. Electronic structure analysis demonstrates contrasting behavior: silicon vacancies create highly localized states with strong spin polarization, while carbon vacancies produce more dispersed states with weaker magnetic properties. Vacancy migration studies reveal significantly lower barriers for silicon vacancies compared to carbon vacancies, indicating higher mobility for Si vacancies at moderate temperatures. Optical properties, calculated using PBE-DFPT, show distinct charge-state dependent absorption in the far-infrared region, with positively charged states of both vacancy types demonstrating the strongest response. The complementary characteristics of Si and C vacancies - localized versus dispersed states, different magnetic properties, and distinct optical responses - suggest possibilities for defect engineering in quantum and optoelectronic applications. Our results highlight the critical importance of advanced functionals in accurately describing defect properties and provide a comprehensive framework for understanding vacancy behavior in 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: Ab initio techniques have revolutionised the way in which theory can help practitioners to explore critical mechanisms that govern reactions or properties, and to develop new strategies for materials discovery and design. Yet, their application to electrochemical systems is still limited, due to the challenges electronic structure calculations face in achieving a realistic description of electrified solid/liquid interfaces including, e.g., potential and pH control or free energies of barrier configurations. A well-known example of how novel concepts can extend the scope of simulations is the development of thermostats, which introduced temperature control to electronic structure Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The analogous technique for modelling electrochemical systems - potential control, inherent to most electrochemical experiments - is just emerging. In this review, we critically discuss state-of-the-art approaches to describe electrified interfaces between a solid electrode and a liquid electrolyte in realistic environments. By exchanging energy, electronic charge and ions with their environment, electrochemical interfaces are thermodynamically open systems. In addition, large fluctuations of the electrostatic potential and field occur on the time and length scales relevant to chemical reactions. We systematically discuss the key challenges in incorporating these features into realistic ab initio simulations, as well as the available techniques and approaches to overcome them, in order to facilitate the development and use of these novel techniques by the wider community. These methodological developments provide researchers with a new level of realism to explore fundamental electrochemical mechanisms and reactions from first principles.</description>

      <title>P-orbital spin generator with large spin Hall angle and long spin diffusion length</title>

Abstract: High density data storage and spin-logic devices require highly efficient all-electric control of spin moments. So far, charge-to-spin conversion through the spin Hall effect (SHE) highly limits to d-orbital materials associated with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), especially heavy metals. However, d-orbital heavy metals with strong SOC results in a short spin diffusion length, which restricts the spin transport and accumulation in spintronic devices. Therefore, it is urgent to discovery new SHE materials with both large spin Hall conductivity and high spin transport ability beyond d-orbital materials. Here, we experimentally report a large charge to spin conversion in a p-orbital In2Bi alloy, exhibiting the coexistence of a large spin Hall angle and a long spin diffusion length (4 times that of Pt). Our first-principles calculations reveal that small gap openings near the Fermi level lead to large Berry curvature-related spin Hall conductivity. Due to the delocalized nature of p-orbitals of In2Bi, its spin current can overcome the physical barriers between spin Hall angle and spin diffusion length in d-orbital metals, thereby advancing the development of high performance spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Beyond surfaces: quantifying internal radiative heat transport in dense materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While phonons and electrons are well-established heat carriers in solids, photons are typically associated only with radiative transfer between surfaces. Yet for over 70 years, theorists have speculated that thermal photons could also conduct heat within dense, opaque materials -- an idea that has remained unproven and unquantified. Here, we resolve this longstanding question by developing a first-principles framework that reveals and quantifies the internal radiative contribution to thermal conductivity in solids. By analyzing 15 crystalline materials, we uncover photon mean free paths (MFPs) ranging from $\sim$100$\mu$m to over 1cm, with some materials exhibiting surprisingly large radiative thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{rad}}$). Contrary to common assumptions, we show that $\kappa_{\text{rad}}$ can scale steeply with temperature (from $T^{1}$ to $T^{4}$), even as MFPs decrease (from $T^{-0.3}$ to $T^{-3}$). We also discover a robust link between photon MFP and phonon linewidths, revealing an unexpected interplay between radiative and phononic heat transport. Crucially, we establish a general formalism to calculate $\kappa_{\text{rad}}$ across arbitrary sample thicknesses and surface emissivities -- bridging ballistic and diffusive regimes. Our findings overturn long-held assumptions, uncover a missing channel of heat conduction, and provide a powerful new tool for thermal management in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Phonon dephasing times determined with time-delayed, broadband CARS</title>

Abstract: Coherent Raman scattering techniques as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), offer significant advantages in terms of pixel dwell times and speed as compared to spontaneous Raman scattering for investigations of crystalline materials. However, the spectral information in CARS is often hampered by the presence of a non-resonant contribution to the scattering process that shifts and distorts the Raman peaks. In this work, we apply a method to obtain non-resonant background-free spectra based on time-delayed, broadband CARS (TD-BCARS) using an intra-pulse excitation scheme. In particular, this method can measure the phononic dephasing times across the full phonon spectrum at once. We test the methodology on amorphous SiO2 (glass), which is used to characterize the setup-specific and material-independent response times, and then apply TD-BCARS to the analysis of single crystals of diamond and ferroelectrics of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) and potassium titanyl arsenate (KTA). For diamond, we determine a dephasing time of t = 7.81 ps for the single sp3 peak.</description>

      <title>A common origin of photoplastic and electroplastic effects in ZnS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dislocation motion--the atomic-scale mechanism of crystal plasticity--governs the strength and ductility of materials. In functional materials, external stimuli beyond mechanical stress can also affect dislocation glide. In the wide band gap semiconductor ZnS, optical illumination suppresses plasticity, whereas electric fields can enhance dislocation motion. Here, we show that the common underlying mechanism for these phenomena is the charged dislocations that respond to the changes in carrier concentration. Our prior theoretical work showed that locally charged dislocations in ZnS trap excess carriers, triggering core reconstructions that modify their mobility, with the positively charged Zn-rich core dislocations showing the most drastic change. Here, we validate this prediction experimentally by showing that either optical excitation or electronic doping selectively inhibits the glide of Zn-rich dislocations in epitaxially grown ZnS. First, imaging individual interface misfit dislocations under different optical excitation conditions shows that Zn-core glide is strongly reduced as optical power is increased, while the S-core dislocations show negligible sensitivity to light, marking the first, single misfit dislocation imaging of the photoplastic effect. Next, we show that a similar behavior is observed with direct electron (n-type) doping of ZnS epitaxial layers grown beyond the critical thickness. As the n-type dopant density is increased, the resulting Zn-core dislocation density is reduced by more than one order of magnitude, while the S-core density remains essentially unchanged, causing a sign reversal of the strain-anisotropy with n-type doping. These results demonstrate a common origin for the opto-electronic sensitivity of dislocations in ZnS and provide a pathway for the engineering of dislocation content in compound semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Flexoelectric Polarization Enhancement in Paraelectric $\mathrm{BaHfO_3}$ via Strain Gradient Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity - polarization induced by strain gradients - offers a route to polar functionality in centrosymmetric dielectrics, where traditional piezoelectric effects are absent. This study investigates the flexoelectric effect in epitaxial $\mathrm{BaHfO_3}$ (BHO) thin films, a centrosymmetric and paraelectric perovskite. While a large lattice mismatch induces defect-driven relaxation, a coherently grown BHO film undergoes elastic relaxation, forming intrinsic strain gradients exceeding $10^5\ \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. A 29-fold enhancement in spontaneous polarization is observed at an electric field of $4\ \mathrm{MV\,cm}^{-1}$ for BHO exhibiting a strain gradient compared to relaxed BHO. This enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric coupling, which is isolated from ferroelectric and piezoelectric contributions due to the centrosymmetric nature and the absence of phase transitions in BHO. The findings establish a clear link between engineered strain gradients and enhanced polarizability in oxide thin films, offering a benchmark system for deconvoluting the flexoelectric effect from other polar effects. These results provide a basis for exploiting flexoelectricity in dielectric devices and advance the fundamental understanding of strain-coupled phenomena in functional oxides.</description>

Abstract: Developing materials with tailored mechanical performance requires iteration over a large number of proposed designs. When considering dynamic fracture, experiments at every iteration are usually infeasible. While high-fidelity, physics-based simulations can potentially reduce experimental efforts, they remain computationally expensive. As a faster alternative, key dynamic properties can be predicted directly from microstructural images using deep-learning surrogate models. In this work, the spallation of ductile polycrystals under plate-impact loading at strain rates of O(10^6 s^-1) is considered. A physics-based numerical model that couples crystal plasticity and a cohesive zone model is used to generate data for the surrogate models. Three architectures - 3D U-Net, 3D Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-3D), and U-FNO were trained on the particle-velocity field data from the numerical model. The generalization of the models was evaluated using microstructures with varying grain sizes and aspect ratios. U-FNO and 3D U-Net performed significantly better than FNO-3D across all datasets. Furthermore, U-FNO and 3D U-Net exhibited comparable accuracy for every metric considered in this study. However, training the U-FNO requires almost twice the computational effort compared to the 3D U-Net, making it a desirable option for a surrogate model.</description>

Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) provides nontrivial bounds among physical quantities, as exemplified by the metric-curvature inequality. In this paper, we investigate various bounds for different observables through certain generalizations of the QGT. First, we demonstrate that bounds hold for all linear responses, which are produced by a QGT extended to many-body states, finite temperature, and general parameter space. As an application, we show the thermodynamic inequality originating from the convexity of free energy can be further tightened. Second, we establish a bound between the Drude weight and the orbital magnetization. The equality is exactly satisfied in the Landau level system, and systems with nearly flat bands tend to approach equality as well. We apply the resulting inequality to two orbital ferromagnets and support that the twisted bilayer graphene system is close to the Landau level system. Moreover, we show that an analogous inequality also holds for a higher-order multipole, magnetic quadrupole. Finally, we discuss the analogy between the QGT and the uncertainty principle, emphasizing that the existence of nontrivial bounds necessarily reflects quantum effects.</description>

Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, is discussed. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature, in accordance with previous investigations. An almost linear variation of the third-order elastic modulus with temperature is demonstrated, revealing opposite trends for uniaxial loadings along the armchair or the zigzag direction. The detailed dependence of the distributions of bond lengths and bond angles both on strain and temperature is presented for the first time, along with approximate analytical expressions. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>Nature of field-induced transitions and hysteretic magnetoresistance in non-collinear antiferromagnet EuIn2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the magnetic and electrical transport properties of the hexagonal EuIn2As2 compound, combining experimental and theoretical results. This compound is predicted to be an axion-insulator from an electronic point of view and an altermagnet while in the collinear magnetic phase. However, experiments indicate that the Fermi level lies within the valence band rather than in the topological gap, potentially leading to the dominance of magnetic properties. Our detailed studies on magnetization and electrical transport support the presence of a broken-helix antiferromagnetic state, which was previously identified by X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. Notably, we observed within that state a field-induced metamagnetic transition marked by a large hysteresis in magnetoresistance, which turns into a sharp upturn for the magnetic field tilted by 15 degree from the c-axis of the crystal. Combined with theoretical calculations, it is explained that the application of a magnetic field changes the low-resistivity antiferromagnetic domain walls to the high-resistivity domain walls due to the reduction in the Fermi surface sheets interaction area in the domain walls, originating from p-orbitals of As. EuIn2As2, therefore, presents a new case study that broadens the understanding of complex magnetic structures and their influence on electrical transport.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Prediction of Magnetic Proximity Effect in van der Waals Heterostructures: From Atoms to Moir\'e</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning framework that efficiently predicts large-scale proximity-induced magnetism in van der Waals heterostructures, overcoming the high computational cost of density functional theory (DFT). We apply it to graphene/\CGT, which exhibits a previously unrecognized dichotomy. Unlike the spin polarization at the Fermi level, which follows the pseudospin, the proximity-induced magnetic moments vary across carbon atoms, defying analytical modeling. To address this, we develop an ensemble-based regression model trained on DFT data and employ local environment descriptors to map the local ($\sim 2$\,nm$^2$) atomic-scale geometry to the carbon magnetic moments. Besides demonstrating locality, the model reveals rich magnetic moir\'e textures. Crucially, this method can be broadly applied to orbital and spin proximity effects that are highly sensitive to local atomic environments and are beyond analytical description.</description>

      <title>Physically Interpretable Descriptors Drive the Materials Design of Metal Hydrides for Hydrogen Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density $w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed Digital Hydrogen Platform (\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design maps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and $P_{\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive elements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type hydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite trend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare candidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to the unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models indicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching these benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for materials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery of materials in complex chemical spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a differentiation framework for plane-wave density-functional theory (DFT) that combines the strengths of forward-mode algorithmic differentiation (AD) and density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). In the resulting AD-DFPT framework derivatives of any DFT output quantity with respect to any input parameter (e.g. geometry, density functional or pseudopotential) can be computed accurately without deriving gradient expressions by hand. We implement AD-DFPT into the Density-Functional ToolKit (DFTK) and show its broad applicability. Amongst others we consider the inverse design of a semiconductor band gap, the learning of exchange-correlation functional parameters, or the propagation of DFT parameter uncertainties to relaxed structures. These examples demonstrate a number of promising research avenues opened by gradient-driven workflows in first-principles materials modeling.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Based Optical Thermometry Using Photoluminescence and Raman Spectra of Diamonds Containing SiV Centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro- and nanothermometry enable precise temperature monitoring and control at the micro- and nanoscale, and have become essential diagnostic tools in applications ranging from high-power microelectronics to biosensing and nanomedicine. Most existing techniques rely on secondary micro- and nanothermometers that require individual calibration of each sensor, ideally both off- and in-situ, before use. We present an alternative approach that overcomes this limitation by employing fluorescent diamonds containing silicon-vacancy centers, where the thermo-sensitive physical quantities are the centers' photoluminescence and the diamond host's Raman signals. The photoluminescence and Raman data are analyzed using two multi-feature regression algorithms that leverage a minimal number of calibration diamonds and temperature set points to predict the temperature of previously unseen diamonds. Using this approach, the models achieve accuracies as low as 0.7 K, resolutions down to 0.6 K Hz$^{-1/2}$, and sensitivity as high as 0.04 K$^{-1}$. These correspond to improvements of roughly 70 percent (over threefold) in accuracy, 50 percent (twofold) in resolution, and 567 percent (sevenfold) in sensitivity compared with traditional single-feature models. Our approach is particularly suited to applications where pre-deployment calibration of every thermosensor is impractical, and it is generalizable to any thermometry platform with two or more simultaneously measurable temperature-dependent observables.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Modeling of Abnormal Grain Growth: Role of Solute Segregation and Grain Boundary Character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abnormal grain growth (AGG) influences the properties of polycrystalline materials; however, the underlying mechanisms, particularly the role of solute segregation at the grain boundary (GB), are difficult to quantify precisely. This study demonstrates a multiscale framework that integrates atomic-scale segregation energetics (using density functional theory) with mesoscale grain growth dynamics (using phase-field model) to investigate AGG, using $\alpha$-Fe as an example system. Multisite segregation energies are calculated for symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) along the $\langle 110 \rangle$ axis for nine different solutes (Co, Cr, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Ti, W, and V), encompassing three different types of coincident site lattice (CSL) boundaries: $\sum 3 (11\bar{2})$, $\sum 9 (\bar{2}21)$, and $\sum 3 (\bar{1}11)$. The model takes into account the effect of solute drag on GB mobility, estimated using a bulk solute concentration of 0.1 at\%. The results demonstrate that AGG originates due to GB anisotropy, the extent of which largely depends on the type of solute atom present. Such a complex dependence necessitates using a multiscale model to understand AGG comprehensively. In general, low-energy $\Sigma 3$ boundaries are found to have higher mobility and show preferential growth for most of the solutes, other than Co. The study reveals how the distribution of GB types significantly influences AGG. When 10-30\% of the GBs are high-mobility type, crown-like morphologies are observed, leading to AGG. These findings underscore the critical role of GB chemistry and crystallography in governing AGG, and the model can be generalized to provide a predictive framework for controlling grain growth through strategic solute design in advanced alloys.</description>

Abstract: The Landau-Brazovskii model provides a theoretical framework for describing various phases arising from competing short- and long-range interactions in many physical systems. In this work, we investigate phase transitions among various ordered phases within the three-dimensional Landau-Brazovskii model. We construct the phase diagram of this model, which encompasses eight distinct phases, and systematically compute the transition pathways connecting various metastable and stable states using the Landau-Brazovskii saddle dynamics. Along each transition pathway, the critical nucleus is identified with some detailed analyses of its shape, energy barrier, and Hessian eigenvalues. Furthermore, we explore how the transition state is influenced by model parameters, revealing systematic trends in critical nucleus sizes and energy barrier heights. Our results provide a comprehensive characterization of the nucleation mechanisms within the Landau-Brazovskii model and offer valuable insights into the structural transformations of modulated-phase systems.</description>

      <title>E2Former: An Efficient and Equivariant Transformer with Linear-Scaling Tensor Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Cs, Rb) have become a fascinating materials platform following the discovery of many novel quantum states due to the interplay between electronic correlation, topology, and geometry. Understanding their physical origin requires constructing effective theories that capture the low-energy electronic structure and electronic interactions. While the band structure calculated by density functional theory (DFT) broadly agrees with experiments in the unbroken symmetry phase, the multiorbital nature challenges a proper understanding of the band structure and its description by tight-binding models. Here, we point out the unusual and puzzling properties of the DFT electronic structure, including the sublattice type of the van Hove singularities, the geometric shape of the Fermi surface, and the orbital content of the low-energy band dispersion, which cannot be described by the commonly used one-orbital or multiorbital kagome tight-binding models. We address these fundamental puzzles and develop an extended Slater-Koster formalism that can successfully resolve these issues. We discover the important role of site-symmetry and interorbital hopping structure and provide a concrete multiorbital tight-binding model description of the electronic structure for $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and the family of ``135'' compounds with other transition metals. This is a crucial step toward studying the effects of electron-electron interactions for the correlated and topological states in kagome metals and superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions are considered a key component of dark matter, characterized by very weak couplings to fermions and Chern-Simons couplings to gauge fields. We propose a novel detection mechanism based on symmetry-breaking magnetoelectric materials with a linear axionic coupling between magnetization and ferroelectric polarization. The focus is on a strain gradient Sr2IrO4 film, where the breaking of space-inversion symmetry results in an emergent polar phase and an out-of-plane magnetic moment, exhibiting a flexomagnetoelectric effect. In this material, the linear P||M enables a direct coupling between the external axion field and the intrinsic axion-like field, which amplifies the weak electromagnetic signals induced by axions, paving the way for pioneering axion detection. In contrast to conventional detection techniques, this mechanism is expected to enhance the sensitivity of the axion-electron and axion-photon coupling, providing a novel platform for axion detection and advancing the study of dark matter through the magnetoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Theory of bound magnetic polarons in cubic and uniaxial antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent debate about the origin of remanent magnetization and the corresponding anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets and altermagnets, a theory of bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) in anisotropic antiferromagnetic semiconductors is developed. The theory describes quantitatively the experimentally observed magnitude of excess magnetization and its dependence on the magnetic field in cubic antiferromagnetic EuTe. In contrast to the cubic case, our theory predicts the presence of magnetization hysteresis below N\'eel temperature in antiferromagnets with uniaxial anisotropy. We show, employing material parameters implied by experimental and ab initio results, that the magnitudes of remanent magnetization and the coercive field are in accord with recent experimental observations for altermagnetic hexagonal MnTe. While the altermagnets have an intrinsic contribution to the remanent magnetization and the anomalous Hall effect, our theory explains the origin of an extrinsic contribution. Our findings address, therefore, a question about the relative contribution to the remanent magnetization of bound magnetic polarons and weak ferromagnetism driven by the antisymmetric exchange interaction, the latter weakened by the formation of antiferromagnetic domains. Furthermore, we provide the theory of BMP spontaneous spin splitting, which can be probed optically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the glass transition, the characteristic relaxation time (e.g., the alpha-relaxation time in dielectric spectroscopy) of a glass-former exhibits a strongly super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, as compared to the classical Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures. A comprehensive description of both regions thus requires five parameters. Here, we demonstrate that many glass-formers exhibit a universal scaling, with only two material-specific parameters setting the timescale and the temperature scale; the other three being universal constants. Furthermore, we show that the master curve can be described by the recently developed two-state, two-(time) scale (TS2) theory (Soft Matter 2020, 16, 810) and regress the universal TS2 parameters. We also show the connection between the TS2 model and the Hall-Wolynes elastic relaxation theory.</description>

      <title>Information in 4D-STEM: Where it is, and How to Use it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrast transfer mechanisms for electron scattering have been extensively studied in transmission electron microscopy. Here we revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism from scattering theory to understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data, and consequently identify new imaging modes that can also serve as crude but fast approximations to ptychography. We show that tilt correction and summation of the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk -- corresponding to tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) respectively -- enables aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that makes maximal use of the 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond the WPOA, we identify the contrast transfer from the interference between inelastic/plural scattering electrons, which show up as quadratic terms, and show that under overfocus conditions, contrast can be further enhanced at selected frequencies, similar to phase-contrast TEM imaging. There is also usable information encoded in the dark field region which we demonstrate by constructing a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) that sums up the incoherent scattering components and holds promise for depth sectioning of strong scatterers. This framework generalizes phase contrast theory in conventional/scanning transmission electron microscopy to 4D-STEM and provides analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography, which blindly exploits all above contrast mechanisms.</description>

      <title>FDTRImageEnhancer: Combining Physics-Informed Deconvolution and Microstructure-Aware Deep Learning to Enhance Thermal Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</description>

      <title>Automated Constitutive Model Discovery by Pairing Sparse Regression Algorithms with Model Selection Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The automated discovery of constitutive models from data has recently emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional model calibration paradigm. In this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression (LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost. While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the $\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for $\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform consistently well in discovering isotropic and anisotropic materials, yielding highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range of viable discovery algorithms beyond $\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO.</description>

      <title>Topological surface magnon-polariton in an insulating canted antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface magnon-polariton as a new approach in the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating canted antiferromagnet, where strong-coupled magnon-photon modes can be achieved using electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands. Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilization of optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its experimental feasibility and wide generality as manifested in hematite.</description>

      <title>Dynamical breaking of inversion symmetry, strong second harmonic generation, and ferroelectricity with nonlinear phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how crystalline inversion symmetry can be dynamically broken by optical phonons with generic, hardening Kerr-like non-linearities. The symmetry-broken state is reached through a parametric instability that can be accessed by driving close to half the phonon resonance. After the onset of the instability, the system settles to a steady state with inversion-symmetry breaking phonon trajectories and strong second harmonic generation. The time averaged positions of the atoms are displaced relative to equilibrium, resulting in a ferroelectric rectification of the driving signal.</description>
