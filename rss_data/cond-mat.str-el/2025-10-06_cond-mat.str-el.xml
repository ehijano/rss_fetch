      <title>Unusual spin-triplet superconductivity in monolayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the phonons in monolayer graphene and we show the possibility for the spin-triplet superconducting excitations states by discretizing the single-particle excitations near Fermi wave vector. The molonayer graphene was supposed to be exposed under the influence of the external gate-potential and the local Coulomb interaction effects have been taken into account at each lattice site position in the monolayer. A sufficiently large temperature domain was found, where the superconducting order parameter is not vanishing. Corresponding to this, at the surprisingly high temperature limit, we obtain a narrow domain of the electron-phonon coupling parameter $\lambda_{\rm eff}$, emphasizing the superconducting state. We discuss the localizing role of Hubbard-$U$ interaction and the effects external gate potential on the calculated physical parameters in the system. We explain the importance of the chemical potential in the formation of the superconducting state. We show the existence of a large superconducting band-gap in the system even in the case of the absence of the applied electric field potential.</description>

      <title>Four Moir\'e materials at One Magic Angle in Helical Quadrilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce helical twisted quadrilayer graphene (HTQG), four graphene sheets rotated by the same small angle, as a versatile and experimentally accessible platform for correlated topological matter. HTQG consists of three moir\'e lattices, formed by interference between adjacent graphene layers, that are twisted relative to each other. Lattice relaxation produces four types of large-scale commensurate domains. The domains are characterized by the stacking of the three moir\'e lattices and come in two types: Type-I "Bernal" stacking and Type-II "rhombohedral" stacking. Domain walls between adjacent stackings often host topologically protected edge states, forming networks at the supermoir\'e and super-supermoir\'e scales. Remarkably, all four moir\'e substructures have narrow bands at the same magic angle $\theta \approx 2.3^\circ$, allowing their correlated phases to be simultaneously targeted in device manufacturing. We argue that the Type-I domains are especially suitable for realizing robust superconductivity which emerges from doping topological insulators, and Chern insulators in $C = \pm 2$ bands.</description>

      <title>Detecting quantum spin liquid on Kitaev model through a superconducting junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent orbital selectivity and partial Kondo-screening in magnetically ordered Hund's metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02593v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hund's metallicity in 3$d$ transition metal oxides constitutes a rare class of compounds, since they have been long understood considering the dominance of Hubbard $U$. $\mathrm{LiV_2O_4}$\&amp; $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ belong to this rare class of metals; among them, $\mathrm{LiV_2O_4}$ has been the subject of extensive investigations for its unconventional heavy-fermion behavior, while studies on $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ remain limited despite its anomalous ferromagnetic ground state. In this study, we report an unusual spin-orbital selective localization in $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ leading to a sharp Kondo resonance at $\sim$70 K in the spin-$up$ channel of orbitals of $t_{2g}$ symmetry using a combination of Density functional theory and Dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Correspondingly, an appreciable reduction in the magnetization below $T$=100 K further suggests partial Kondo screening of local moments active at low temperatures, explaining its effective spin magnetization state and upturn in its resistivity observed in experimental reports. We note a significant effect of Hund's induced spin-orbital selective incoherence in dictating the temperature evolution of its macroscopic observables e.g. spin-spin correlation function and effective local moment. Our results reveal a potentially distinct/new form of spin-dependent selectivity induced via Hund's coupling in addition to the conventional orbital-selectivity in the Hund's metals, as a plausible key mechanism in stabilizing their long-range magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic evidence of Kondo resonance in 3$d$ van der Waals ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets drive the advancement in spintronic applications and enable the exploration of exotic magnetism in low-dimensional systems. The entanglement of dual $-$ localized and itinerant $-$ nature of electrons lies at the heart of the correlated electron systems giving rise to exotic ground state properties such as complex magnetism, heavy fermionic behavior, Kondo lattice formation, \textit{etc}. Through temperature-dependent electronic structure of vdW ferromagnets, (Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$, probed using high-resolution photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT), we provide direct evidence of the emergence of Kondo resonance peak driven by complex interplay between localized and itinerant electrons. In overall agreement with experimental electronic structure and magnetic properties, DFT+DMFT also reveals finite spin band splitting well beyond $T_{C}$. Core levels, valence band photoemission spectra together with DFT+DMFT spectral functions reveal insignificant change across $T_{C}$ indicating non-Stoner magnetism in (Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$. Our results provide a way forward to the understanding of complex interplay between electronic structure, exotic magnetism and heavy fermionic behavior leading to Kondo scenerio in 3$d$ vdW ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Bimagnon dispersion of La2CuO4 probed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the study of the magnetic excitations of Mott insulator La2CuO4 by using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and cluster calculations within the framework of exact diagonalization. Our results demonstrate experimentally that the bimagnon excitation in Cu L-edge RIXS is enhanced if the incident x-ray energy is slightly above the absorption edge. Through incident-energy-dependent momentum-resolved RIXS, we investigated the excitation of the bimagnon with predominantly A1 symmetry. The bimagnons of La2CuO4 exhibit a nearly flat dispersion with momentum along the Cu-O bond direction. This observation agrees with the bimagnon dispersion from the calculations on a single-band Hubbard model rather than a Heisenberg model with only the nearest neighbor exchange interaction. This means that the effect of the higher-order spin couplings such as the cyclic or ring exchange interactions caused by the coherent motion of electrons beyond nearest-neighbor sites is important for understanding the bimagnon dynamics of cuprates.</description>

      <title>Modeling Quantum Geometry for Fractional Chern Insulators with unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moire materials present a unique platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases beyond the paradigm of ideal quantum geometry. While analytical approaches to FCIs and fractional quantum Hall states (FQHS) often rely on idealized Bloch wavefunctions, realistic moire models lack direct tunability of quantum metric and Berry curvature, limiting theoretical and numerical exploration. Here, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning framework to model interacting Hamiltonians directly through the distribution of single-particle form factors. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE), we show that unsupervised learning can not only distinguish FCI and non-FCI states, but also generate new form factors with distinct topological character, not present in the training set. This latent space enables the generation and interpolation of form factors for topological flatbands with Chern number $|C|=1$, enabling the discovery of unobserved many-body states such as charge density waves. Principal component analysis (PCA) further reveals that the dominant patterns in the form factors-reflecting correlations across the Brillouin zone-can be decomposed into components with approximately quantized Chern numbers, providing new insights into the global and topological structure of quantum geometry. Our results highlight the ability of machine learning to generalize and model topological quantum systems, paving the way for the inverse design of form factors with tailored quantum geometry and many-body phases in flatband materials.</description>

      <title>Utility-Scale Quantum State Preparation: Classical Training using Pauli Path Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Pauli Path simulation to variationally obtain parametrized circuits for preparing ground states of various quantum many-body Hamiltonians. These include the quantum Ising model in one dimension, in two dimensions on square and heavy-hex lattices, and the Kitaev honeycomb model, all at system sizes of one hundred qubits or more, beyond the reach of exact state-vector simulation, thereby reaching utility scale. We benchmark the Pauli Path simulation results against exact ground-state energies when available, and against density-matrix renormalization group calculations otherwise, finding strong agreement. To further assess the quality of the variational states, we evaluate the magnetization in the x and z directions for the quantum Ising models and compute the topological entanglement entropy for the Kitaev honeycomb model. Finally, we prepare approximate ground states of the Kitaev honeycomb model with 48 qubits, in both the gapped and gapless regimes, on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum computer using parametrized circuits obtained from Pauli Path simulation. We achieve a relative energy error of approximately $5\%$ without error mitigation and demonstrate the braiding of Abelian anyons on the quantum device beyond fixed-point models.</description>

      <title>Slow-phonon control of spin Edelstein effect in Rashba $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have zero net magnetization yet feature spin-split bands that host spin-polarized states. Here, we investigate how slow lattice vibrations (phonons) influence both the intrinsic and externally induced spin polarizations in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. For the induced spin polarizations, we employ a Rashba continuum model with electron-phonon coupling (EPC) treated at the static-Holstein level and analyze the spin Edelstein effect using the Kubo linear-response formalism. We find that moderate-to-strong EPC progressively suppresses the induced polarization via both intraband and interband channels, with a critical coupling marking the onset of complete spin Edelstein depolarization. The depolarization transition arises from a phonon-induced energy renormalization that pushes the spin-split bands anisotropically above the chemical potential, leading to a complete collapse of the Fermi surface. While (de)polarization can occur even in the Rashba non-altermagnetic phase, it remains isotropic. The presence of altermagnetism makes it anisotropic and breaks the conventional antisymmetry between spin susceptibilities that occurs with pure spin-orbit coupling, rendering the effect highly relevant for spintronic applications. We further investigate how the phonon coupling to the altermagnetic order, Rashba spin-orbit strength, and carrier doping collectively tune the depolarization transition. Our findings demonstrate that phonon scattering (e.g., through various substrates) offers a powerful means for on-demand control of spin polarization, enabling reversible switching between spin-polarized and depolarized states -- a key functionality for advancing spin logic architectures and optimizing next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets host unconventional spin-polarized bands despite zero net magnetization, but controlling their spin structure remains challenging. We propose a multi-field approach to engineer spin polarization in $d$-wave altermagnets using gating, optical driving, and in-plane electric fields, which enable tunable and switchable polarizations along multiple directions. Optical driving induces out-of-plane ($z$) polarization, while gating and in-plane fields generate $x$- and $y$-polarizations via the Edelstein effect, all of which are experimentally detectable. We further find that spin- and band-selective doping induces chiral optical activity, a feature unique to altermagnets. Our approach provides a versatile route for full control of spin polarization in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Weak localization and antilocalization corrections to nonlinear transport: a semiclassical Boltzmann treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear transport regime is manifested in the nonlinear current-voltage characteristic of the system. An example of such a nonlinear regime is a setup in which current is injected into the sample and the measured voltage drop is quadratic in the injected current. Such a quadratic nonlinear regime requires inversion symmetry to be broken. This is the same symmetry condition as one needs to observe weak antilocalization, which can be prominent in two-dimensional systems. Here, we study the effects of weak (anti)localization on second-order nonlinear transport in two-dimensional systems using the semiclassical Boltzmann approach. We solve for quasiparticle distribution function up to the second order in the applied external electric field and calculate linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors for a toy model. We find that localization effects could lead to a sign change of the nonlinear conductivity tensor -- a phenomenon observed in single-layer graphene devices.</description>

      <title>Twisting the Hubbard model into the Momentum-Mixing Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08746v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubbard model is a standard theoretical tool for studying materials with strong electron-electron interactions, such as the cuprate superconductors. Unfortunately, interaction-driven phenomena such as the transition into the strongly correlated Mott insulator phase are difficult to treat with established theoretical techniques. However, the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto model displays similar Mott physics. Here we show how the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model can be deformed continuously into the Hubbard model. The trick is to systematically re-introduce all the momentum mixing the original Hatsugai-Kohmoto model omits. This can be accomplished by grouping $n$-momenta into a cell and hybridizing them resulting in the momentum-mixing Hatsugai-Kohmoto (MMHK) model. We recover the Bethe ansatz ground state energy of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to within 1$\%$ from only ten mixed momenta. Overall the convergence scales as $1/n^2$ as opposed to the inverse linear behaviour of standard finite-cluster techniques. Our results for a square lattice reproduce all known features from state-of-the-art simulations also with only a few mixed momenta. Consequently, we believe the MMHK model offers an alternative tool for strongly correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of the electronic Fermi liquid: a pedagogical overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over a hundred years, electron transport in conductive materials has been primarily described by the Drude model, which assumes that current flow is impeded primarily by momentum-relaxing collisions between electrons and extrinsic objects such as impurities or phonons. In the past decade, however, experiments have increasingly realized ultra-high quality electronic materials that demonstrate a qualitatively distinct method of charge transport called hydrodynamic flow. Hydrodynamic flow occurs when electrons collide much more frequently with each other than with anything else, and in this limit the electric current has long-wavelength collective behavior analogous to that of a classical fluid. While electron hydrodynamics has long been postulated theoretically for solid-state systems, the plethora of recent experimental realizations has reinvigorated the field. Here, we review recent theoretical and experimental progress in understanding hydrodynamic electrons using the (hydrodynamic) Fermi liquid as our prototypical example.</description>

Abstract: B site ordered $5d^2$ double perovskites ($\mathrm{A_2BB'O_6,\ B'}=5d^2)$ display a remarkable range of physical properties upon variation of the chosen B and $\mathrm{B'}$ site ions. This sensitivity to chemical substitution reflects the delicate balance and profound impact of strong electronic correlation and spin-orbit coupling in such systems. We present rhenium $L_2$ and $L_3$ resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements of two such physically dissimilar materials, Mott-insulating $\mathrm{Ba_2YReO_6}$ and semiconducting $\mathrm{Sr_2CrReO_6}$. Despite these differences, our RIXS results reveal similar energy scales of Hund's ($J_H$) and spin-orbit coupling ($\zeta$) in the two materials, with both systems firmly in the intermediate Hund's coupling regime where $J_H/\zeta\sim 1$. However, there are clear differences in their RIXS spectra. The conductive character of $\mathrm{Sr_2CrReO_6}$ broadens and obfuscates the atomic transitions within an electron-hole continuum, while the insulating character of $\mathrm{Ba_2YReO_6}$ results in sharp atomic excitations. This contrast in their RIXS spectra despite their similar energy scales reflects a difference in the itinerancy-promoting hopping integral and illustrates the impact of the local crystal environment in double perovskites. Finally, $L_2$ and $L_3$ edge analyses of the atomic excitations in $\mathrm{Ba_2YReO_6}$ reveal that the ordering of the low lying excited states is inverted compared to previous reports, such that the appropriate energy scales of Hund's and spin-orbit coupling are significantly modified. We present exact diagonalization calculations of the RIXS spectra at both edges which show good agreement with our results for new energy scales of $\zeta=0.290(5)$ eV and $J_H=0.38(2)$ eV ($J_H/\zeta=1.30(5)$).</description>

      <title>Investigating the Fermi-Hubbard model by the Tensor-Backflow method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$, next-nearest-neighbor hopping strengths $t'$ and boundary conditions. Instead of considering backflow terms from all sites, competitive results are achieved by considering nearest-neighbor or next-nearest-neighbor backflow terms. Meanwhile the variational wave-function is not enforced on geometric symmetries. When $t'$=0, by considering nearest-neighbor backflow terms, linear stripe order is sucessfully obtained for the case of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under periodoc boundary condition. For a similar case under open boundary condition, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. Comparing to state-of-the-art neural network results, energies are competitive and relative errors are below $5\times 10^{-3}$. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations. When $t'$=-0.2, by considering next-nearest-neighbor backflow terms, obtained energies are competitive or even lower than state-of-the-art neural network results. For example, obtained energy for $n$=0.875, $U$=8 on the $12\times 12$ lattice under PBC is $8.1\times 10^{-4}$ lower comparing to that from the neural network state. Therefore, the Tensor-Backflow method has strong representation abilities for the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Multipole phases in a type of spin/fermion ladders with local conserved quantities and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spin/fermion ladder models with exact multipole phases, which are traditional spin phases formed by multipole moments. These phases feature non-trivial order with zero magnetization. The multipole models have dimer local conserved quantities that are Ising terms of spin. The Hilbert spaces are locally fragmented into independent sectors described effectively by {\it higher-order spin}. For dipole models, we consider two ladder geometries with quadratic spin couplings and work out the phase diagrams. Different phases of the model can be distinguished experimentally with the dynamical structure factor. Higher-order multipole models are obtained by introducing more dimer conserved quantities. The phases are characterized by the values of the local conserved quantities and the traditional spin phases of the higher-order spin.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous lattice distortion and crystal field effects in HoB4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tetraboride HoB4 crystallizes in a tetragonal structure (space group P4/mbm), with the Ho atoms realizing a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. It orders antiferromagnetically at TN1 = 7.1 K and undergoes further magnetic transition at TN2 = 5.7 K. The complex magnetic structures are attributed to competing order parameters of magnetic and quadrupolar origin with significant magnetoelastic coupling. Here, we investigate the response of the lattice of HoB4 across the antiferromagnetic phase transitions by using low-temperature powder x-ray diffraction and ultrasound-velocity measurements, supported by crystal electric field (CEF) calculations. Below TN2, the crystal structure of HoB4 changes to monoclinic (space group P21/b) as a macroscopic manifestation of the quadrupolar ordering. Between 300 and 3.5 K, the total distortion amplitude is 0.46~\AA\ and the relative volume change is $3.5 \times 10^{-3}$. This structural phase transition is compatible with the huge softening of the modulus $C_{44}$ observed around TN2 due to ferroquadrupolar order. A lattice instability developing immediately below TN1 is seen consistently in x-ray and ultrasound data. CEF analysis suggests a quasi-degenerated ground state for the Ho$^{3+}$ ions in this system.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast giant enhancement of second harmonic generation in a strongly correlated cobaltite YbBaCo4O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of ultrafast photoinduced giant enhancement of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency in cobaltite YbBaCo4O7. Upon femtosecond pumping at energies above the band gap, the system exhibits an ultrafast enhancement in SHG intensity, reaching up to 60% higher than the initial value, then decays into a metastable state maintaining the enhancement. The enhancement scales linearly with pump fluence but shows no dependence on pump polarization. A pure electronic process sets in within the first ~200 fs and is accompanied by a pronounced anisotropic amplification of nonlinear susceptibility. We propose this anomalous SHG enhancement originates from ultrafast electronic band renormalization arising from dynamical modification of multi-electron correlations. In stark contrast to conventional asymmetric systems where SHG is typically suppressed upon photoexcitation, our experimental findings shed a new light on ultrafast optical control nonlinear properties in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of atomic solid hydrogen phases based on Gutzwiller many-body wave functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply two ab initio many-body methods based on Gutzwiller wave functions, i.e., correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) and Gutzwiller conjugate gradient minimization (GCGM), to the study of crystalline phases of atomic hydrogen. Both methods avoid empirical Hubbard U parameters and are free from double-counting issues. CMRT employs a Gutzwiller-type approximation that enables efficient calculations, while GCGM goes beyond this approximation to achieve higher accuracy at higher computational cost. By benchmarking against available quantum Monte Carlo results, we demonstrate that while both methods are more accurate than the widely used density-functional theory (DFT), GCGM systematically captures additional correlation energy missing in CMRT, leading to significantly improved total energy predictions. We also show that by including the correlation energy $E_c$ from LDA in the CMRT calculation, CMRT+$E_c$ produces energy in better agreement with the QMC results in these hydrogen lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy scaling laws from fluctuations of non-conserved quantities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement patterns reveal essential information on many-body states and provide a way to classify quantum phases of matter. However, experimental studies of many-body entanglement remain scarce due to their unscalable nature. The present work aims to mitigate this theoretical and experimental divide by introducing reduced fluctuations of observables, consisting of a sum of on-site operators, as a scalable experimental probe of the entanglement entropy. Specifically, we illustrate by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations in spin chains that the reduced fluctuations exhibit the same size scaling properties as the entanglement entropy. Generalizing previous observations restricted to special systems with conserved quantities, our work introduces experimentally feasible protocol to extract entanglement scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems: Nonstabilizerness, entanglement, and fractal dimension in SYK and random matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Interactions of Wigner Crystal in Magnetic Field and Berry Curvature: Multi-Particle Tunneling through Complex Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how an out-of-plane magnetic field $B({\bf r})$ and a Berry curvature $\Omega({\bf k})$ modify the exchange interactions in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal (WC) using a semi-classical large-$r_s$ expansion. When only a magnetic field is present, ring-exchange processes arise from multi-particle tunneling through {\it complex} trajectories which constitute {\it complex instanton} solutions of the coordinate-space path integral. To leading order in $B$, each exchange constant $J_a$ acquires an Aharonov-Bohm phase along the zero-field tunneling trajectory. When a Berry curvature is present, the multi-particle tunneling must be considered in a complexified phase space $({\bf r}, {\bf k})$. To leading order in $\Omega$, $J_a$ acquires a Berry phase along a {\it purely imaginary} momentum-space trajectory. When $B$ and $\Omega$ are both present, in addition to having both Aharonov-Bohm and Berry phases, the exchange magnitude $|J_a|$ is also modified due to an effective-mass renormalization. These effects could be relevant for the WC and proximate phases recently observed in rhombohedral multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Higher structure of non-invertible symmetries from Lagrangian descriptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetry structure of a quantum field theory is determined not only by the topological defects that implement the symmetry and their fusion rules, but also by the topological networks they can form, which is referred to as the higher structure of the symmetry. In this paper, we consider theories with non-invertible symmetries that have an explicit Lagrangian description, and use it to study their higher structure. Starting with the 2d free compact boson theory and its non-invertible duality defects, we will find Lagrangian descriptions of networks of defects and use them to recover all the $F$-symbols of the familiar Tambara-Yamagami fusion category $\operatorname{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_N,+1)$. We will then use the same approach in 4d Maxwell theory to compute $F$-symbols associated with its non-invertible duality and triality defects, which are 2d topological field theories. In addition, we will also compute some of the $F$-symbols using a different (group theoretical) approach that is not based on the Lagrangian description, and find that they take the expected form.</description>

      <title>Reversal of strain state in a Mott insulator thin film by controlling substrate morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The V2O3 phase diagram contains two insulating phases and one metallic phase with different lattice structures. The stability of these phases is very sensitive to pressure, offering a mechanism to tune phase transitions by inducing strain in thin films. The most studied source of strain is lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate. In this work, however, we find that the film/substrate thermal expansion mismatch can be made to play a dominant role by modifying the substrate morphology. When grown on sapphire, the lattice mismatch induces compressive strain in the V2O3 films, whereas thermal expansion mismatch induces tensile strain. We find that minute changes in substrate morphology may relax the compressive strain component, allowing the thermally-induced tensile component to overcome it. Thus, by simple annealing of the substrates to create either a flat or stepped morphology, strongly compressive or tensile strains may be induced in the films. This results in either full suppression of the metal-insulator transition or stabilization of insulating phases at all temperatures, exhibiting many orders of magnitude differences in film resistivity. To elucidate the strain relaxation mechanism, we use high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) to image the atomic steps in the substrate and the adjacent crystallographic defects in the V2O3. These findings offer a hitherto underexplored mechanism to tune strain in thin films, deepen our understanding of the effects of structural degrees of freedom on phase stability of a canonical Mott insulator and may allow for applications requiring insulator-metal switching above room temperature.</description>
