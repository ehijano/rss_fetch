      <title>Simulating integrated Volterra square-root processes and Volterra Heston models via Inverse Gaussian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel simulation scheme, iVi (integrated Volterra implicit), for integrated Volterra square-root processes and Volterra Heston models based on the Inverse Gaussian distribution. The scheme is designed to handle $L^1$ kernels with singularities by relying solely on integrated kernel quantities, and it preserves the non-decreasing property of the integrated process. We establish weak convergence of the iVi scheme by reformulating it as a stochastic Volterra equation with a measure kernel and proving a stability result for this class of equations. Numerical results demonstrate that convergence is achieved with very few time steps. Remarkably, for the rough fractional kernel, unlike existing schemes, convergence seems to improve as the Hurst index $H$ decreases and approaches $-1/2$.</description>

      <title>The Risk-Neutral Equivalent Pricing of Model-Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13744v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing approaches to asset-pricing under model-uncertainty adapt classical utility-maximization frameworks and seek theoretical comprehensiveness. We move toward practice by considering binary model-uncertainties and by switching attention from 'preference' to 'constraints'. This decomposes economic asset-pricing into the viable pricing of model-risk and non-model risk separately such that the former has a unique and intuitive formula with convenient properties. Its parameter, dynamically conserved under model-risk inference, allows an integrated representation of ex-ante risk-pricing and bias, with ex-post price-effects that can be disentangled, through well-known anomalies, Momentum and Low-Risk, whose risk-reward curves acquire a new significance: peak-rewards measure ex-ante risk-pricing, and peak-locations, bias.</description>

      <title>Optimal Capital Structure for Life Insurance Companies Offering Surplus Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapt Leland's dynamic capital structure model to the context of an insurance company selling participating life insurance contracts explaining the existence of life insurance contracts which provide both a guaranteed payment and surplus participation to the policyholders. Our derivation of the optimal participation rate reveals its pronounced sensitivity to the contract duration and the associated tax rate. Moreover, the asset substitution effect, which describes the tendency of equity holders to increase the riskiness of a company's investment decisions, decreases when adding surplus participation.</description>

      <title>Robust Time-inconsistent Linear-Quadratic Stochastic Controls: A Stochastic Differential Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies robust time-inconsistent (TIC) linear-quadratic stochastic control problems, formulated by stochastic differential games. By a spike variation approach, we derive sufficient conditions for achieving the Nash equilibrium, which corresponds to a time-consistent (TC) robust policy, under mild technical assumptions. To illustrate our framework, we consider two scenarios of robust mean-variance analysis, namely with state- and control-dependent ambiguity aversion. We find numerically that with time inconsistency haunting the dynamic optimal controls, the ambiguity aversion enhances the effective risk aversion faster than the linear, implying that the ambiguity in the TIC cases is more impactful than that under the TC counterparts, e.g., expected utility maximization problems.</description>
