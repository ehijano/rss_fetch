      <title>Physics-informed machine learning: A mathematical framework with applications to time series forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is an emerging framework that integrates physical knowledge into machine learning models. This physical prior often takes the form of a partial differential equation (PDE) system that the regression function must satisfy. In the first part of this dissertation, we analyze the statistical properties of PIML methods. In particular, we study the properties of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in terms of approximation, consistency, overfitting, and convergence. We then show how PIML problems can be framed as kernel methods, making it possible to apply the tools of kernel ridge regression to better understand their behavior. In addition, we use this kernel formulation to develop novel physics-informed algorithms and implement them efficiently on GPUs. The second part explores industrial applications in forecasting energy signals during atypical periods. We present results from the Smarter Mobility challenge on electric vehicle charging occupancy and examine the impact of mobility on electricity demand. Finally, we introduce a physics-constrained framework for designing and enforcing constraints in time series, applying it to load forecasting and tourism forecasting in various countries.</description>

      <title>The Bayesian Approach to Continual Learning: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning is an online paradigm where a learner continually accumulates knowledge from different tasks encountered over sequential time steps. Importantly, the learner is required to extend and update its knowledge without forgetting about the learning experience acquired from the past, and while avoiding the need to retrain from scratch. Given its sequential nature and its resemblance to the way humans think, continual learning offers an opportunity to address several challenges which currently stand in the way of widening the range of applicability of deep models to further real-world problems. The continual need to update the learner with data arriving sequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and Bayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the prior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the knowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings of Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and class-incremental learning. We begin by discussing definitions of continual learning along with its Bayesian setting, as well as the links with related fields, such as domain adaptation, transfer learning and meta-learning. Afterwards, we introduce a taxonomy offering a comprehensive categorization of algorithms belonging to the Bayesian continual learning paradigm. Meanwhile, we analyze the state-of-the-art while zooming in on some of the most prominent Bayesian continual learning algorithms to date. Furthermore, we shed some light on links between continual learning and developmental psychology, and correspondingly introduce analogies between both fields. We follow that with a discussion of current challenges, and finally conclude with potential areas for future research on Bayesian continual learning.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Confidence Multiple Change Point Identification under Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piecewise constant functions describe a variety of real-world phenomena in domains ranging from chemistry to manufacturing. In practice, it is often required to confidently identify the locations of the abrupt changes in these functions as quickly as possible. For this, we introduce a fixed-confidence piecewise constant bandit problem. Here, we sequentially query points in the domain and receive noisy evaluations of the function under bandit feedback. We provide instance-dependent lower bounds for the complexity of change point identification in this problem. These lower bounds illustrate that an optimal method should focus its sampling efforts adjacent to each of the change points, and the number of samples around each change point should be inversely proportional to the magnitude of the change. Building on this, we devise a simple and computationally efficient variant of Track-and-Stop and prove that it is asymptotically optimal in many regimes. We support our theoretical findings with experimental results in synthetic environments demonstrating the efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Optimal High-probability Convergence of Nonlinear SGD under Heavy-tailed Noise via Symmetrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study convergence in high-probability of SGD-type methods in non-convex optimization and the presence of heavy-tailed noise. To combat the heavy-tailed noise, a general black-box nonlinear framework is considered, subsuming nonlinearities like sign, clipping, normalization and their smooth counterparts. Our first result shows that nonlinear SGD (N-SGD) achieves the rate $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/2})$, for any noise with unbounded moments and a symmetric probability density function (PDF). Crucially, N-SGD has exponentially decaying tails, matching the performance of linear SGD under light-tailed noise. To handle non-symmetric noise, we propose two novel estimators, based on the idea of noise symmetrization. The first, dubbed Symmetrized Gradient Estimator (SGE), assumes a noiseless gradient at any reference point is available at the start of training, while the second, dubbed Mini-batch SGE (MSGE), uses mini-batches to estimate the noiseless gradient. Combined with the nonlinear framework, we get N-SGE and N-MSGE methods, respectively, both achieving the same convergence rate and exponentially decaying tails as N-SGD, while allowing for non-symmetric noise with unbounded moments and PDF satisfying a mild technical condition, with N-MSGE additionally requiring bounded noise moment of order $p \in (1,2]$. Compared to works assuming noise with bounded $p$-th moment, our results: 1) are based on a novel symmetrization approach; 2) provide a unified framework and relaxed moment conditions; 3) imply optimal oracle complexity of N-SGD and N-SGE, strictly better than existing works when $p &lt; 2$, while the complexity of N-MSGE is close to existing works. Compared to works assuming symmetric noise with unbounded moments, we: 1) provide a sharper analysis and improved rates; 2) facilitate state-dependent symmetric noise; 3) extend the strong guarantees to non-symmetric noise.</description>

      <title>CoVAE: Consistency Training of Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art generative approaches frequently rely on a two-stage training procedure, where an autoencoder (often a VAE) first performs dimensionality reduction, followed by training a generative model on the learned latent space. While effective, this introduces computational overhead and increased sampling times. We challenge this paradigm by proposing Consistency Training of Variational AutoEncoders (CoVAE), a novel single-stage generative autoencoding framework that adopts techniques from consistency models to train a VAE architecture. The CoVAE encoder learns a progressive series of latent representations with increasing encoding noise levels, mirroring the forward processes of diffusion and flow matching models. This sequence of representations is regulated by a time dependent $\beta$ parameter that scales the KL loss. The decoder is trained using a consistency loss with variational regularization, which reduces to a conventional VAE loss at the earliest latent time. We show that CoVAE can generate high-quality samples in one or few steps without the use of a learned prior, significantly outperforming equivalent VAEs and other single-stage VAEs methods. Our approach provides a unified framework for autoencoding and diffusion-style generative modeling and provides a viable route for one-step generative high-performance autoencoding. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/gisilvs/covae.</description>

      <title>A Generalization Theory for Zero-Shot Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modern paradigm for generalization in machine learning and AI consists of pre-training a task-agnostic foundation model, generally obtained using self-supervised and multimodal contrastive learning. The resulting representations can be used for prediction on a downstream task for which no labeled data is available. We present a theoretical framework to better understand this approach, called zero-shot prediction. We identify the target quantities that zero-shot prediction aims to learn, or learns in passing, and the key conditional independence relationships that enable its generalization ability.</description>

      <title>A Randomized Algorithm for Sparse PCA based on the Basic SDP Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) is a fundamental technique for dimensionality reduction, and is NP-hard. In this paper, we introduce a randomized approximation algorithm for SPCA, which is based on the basic SDP relaxation. Our algorithm has an approximation ratio of at most the sparsity constant with high probability, if called enough times. Under a technical assumption, which is consistently satisfied in our numerical tests, the average approximation ratio is also bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\log{d})$, where $d$ is the number of features. We show that this technical assumption is satisfied if the SDP solution is low-rank, or has exponentially decaying eigenvalues. We then present a broad class of instances for which this technical assumption holds. We also demonstrate that in a covariance model, which generalizes the spiked Wishart model, our proposed algorithm achieves a near-optimal approximation ratio. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through numerical results on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Uncovering symmetric and asymmetric species associations from community and environmental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is no much doubt that biotic interactions shape community assembly and ultimately the spatial co-variations between species. There is a hope that the signal of these biotic interactions can be observed and retrieved by investigating the spatial associations between species while accounting for the direct effects of the environment. By definition, biotic interactions can be both symmetric and asymmetric. Yet, most models that attempt to retrieve species associations from co-occurrence or co-abundance data internally assume symmetric relationships between species. Here, we propose and validate a machine-learning framework able to retrieve bidirectional associations by analyzing species community and environmental data.
  Our framework (1) models pairwise species associations as directed influences from a source to a target species, parameterized with two species-specific latent embeddings: the effect of the source species on the community, and the response of the target species to the community; and (2) jointly fits these associations within a multi-species conditional generative model with different modes of interactions between environmental drivers and biotic associations. Using both simulated and empirical data, we demonstrate the ability of our framework to recover known asymmetric and symmetric associations and highlight the properties of the learned association networks. By comparing our approach to other existing models such as joint species distribution models and probabilistic graphical models, we show its superior capacity at retrieving symmetric and asymmetric interactions. The framework is intuitive, modular and broadly applicable across various taxonomic groups.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Identifying Interpretable Subgroups With Elevated Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm for identifying interpretable subgroups with elevated treatment effects, given an estimate of individual or conditional average treatment effects (CATE). Subgroups are characterized by ``rule sets'' -- easy-to-understand statements of the form (Condition A AND Condition B) OR (Condition C) -- which can capture high-order interactions while retaining interpretability. Our method complements existing approaches for estimating the CATE, which often produce high dimensional and uninterpretable results, by summarizing and extracting critical information from fitted models to aid decision making, policy implementation, and scientific understanding. We propose an objective function that trades-off subgroup size and effect size, and varying the hyperparameter that controls this trade-off results in a ``frontier'' of Pareto optimal rule sets, none of which dominates the others across all criteria. Valid inference is achievable through sample splitting. We demonstrate the utility and limitations of our method using simulated and empirical examples.</description>

      <title>Signed Graph Learning: Algorithms and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world data is often represented through the relationships between data samples, forming a graph structure. In many applications, it is necessary to learn this graph structure from the observed data. Current graph learning research has primarily focused on unsigned graphs, which consist only of positive edges. However, many biological and social systems are better described by signed graphs that account for both positive and negative interactions, capturing similarity and dissimilarity between samples. In this paper, we develop a method for learning signed graphs from a set of smooth signed graph signals. Specifically, we employ the net Laplacian as a graph shift operator (GSO) to define smooth signed graph signals as the outputs of a low-pass signed graph filter defined by the net Laplacian. The signed graph is then learned by formulating a non-convex optimization problem where the total variation of the observed signals is minimized with respect to the net Laplacian. The proposed problem is solved using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and a fast algorithm reducing the per-ADMM iteration complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of nodes is introduced. Furthermore, theoretical proofs of convergence for the algorithm and a bound on the estimation error of the learned net Laplacian as a function of sample size, number of nodes, and graph topology are provided. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on simulated data and gene regulatory network inference problem and compared to existing signed graph learning methods.</description>

      <title>Discovering Governing Equations in the Presence of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of complex dynamical systems, understanding and accurately modeling the underlying physical processes is crucial for predicting system behavior and designing effective interventions. Yet real-world systems exhibit pronounced input (or system) variability and are observed through noisy, limited data conditions that confound traditional discovery methods that assume fixed-coefficient deterministic models. In this work, we theorize that accounting for system variability together with measurement noise is the key to consistently discover the governing equations underlying dynamical systems. As such, we introduce a stochastic inverse physics-discovery (SIP) framework that treats the unknown coefficients as random variables and infers their posterior distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the push-forward of the posterior samples and the empirical data distribution. Benchmarks on four canonical problems -- the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system (multi- and single-trajectory), the historical Hudson Bay lynx-hare data, the chaotic Lorenz attractor, and fluid infiltration in porous media using low- and high-viscosity liquids -- show that SIP consistently identifies the correct equations and lowers coefficient root-mean-square error by an average of 82\% relative to the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) approach and its Bayesian variant. The resulting posterior distributions yield 95\% credible intervals that closely track the observed trajectories, providing interpretable models with quantified uncertainty. SIP thus provides a robust, data-efficient approach for consistent physics discovery in noisy, variable, and data-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis of Posterior Sampling-Based Expected Improvement for Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for optimizing an expensive-to-evaluate black-box function. In particular, the effectiveness of expected improvement (EI) has been demonstrated in a wide range of applications. However, theoretical analyses of EI are limited compared with other theoretically established algorithms. This paper analyzes a randomized variant of EI, which evaluates the EI from the maximum of the posterior sample path. We show that this posterior sampling-based random EI achieves the sublinear Bayesian cumulative regret bounds under the assumption that the black-box function follows a Gaussian process. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Simulating Biases for Interpretable Fairness in Offline and Online Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive models often reinforce biases which were originally embedded in their training data, through skewed decisions. In such cases, mitigation methods are critical to ensure that, regardless of the prevailing disparities, model outcomes are adjusted to be fair. To assess this, datasets could be systematically generated with specific biases, to train machine learning classifiers. Then, predictive outcomes could aid in the understanding of this bias embedding process. Hence, an agent-based model (ABM), depicting a loan application process that represents various systemic biases across two demographic groups, was developed to produce synthetic datasets. Then, by applying classifiers trained on them to predict loan outcomes, we can assess how biased data leads to unfairness. This highlights a main contribution of this work: a framework for synthetic dataset generation with controllable bias injection. We also contribute with a novel explainability technique, which shows how mitigations affect the way classifiers leverage data features, via second-order Shapley values. In experiments, both offline and online learning approaches are employed. Mitigations are applied at different stages of the modelling pipeline, such as during pre-processing and in-processing.</description>

      <title>MF-GLaM: A multifidelity stochastic emulator using generalized lambda models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic simulators exhibit intrinsic stochasticity due to unobservable, uncontrollable, or unmodeled input variables, resulting in random outputs even at fixed input conditions. Such simulators are common across various scientific disciplines; however, emulating their entire conditional probability distribution is challenging, as it is a task traditional deterministic surrogate modeling techniques are not designed for. Additionally, accurately characterizing the response distribution can require prohibitively large datasets, especially for computationally expensive high-fidelity (HF) simulators. When lower-fidelity (LF) stochastic simulators are available, they can enhance limited HF information within a multifidelity surrogate modeling (MFSM) framework. While MFSM techniques are well-established for deterministic settings, constructing multifidelity emulators to predict the full conditional response distribution of stochastic simulators remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose multifidelity generalized lambda models (MF-GLaMs) to efficiently emulate the conditional response distribution of HF stochastic simulators by exploiting data from LF stochastic simulators. Our approach builds upon the generalized lambda model (GLaM), which represents the conditional distribution at each input by a flexible, four-parameter generalized lambda distribution. MF-GLaMs are non-intrusive, requiring no access to the internal stochasticity of the simulators nor multiple replications of the same input values. We demonstrate the efficacy of MF-GLaM through synthetic examples of increasing complexity and a realistic earthquake application. Results show that MF-GLaMs can achieve improved accuracy at the same cost as single-fidelity GLaMs, or comparable performance at significantly reduced cost.</description>

      <title>Information Must Flow: Recursive Bootstrapping for Information Bottleneck in Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), a unified framework that models cognition as the directed flow of information between high-entropy context and low-entropy content. Inference emerges as a cycle of bidirectional interactions, bottom-up contextual disambiguation paired with top-down content reconstruction, which resolves the Information Bottleneck in Optimal Transport (iBOT). Implemented via Rao-Blackwellized variational entropy minimization, CCUP steers representations toward minimal joint uncertainty while preserving inferential directionality. Local cycle completion underpins temporal bootstrapping, chaining simulations to refine memory, and spatial bootstrapping, enabling compositional hierarchical inference. We prove a Delta Convergence Theorem showing that recursive entropy minimization yields delta-like attractors in latent space, stabilizing perceptual schemas and motor plans. Temporal bootstrapping through perception-action loops and sleep-wake consolidation further transforms episodic traces into semantic knowledge. Extending CCUP, each hierarchical level performs delta-seeded inference: low-entropy content seeds diffuse outward along goal-constrained paths shaped by top-down priors and external context, confining inference to task-relevant manifolds and circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Building on this, we propose that language emerges as a symbolic transport system, externalizing latent content to synchronize inference cycles across individuals. Together, these results establish iBOT as a foundational principle of information flow in both individual cognition and collective intelligence, positioning recursive inference as the structured conduit through which minds adapt, align, and extend.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Expansion: A Pathway Toward the Next Generation of Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Recurrent Expansion (RE) as a new learning paradigm that advances beyond conventional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). While DL focuses on learning from static data representations, RE proposes an additional dimension: learning from the evolving behavior of models themselves. RE emphasizes multiple mappings of data through identical deep architectures and analyzes their internal representations (i.e., feature maps) in conjunction with observed performance signals such as loss. By incorporating these behavioral traces, RE enables iterative self-improvement, allowing each model version to gain insight from its predecessors. The framework is extended through Multiverse RE (MVRE), which aggregates signals from parallel model instances, and further through Heterogeneous MVRE (HMVRE), where models of varying architectures contribute diverse perspectives. A scalable and adaptive variant, Sc-HMVRE, introduces selective mechanisms and scale diversity for real-world deployment. Altogether, RE presents a shift in DL: from purely representational learning to behavior-aware, self-evolving systems. It lays the groundwork for a new class of intelligent models capable of reasoning over their own learning dynamics, offering a path toward scalable, introspective, and adaptive artificial intelligence. A simple code example to support beginners in running their own experiments is provided in Code Availability Section of this paper.</description>

      <title>wd1: Weighted Policy Optimization for Reasoning in Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) through reinforcement learning (RL) remains an open problem. The intractability of dLLMs likelihood function necessitates approximating the current, old, and reference policy likelihoods at each policy optimization step. This reliance introduces additional computational overhead and lead to potentially large bias -- particularly when approximation errors occur in the denominator of policy ratios used for importance sampling. To mitigate these issues, we introduce $\mathtt{wd1}$, a novel policy optimization approach that reformulates the objective as a weighted likelihood, requiring only a single approximation for the current parametrized policy likelihood. Experiments on widely used reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that $\mathtt{wd1}$, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or any supervised data, outperforms existing RL methods for dLLMs, achieving up to 16% higher accuracy. $\mathtt{wd1}$ delivers additional computational gains, including reduced training time and fewer function evaluations (NFEs) per gradient step. These findings, combined with the simplicity of method's implementation and R1-Zero-like training (no SFT), position $\mathtt{wd1}$ as a more effective and efficient method for applying RL to dLLMs reasoning.</description>

      <title>Foundation models for time series forecasting: Application in conformal prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The zero-shot capabilities of foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting offer promising potentials in conformal prediction, as most of the available data can be allocated to calibration. This study compares the performance of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with traditional methods, including statistical models and gradient boosting, within a conformal prediction setting. Our findings highlight two key advantages of TSFMs. First, when the volume of data is limited, TSFMs provide more reliable conformalized prediction intervals than classic models, thanks to their superior predictive accuracy. Second, the calibration process is more stable because more data are used for calibration. Morever, the fewer data available, the more pronounced these benefits become, as classic models require a substantial amount of data for effective training. These results underscore the potential of foundation models in improving conformal prediction reliability in time series applications, particularly in data-constrained cases. All the code to reproduce the experiments is available.</description>

      <title>On the under-reaching phenomenon in message-passing neural PDE solvers: revisiting the CFL condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes sharp lower bounds for the number of message passing iterations required in graph neural networks (GNNs) when solving partial differential equations (PDE). This significantly reduces the need for exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. Bounds are derived for the three fundamental classes of PDEs (hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic) by relating the physical characteristics of the problem in question to the message-passing requirement of GNNs. In particular, we investigate the relationship between the physical constants of the equations governing the problem, the spatial and temporal discretisation and the message passing mechanisms in GNNs.
  When the number of message passing iterations is below these proposed limits, information does not propagate efficiently through the network, resulting in poor solutions, even for deep GNN architectures. In contrast, when the suggested lower bound is satisfied, the GNN parameterisation allows the model to accurately capture the underlying phenomenology, resulting in solvers of adequate accuracy.
  Examples are provided for four different examples of equations that show the sharpness of the proposed lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Underrepresentation, Label Bias, and Proxies: Towards Data Bias Profiles for the EU AI Act and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Undesirable biases encoded in the data are key drivers of algorithmic discrimination. Their importance is widely recognized in the algorithmic fairness literature, as well as legislation and standards on anti-discrimination in AI. Despite this recognition, data biases remain understudied, hindering the development of computational best practices for their detection and mitigation. In this work, we present three common data biases and study their individual and joint effect on algorithmic discrimination across a variety of datasets, models, and fairness measures. We find that underrepresentation of vulnerable populations in training sets is less conducive to discrimination than conventionally affirmed, while combinations of proxies and label bias can be far more critical. Consequently, we develop dedicated mechanisms to detect specific types of bias, and combine them into a preliminary construct we refer to as the Data Bias Profile (DBP). This initial formulation serves as a proof of concept for how different bias signals can be systematically documented. Through a case study with popular fairness datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DBP in predicting the risk of discriminatory outcomes and the utility of fairness-enhancing interventions. Overall, this article bridges algorithmic fairness research and anti-discrimination policy through a data-centric lens.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: Navigating Inference with Optimal Transport Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently enabled enormous gains in sensitivity across the sciences. In particle physics, much of this progress has relied on excellent simulations of a wide range of physical processes. However, due to the sophistication of modern machine learning (ML) algorithms and their reliance on high-quality training samples, discrepancies between simulation and experimental data can significantly limit the effectiveness of ML techniques. In this work, we present a solution to this ``mis-specification'' problem: a calibration approach based on optimal transport, which we apply to high-dimensional simulations for the first time. We demonstrate the performance of our approach through jet tagging, using a CMS-inspired dataset. A 128-dimensional internal jet representation from a powerful general-purpose classifier is studied; after calibrating this internal ``latent'' representation, we find that a wide variety of quantities derived from it for downstream tasks are also properly calibrated: using this calibrated high-dimensional representation, powerful new applications of jet flavor information can be utilized in LHC analyses. This is a key step toward allowing properly-calibrated ``foundation models'' in particle physics. More broadly, this calibration framework has broad applications for correcting high-dimensional simulations across the sciences.</description>

      <title>Predictive Causal Inference via Spatio-Temporal Modeling and Penalized Empirical Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an integrated framework for predictive causal inference designed to overcome limitations inherent in conventional single model approaches. Specifically, we combine a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for spatial health state estimation with a Multi Task and Multi Graph Convolutional Network (MTGCN) for capturing temporal outcome trajectories. The framework asymmetrically treats temporal and spatial information regarding them as endogenous variables in the outcome regression, and exogenous variables in the propensity score model, thereby expanding the standard doubly robust treatment effect estimation to jointly enhance bias correction and predictive accuracy. To demonstrate its utility, we focus on clinical domains such as cancer, dementia, and Parkinson disease, where treatment effects are challenging to observe directly. Simulation studies are conducted to emulate latent disease dynamics and evaluate the model performance under varying conditions. Overall, the proposed framework advances predictive causal inference by structurally adapting to spatiotemporal complexities common in biomedical data.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Convergence: Shuffling Complexity Beyond Lipschitz Smoothness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shuffling-type gradient methods are favored in practice for their simplicity and rapid empirical performance. Despite extensive development of convergence guarantees under various assumptions in recent years, most require the Lipschitz smoothness condition, which is often not met in common machine learning models. We highlight this issue with specific counterexamples. To address this gap, we revisit the convergence rates of shuffling-type gradient methods without assuming Lipschitz smoothness. Using our stepsize strategy, the shuffling-type gradient algorithm not only converges under weaker assumptions but also match the current best-known convergence rates, thereby broadening its applicability. We prove the convergence rates for nonconvex, strongly convex, and non-strongly convex cases, each under both random reshuffling and arbitrary shuffling schemes, under a general bounded variance condition. Numerical experiments further validate the performance of our shuffling-type gradient algorithm, underscoring its practical efficacy.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scores: Proximal Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have quickly become some of the most popular and powerful generative models for high-dimensional data. The key insight that enabled their development was the realization that access to the score -- the gradient of the log-density at different noise levels -- allows for sampling from data distributions by solving a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE) via forward discretization, and that popular denoisers allow for unbiased estimators of this score. In this paper, we demonstrate that an alternative, backward discretization of these SDEs, using proximal maps in place of the score, leads to theoretical and practical benefits. We leverage recent results in proximal matching to learn proximal operators of the log-density and, with them, develop Proximal Diffusion Models (ProxDM). Theoretically, we prove that $\widetilde{O}(d/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps suffice for the resulting discretization to generate an $\varepsilon$-accurate distribution w.r.t. the KL divergence. Empirically, we show that two variants of ProxDM achieve significantly faster convergence within just a few sampling steps compared to conventional score-matching methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic approximation with block-coordinate stepsizes and propose adaptive stepsize rules that aim to minimize the expected distance from the next iterate to an optimal point. These stepsize rules employ online estimates of the second moment of the search direction along each block coordinate. The popular Adam algorithm can be interpreted as a particular heuristic for such estimation. By leveraging a simple conditional estimator, we derive a new method that obtains comparable performance as Adam but requires less memory and fewer hyper-parameters. We prove that this family of methods converges almost surely to a small neighborhood of the optimal point, and the radius of the neighborhood depends on the bias and variance of the second-moment estimator. Our analysis relies on a simple aiming condition that assumes neither convexity nor smoothness, thus has broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Theory-Informed Improvements to Classifier-Free Guidance for Discrete Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for conditional generation and improving sample quality in continuous diffusion models, and recent works have extended it to discrete diffusion. This paper theoretically analyzes CFG in the context of masked discrete diffusion, focusing on the role of guidance schedules. Our analysis shows that high guidance early in sampling (when inputs are heavily masked) harms generation quality, while late-stage guidance has a larger effect. These findings provide a theoretical explanation for empirical observations in recent studies on guidance schedules. The analysis also reveals an imperfection of the current CFG implementations. These implementations can unintentionally cause imbalanced transitions, such as unmasking too rapidly during the early stages of generation, which degrades the quality of the resulting samples. To address this, we draw insight from the analysis and propose a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism empirically applicable to any discrete diffusion. Intuitively, our method smoothens the transport between the data distribution and the initial (masked/uniform) distribution, which results in improved sample quality. Remarkably, our method is achievable via a simple one-line code change. The efficacy of our method is empirically demonstrated with experiments on ImageNet (masked discrete diffusion) and QM9 (uniform discrete diffusion).</description>

      <title>Simulation as Supervision: Mechanistic Pretraining for Scientific Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific modeling faces a core limitation: mechanistic models offer interpretability but collapse under real-world complexity, while machine learning models are flexible but require large labeled datasets, cannot infer unobservable quantities, and operate as black boxes. We introduce Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), a general framework that uses mechanistic simulations as training data for neural networks. SGNNs are pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. We evaluated SGNNs across scientific disciplines and modeling tasks, and found that SGNNs achieved state-of-the-art results across settings: for prediction tasks, they nearly tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield prediction error by one third, and maintained accuracy in ecological forecasting where task specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution, a new form of mechanistic interpretability. Given real world input, SGNNs retrieve simulations based on what the model has learned to see as most similar, revealing which underlying dynamics the model believes are active. This provides process-level insight -- what the model thinks is happening -- not just which features mattered. SGNNs unify scientific theory with deep learning flexibility and unlock a new modeling paradigm -- transforming simulations from rigid, post hoc tools into flexible sources of supervision, enabling robust, interpretable inference even when ground truth is missing.</description>

      <title>Shortening the Trajectories: Identity-Aware Gaussian Approximation for Efficient 3D Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian-based Probabilistic Generative Models (GPGMs) generate data by reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with Gaussian noise. While these models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their practical deployment remains constrained by the high computational cost of long generative trajectories, which often involve hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework that improves generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or inference fidelity. Our key insight is that for certain data modalities, the noising process causes data to rapidly lose its identity and converge toward a Gaussian distribution. We analytically identify a characteristic step at which the data has acquired sufficient Gaussianity, and then replace the remaining generation trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike existing acceleration techniques that coarsening the trajectories by skipping steps, our method preserves the full resolution of learning dynamics while avoiding redundant stochastic perturbations between `Gaussian-like' distributions. Empirical results across multiple data modalities demonstrate substantial improvements in both sample quality and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning in Continuous Action Spaces: Mitigating Compounding Error without Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a continuous state-and-action dynamical system. While imitation learning in discrete settings such as autoregressive language modeling has seen immense success and popularity in recent years, imitation in physical settings such as autonomous driving and robot learning has proven comparably more complex due to the compounding errors problem, often requiring elaborate set-ups to perform stably. Recent work has demonstrated that even in benign settings, exponential compounding errors are unavoidable when learning solely from expert-controlled trajectories, suggesting the need for more advanced policy parameterizations or data augmentation. To this end, we present minimal interventions that provably mitigate compounding errors in continuous state-and-action imitation learning. When the system is open-loop stable, we prescribe "action chunking," i.e., predicting and playing sequences of actions in open-loop; when the system is possibly unstable, we prescribe "noise injection," i.e., adding noise during expert demonstrations. These interventions align with popular choices in modern robot learning, though the benefits we derive are distinct from the effects they were designed to target. Our results draw insights and tools from both control theory and reinforcement learning; however, our analysis reveals novel considerations that do not naturally arise when either literature is considered in isolation.</description>

      <title>Convex Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey reviews a clustering method based on solving a convex optimization problem. Despite the plethora of existing clustering methods, convex clustering has several uncommon features that distinguish it from prior art. The optimization problem is free of spurious local minima, and its unique global minimizer is stable with respect to all its inputs, including the data, a tuning parameter, and weight hyperparameters. Its single tuning parameter controls the number of clusters and can be chosen using standard techniques from penalized regression. We give intuition into the behavior and theory for convex clustering as well as practical guidance. We highlight important algorithms and give insight into how their computational costs scale with the problem size. Finally, we highlight the breadth of its uses and flexibility to be combined and integrated with other inferential methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning with Gradient Eligibility Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving fast and stable off-policy learning in deep reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging. Most existing methods rely on semi-gradient temporal-difference (TD) methods for their simplicity and efficiency, but are consequently susceptible to divergence. While more principled approaches like Gradient TD (GTD) methods have strong convergence guarantees, they have rarely been used in deep RL. Recent work introduced the Generalized Projected Bellman Error ($\GPBE$), enabling GTD methods to work efficiently with nonlinear function approximation. However, this work is only limited to one-step methods, which are slow at credit assignment and require a large number of samples. In this paper, we extend the $\GPBE$ objective to support multistep credit assignment based on the $\lambda$-return and derive three gradient-based methods that optimize this new objective. We provide both a forward-view formulation compatible with experience replay and a backward-view formulation compatible with streaming algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithms and show that they outperform both PPO and StreamQ in MuJoCo and MinAtar environments, respectively.

      <title>Continuous-Time Signal Decomposition: An Implicit Neural Generalization of PCA and ICA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the low-rank decomposition problem, such as principal and independent component analysis (PCA, ICA) for continuous-time vector-valued signals and provide a model-agnostic implicit neural signal representation framework to learn numerical approximations to solve the problem. Modeling signals as continuous-time stochastic processes, we unify the approaches to both the PCA and ICA problems in the continuous setting through a contrast function term in the network loss, enforcing the desired statistical properties of the source signals (decorrelation, independence) learned in the decomposition. This extension to a continuous domain allows the application of such decompositions to point clouds and irregularly sampled signals where standard techniques are not applicable.</description>

      <title>Sharp Trade-Offs in High-Dimensional Inference via 2-Level SLOPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among techniques for high-dimensional linear regression, Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE) generalizes the LASSO via an adaptive $l_1$ regularization that applies heavier penalties to larger coefficients in the model. To achieve such adaptivity, SLOPE requires the specification of a complex hierarchy of penalties, i.e., a monotone penalty sequence in $R^p$, in contrast to a single penalty scalar for LASSO. Tuning this sequence when $p$ is large poses a challenge, as brute force search over a grid of values is computationally prohibitive. In this work, we study the 2-level SLOPE, an important subclass of SLOPE, with only three hyperparameters. We demonstrate both empirically and analytically that 2-level SLOPE not only preserves the advantages of general SLOPE -- such as improved mean squared error and overcoming the Donoho-Tanner power limit -- but also exhibits computational benefits by reducing the penalty hyperparameter space. In particular, we prove that 2-level SLOPE admits a sharp, theoretically tight characterization of the trade-off between true positive proportion (TPP) and false discovery proportion (FDP), contrasting with general SLOPE where only upper and lower bounds are known. Empirical evaluations further underscore the effectiveness of 2-level SLOPE in settings where predictors exhibit high correlation, when the noise is large, or when the underlying signal is not sparse. Our results suggest that 2-level SLOPE offers a robust, scalable alternative to both LASSO and general SLOPE, making it particularly suited for practical high-dimensional data analysis.</description>

      <title>A Moment-Based Generalization to Post-Prediction Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly used to generate data for downstream analyses, yet naively treating these predictions as true observations can lead to biased results and incorrect inference. Wang et al. (2020) proposed a method, post-prediction inference, which calibrates inference by modeling the relationship between AI/ML-predicted and observed outcomes in a small, gold-standard sample. Since then, several methods have been developed for inference with predicted data. We revisit Wang et al. in light of these recent developments. We reflect on their assumptions and offer a simple extension of their method which relaxes these assumptions. Our extension (1) yields unbiased point estimates under standard conditions and (2) incorporates a simple scaling factor to preserve calibration variability. In extensive simulations, we show that our method maintains nominal Type I error rates, reduces bias, and achieves proper coverage.</description>

      <title>A Study of Value-Aware Eigenoptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Options, which impose an inductive bias toward temporal and hierarchical structure, offer a powerful framework for reinforcement learning (RL). While effective in sequential decision-making, they are often handcrafted rather than learned. Among approaches for discovering options, eigenoptions have shown strong performance in exploration, but their role in credit assignment remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether eigenoptions can accelerate credit assignment in model-free RL, evaluating them in tabular and pixel-based gridworlds. We find that pre-specified eigenoptions aid not only exploration but also credit assignment, whereas online discovery can bias the agent's experience too strongly and hinder learning. In the context of deep RL, we also propose a method for learning option-values under non-linear function approximation, highlighting the impact of termination conditions on performance. Our findings reveal both the promise and complexity of using eigenoptions, and options more broadly, to simultaneously support credit assignment and exploration in reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Continual Reinforcement Learning by Planning with Online World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) refers to a naturalistic setting where an agent needs to endlessly evolve, by trial and error, to solve multiple tasks that are presented sequentially. One of the largest obstacles to CRL is that the agent may forget how to solve previous tasks when learning a new task, known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by planning with online world models. Specifically, we learn a Follow-The-Leader shallow model online to capture the world dynamics, in which we plan using model predictive control to solve a set of tasks specified by any reward functions. The online world model is immune to forgetting by construction with a proven regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K^2D\log(T)})$ under mild assumptions. The planner searches actions solely based on the latest online model, thus forming a FTL Online Agent (OA) that updates incrementally. To assess OA, we further design Continual Bench, a dedicated environment for CRL, and compare with several strong baselines under the same model-planning algorithmic framework. The empirical results show that OA learns continuously to solve new tasks while not forgetting old skills, outperforming agents built on deep world models with various continual learning techniques.</description>

      <title>The BdryMat\'ern GP: Reliable incorporation of boundary information on irregular domains for Gaussian process modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are broadly used as surrogate models for expensive computer simulators of complex phenomena. However, a key bottleneck is that its training data are generated from this expensive simulator and thus can be highly limited. A promising solution is to supplement the learning model with boundary information from scientific knowledge. However, despite recent work on boundary-integrated GPs, such models largely cannot accommodate boundary information on irregular (i.e., non-hypercube) domains, and do not provide sample path smoothness control or approximation error analysis, both of which are important for reliable surrogate modeling. We thus propose a novel BdryMat\'ern GP modeling framework, which can reliably integrate Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundaries on an irregular connected domain with a boundary set that is twice-differentiable almost everywhere. Our model leverages a new BdryMat\'ern covariance kernel derived in path integral form via a stochastic partial differential equation formulation. Similar to the GP with Mat\'ern kernel, we prove that sample paths from the BdryMat\'ern GP satisfy the desired boundaries with smoothness control on its derivatives. We further present an efficient approximation procedure for the BdryMat\'ern kernel using finite element modeling with rigorous error analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the BdryMat\'ern GP in a suite of numerical experiments on incorporating broad boundaries on irregular domains.</description>

      <title>Capturing Unseen Spatial Extremes Through Knowledge-Informed Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observed records of climate extremes provide an incomplete picture of risk, missing "unseen" extremes that exceed historical bounds. In parallel, neglecting spatial dependence undervalues the risk of synchronized hazards that amplify impacts. To address these challenges, we develop DeepX-GAN (Dependence-Enhanced Embedding for Physical eXtremes - Generative Adversarial Network), a knowledge-informed deep generative model designed to better capture the spatial structure of rare extremes. The zero-shot generalizability of DeepX-GAN enables simulation of unseen extremes that fall outside historical experience yet remain statistically plausible. We define two types of unseen extremes: "checkmate" extremes that directly hit targets, and "stalemate" extremes that narrowly miss. These unrealized scenarios expose latent risks in fragile systems and may reinforce a false sense of resilience if overlooked. Near misses, in particular, can prompt either proactive adaptation or dangerous complacency, depending on how they are interpreted. Applying DeepX-GAN to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), we find that these unseen extremes disproportionately affect regions with high vulnerability and low socioeconomic readiness, but differ in urgency and interpretation. Future warming could expand and redistribute these unseen extremes, with emerging exposure hotspots in Indo-Pakistan and Central Africa. This distributional shift highlights critical blind spots in conventional hazard planning and underscores the need to develop spatially adaptive policies that anticipate emergent risk hotspots rather than simply extrapolating from historical patterns.</description>

      <title>Warm Starts Accelerate Generative Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iterative generative models, like diffusion and flow-matching, create high-fidelity samples by progressively refining a noise vector into data. However, this process is notoriously slow, often requiring hundreds of function evaluations. We introduce the warm-start model, a simple, deterministic model that dramatically accelerates conditional generation by providing a better starting point. Instead of starting generation from an uninformed N(0, I) prior, our warm-start model predicts an informed prior N(mu, sigma), whose moments are conditioned on the input context. This "warm start" substantially reduces the distance the generative process must traverse, particularly when the conditioning information is strongly informative. On tasks like image inpainting, our method achieves results competitive with a 1000-step DDPM baseline using only 11 total function evaluations (1 for the warm start, 10 for generation). A simple conditional normalization trick makes our method compatible with any standard generative model and sampler without modification, allowing it to be combined with other efficient sampling techniques for further acceleration. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/jonas-scholz123/warm-start-model.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Basis Function Selection in Constructive Wavelet Neural Networks and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavelet neural network (WNN), which learns an unknown nonlinear mapping from the data, has been widely used in signal processing, and time-series analysis. However, challenges in constructing accurate wavelet bases and high computational costs limit their application. This study introduces a constructive WNN that selects initial bases and trains functions by introducing new bases for predefined accuracy while reducing computational costs. For the first time, we analyze the frequency of unknown nonlinear functions and select appropriate initial wavelets based on their primary frequency components by estimating the energy of the spatial frequency component. This leads to a novel constructive framework consisting of a frequency estimator and a wavelet-basis increase mechanism to prioritize high-energy bases, significantly improving computational efficiency. The theoretical foundation defines the necessary time-frequency range for high-dimensional wavelets at a given accuracy. The framework's versatility is demonstrated through four examples: estimating unknown static mappings from offline data, combining two offline datasets, identifying time-varying mappings from time-series data, and capturing nonlinear dependencies in real time-series data. These examples showcase the framework's broad applicability and practicality. All the code will be released at https://github.com/dshuangdd/CWNN.</description>

      <title>A CLuP algorithm to practically achieve $\sim 0.76$ SK--model ground state free energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider algorithmic determination of the $n$-dimensional Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model ground state free energy. It corresponds to a binary maximization of an indefinite quadratic form and under the \emph{worst case} principles of the classical NP complexity theory it is hard to approximate within a $\log(n)^{const.}$ factor. On the other hand, the SK's random nature allows (polynomial) spectral methods to \emph{typically} approach the optimum within a constant factor. Naturally one is left with the fundamental question: can the residual (constant) \emph{computational gap} be erased?
  Following the success of \emph{Controlled Loosening-up} (CLuP) algorithms in planted models, we here devise a simple practical CLuP-SK algorithmic procedure for (non-planted) SK models. To analyze the \emph{typical} success of the algorithm we associate to it (random) CLuP-SK models. Further connecting to recent random processes studies [94,97], we characterize the models and CLuP-SK algorithm via fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [98]. Moreover, running the algorithm we demonstrate that its performance is in an excellent agrement with theoretical predictions. In particular, already for $n$ on the order of a few thousands CLuP-SK achieves $\sim 0.76$ ground state free energy and remarkably closely approaches theoretical $n\rightarrow\infty$ limit $\approx 0.763$. For all practical purposes, this renders computing SK model's near ground state free energy as a \emph{typically} easy problem.</description>

      <title>TPP-SD: Accelerating Transformer Point Process Sampling with Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose TPP-SD, a novel approach that accelerates Transformer temporal point process (TPP) sampling by adapting speculative decoding (SD) techniques from language models. By identifying the structural similarities between thinning algorithms for TPPs and speculative decoding for language models, we develop an efficient sampling framework that leverages a smaller draft model to generate multiple candidate events, which are then verified by the larger target model in parallel. TPP-SD maintains the same output distribution as autoregressive sampling while achieving significant acceleration. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approach produces samples from identical distributions as standard methods, but with 2-6$\times$ speedup. Our ablation studies analyze the impact of hyperparameters such as draft length and draft model size on sampling efficiency. TPP-SD bridges the gap between powerful Transformer TPP models and the practical need for rapid sequence sampling.</description>

We propose an integrated approach that combines advanced statistical methodologies with machine learning models to enhance the identification and exploitation of predictive relationships between equities. Methods: We employed a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to cluster nine prominent stocks based on their mid-range historical volatility profiles over a three-year period. From the resulting clusters, we constructed a multi-stage causal inference pipeline, incorporating the Granger Causality Test (GCT), a customised Peter-Clark Momentary Conditional Independence (PCMCI) test, and Effective Transfer Entropy (ETE) to identify robust, predictive linkages. Subsequently, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier were utilised to determine the optimal time lag for trade execution. The resulting strategy was rigorously backtested. Results: The proposed volatility-based trading strategy, tested from 8 June 2023 to 12 August 2023, demonstrated substantial efficacy. The portfolio yielded a total return of 15.38%, significantly outperforming the 10.39% return of a comparative Buy-and-Hold strategy. Key performance metrics, including a Sharpe Ratio up to 2.17 and a win rate up to 100% for certain pairs, confirmed the strategy's viability. Conclusion: This research contributes a systematic and robust methodology for identifying profitable trading opportunities derived from volatility-based causal relationships. The findings have significant implications for both academic research in financial modelling and the practical application of algorithmic trading, offering a structured approach to developing resilient, data-driven strategies.</description>

      <title>Impute With Confidence: A Framework for Uncertainty Aware Multivariate Time Series Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data with missing values is common across many domains. Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation. By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating uncertainty into time series imputation.</description>

      <title>Robust Spatiotemporal Epidemic Modeling with Integrated Adaptive Outlier Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In epidemic modeling, outliers can distort parameter estimation and ultimately lead to misguided public health decisions. Although there are existing robust methods that can mitigate this distortion, the ability to simultaneously detect outliers is equally vital for identifying potential disease hotspots. In this work, we introduce a robust spatiotemporal generalized additive model (RST-GAM) to address this need. We accomplish this with a mean-shift parameter to quantify and adjust for the effects of outliers and rely on adaptive Lasso regularization to model the sparsity of outlying observations. We use univariate polynomial splines and bivariate penalized splines over triangulations to estimate the functional forms and a data-thinning approach for data-adaptive weight construction. We derive a scalable proximal algorithm to estimate model parameters by minimizing a convex negative log-quasi-likelihood function. Our algorithm uses adaptive step-sizes to ensure global convergence of the resulting iterate sequence. We establish error bounds and selection consistency for the estimated parameters and demonstrate our model's effectiveness through numerical studies under various outlier scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of RST-GAM by analyzing county-level COVID-19 infection data in the United States, highlighting its potential to inform public health decision-making.</description>

      <title>Optimal Differentially Private Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data privacy is a central concern in many applications involving ranking from incomplete and noisy pairwise comparisons, such as recommendation systems, educational assessments, and opinion surveys on sensitive topics. In this work, we propose differentially private algorithms for ranking based on pairwise comparisons. Specifically, we develop and analyze ranking methods under two privacy notions: edge differential privacy, which protects the confidentiality of individual comparison outcomes, and individual differential privacy, which safeguards potentially many comparisons contributed by a single individual. Our algorithms--including a perturbed maximum likelihood estimator and a noisy count-based method--are shown to achieve minimax optimal rates of convergence under the respective privacy constraints. We further demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our methods through experiments on both simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Fourier Basis Mapping: A Time-Frequency Learning Framework for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear, MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking, centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Aware Dynamic Resource Allocation under Long-Term Cost Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications such as cloud platforms allocating GPUs to users or governments deploying mobile health units across competing regions, we study the dynamic allocation of a reusable resource to strategic agents with private valuations. Our objective is to simultaneously (i) maximize social welfare, (ii) satisfy multi-dimensional long-term cost constraints, and (iii) incentivize truthful reporting. We begin by numerically evaluating primal-dual methods widely used in constrained online optimization and find them to be highly fragile in strategic settings -- agents can easily manipulate their reports to distort future dual updates for future gain.
  To address this vulnerability, we develop an incentive-aware framework that makes primal-dual methods robust to strategic behavior. Our design combines epoch-based lazy updates -- where dual variables remain fixed within each epoch -- with randomized exploration rounds that extract approximately truthful signals for learning. Leveraging carefully designed online learning subroutines that can be of independent interest for dual updates, our mechanism achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ social welfare regret, satisfies all cost constraints, and ensures incentive alignment. This matches the performance of non-strategic allocation approaches while being robust to strategic agents.</description>

      <title>Frequency-aware Surrogate Modeling With SMT Kernels For Advanced Data Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive open-source framework for developing correlation kernels, with a particular focus on user-defined and composition of kernels for surrogate modeling. By advancing kernel-based modeling techniques, we incorporate frequency-aware elements that effectively capture complex mechanical behaviors and timefrequency dynamics intrinsic to aircraft systems. Traditional kernel functions, often limited to exponential-based methods, are extended to include a wider range of kernels such as exponential squared sine and rational quadratic kernels, along with their respective firstand second-order derivatives. The proposed methodologies are first validated on a sinus cardinal test case and then applied to forecasting Mauna-Loa Carbon Dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations and airline passenger traffic. All these advancements are integrated into the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0), providing a versatile platform for both standard and customizable kernel configurations. Furthermore, the framework enables the combination of various kernels to leverage their unique strengths into composite models tailored to specific problems. The resulting framework offers a flexible toolset for engineers and researchers, paving the way for numerous future applications in metamodeling for complex, frequency-sensitive domains.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The matrix scaling problem, particularly the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, has been studied for over 60 years. In practice, the algorithm often yields high-quality approximations within just a few iterations. Theoretically, however, the best-known upper bound places it in the class of pseudopolynomial-time approximation algorithms. Meanwhile, the lower-bound landscape remains largely unexplored. Two fundamental questions persist: what accounts for the algorithm's strong empirical performance, and can a tight bound on its iteration count be established?
  For an $n\times n$ matrix, its normalized version is obtained by dividing each entry by its largest entry. We say that a normalized matrix has a density $\gamma$ if there exists a constant $\rho &gt; 0$ such that one row or column has exactly $\lceil \gamma n \rceil$ entries with values at least $\rho$, and every other row and column has at least $\lceil \gamma n \rceil$ such entries.
  For the upper bound, we show that the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm produces a nearly doubly stochastic matrix in $O(\log n - \log \varepsilon)$ iterations and $\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ time for all nonnegative square matrices whose normalized version has a density $\gamma &gt; 1/2$. Such matrices cover both the algorithm's principal practical inputs and its typical theoretical regime, and the $\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ runtime is optimal.
  For the lower bound, we establish a tight bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}\left(n^{1/2}/\varepsilon\right)$ iterations for positive matrices under the $\ell_2$-norm error measure. Moreover, for every $\gamma &lt; 1/2$, there exists a matrix with density $\gamma$ for which the algorithm requires $\Omega\left(n^{1/2}/\varepsilon\right)$ iterations.
  In summary, our results reveal a sharp phase transition in the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm at the density threshold $\gamma = 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Through the River: Understanding the Benefit of Schedule-Free Methods for Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly, conventional pretraining strategies with fixed compute budgets-such as cosine learning rate schedules-are increasingly inadequate for large-scale training. Recent alternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight averaging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay phases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at the cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable alternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024], which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show that SF-AdamW effectively navigates the "river" structure of the loss landscape without decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable for continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this analysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to momentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key limitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model training.</description>

      <title>NeuTSFlow: Modeling Continuous Functions Behind Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet conventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their origin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy observations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they correspond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can be viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a shared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as learning the transition from the historical function family to the future function family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we leverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships between their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the transition path in function space from the historical function family to the future function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a novel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for learning path of measure between historical and future function families. By parameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function spaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies at discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead. Experiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family perspective.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Conditional Group Distributionally Robust Optimization with Cross-Entropy Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-source learning with discrete labels, distributional heterogeneity across domains poses a central challenge to developing predictive models that transfer reliably to unseen domains. We study multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation, where labeled data are drawn from multiple source domains and only unlabeled data from a target domain. To address potential distribution shifts, we propose a novel Conditional Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (CG-DRO) framework that learns a classifier by minimizing the worst-case cross-entropy loss over the convex combinations of the conditional outcome distributions from the sources. To solve the resulting minimax problem, we develop an efficient Mirror Prox algorithm, where we employ a double machine learning procedure to estimate the risk function. This ensures that the errors of the machine learning estimators for the nuisance models enter only at higher-order rates, thereby preserving statistical efficiency under covariate shift. We establish fast statistical convergence rates for the estimator by constructing two surrogate minimax optimization problems that serve as theoretical bridges. A distinguishing challenge for CG-DRO is the emergence of nonstandard asymptotics: the empirical estimator may fail to converge to a standard limiting distribution due to boundary effects and system instability. To address this, we introduce a perturbation-based inference procedure that enables uniformly valid inference, including confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Solving dynamic portfolio selection problems via score-based diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the dynamic mean-variance portfolio selection problem in a {\it model-free} manner, based on (generative) diffusion models. We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathcal P$ (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathcal Q$ (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between $\mathcal P$ and $\mathcal Q$ in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important baselines, including the Markowitz portfolio, the equal weight (naive) portfolio, and S\&amp;P 500.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating the containment and similarity between two sets using only random samples from each set, without relying on sketches or full data access. The study introduces a binomial model for predicting the overlap between samples, demonstrating that it is both accurate and practical when sample sizes are small compared to the original sets. The paper compares this model to previous approaches and shows that it provides better estimates under the considered conditions. It also analyzes the statistical properties of the estimator, including error bounds and sample size requirements needed to achieve a desired level of accuracy and confidence. The framework is extended to estimate set similarity, and the paper provides guidance for applying these methods in large scale data systems where only partial or sampled data is available.</description>

      <title>Towards High Supervised Learning Utility Training Data Generation: Data Pruning and Column Reordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tabular data synthesis for supervised learning ('SL') model training is gaining popularity in industries such as healthcare, finance, and retail. Despite the progress made in tabular data generators, models trained with synthetic data often underperform compared to those trained with original data. This low SL utility of synthetic data stems from class imbalance exaggeration and SL data relationship overlooked by tabular generator. To address these challenges, we draw inspirations from techniques in emerging data-centric artificial intelligence and elucidate Pruning and ReOrdering ('PRRO'), a novel pipeline that integrates data-centric techniques into tabular data synthesis. PRRO incorporates data pruning to guide the table generator towards observations with high signal-to-noise ratio, ensuring that the class distribution of synthetic data closely matches that of the original data. Besides, PRRO employs a column reordering algorithm to align the data modeling structure of generators with that of SL models. These two modules enable PRRO to optimize SL utility of synthetic data. Empirical experiments on 22 public datasets show that synthetic data generated using PRRO enhances predictive performance compared to data generated without PRRO. Specifically, synthetic replacement of original data yields an average improvement of 26.74% and up to 871.46% improvement using PRRO, while synthetic appendant to original data results with PRRO-generated data results in an average improvement of 6.13% and up to 200.32%. Furthermore, experiments on six highly imbalanced datasets show that PRRO enables the generator to produce synthetic data with a class distribution that resembles the original data more closely, achieving a similarity improvement of 43%. Through PRRO, we foster a seamless integration of data synthesis to subsequent SL prediction, promoting quality and accessible data analysis.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Enhanced Neural ODE and Graph Attention for Interpretable Energy Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of energy demand and supply is critical for optimizing sustainable energy systems, yet it is challenged by the variability of renewable sources and dynamic consumption patterns. This paper introduces a neural framework that integrates continuous-time Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), graph attention, multi-resolution wavelet transformations, and adaptive learning of frequencies to address the issues of time series prediction. The model employs a robust ODE solver, using the Runge-Kutta method, paired with graph-based attention and residual connections to better understand both structural and temporal patterns. Through wavelet-based feature extraction and adaptive frequency modulation, it adeptly captures and models diverse, multi-scale temporal dynamics. When evaluated across seven diverse datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2 (electricity transformer temperature), and Waste, Solar, and Hydro (renewable energy), this architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various forecasting metrics, proving its robustness in capturing complex temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the model enhances interpretability through SHAP analysis, making it suitable for sustainable energy applications.</description>

      <title>Multiple Choice Learning of Low Rank Adapters for Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose LoRA-MCL, a training scheme that extends next-token prediction in language models with a method designed to decode diverse, plausible sentence continuations at inference time. Traditional language modeling is an intrinsically ill-posed problem: given a context, multiple futures may be equally plausible. Our approach leverages Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to efficiently handle ambiguity through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We provide a theoretical interpretation of applying Multiple Choice Learning to Language Modeling, assuming the data is generated from a mixture of distributions. To illustrate the proposed approach, we use data sampled from mixtures of Markov chains. We then demonstrate with extensive experiments on real-world visual and audio captioning tasks that our method achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable Conformal Prediction with Optimal Transport: Tackling Distribution Shifts with Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method that has gained popularity in the machine learning community due to its finite-sample guarantees and ease of use. Its most common variant, dubbed split conformal prediction, is also computationally efficient as it boils down to collecting statistics of the model predictions on some calibration data not yet seen by the model. Nonetheless, these guarantees only hold if the calibration and test data are exchangeable, a condition that is difficult to verify and often violated in practice due to so-called distribution shifts. The literature is rife with methods to mitigate the loss in coverage in this non-exchangeable setting, but these methods require some prior information on the type of distribution shift to be expected at test time. In this work, we study this problem via a new perspective, through the lens of optimal transport, and show that it is possible to estimate the loss in coverage and mitigate it in case of distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network Based Accelerated Failure Time Models using Rank Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accelerated failure time (AFT) model assumes a log-linear relationship between failure times and a set of covariates. In contrast to other popular survival models that work on hazard functions, the effects of covariates are directly on failure times, whose interpretation is intuitive. The semiparametric AFT model that does not specify the error distribution is flexible and robust to departures from the distributional assumption. Owing to the desirable features, this class of models has been considered as a promising alternative to the popular Cox model in the analysis of censored failure time data. However, in these AFT models, a linear predictor for the mean is typically assumed. Little research has addressed the nonlinearity of predictors when modeling the mean. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have received a focal attention over the past decades and have achieved remarkable success in a variety of fields. DNNs have a number of notable advantages and have been shown to be particularly useful in addressing the nonlinearity. By taking advantage of this, we propose to apply DNNs in fitting AFT models using a Gehan-type loss, combined with a sub-sampling technique. Finite sample properties of the proposed DNN and rank based AFT model (DeepR-AFT) are investigated via an extensive stimulation study. DeepR-AFT shows a superior performance over its parametric or semiparametric counterparts when the predictor is nonlinear. For linear predictors, DeepR-AFT performs better when the dimensions of covariates are large. The proposed DeepR-AFT is illustrated using two real datasets, which demonstrates its superiority.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Worst-class Error: A Boosting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of the worst-class error rate, instead of the standard error rate averaged over all classes. For example, a three-class classification task with class-wise error rates of 10%, 10%, and 40% has a worst-class error rate of 40%, whereas the average is 20% under the class-balanced condition. The worst-class error is important in many applications. For example, in a medical image classification task, it would not be acceptable for the malignant tumor class to have a 40% error rate, while the benign and healthy classes have a 10% error rates. To avoid overfitting in worst-class error minimization using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), we design a problem formulation for bounding the worst-class error instead of achieving zero worst-class error. Moreover, to correctly bound the worst-class error, we propose a boosting approach which ensembles DNNs. We give training and generalization worst-class-error bound. Experimental results show that the algorithm lowers worst-class test error rates while avoiding overfitting to the training set.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies a family of estimators based on noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) for learning unnormalized distributions. The main contribution of this work is to provide a unified perspective on various methods for learning unnormalized distributions, which have been independently proposed and studied in separate research communities, through the lens of NCE. This unified view offers new insights into existing estimators. Specifically, for exponential families, we establish the finite-sample convergence rates of the proposed estimators under a set of regularity assumptions, most of which are new.</description>

      <title>LITE: Efficiently Estimating Gaussian Probability of Maximality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing the probability of maximality (PoM) of a Gaussian random vector, i.e., the probability for each dimension to be maximal. This is a key challenge in applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to reinforcement learning, where the PoM not only helps with finding an optimal action, but yields a fine-grained analysis of the action domain, crucial in tasks such as drug discovery. Existing techniques are costly, scaling polynomially in computation and memory with the vector size. We introduce LITE, the first approach for estimating Gaussian PoM with almost-linear time and memory complexity. LITE achieves SOTA accuracy on a number of tasks, while being in practice several orders of magnitude faster than the baselines. This also translates to a better performance on downstream tasks such as entropy estimation and optimal control of bandits. Theoretically, we cast LITE as entropy-regularized UCB and connect it to prior PoM estimators.</description>

      <title>Discrimination-free Insurance Pricing with Privatized Sensitive Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fairness has emerged as a critical consideration in the landscape of machine learning algorithms, particularly as AI continues to transform decision-making across societal domains. To ensure that these algorithms are free from bias and do not discriminate against individuals based on sensitive attributes such as gender and race, the field of algorithmic bias has introduced various fairness concepts, along with methodologies to achieve these notions in different contexts. Despite the rapid advancement, not all sectors have embraced these fairness principles to the same extent. One specific sector that merits attention in this regard is insurance. Within the realm of insurance pricing, fairness is defined through a distinct and specialized framework. Consequently, achieving fairness according to established notions does not automatically ensure fair pricing in insurance. In particular, regulators are increasingly emphasizing transparency in pricing algorithms and imposing constraints on insurance companies on the collection and utilization of sensitive consumer attributes. These factors present additional challenges in the implementation of fairness in pricing algorithms. To address these complexities and comply with regulatory demands, we propose an efficient method for constructing fair models that are tailored to the insurance domain, using only privatized sensitive attributes. Notably, our approach ensures statistical guarantees, does not require direct access to sensitive attributes, and adapts to varying transparency requirements, addressing regulatory demands while ensuring fairness in insurance pricing.</description>

      <title>Risk Bounds For Distributional Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines risk bounds for nonparametric distributional regression estimators. For convex-constrained distributional regression, general upper bounds are established for the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and the worst-case mean squared error (MSE) across the domain. These theoretical results are applied to isotonic and trend filtering distributional regression, yielding convergence rates consistent with those for mean estimation. Furthermore, a general upper bound is derived for distributional regression under non-convex constraints, with a specific application to neural network-based estimators. Comprehensive experiments on both simulated and real data validate the theoretical contributions, demonstrating their practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Constrained Sampling: A Large Deviations Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC) based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD. Although acceleration for SRNLD has been studied, it is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix accelerates the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD and reduces the asymptotic variance. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance, which validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.</description>

      <title>Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization for Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence is presented that the accuracy of Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics framework is improved using the coupled entropy, which carefully establishes the physical measures of complex systems. While Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful toolset, questions have persisted as to how to evaluate whether its proposed solutions properly characterize the uncertainty of heavy-tailed distributions. The entropy of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) is $1+\kappa+\ln\sigma$, where $\kappa$ is the shape or nonlinear coupling and $\sigma$ is the scale. A generalized entropy should retain the uncertainty due to the scale, while minimizing the dependence of the nonlinear coupling. The Tsallis entropy of the GPD instead subtracts a function of the inverse-scale and converges to one as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. Colloquially, the Tsallis entropy is too cold. The normalized Tsallis entropy (NTE) rectifies the positive dependence on the scale but introduces a nonlinear term multiplying the scale and the coupling, making it too hot. The coupled entropy measures the uncertainty of the GPD to be $1+\ln_\frac{\kappa}{1+\kappa}\sigma=1+\frac{1+\kappa}{\kappa}(\sigma^\frac{\kappa}{1+\kappa}-1)$, which converges to $\sigma$ as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. One could say, the coupled entropy allows scientists, engineers, and analysts to eat their porridge, confident that its measure of uncertainty reflects the mathematical physics of the scale of non-exponential distributions while minimizing the dependence on the shape or nonlinear coupling. The training of the coupled variational autoencoder is an example of the unique ability of the coupled entropy to improve the performance of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Hyperspherical Variational Autoencoders Using Efficient Spherical Cauchy Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture that employs a spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distribution. Unlike traditional Gaussian latent spaces or the widely used von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, spCauchy provides a more natural hyperspherical representation of latent variables, better capturing directional data while maintaining flexibility. Its heavy-tailed nature prevents over-regularization, ensuring efficient latent space utilization while offering a more expressive representation. Additionally, spCauchy circumvents the numerical instabilities inherent to vMF, which arise from computing normalization constants involving Bessel functions. Instead, it enables a fully differentiable and efficient reparameterization trick via M\"obius transformations, allowing for stable and scalable training. The KL divergence can be computed through a rapidly converging power series, eliminating concerns of underflow or overflow associated with evaluation of ratios of hypergeometric functions. These properties make spCauchy a compelling alternative for VAEs, offering both theoretical advantages and practical efficiency in high-dimensional generative modeling.</description>

Abstract: Volunteer labor can temporarily yield lower benefits to charities than its costs. In such instances, organizations may wish to defer volunteer donations to a later date. Exploiting a discontinuity in blood donations' eligibility criteria, we show that deferring donors reduces their future volunteerism. In our setting, medical staff manipulates donors' reported hemoglobin levels over a threshold to facilitate donation. Such manipulation invalidates standard regression discontinuity design. To circumvent this issue, we propose a procedure for obtaining partial identification bounds where manipulation is present. Our procedure is applicable in various regression discontinuity settings where the running variable is manipulated.</description>

      <title>Score Attack: A Lower Bound Technique for Optimal Differentially Private Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving optimal statistical performance while ensuring the privacy of personal data is a challenging yet crucial objective in modern data analysis. However, characterizing the optimality, particularly the minimax lower bound, under privacy constraints is technically difficult. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called the score attack, which provides a lower bound on the differential-privacy-constrained minimax risk of parameter estimation. The score attack method is based on the tracing attack concept in differential privacy and can be applied to any statistical model with a well-defined score statistic. It can optimally lower bound the minimax risk of estimating unknown model parameters, up to a logarithmic factor, while ensuring differential privacy for a range of statistical problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness and optimality of this general method in various examples, such as the generalized linear model in both classical and high-dimensional sparse settings, the Bradley-Terry-Luce model for pairwise comparisons, and non-parametric regression over the Sobolev class.</description>

      <title>Don't be so negative! Score-based Generative Modeling with Oracle-assisted Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models, widely utilized across diverse domains. Despite significant advancements in large-scale tasks such as text-to-image generation, their application to constrained domains has received considerably less attention. This work addresses model learning in a setting where, in addition to the training dataset, there further exists side-information in the form of an oracle that can label samples as being outside the support of the true data generating distribution. Specifically we develop a new denoising diffusion probabilistic modeling methodology, Gen-neG, that leverages this additional side-information. Gen-neG builds on classifier guidance in diffusion models to guide the generation process towards the positive support region indicated by the oracle. We empirically establish the utility of Gen-neG in applications including collision avoidance in self-driving simulators and safety-guarded human motion generation.</description>

      <title>Transformers Can Solve Non-Linear and Non-Markovian Filtering Problems in Continuous Time For Conditionally Gaussian Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19603</link>

Abstract: The use of attention-based deep learning models in stochastic filtering, e.g. transformers and deep Kalman filters, has recently come into focus; however, the potential for these models to solve stochastic filtering problems remains largely unknown. The paper provides an affirmative answer to this open problem in the theoretical foundations of machine learning by showing that a class of continuous-time transformer models, called \textit{filterformers}, can approximately implement the conditional law of a broad class of non-Markovian and conditionally Gaussian signal processes given noisy continuous-time (possibly non-Gaussian) measurements. Our approximation guarantees hold uniformly over sufficiently regular compact subsets of continuous-time paths, where the worst-case 2-Wasserstein distance between the true optimal filter and our deep learning model quantifies the approximation error. Our construction relies on two new customizations of the standard attention mechanism: The first can losslessly adapt to the characteristics of a broad range of paths since we show that the attention mechanism implements bi-Lipschitz embeddings of sufficiently regular sets of paths into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces; thus, it incurs no ``dimension reduction error''. The latter attention mechanism is tailored to the geometry of Gaussian measures in the $2$-Wasserstein space. Our analysis relies on new stability estimates of robust optimal filters in the conditionally Gaussian setting.</description>

      <title>Spurious Stationarity and Hardness Results for Bregman Proximal-Type Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bregman proximal-type algorithms (BPs), such as mirror descent, have become popular tools in machine learning and data science for exploiting problem structures through non-Euclidean geometries. In this paper, we show that BPs can get trapped near a class of non-stationary points, which we term spurious stationary points. Such stagnation can persist for any finite number of iterations if the gradient of the Bregman kernel is not Lipschitz continuous, even in convex problems. The root cause lies in a fundamental contrast in descent behavior between Euclidean and Bregman geometries: While Euclidean gradient descent ensures sufficient decrease near any non-stationary point, BPs may exhibit arbitrarily slow decrease around spurious stationary points. As a result, commonly used Bregman-based stationarity measure, such as relative change in terms of Bregman divergence, can vanish near spurious stationary points. This may misleadingly suggest convergence, even when the iterates remain far from any true stationary point. Our analysis further reveals that spurious stationary points are not pathological, but rather occur generically in a broad class of nonconvex problems with polyhedral constraints. Taken together, our findings reveal a serious blind spot in Bregman-based optimization methods and calls for new theoretical tools and algorithmic safeguards to ensure reliable convergence.</description>

      <title>On the Uniform Convergence of Subdifferentials in Stochastic Optimization and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10289v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the uniform convergence of subdifferential mappings from empirical risk to population risk in nonsmooth, nonconvex stochastic optimization. This question is key to understanding how empirical stationary points approximate population ones, yet characterizing this convergence remains a fundamental challenge due to the set-valued and nonsmooth nature of subdifferentials. This work establishes a general reduction principle: for weakly convex stochastic objectives, over any open subset of the domain, we show that a uniform bound on the convergence of selected subgradients-chosen arbitrarily from subdifferential sets-yields a corresponding uniform bound on the Hausdorff distance between the subdifferentials. This deterministic result reduces the study of set-valued subdifferential convergence to simpler vector-valued subgradient convergence. We apply this reduction to derive sharp uniform convergence rates for subdifferential mappings in stochastic convex-composite optimization, without relying on differentiability assumptions on the population risk. These guarantees clarify the landscape of nonsmooth empirical objectives and offer new insight into the geometry of optimization problems arising in robust statistics and related applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to address practical real-world problems. When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with physical learning applications in physics and quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery-Driven Change Point Detection in Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Change point detection in time series aims to identify moments when the probability distribution of time series changes. It is widely applied in many areas, such as human activity sensing and medical science. In the context of multivariate time series, this typically involves examining the joint distribution of multiple variables: If the distribution of any one variable changes, the entire time series undergoes a distribution shift. However, in practical applications, we may be interested only in certain components of the time series, exploring abrupt changes in their distributions while accounting for the presence of other components. Here, assuming an underlying structural causal model that governs the time-series data generation, we address this task by proposing a two-stage non-parametric algorithm that first learns parts of the causal structure through constraint-based discovery methods, and then employs conditional relative Pearson divergence estimation to identify the change points. The conditional relative Pearson divergence quantifies the distribution difference between consecutive segments in the time series, while the causal discovery method allows a focus on the causal mechanism, facilitating access to independent and identically distributed (IID) samples. Theoretically, the typical assumption of samples being IID in conventional change point detection methods can be relaxed based on the Causal Markov Condition. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate the correctness and utility of our approach.</description>

      <title>Winners with Confidence: Discrete Argmin Inference with an Application to Model Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding the index of the minimum value of a vector from noisy observations. This problem is relevant in population/policy comparison, discrete maximum likelihood, and model selection. We develop an asymptotically normal test statistic, even in high-dimensional settings and with potentially many ties in the population mean vector, by integrating concepts and tools from cross-validation and differential privacy. The key technical ingredient is a central limit theorem for globally dependent data. We also propose practical ways to select the tuning parameter that adapts to the signal landscape. Numerical experiments and data examples demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Skills from Unlabeled Prior Data for Efficient Online Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18076v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised pretraining has been transformative in many supervised domains. However, applying such ideas to reinforcement learning (RL) presents a unique challenge in that fine-tuning does not involve mimicking task-specific data, but rather exploring and locating the solution through iterative self-improvement. In this work, we study how unlabeled offline trajectory data can be leveraged to learn efficient exploration strategies. While prior data can be used to pretrain a set of low-level skills, or as additional off-policy data for online RL, it has been unclear how to combine these ideas effectively for online exploration. Our method SUPE (Skills from Unlabeled Prior data for Exploration) demonstrates that a careful combination of these ideas compounds their benefits. Our method first extracts low-level skills using a variational autoencoder (VAE), and then pseudo-labels unlabeled trajectories with optimistic rewards and high-level action labels, transforming prior data into high-level, task-relevant examples that encourage novelty-seeking behavior. Finally, SUPE uses these transformed examples as additional off-policy data for online RL to learn a high-level policy that composes pretrained low-level skills to explore efficiently. In our experiments, SUPE consistently outperforms prior strategies across a suite of 42 long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Code: https://github.com/rail-berkeley/supe.</description>

      <title>TabDPT: Scaling Tabular Foundation Models on Real Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tabular data is one of the most ubiquitous sources of information worldwide, spanning a wide variety of domains. This inherent heterogeneity has slowed the development of Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) capable of fast generalization to unseen datasets. In-Context Learning (ICL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for TFMs, enabling dynamic adaptation to new tasks without additional tuning. While many studies have attempted to re-purpose large language models for tabular ICL, they have had limited success, so recent works have focused on developing tabular-specific foundation models. In this work, we propose an approach to combine ICL-based retrieval with self supervised learning to train tabular foundation models. We also investigate the utility of real vs. synthetic data for model pre-training, and show that real data can contain useful signal not easily captured in synthetic training. Specifically, we show that incorporating real data during the pre-training phase can lead to significantly faster training and better downstream generalization to unseen data. Our resulting model, TabDPT, achieves top performance on both regression (CTR23) and classification (CC18) benchmarks. Importantly, we also demonstrate that with our pre-training procedure, scaling both model and data size leads to consistent performance improvements that follow power laws. This echoes scaling laws in LLMs and other foundation models, and suggests that Internet-scale TFMs can be achievable. We open-source our full pipeline: inference code including trained model weights can be found at github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-inference, and the training code to reproduce experiments can be found at github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-training.</description>

      <title>DFRot: Achieving Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free for Rotated LLMs with Refined Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating the activation and weight matrices to reduce the influence of outliers in large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted significant attention, particularly in the context of model quantization. Prior studies have shown that in low-precision quantization scenarios, such as 4-bit weights and 4-bit activations (W4A4), randomized Hadamard transforms can achieve significantly higher accuracy than randomized orthogonal transforms. Notably, the reason behind this phenomenon remains unknown. In this paper, we find that these transformations show substantial improvement in eliminating outliers for common tokens and achieve similar quantization error. The primary reason for the accuracy difference lies in the fact that randomized Hadamard transforms can slightly reduce the quantization error for tokens with massive activations while randomized orthogonal transforms increase the quantization error. Due to the extreme rarity of these tokens and their critical impact on model accuracy, we consider this a long-tail optimization problem, and therefore construct a simple yet effective method: a weighted loss function. Additionally, we propose an optimization strategy for the rotation matrix that involves alternating optimization of quantization parameters while employing orthogonal Procrustes transforms to refine the rotation matrix. This makes the distribution of the rotated activation values more conducive to quantization, especially for tokens with massive activations. Our method enhances the Rotated LLMs by achieving dual free, Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free, dubbed as DFRot. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DFRot. By tuning the rotation matrix using just a single sample, DFRot achieves a perplexity improvement of 0.98 and 0.95 on W4A4KV4 and W4A4KV16, respectively, for LLaMA3-70B, a model known for its quantization challenges.</description>

      <title>Prune 'n Predict: Optimizing LLM Decision-making with Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are empowering decision-making in several applications, including tool or API usage and answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, incorrect outputs pose significant risks in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance. To quantify LLM uncertainty and thereby mitigate these risks, recent works employ conformal prediction (CP), a model- and distribution-agnostic framework that uses LLM outputs to generate a \emph{prediction set} containing the true answer with high probability. Leveraging CP, we propose \emph{conformal revision of questions} (CROQ), which revises the question by narrowing down the available choices to those in the prediction set and asking the LLM the revised question. We expect LLMs to be more accurate on revised questions with fewer choices. Furthermore, we expect CROQ to be effective when the prediction sets from CP are small. Commonly used logit scores often lead to large sets, diminishing CROQ's effectiveness. To overcome this, we propose CP-OPT, an optimization framework to learn scores that minimize set sizes while maintaining coverage. Our extensive experiments on MMLU, ToolAlpaca, and TruthfulQA datasets with multiple LLMs show that CROQ improves accuracy over the standard inference, with more pronounced gains when paired with CP-OPT.</description>

      <title>Improved Offline Contextual Bandits with Second-Order Bounds: Betting and Freezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider off-policy selection and learning in contextual bandits, where the learner aims to select or train a reward-maximizing policy using data collected by a fixed behavior policy. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a novel off-policy selection method that leverages a new betting-based confidence bound applied to an inverse propensity weight sequence. Our theoretical analysis reveals that this method achieves a significantly improved, variance-adaptive guarantee over prior work. Second, we propose a novel and generic condition on the optimization objective for off-policy learning that strikes a different balance between bias and variance. One special case, which we call freezing, tends to induce low variance, which is preferred in small-data regimes. Our analysis shows that it matches the best existing guarantees. In our empirical study, our selection method outperforms existing methods, and freezing exhibits improved performance in small-sample regimes.</description>

      <title>Learning-Order Autoregressive Models with Application to Molecular Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have become the workhorse for sequence generation tasks, since many problems can be modeled as next-token prediction. While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an order-policy, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated across key metrics for distribution similarity and drug-likeless.</description>

      <title>Tractable downfall of basis pursuit in structured sparse optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of finding the sparsest solution to a linear underdetermined system of equations, often appearing, e.g., in data analysis, optimal control, system identification or sensor selection problems, is considered. This non-convex problem is commonly solved by convexification via $\ell_1$-norm minimization, known as basis pursuit (BP). In this work, a class of structured matrices, representing the system of equations, is introduced for which (BP) tractably fails to recover the sparsest solution. In particular, this enables efficient identification of matrix columns corresponding to unrecoverable non-zero entries of the sparsest solution and determination of the uniqueness of such a solution. These deterministic guarantees contrast with popular probabilistic ones and provide insights into the a priori design of sparse optimization problems. As our matrix structures appear naturally in optimal control problems, we exemplify our findings based on a fuel-optimal control problem for a class of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in visual domains such as image and video generation. They have also recently emerged as a promising approach in robotics, especially in robot manipulations. Diffusion models leverage a probabilistic framework, and they stand out with their ability to model multi-modal distributions and their robustness to high-dimensional input and output spaces. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art diffusion models in robotic manipulation, including grasp learning, trajectory planning, and data augmentation. Diffusion models for scene and image augmentation lie at the intersection of robotics and computer vision for vision-based tasks to enhance generalizability and data scarcity. This paper also presents the two main frameworks of diffusion models and their integration with imitation learning and reinforcement learning. In addition, it discusses the common architectures and benchmarks and points out the challenges and advantages of current state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.</description>

      <title>Divergence of Empirical Neural Tangent Kernel in Classification Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that in classification problems, fully connected neural networks (FCNs) and residual neural networks (ResNets) cannot be approximated by kernel logistic regression based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) under overtraining (i.e., when training time approaches infinity). Specifically, when using the cross-entropy loss, regardless of how large the network width is (as long as it is finite), the empirical NTK diverges from the NTK on the training samples as training time increases. To establish this result, we first demonstrate the strictly positive definiteness of the NTKs for multi-layer FCNs and ResNets. Then, we prove that during training, % with the cross-entropy loss, the neural network parameters diverge if the smallest eigenvalue of the empirical NTK matrix (Gram matrix) with respect to training samples is bounded below by a positive constant. This behavior contrasts sharply with the lazy training regime commonly observed in regression problems. Consequently, using a proof by contradiction, we show that the empirical NTK does not uniformly converge to the NTK across all times on the training samples as the network width increases. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on both synthetic data and the MNIST classification task. This finding implies that NTK theory is not applicable in this context, with significant theoretical implications for understanding neural networks in classification problems.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Instrumental Variable Inference with Many Weak Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study inference on linear functionals in the nonparametric instrumental variable (NPIV) problem with a discretely-valued instrument under a many-weak-instruments asymptotic regime, where the number of instrument values grows with the sample size. A key motivating example is estimating long-term causal effects in a new experiment with only short-term outcomes, using past experiments to instrument for the effect of short- on long-term outcomes. Here, the assignment to a past experiment serves as the instrument: we have many past experiments but only a limited number of units in each. Since the structural function is nonparametric but constrained by only finitely many moment restrictions, point identification typically fails. To address this, we consider linear functionals of the minimum-norm solution to the moment restrictions, which is always well-defined. As the number of instrument levels grows, these functionals define an approximating sequence to a target functional, replacing point identification with a weaker asymptotic notion suited to discrete instruments. Extending the Jackknife Instrumental Variable Estimator (JIVE) beyond the classical parametric setting, we propose npJIVE, a nonparametric estimator for solutions to linear inverse problems with many weak instruments. We construct automatic debiased machine learning estimators for linear functionals of both the structural function and its minimum-norm projection, and establish their efficiency in the many-weak-instruments regime. To do so, we develop a general semiparametric efficiency theory for regular estimators under weak identification and many-weak-instrument asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Improved Regret Bounds for Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound in Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Bayesian optimization problem (also referred to as the Bayesian setting of the Gaussian process bandit), where the learner seeks to minimize the regret under a function drawn from a known Gaussian process (GP). Under a Mat\'ern kernel with a certain degree of smoothness, we show that the Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret with high probability. Furthermore, our analysis yields $O(\sqrt{T \ln^2 T})$ regret under a squared exponential kernel. These results fill the gap between the existing regret upper bound for GP-UCB and the best-known bound provided by Scarlett (2018). The key idea in our proof is to capture the concentration behavior of the input sequence realized by GP-UCB, enabling a more refined analysis of the GP's information gain.</description>

      <title>Exploration Behavior of Untrained Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior in early training.</description>

      <title>Predicting Graph Structure via Adapted Flux Balance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps, which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>
