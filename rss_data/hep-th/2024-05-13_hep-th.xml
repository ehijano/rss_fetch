      <title>Inflating in perturbative LVS: Global Embedding and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perturbative LARGE volume scenario (LVS) is a promising moduli stabilisation scheme in which the overall volume modulus of the compactifying Calabi-Yau (CY) threefold is dynamically stabilised to exponentially large values via using only perturbative corrections. In this article, using an orientifold of a K3-fibred CY threefold, we present the global embedding of an inflationary model proposed in the framework of perturbative LVS, in which the overall volume modulus acts as the inflaton field rolling on a nearly flat potential induced by a combination of the ${\alpha^\prime}^3$-corrections and the so-called {\it log-loop} effects. Given that having a concrete global construction facilitates explicit expressions for a set of sub-leading corrections, as a next step, we present a detailed analysis investigating the robustness of the single-field inflationary model against such corrections, in particular those arising from the winding-type string loop corrections and the higher derivative F$^4$-corrections.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy, Phase Transition, and Island Rule for Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the examination of the island rule within the context of four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS (4D RN-AdS) black hole, illuminating the intricate relationship between the entanglement entropy and phase transitions of black holes. The entanglement entropy of 4D RN-AdS black holes follow the anticipated linear growth pattern before ultimately declining to a constant value, in accordance with the well-established Page curve. The novelty of this study lies in the examination of the influence, previously unexplored, of the first-order phase transition on the shape and evolution of the Page curve in situations involving both eternal and evaporating black holes. Despite the morphological alterations of the curve induced by the transition, the inherent unitarity of the system persists. As the evaporation progresses, the Page curve displays diverse configurations, unveiling phenomena that are novel and defy traditional expectations, thereby enriching our comprehension of the thermodynamics of black holes interlinked with quantum information.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Bell Tests with Decoherence Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inflationary universe creates particle pairs, which are entangled in their momenta due to momentum conservation. Operators involving the momenta of the fluctuations can be rewritten into pseudo-spin operators, such as the Gour-Khanna-Mann-Revzen (GKMR) pseudo-spin. Making use of these pseudo-spin operators, cosmological Bell inequalities can be formulated. The violation of these Bell inequalities indicates the quantum nature of primordial fluctuations.
  In this work, we focus on primordial curvature perturbations. Since curvature perturbations arise from gravity, their action includes the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We clarify the role of the boundary term in selecting suitable initial conditions for linear perturbations.
  After that, we proceed to the interactions of cosmological perturbations, including the bulk and boundary interaction terms, which introduce decoherence effects. These decoherence effects change the expectation value of the Bell operator, and gradually restore the Bell inequality. We describe this process by a ``Bell test curve'', which offers a window for testing the quantum origin of cosmological perturbations. We also explore the possibility of extracting the information of the decoherence rate and the structure of primordial interactions from the Bell test curve.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an integrable sigma model with a generalized $\mathcal{F}$ structure, which involves a generalized Nijenhuis structure $\mathcal{J}$ satisfying $\mathcal{J}^{3}=-\mathcal{J}$. Utilizing the expression of the generalized complex structure on the metric Lie group manifold $G$ in terms of operator relations on its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we formulate a Yang-Baxter sigma model with a generalized complex structure. Additionally, we present multi-Yang-Baxter sigma models featuring two and three compatible Nijenhuis structures. Examples for each of these models are provided.</description>

      <title>All-multiplicity amplitudes in impulsive PP-waves from the worldline formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the worldline formalism to derive Bern-Kosower type Master Formulae for the tree-level scattering of a charged particle and an arbitrary number of photons on impulsive PP-waves, where the coupling of the PP-wave to matter is treated fully non-perturbatively. We show that, in a certain kinematic regime characterised by a semi-classical positive energy condition, both off-shell currents and scattering amplitudes exhibit two novel factorisation structures. First, they may be written as currents in vacuum but with a single additional photon, averaged over the momentum of that photon. This converts the all-orders interaction with the PP-wave into a single effective interaction. Second, the currents and amplitudes may be written as a weighted average of the corresponding quantities in an impulsive plane wave background, with the average taken over all possible field strengths of the plane wave. This generalises a known single-photon result to arbitrary multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical topology with multiple defect curves for dyonic AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dyonic black holes with quasitopological electromagnetism exhibit an intriguing phase diagram with two separated first-order coexistence curves. In this paper, we aim to uncover its influence on the black hole thermodynamical topology. At first, we investigate the phase transition and phase diagram of the dyonic black holes. Comparing with previous study that there is no black hole phase transition region for a middle pressure, we find this region can narrow or disappear by fine tuning the coupling parameter. Instead, two first-order phase transitions can be observed. Importantly, we uncover that such novel phase diagram shall lead to a multiple defect curve phenomenon in black hole topology where each dyonic black hole is treated as one defect in the thermodynamical parameter space. By examining the topology, it is shown that there could be one, three, or five black hole states for given pressure and temperature. For each case, the topological number is calculated. Our results show that the topological number always takes value of +1, keeping unchanged even when the multiple defect curves appear. Therefore, our study provides an important ingredient on understanding the black hole thermodynamical topology.</description>

      <title>A study of layered holographic superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated a holographic model of a multi-layered superconductor in (2+1)-dimensions using the AdS/CFT correspondence. This correspondence allows us to study strongly interacting condensed matter systems through a weakly interacting gravitational theory. Our study focused on the effects of a finite system size on the superconductor's properties. We observed significant variations in the critical temperature and critical magnetic field depending on the number of layers and the spacing between them. Notably, our results capture the transition from a two-dimensional (2D) to a three-dimensional (3D) behavior in the limit of a large number of closely spaced layers. This transition signifies a change in how the superconductivity operates within real material.</description>

      <title>Violation of Weak Cosmic Censorship in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent discovery of a violation of strong cosmic censorship (SCC) for the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in de Sitter space (RN-dS), we investigate if the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) can also be violated in RN-dS with a fixed cosmological constant. Our method is based on the recent formulation of examining WCCC by requiring the second law to hold, which requires the sum of areas of the event and cosmic horizons cannot decrease during the infall process of Wald's gedanken experiment. We find that the WCCC can be violated for the near-extremal RN-dS in some regimes of second-order perturbation of field configurations. Given the charge parameter of RN-dS, we can find the lowest value of the sub-extremality parameter, beyond which the WCCC holds. Our results imply that violations of SCC and WCCC could be correlated. Because of a lack of an unambiguous relation between the gravitational mass and matter's kinematic mass in asymptotically de Sitter space, we cannot compare the corresponding regimes of parameter space for the violations of SCC and WCCC. We also discuss the subtlety in formulating both the first-law and second-law approaches to examine WCCC.</description>

      <title>The Edge of Random Tensor Eigenvalues with Deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The largest eigenvalue of random tensors is an important feature of systems involving disorder, equivalent to the ground state energy of glassy systems or to the injective norm of quantum states. For symmetric Gaussian random tensors of order $3$ and of size $N$, in the presence of a Gaussian noise, continuing the work [arXiv:2310.14589], we compare the edge of the genuine eigenvalue distribution with that of the signed distribution, using field theoretic methods at large $N$ combined with earlier rigorous results of [arXiv:1003.1129]. We support our claims with Monte Carlo simulations. We find two critical points as the variance of the noise increases, the first of which corresponding to the emergence of an outlier from the main part of the spectrum and the second where this outlier merges with the corresponding trivial eigenvalue and they both become complex.</description>

      <title>Infrared gluon propagator in the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger scenario at one-loop order in the Landau gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Refined Gribov-Zwanziger (RGZ) action in the Landau gauge provides a local and renormalizable framework to account for the existence of infinitesimal Gribov copies in the path integral together with other relevant infrared effects such as the formation of condensates. The properties of the tree-level gluon propagator obtained in this setup has been thoroughly investigated over the past decade. It accommodates important properties seen in lattice simulations such as a finite value at vanishing momentum and positivity violation. Yet a comprehensive study about the stability of such properties against quantum corrections was lacking. In this work, we compute the gluon propagator in the RGZ scenario at one-loop order and implement an appropriate renormalization scheme in order to compare our findings with lattice data. Remarkably, the qualitative properties of the tree-level gluon propagator are preserved. In particular, the fits with lattice data show evidence for positivity violation and the existence of complex poles for SU(2) and SU(3) gauge groups. We comment on the results for the ghost propagator as well.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution and Thermal Renormalization Group Flow in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-evolution of the Universe as described by the Friedmann equation can be coupled to equations of motion of matter fields. Quantum effects may be incorporated to improve these classical equations of motion by the renormalization group (RG) running of their couplings. Since temporal and thermal evolutions are linked to each other, astrophysical and cosmological treatements based on zero-temperature RG methods require the extension to finite-temperatures. We propose and explore a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale as $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ (in natural units), where $k_T$ is acting as a running cutoff for thermal fluctuations and the momentum $k$ can be used for the quantum fluctuations. In this approach, the temperature of the expanding Universe is related to the dimensionless quantity $\tau$ (and not to $k_T$). We show that by this choice dimensionless RG flow equations have no explicit $k$-dependence, as it is convenient. We also discuss how this modified thermal RG is used to handle high-energy divergences of the RG running of the cosmological constant and to "solve the triviality" of the $\phi^4$ model by a thermal phase transition in terms of $\tau$ in $d=4$ Euclidean dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a five-dimensional twice anisotropic holographic model for heavy quarks supported by Einstein-dilaton-three-Maxwell action. A special feature of the model is the presence of $z^5$-term in the metric strain coefficient (warp factor). It's influence on the model properties, mainly on the confinement/deconfinement phase transition, is considered. Conditions for the direct magnetic catalysis are found and the corresponding phase diagrams are discussed.</description>

      <title>Massive gravity generalization of $T\overline{T}$ deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the two-dimensional massive gravity description of $T\overline{T}$ deformations, we propose a direct generalization in $d$ dimensions. Our methodology indicates that all terms up to order $d$ are present in the deformation. In two dimensions, $T\overline{T}$ is enhanced by a linear and a constant term, and exhibits an interesting behaviour regarding the deformed spectrum and correlators. At certain limits, this deformation can reduce to $T\overline{T}$ or $T\overline{T}+\Lambda_{2}$ consistently. Using the massive gravity method, we obtain the classically deformed action of a sigma model of bosons and fermions interacting with an arbitrary potential, extending previous results. As a consequence, a proposal regarding the deformation of higher-derivative theories is made. Moreover, a standard dimensional reduction procedure is presented, with the resulting operator matching the form of prior findings under certain assumptions. In $d\geq2$, we provide the exact structure of the quadratic terms in agreement with previous approaches, as well as the structure of the linear and constant terms. All higher order contributions are not easily evaluated, yet we derive the complete answer for all cases up to seven dimensions. Under certain conditions, these terms vanish, resulting in a quadratic operator. The trace-flow equation for this family of deformations is also derived. Finally, we investigate the class of root-$T\overline{T}$ operators in various dimensions within the scope of this formalism.</description>

      <title>Celestial amplitudes from conformal correlators with bulk-point kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two- and three-point celestial (C)CFT$_{d-1}$ amplitudes can be directly obtained from correlation functions in a unitary Lorentzian CFT$_d$ on $\mathbb{R}\times S^{d-1}$. The recipe involves a rescaling of the operators, followed by an expansion around a bulk point configuration and a transformation to an $S^{d-1}$ conformal primary basis. The first two steps project the CFT$_d$ correlators onto distributions on $S^{d-1}$. The final step implements a dimensional reduction yielding CCFT$_{d-1}$ amplitudes that are manifestly vanishing for all in/out configurations and Poincar\'e invariant. The dimensional reduction may be implemented either by evaluating certain time integral transforms around the bulk-point limit, or by analytically continuing the CFT$_d$ operator dimensions and restricting the operators to $S^{d-1}$ time slices separated by $\pi$ in global time. The latter prescription generates the correct normalization for both two- and three-point functions. On the other hand, the celestial three-point amplitudes obtained via the former prescription are found to only agree after evaluating a residue at an integer linear combination of the CFT$_d$ conformal dimensions. The correct normalization may also be obtained by considering a different integration path in the uplift of the complexified time plane to its universal cover.</description>

      <title>A note on hidden classes in spinor classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lounesto classification is a well-established scheme for categorizing spinors based on their physical content, which are determined by their associated bilinear forms. It consists of six disjoint classes encompassing the known spinors within the context of the standard model of high-energy physics. However, advancements in theories beyond the standard model have opened the door to potential new spinorial adjoint structures, leading to new unforeseen classess. These developments indicate the potential for extending the standard Lounesto classification. In this paper, we explore all possible subclasses that could extend the Lounesto scheme. We highlight the most relevant subclasses by imposing constraints to their corresponding dual structures, thus broadening our understanding of spinor and its applications in theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves as Probe of Dark Matter in Interferometer Missions: Fisher Forecast and MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose novel inflationary primordial gravitational wave (GW) spectral shapes at interferometer-based current and future GW missions to test dark matter (DM) production and baryogenesis via gravity-portal. We consider three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the lightest among them is DM candidate while the others participate in baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We find that future GW detectors BBO, DECIGO, ET, for instance, are able to probe DM mass for $5\times 10^6\, {\rm GeV}&lt;M_{\rm DM}&lt;1.6\times 10^7$ GeV with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;10$, along with the observed amount of baryon asymmetry due to gravitational leptogenesis for heavy RHN mass $M_{\cal{N}}$ to be around $8\times 10^{12}$ GeV. Employing Fisher matrix forecast analysis, we identify the parameter space involving non-minimal coupling to gravity $\xi$, reheating temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm rh}$ and DM mass $M_{\rm DM}$ where the GW detector-sensitivities will be the maximum with the least error, along with SNR $&gt;10$. Finally, utilizing mock data for each GW detector, we perform MCMC analysis to find out the combined constraints on the various microphysics parameters. We also explore production of other cosmological relics such as QCD axion relic as DM candidate, produced via gravity-portal in early universe. We find that ET, for instance, can probe the decay constant of such DM candidates ($f_a$) as $10^9\,{\rm GeV}\lesssim f_a\lesssim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$ for misalignment angle $\theta_i\in[0.1,\pi/\sqrt{3}]$ and $\xi=1$ with SNR $&gt;10$, whereas this range decreases with the increase of non-minimal coupling. Thus the upcoming GW missions will be able to test such non-thermal DM and baryogenesis scenarios involving very high energy scales, which is otherwise impossible to reach in particle physics experiments in laboratories.</description>

      <title>Regularized-Renormalized-Resummed loop corrected power spectrum of non-singular bounce with Primordial Black Hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $\Delta N_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.</description>

      <title>Energy momentum tensor on and off the light cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational form factors $A_i$, $D_i$ and $\bar c_i$ of a scalar theory using both the light-cone and covariant perturbation theory at the one-loop level. The light-cone formalism provides a potential approach to access these form factors beyond the perturbative regime. However, unlike the covariant formulation, the Poincar\'e symmetry on the light cone is not manifest. In this work, we use perturbation theory as a benchmark to extract the gravitational form factors from the light-front energy-momentum tensor. By comparing results on and off the light cone, we identify $T^{++}, T^{+a}, T^{+-}, T^{12}$ as the "good currents" that are properly renormalized and can be used to extract the gravitational form factors.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Mimetic Curvaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mimetic gravity theory is one of the interesting modified gravity theories, which aims to unify the matter component of our universe within the power of gravity. The mimetic-like theory can also be responsible for primordial perturbations production, e.g., when the mimetic field is set to be like a curvaton field, and the adiabatic perturbation can thus be generated from the isocurvature perturbation via usual curvaton mechanism [1]. In the original mimetic curvaton model, the parameter $\lambda$ was purely an algebraic multiplier, lack of any perturbed dynamics. In the current paper, we treat $\lambda$ as an auxiliary field, with its perturbation $\delta\lambda$ evolving alongside. We show that, with such a consideration, the adiabatic perturbation can still be generated from the curvaton mechanism, and becomes scale invariant with different field space configurations.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Leptogenesis with sub-GeV Axion Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A derivative coupling of an axion like particle (ALP) with a B-L current may lead to the baryon asymmetry of the universe via spontaneous leptogenesis provided a lepton number breaking interaction prevails in thermal equilibrium. Conventionally, such scenario works only for heavy ALPs and high reheating temperature due to the fact that the same lepton number breaking contribution is tied up with neutrino mass generation also. In this work, we propose inert Higgs doublet assisted lepton number violating operator to relieve such tension so as to generate lepton asymmetry (of freeze-in/out type) with a much lower reheating temperature that can accommodate light (sub-GeV) ALPs sensitive to current and future ALP searches.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension tomography: BAO vs SnIa distance tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble tension by comparing the luminosity distances obtained using an up-to-date BAO dataset (including the latest DESI data) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon+ SnIa distances calibrated with Cepheids. Using a redshift tomography method, we find: 1) The BAO-inferred distances are discrepant with the Pantheon+ SnIa distances across all redshift bins considered, with the discrepancy level varying with redshift. 2) The distance discrepancy is more pronounced at lower redshifts ($z \in [0.1,0.8]$) compared to higher redshifts ($z\in [0.8,2.3]$). The consistency of \lcdm best fit parameters obtained in high and low redshift bins of both BAO and SnIa samples is investigated and we confirm that the tension reduces at high redshifts. Also a mild tension between the redshift bins is identified at higher redshifts for both the BAO and Pantheon+ data with respect to the best fit value of $H_0$ in agreement with previous studies which find hints for an 'evolution' of $H_0$ in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. These results confirm that the low redshift BAO and SnIa distances can only become consistent through a re-evaluation of the distance calibration methods. An $H(z)$ expansion rate deformation alone is insufficient to resolve the tension. Our findings also hint at a possible deviation of the expansion rate from the Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM model at high redshifts $z\gtrsim 2$. We show that such a deformation is well described by a high redshift transition of $H(z)$ like the one expressed by $\Lambda_s$CDM even though this alone cannot fully resolve the Hubble tension due to its tension with intermediate/low $z$ BAO data.</description>

      <title>Color confinement due to spontaneous breaking of magnetic $U(1)_m^8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity is equal to 8 Abelian monopole currents of the Dirac type satisfying Abelian conservation rules kinematically. There exist magnetic $U(1)_m^8$ symmetries in non-Abelian $SU(3)$ QCD. When the magnetic $U(1)_m^8$ symmetries are broken spontaneously, only states which are invariant under all $U(1)_e$ subgroups of $SU(3)$ can exist as a physical state. Such states are $SU(3)$ singlets. The QCD vacuum in the confinement phase is characterized by one long percolating monopole loop running over the whole lattice volume in both quenched and full QCD. The long loop in full QCD is on average a few times longer in comparison with that in quenched QCD case. Surprisingly, the monopole behaviors in full QCD seem independent of the bare quark mass suggesting irrelevance of Abelian monopoles to the chiral symmetry breaking mechanism.
  Existence of such Abelian magnetic monopoles in the continuum limit is studied in detail in $SU(3)$ by means of a block spin transformation of monopoles and the inverse Monte-Carlo method. The monopole density $\rho$ and the infrared effective monopole action $S(k)$ of $n$ blocked monopoles are determined for $a(\beta)=(0.04\sim 2)$fm and $n=1\sim 12$ blockings on $48^4$ lattice in quenched QCD and for $a(\beta)=0.0846(7)$fm and $n=1\sim 24$ on $96^4$ in full QCD at $m_\pi=146$MeV. Originally $\rho$ and $S(k)$ are a two-point function of $a(\beta)$ and the number of times of the blocking transformation $n$. However, both are found to be a function of $b=na(\beta)$ alone in the quenched QCD which suggests the existence of the continuum limit. In the full QCD, the renormalization flow is observed similarly but the scaling is not yet proved. The distributions of the long loops show that monopole condensation occurs due to the entropy dominance over the energy for all $b$ considered.</description>

Abstract: We recently introduced a particular nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics which has the property that it is exactly solvable in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of the usual linear quantum mechanics problem. In this paper we suggest that the two components of the wave function represent the system described by the Hamiltonian H in two different asymptotic regions of spacetime and we show that the non-linear terms can be viewed as giving rise to gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Extended Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we attempt to explore the dark sector of the universe i.e. dark matter and dark energy, where the dark energy components are related to the modified $f(Q)$ Lagrangian, particularly a power law function $f(Q)= \gamma \left(\frac{Q}{Q_0}\right)^n$, while the dark matter component is described by the Extended Bose-Einstein Condensate (EBEC) equation of state for dark matter, specifically, $p = \alpha \rho + \beta \rho^2$. We find the corresponding Friedmann-like equations and the continuity equation for both dark components along with an interacting term, specifically $\mathcal{Q} = 3b^2H \rho$, which signifies the energy exchange between the dark sector of the universe. Further, we derive the analytical expression of the Hubble function, and then we find the best-fit values of free parameters utilizing the Bayesian analysis to estimate the posterior probability and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique corresponding to CC+Pantheon+SH0ES samples. In addition, to examine the robustness of our MCMC analysis, we perform a statistical assessment using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Further from the evolutionary profile of the deceleration parameter and the energy density, we obtain a transition from the decelerated epoch to the accelerated expansion phase, with the present deceleration parameter value as $q(z=0)=q_0=-0.56^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ ($68 \%$ confidence limit), that is quite consistent with cosmological observations. In addition, we find the expected positive behavior of the effective energy density. Finally, by examining the sound speed parameter, we find that the assumed theoretical $f(Q)$ model is thermodynamically stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum many-body dynamics spread initially localized quantum information across the entire system. Information scrambling refers to such a process, whose simulation is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We demonstrate the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the interferometric protocol for calculating out-of-time-ordered correlators to study the scrambling property of a one-dimensional kicked-Ising model on 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum processors. The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states.</description>

Abstract: Employing the modified Villain lattice formulation of the axion QED, we present an alternative and much simpler derivation of the conclusion of~Ref.~\cite{Honda:2024sdz} that the sweep of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry operator over the (non-genuine) gauge invariant 't~Hooft line operator with an integer magnetic charge does not leave any effect. The point is that such a 't~Hooft line can be represented by a boundary of a (non-topological) defect that is invariant under the axial transformation on the axion field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect contains great amount of theoretical importance in various branches of physics. Requirement of very high acceleration hinders its experimental evidence. We propose a novel model to capture this effect experimentally through measuring the Pancharatnam-Berry phase (PBP) of the accelerated quantum system. We find that allowing the qubit's motion along one of the parallel directions of two parallel mirrors and by keeping it in between them, PBP can be greatly enhanced. Our investigation shows that for the current measurable PBP ($\sim 10^{-6}$ rad), energy gap $\sim1$ GHz of the qubit, distance between two mirrors $L\sim150$ (or $300)\,m$ and detector's position $z_0 \sim3.3\,m$ the required acceleration of the qubit can be as low as $a\sim 10^9~ m/s^2$. This value is potentially very achievable within the current technology and thereby providing a very close to realistic model for experimentally verify the aforesaid quantum phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that gravitational waves (GWs) undergo no absorption or dissipation when traversing through a perfect fluid. However, in the presence of a viscous fluid, GWs transfer energy to the fluid medium. In this essay, we present a review of our recent series of results regarding the interaction between gravitational waves and surrounding matter. Additionally, we examine the impact of a viscous fluid shell on gravitational wave propagation, focusing particularly on GW damping and GW heating. Furthermore, we explore the significance of these effects in various astrophysical scenarios such as core-collapse Supernovae and primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The massless fields in the universal NS-NS sector of string theory form $O(D, D)$ multiplets of Double Field Theory, which is a theory that provides a T-duality covariant formulation of supergravity, leading to a stringy modification of General Relativity. In this framework, it is possible to write down the extensions of the Einstein field equations and the Friedmann equations in such a way that the coupling of gravitational and matter sectors is dictated by the $O(D, D)$ symmetry universally. In this paper, we obtain the autonomous form of the $O(D, D)$-complete Friedmann equations, find the critical points and perform their stability analysis. We also include the phase portraits of the system. Cosmologically interesting cases of scalar field, radiation, and matter are separately considered and compared with the Chameleon models in a similar setting. Accelerating phases and the conditions for their existence are also given for such cases.</description>

Abstract: We extend the protocol of Gao and Jafferis arXiv:1911.07416 to allow wormhole teleportation between two entangled copies of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model communicating only through a classical channel. We demonstrate in finite $N$ simulations that the protocol exhibits the characteristic holographic features of wormhole teleportation discussed and summarized in Jafferis et al. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05424-3 . We review and exhibit in detail how these holographic features relate to size winding which, as first shown by Brown et al. arXiv:1911.06314 and Nezami et al. arXiv:2102.01064, encodes a dual description of wormhole teleportation.</description>

Abstract: We construct proper moduli algebraic spaces of K-polystable $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano cones (a.k.a. Calabi-Yau cones) or equivalently their links i.e., Sasaki-Einstein manifolds with singularities.
  As a byproduct, it gives alternative algebraic construction of proper K-moduli of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties. In contrast to the previous algebraic proof of its properness ([BHLLX, LXZ]), we do not use the $\delta$-invariants ([FO, BJ]) nor the $L^2$-normalized Donaldson-Futaki invariants. We use the local normalized volume of [Li] and the higher $\Theta$-stable reduction instead.</description>

      <title>Holography and Localization of Information in Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the AdS/CFT correspondence, we identify a class of CFT operators which represent diff-invariant and approximately local observables in the gravitational dual. Provided that the bulk state breaks all asymptotic symmetries, we show that these operators commute to all orders in $1/N$ with asymptotic charges, thus resolving an apparent tension between locality in perturbative quantum gravity and the gravitational Gauss law. The interpretation of these observables is that they are not gravitationally dressed with respect to the boundary, but instead to features of the state. We also provide evidence that there are bulk observables whose commutator vanishes to all orders in $1/N$ with the entire algebra of single-trace operators defined in a space-like separated time-band. This implies that in a large $N$ holographic CFT, the algebra generated by single-trace operators in a short-enough time-band has a non-trivial commutant when acting on states which break the symmetries. It also implies that information deep in the interior of the bulk is invisible to single-trace correlators in the time-band and hence that it is possible to localize information in perturbative quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: A Boussinesq system for a non-linear shallow water is considered. The nonlinear and topological effects are examined through an associated matrix spectral problem. It is shown an equivalence relationship between the bound states and topological soliton charge densities which resembles a formula of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer-type index theorem. The zero mode components describe a topologically protected Kelvin wave of KdV-type and a novel Boussinesq-type field. We show that either the $1+1$ dimensional pKdV kink or the Kelvin mode can be mapped to the bulk velocity potential in $2+1$ dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We extend the formula for correlation functions of scalar field theories in terms of quantum $A_{\infty}$ algebras presented in arXiv:2203.05366 to incorporate Dirac fields. We use a description that is analogous to string field theory, and the formula for correlation functions takes the same form for both scalar fields and Dirac fields. We prove that correlation functions from our formula satisfy the Schwinger-Dyson equations in the free theory. The proof for interacting theories is presented in the companion paper arXiv:2305.13103 by one of the authors.</description>

Abstract: We extend the formula for correlation functions of free scalar field theories and Dirac field theories in terms of quantum $A_{\infty}$ algebras presented in arXiv:2305.11634 to general scalar-Dirac systems. We obtain the result that the same formula as in the previous paper holds in this case. We show that correlation functions from our formula satisfy the Schwinger-Dyson equations. We therefore confirm that correlation functions from our formula express correlation functions from the ordinary approach of quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Topology of Born-Infeld-AdS Black Hole Phase Transitions: Bulk and CFT Sides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamic criticality of the AdS black holes serves as an important structure during the thermal phase transition. This paper discusses about the critical points and their topology during thermal phase transitions of the Born-Infeld AdS black holes. We make such investigations using two different topological approaches, namely, using Duan's topological current $\phi$-mapping theory, and the off-shell free energy. Within Duan's formalism, we observe that for a given value of the Born-Infeld parameter $b$, there exists an associated electric charge parameter $Q$, which is highly sensitive to the topological phase transitions. This way we examine the connections of the first-order phase transition and the topological nature of the critical points. We find that the topological nature has a possible breakdown in certain parametric ranges. In effect, we determine the unconventional and the conventional phase critical points as the creation (topologically vortex) and annihilation (topologically anti-vortex) points (pairs). As the second approach, we call the off-shell free energy to determine the topological classes: of which one corresponds to the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole phases, while the other provides a possible topological phase transition. Here we also reveal a novel phase transition between two unstable phases, namely, the unstable small black hole and the intermediate black holes. For a certain parametric values of the Born-Infeld parameter and the pressure, we also study the different topological descriptions that inevitably correspond to the AdS-Reissner-Nordstr$\Ddot{o}$m black hole phases. As a consistency check of the critical points during the topological phase transitions, we study the vortex/anti-vortex annihilation thermodynamics from local as well as global thermodynamic viewpoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a model for quantum gravity based on the local Lorentz symmetry and general coordinate invariance. A key idea is the irreversible vierbein postulate that a tree-level action for the model at a certain energy scale does not contain an inverse vierbein. Under this postulate, only the spinor becomes a dynamical field, and no gravitational background field is introduced in the tree-level action. In this paper, after explaining the transformation rules of the local Lorentz and general-coordinate transformations in detail, a tree-level action is defined. We show that fermionic fluctuations can induce a nonvanishing gravitational background field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar field theories with quartic interactions are of central interest in the study of second-order phase transitions. For three-dimensional theories, numerous studies make use of the fixed-dimensional perturbative computation of [B. Nickel, D. Meiron, and G. Baker Jr, Compilation of 2-pt and 4-pt graphs for continuous spin model, University of Guelph report (1977)], unfortunately left unpublished. We independently verify the results of Nickel et al., and we extend the computation to the eighth order in the coupling constant. The results of our calculations, together with the tools developed, are made available in Phi4tools, a user-friendly package that allows displaying the information about the individual Feynman diagrams, including the numerical values for the diagrams for zero, two, and four-point functions. We also provide the perturbative series up to order eight for the renormalization-group functions for the $O(N)$ and cubic anisotropic models.</description>

      <title>Setting the connection free in the Galilei and Carroll expansions of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a Palatini-type formulation for the Galilei and Carroll expansions of general relativity, where the connection is promoted to a variable. Known versions of these large and small speed of light expansions are derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action and involve dynamical Newton-Cartan or Carroll geometry, along with additional gauge fields at subleading orders. The corresponding Palatini actions that we obtain in this paper are derived from an appropriate expansion of the Einstein-Palatini action, and the connection variable reduces to the Galilei- or Carroll-adapted connection on shell. In particular, we present the Palatini form for the next-to-leading order Galilean action and recover the known equations of motion. We also compute the leading-order Palatini-type action for the Carrollian case and show that, while it depends on the connection variable, it reduces on shell to the known action of electric Carroll gravity, which only depends on extrinsic curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The six-derivative conformal scalar operator was originally found by Hamada in its critical dimension of spacetime, $d=6$. We generalize this construction to arbitrary dimensions $d$ by adding new terms cubic in gravitational curvatures and by changing its coefficients of expansion in various curvature terms. The consequences of global scale-invariance and of infinitesimal local conformal transformations are derived for the form of this generalized operator. The system of linear equations for coefficients is solved giving explicitly the conformal Hamada operator in any $d$. Some singularities in construction for dimensions $d=2$ and $d=4$ are noticed. We also prove a general theorem that a scalar conformal operator with $n$ derivatives in $d=n-2$ dimensions is impossible to construct. Finally, we compare our explicit construction with the one that uses conformal covariant derivatives and conformal curvature tensors. We present new results for operators built with different orders of conformal covariant derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between Unruh-De Witt spin $1/2$ detectors and a real scalar field is scrutinized by making use of the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory as applied to the Von Neumann algebra of the Weyl operators. The use of the modular theory enables to evaluate in an exact way the trace over the quantum field degrees of freedom. The resulting density matrix is employed to the study of the Bell-CHSH correlator. It turns out that, as a consequence of the interaction with the quantum field, the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality exhibits a decreasing as compared to the case in which the scalar field is absent.</description>

Abstract: We determine the gravito-magnetic Love numbers of non-rotating black holes in all spacetime dimensions through a novel and direct derivation. The Ishibashi- Kodama master field and its associated field equation are avoided. The matching to the EFT variables is simple. This method allows us to correct the values in the literature. Moreover, we highlight a parity-based selection rule for nonlinear terms that include both electric-type and magnetic-type gravitational field tensors, enabling us to conclude that many of the nonlinear response coefficients in the Schwarzschild black hole effective action vanish.</description>

Abstract: We fill some of existed gaps in the correspondence between Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and the Inverse Scattering Transform by extending the consideration to the case of paired stationary and non-stationary Hamiltonians. We formulate the corresponding to the case Goursat problem and explicitly construct the kernel of the non-local Inverse Scattering Transform, which solves it. As a result, we find the way of constructing non-hermitian Hamiltonians from the initially hermitian ones, that leads, in the case of real-valued spectra of both potentials, to pairing of ${\cal CPT/PT}$-invariant Hamiltonians. The relevance of our proposal to Quantum Optics and optical waveguides technology, as well as to non-linear dynamics and Black Hole Physics is briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the first class constraints that describe the infinite spin irreducible $4D$ Poincar\'{e} group representation in flat space to new first class constraints in $AdS_4$ space. The constraints are realized as operators acting in Fock space spanned by the creation and annihilation operators with two-component spinor indices. As a result, we obtain a new closed gauge algebra on $AdS_4$ with the known flat space limit. Using this gauge algebra, we construct the BRST charge and derive the Lagrangian and gauge transformations for free bosonic infinite spin field theory in $AdS_4$ space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of invertible symmetry, the topological approach based on classifying spaces dominates the classification of 't Hooft anomalies and symmetry protected topological phases. We explore the alternative algebraic approach based on cochains that directly characterize the lattice lagrangian of invertible field theories and the anomalous phase factor of topological operator rearrangements. In the current literature, the algebraic approach has been systematically described for only finite 0-form symmetries. In this initial work, we generalize it to finite higher-form symmetries with trivial higher-group structure. We carefully analyze the algebraic cochains and abstract a purely algebraic structure that naturally generalizes group cohomology. Using techniques from simplicial homotopy theory, we show its isomorphism to the cohomology of classifying spaces. The proof is based on an explicit construction of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces and their products.</description>

      <title>A positive metric over DGKT vacua</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the notion of a metric over the space of AdS solution in string theory, leading to an associated distance between them. Such a distance is the idea underlying the AdS distance conjecture. We utilise the previously developed prescription for extracting such a metric: taking an off-shell quadratic variation of the string theory effective action and then evaluating it over the space of on-shell solutions. It was shown that this prescription leads to a well-defined positive metric over M-theory Freund-Rubin vacua. In this work, we use the same prescription to calculate the metric over type IIA DGKT vacua. These are much more involved, they have multiple flux parameters and exhibit scale separation. While it remains an open question whether these vacua exist as fully localised solutions of string theory, they are well-defined within the four-dimensional effective theory, which is all that is required for the calculation. We find that they also have a positive metric over them. Interestingly, this metric turns out to be independent of the many flux parameters in the solution, similarly to what happens for metrics over scalar field spaces. This non-trivial flux cancellation, as well as results from explicit vacua, lead us to propose a Swampland condition: that the metric over the space of vacua in quantum gravity, as defined by the above prescription, is always positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a compactification of 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, with $SU(N)$ gauge group, on a circle with anti-periodic boundary conditions for the fermions. We couple the theory to a constant background gauge field along the circle for an abelian subgroup of the $R$-symmetry which allows to preserve four supersymmetries. The 3D effective theory exhibits gapped and ungapped phases, which we argue are holographically dual, respectively, to a supersymmetric soliton in AdS$_{5}\times S^{5}$, and a particular quotient of AdS$_5\times S^5$. The gapped phase corresponds to an IR 3D $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory at level $N$, while the ungapped phase is naturally identified with the root of a Higgs branch in the 3D theory. We discuss the extension of the twisting procedure to maximally SUSY Yang-Mills theories in different dimensions, obtaining the relevant duals for 2D and 6D, and comment on the odd dimensional cases.</description>

Abstract: By combining swampland conjectures with observational data, it was recently suggested that the cosmological hierarchy problem (i.e. the smallness of the dark energy in Planck units) could be understood as an asymptotic limit in field space, corresponding to a decompactification of one extra (dark) dimension of a size in the micron range. In these Proceedings we examine the fundamental setting of this framework and discuss general aspects of the effective low energy theory inherited from properties of the overarching string theory. We then explore some novel phenomenology encompassing the dark dimension by looking at potential dark matter candidates, decoding neutrino masses, and digging into new cosmological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Random Finite Noncommutative Geometries and Topological Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.09362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a model for quantum gravity on finite noncommutative spaces using the theory of blobbed topological recursion. The model is based on a particular class of random finite real spectral triples ${(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{H}, D , \gamma , J) \,}$, called random matrix geometries of type ${(1,0) \,}$, with a fixed fermion space ${(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{H}, \gamma , J) \,}$, and a distribution of the form ${e^{- \mathcal{S} (D)} {\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d}} D}$ over the moduli space of Dirac operators. The action functional ${\mathcal{S} (D)}$ is considered to be a sum of terms of the form ${\prod_{i=1}^s \mathrm{Tr} \left( {D^{n_i}} \right)}$ for arbitrary ${s \geqslant 1 \,}$. The Schwinger-Dyson equations satisfied by the connected correlators ${W_n}$ of the corresponding multi-trace formal 1-Hermitian matrix model are derived by a differential geometric approach. It is shown that the coefficients ${W_{g,n}}$ of the large $N$ expansion of ${W_n}$'s enumerate discrete surfaces, called stuffed maps, whose building blocks are of particular topologies. The spectral curve ${\left( {\Sigma , \omega_{0,1} , \omega_{0,2}} \right)}$ of the model is investigated in detail. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for the fundamental symmetric bidifferential ${\omega_{0,2}}$ in terms of the formal parameters of the model.</description>

      <title>Reconciling cosmic dipolar tensions with a gigaparsec void</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations indicate a $4.9\sigma$ tension between the CMB and quasar dipoles. This tension challenges the cosmological principle. We propose that if we live in a gigaparsec scale void, the CMB and quasar dipolar tension can be reconciled. This is because we are unlikely to live at the center of the void. And a 19% offset from the center will impact the quasars and CMB differently in their dipolar anisotropies. As we consider a large and thick void, our setup can also ease the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for families of 1d lattice systems in an invertible phase, the cohomology class of the higher Berry curvature can be refined to an integral degree-3 class on the parameter space. Similarly, for families of U(1)-invariant 2d lattice systems in an invertible phase, the higher Thouless pump can be refined to an integral degree-2 class on the parameter space. We show that the 2d Thouless pump can be identified with an excess Berry curvature of a flux insertion.</description>

      <title>Weak-valued correlation functions: Insights and precise readout strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlation function in quantum systems plays a vital role in decoding their properties and gaining insights into physical phenomena. Its interpretation corresponds to the propagation of particle excitations between space-time, similar in spirit to the idea of quantum weak measurement in terms of recording the system information by interaction. By defining weak-valued correlation function, we propose the basic insights and the universal methods for recording them on the apparatus through weak measurement. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we perform numerical experiments of perturbed quantum harmonic oscillators, addressing the intricate interplay between the coupling strength and the number of ensemble copies. Additionally, we extend our protocol to the domain of quantum field theory, where joint weak values encode crucial information about the correlation function. Hopefully, this comprehensive investigation can advance our understanding of the fundamental nature of the correlation function and weak measurement in quantum theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the validity of quantum mechanical operators in the context of quantum gravity, recognizing the potential need for their generalization. A primary objective is to investigate the repercussions of these generalizations on the inherent non-locality within quantum mechanics, as exemplified by Bell's inequality. Additionally, the study scrutinizes the consequences of introducing a non-zero minimal length into the established framework of Bell's inequality. The findings contribute significantly to our theoretical comprehension of the intricate interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity. Moreover, this research explores the impact of quantum gravity on Bell's inequality and its practical applications within quantum technologies, notably in the realms of device-independent protocols, quantum key distribution, and quantum randomness generation.</description>

      <title>Topological transition in a parallel electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we attack the problem of "chiral phase instability" ($\chi$PI) in a quantum chromodynamics (QCD) system under a parallel and constant electromagnetic field. The $\chi$PI refers to that: When $I_2\equiv{\bf E\cdot B}$ is larger than the threshold $I_2^c$, no homogeneous solution can be found for $\sigma$ or $\pi^0$ condensate, and the chiral phase (or angle) $\theta$ becomes unstable. Within the two-flavor chiral perturbation theory, we obtain an effective Lagrangian density for $\theta(x)$ where the chiral anomalous Wess-Zumino-Witten term is found to play a role of "source" to the "potential field" $\theta(x)$. The Euler-Lagrangian equation is applied to derive the equation of motion for $\theta(x)$, and physical solutions are worked out for several shapes of system. In the case $I_2&gt;I_2^c$, it is found that the $\chi$PI actually implies an inhomogeneous QCD phase with $\theta(x)$ spatially dependent. By its very nature, the homogeneous-inhomogeneous phase transition is of pure topological and second order at $I_2^c$. Finally, the work is extended to the three-flavor case, where an inhomogeneous $\eta$ condensation is also found to be developed for $I_2&gt;I_2^c$. Correspondingly, there is a second critical point, $I_2^{c'}=24.3I_2^c$, across which the transition is also of topological and second order by its very nature.</description>

      <title>Tri-unification: a separate $SU(5)$ for each fermion family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss $SU(5)^{3}$ with cyclic symmetry as a possible grand unified theory (GUT). The basic idea of such a tri-unification is that there is a separate $SU(5)$ for each fermion family, with the light Higgs doublet(s) arising from the third family $SU(5)$, providing a basis for charged fermion mass hierarchies. $SU(5)^{3}$ tri-unification reconciles the idea of gauge non-universality with the idea of gauge coupling unification, opening the possibility to build consistent non-universal descriptions of Nature that are valid all the way up to the scale of grand unification. As a concrete example, we propose a grand unified embedding of the tri-hypercharge model $U(1)_Y^3$ based on an $SU(5)^{3}$ framework with cyclic symmetry. We discuss a minimal tri-hypercharge example which can account for all the quark and lepton (including neutrino) masses and mixing parameters. We show that it is possible to unify the many gauge couplings into a single gauge coupling associated with the cyclic $SU(5)^{3}$ gauge group, by assuming minimal multiplet splitting, together with a set of relatively light colour octet scalars. We also study proton decay in this example, and present the predictions for the proton lifetime in the dominant $e^+\pi^0$ channel.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Effects on Fermionic Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenological consequences of breaking discrete global symmetries in quantum gravity (QG). We extend a previous scenario where discrete global symmetries are responsible for scalar dark matter (DM) and domain walls (DWs), to the case of fermionic DM, considered as a feebly interacting massive particle, which achieves the correct DM relic density via the freeze-in mechanism. Due to the mixing between DM and the standard model neutrinos, various indirect DM detection methods can be employed to constrain the QG scale, the scale of freeze-in, and the reheating temperature simultaneously. Since such QG symmetry breaking leads to DW annihilation, this may generate the characteristic gravitational wave background, and hence explain the recent observations of the gravitational wave spectrum by pulsar timing arrays. This work therefore highlights a tantalizing possibility of probing the effective scale of QG from observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system analysis of DBI scalar field cosmology in coincident $f(Q)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11300v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we offer the dynamical system analysis of the DBI (Dirac-Born-Infeld) scalar field in a modified $f(Q)$ gravity context. We have taken a polynomial form of modified gravity and used two different kinds of scalar potential, i.e., polynomial and exponential, and found a closed autonomous dynamical system of equations. We have analyzed the fixed points of such a system and commented on the conditions under which deceleration to late-time acceleration happens in this model. We have noted the similarity of the two models and have also shown that our result is indeed consistent with the previous work done on Einstein's gravity. We have also investigated the phenomenological implications of our models by plotting the EoS ($\omega$), Energy density ($\Omega$), and deceleration parameter ($q$) w.r.t. to e-fold time and comparing with the present value. Finally, we conclude the paper by observing how the dynamical system analysis differs in modified $f(Q)$ gravity, and we also provide some of the future scope of our work.</description>

      <title>Hasse Diagrams for Gapless SPT and SSB Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss (1+1)d gapless phases with non-invertible global symmetries, also referred to as categorical symmetries. This includes gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, known as gapless SPT (or gSPT) phases; and gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped spontaneous symmetry broken (SSB) phases, that we refer to as gapless SSB (or gSSB) phases. We fit these gapless phases, along with gapped SPT and SSB phases, into a phase diagram describing possible deformations connecting them. This phase diagram is partially ordered and defines a so-called Hasse diagram. Based on these deformations, we identify gapless phases exhibiting symmetry protected criticality, that we refer to as intrinsically gapless SPT (igSPT) and intrinsically gapless SSB (igSSB) phases. This includes the first examples of igSPT and igSSB phases with non-invertible symmetries. Central to this analysis is the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where each phase corresponds to a condensable algebra in the Drinfeld center of the symmetry category. On a mathematical note, gSPT phases are classified by functors between fusion categories, generalizing the fact that gapped SPT phases are classified by fiber functors; and gSSB phases are classified by functors from fusion to multi-fusion categories. Finally, our framework can be applied to understand gauging of trivially acting non-invertible symmetries, including possible patterns of decomposition arising due to such gaugings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of QCD equation of state in external magnetic field and nonzero baryon density. Our study is carried out by means of lattice simulation with 2+1 dynamical staggered quarks at the physical masses. The simulation is conducted at imaginary baryon chemical potential what allowed us to overcome the sign problem. We expand the pressure in the baryon imaginary chemical potential and study three leading nonzero coefficients in this expansion. These coefficients were calculated for the following values of magnetic field: $eB=0.3$, $0.6$, $1.2$ GeV$^2$ with the lattice sizes $8\times32^3$, $10\times40^3$, $12\times48^3$. Using these data we take continuum limit for the coefficients. Our results indicate considerable enhancement of the expansion coefficients by the magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We upgrade the results of Borot--Bouchard--Chidambaram--Creutzig to show that the Gaiotto vector in $\mathcal{N} = 2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory admits an analytic continuation with respect to the energy scale (which can therefore be taken to be finite, instead of infinitesimal), and is computed by topological recursion on the (ramified) UV or Gaiotto spectral curve. This has a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in at least two different ways, Hurwitz numbers, quantum curves, and (almost complete) description of the correlators as analytic functions of $\hbar$ (instead of formal series). The same method is used to establish analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the recent work of Chidambaram--Dolega--Osuga.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ first-principles quantum field theoretical methods to investigate the longitudinal and transverse electrical conductivities of a strongly magnetized hot QED plasma at the leading order in coupling. The analysis utilized the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation obtained recently. In the relativistic regime, both conductivities exhibit an approximate scaling behavior given by $\sigma_{\parallel,\perp} = T \tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$, where $\tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$ are functions of the dimensionless ratio $|eB|/T^2$ (here $T$ denotes the temperature and $B$ the magnetic field). We argue that the mechanisms for the transverse and longitudinal conductivities differ significantly, leading to a strong suppression of the former in comparison to the latter. Additionally, we extend our analysis to a magnetized quark-gluon plasma, although the approximation's validity breaks down in QCD at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Anomaly of Subsystem Symmetries in Exotic and Foliated $BF$ Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mixed 't Hooft anomaly of the subsystem symmetries in the exotic $BF$ theory and the foliated $BF$ theory in 2+1 dimensions, both of which are fractonic quantum field theories describing the equivalent physics. In the anomaly inflow mechanism, the 't Hooft anomaly of the subsystem symmetries can be canceled by combining a subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phase in one dimension higher. In this work, we construct the exotic and foliated $BF$ theories with background gauge fields, and the exotic and foliated forms of the SSPT phases using the foliated-exotic duality. In the foliated form, we see that the non-topological defect that describes a fracton can be viewed as a symmetry-like operator. We also newly construct the foliated and exotic SSPT phases with different foliation structures via the foliated-exotic duality. We can show that the SSPT phases with different foliation structures cancel the same anomaly. This may provide a clue to the characterization of the 't Hooft anomaly of subsystem symmetries.</description>

Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin correlators on the $\beta$/$\beta^{\star}$ boundaries in 2D Ising-like models: asymptotics of block Toeplitz determinants and "anomalous contributions'' in the scaling region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantitative properties of correlation functions on the boundaries between two 2D Ising-like models with dual parameters $\beta$ and $\beta^{\star}$. Spin-spin correlators in such constructions without reflection symmetry with respect to transnational-invariant directions are usually represented as $2\times 2$ block Toeplitz determinants which are normally significantly harder than the scalar ($1\times 1$ block) versions. Nevertheless, we show that for the specific $\beta/\beta^{\star}$ boundaries considered in this work, the symbol matrices allow explicit commutative Wiener-Hopf factorizations. As a result, the constants $E(a)$ and $E(\tilde a)$ for the large $n$ asymptotics allow simple explicit representations. However, the Wiener-Hopf factors at different $z$ do not commute. We will show that due to this non-commutativity, ``logarithmic divergences'' in the Wiener-Hopf factors generate ``anomalous contributions'' in the re-scaled correlators.</description>

      <title>Geometric Quantization Without Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the quantization map in geometric quantization of symplectic manifolds via the Poisson sigma model. This gives a polarization-free (path integral) definition of quantization which pieces together most known quantization schemes. We explain how this allows Schur's lemma to address the invariance of polarization problem. We compute this quantization map for the torus and obtain the noncommutative torus and its standard irreducible representation.</description>
