      <title>Design of Engineered Living Materials for Martian Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the next step in extraterrestrial exploration, many engineers and scientists around the country revealed their intense interest to enable multiplanetary human life, including colonizing Mars. This study proposes that architecture on Mars can be realized by a synthetic lichen system, composed of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi, which produce abundant biominerals and biopolymers to bond Martian regolith into consolidated building blocks. These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into a wide range of structures. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria will 1) fix carbon dioxide and dinitrogen from the atmosphere and convert them into oxygen and organic carbon and nitrogen sources to support filamentous fungi; and 2) give rise to high concentrations of carbonate ions because of photosynthetic activities. Filamentous fungi will 1) bind metal ions onto fungal cell walls and serve as nucleation sites to promote biomineral precipitates; and 2) assist the survival and growth of cyanobacteria by providing them water, minerals, additional carbon dioxide, and protection. This report presents the major progress of the project. It has been tested and confirmed that such co-culture systems can be created, and they grow very well solely on Martian regolith simulants, air, light, and an inorganic liquid medium without any additional carbon or nitrogen sources. The cyanobacterial and fungal growth in such co-culture systems is significantly better than their axenic growth due to mutual interactions. The amounts and morphologies of the precipitated crystals vary remarkably depending on the cultivation condition.</description>
