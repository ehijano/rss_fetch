      <title>The Moroccan Public Procurement Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the public procurement market through the lens of game theory by modeling it as a strategic game with discontinuous and non-quasiconcave payoffs. We first show that the game admits no Nash equilibrium in pure strategies. We then analyze the two-player case and derive two explicit mixed-strategy equilibria for the symmetric game and for the weighted $(p,1-p)$ formulation. Finally, we establish the existence of a symmetric Nash equilibrium in the general $N$-player case by applying the diagonal disjoint payoff matching condition, which allows us to extend equilibrium existence to the mixed-strategy setting despite payoff discontinuities.</description>

      <title>Power and Freedom in Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a strategy-proof mechanism, the influence of an agent may be measured as the set of outcomes an agent can bring about by varying her (reported) type. More specifically, we refer to an agent's influence on her own relevant outcomes as her freedom, and to the influence on outcomes relevant for other agents as her power over others. The framework generalises both the notion of opportunity set from the freedom of choice literature, and established power indices for binary voting. It identifies constrained efficient mechanisms as those that maximise agents' freedom. Applying our framework to the analysis of assignment rules, we provide novel characterisations of the top trading cycles rule and bipolar serial dictatorships in terms of their freedom and power properties.</description>

      <title>Motivated Reasoning and Information Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If agents engage in motivated reasoning, how does that affect the aggregation of information in society? We study the effects of motivated reasoning in two canonical settings - the Condorcet jury theorem (CJT), and the sequential social learning model (SLM). We define a notion of motivated reasoning that applies to these and a broader class of other settings, and contrast it to other approaches in the literature. We show for the CJT that information aggregates in the large electorate limit even with motivated reasoning. When signal quality differs across states, increasing motivation improves welfare in the state with the more informative signal and worsens it in the other state. In the SLM, motivated reasoning improves information aggregation up to a point; but if agents place too little weight on truth-seeking, this can lead to worse aggregation relative to the fully Bayesian benchmark.</description>

      <title>On Sybil Proofness in Competitive Combinatorial Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Sybil manipulation in BRACE, a competitive equilibrium mechanism for combinatorial exchanges, by treating identity creation as a finite perturbation of the empirical distribution of reported types. Under standard regularity assumptions on the excess demand map and smoothness of principal utilities, we obtain explicit linear bounds on price and welfare deviations induced by bounded Sybil invasion. Using these bounds, we prove a sharp contrast: strategyproofness in the large holds if and only if each principal's share of identities vanishes, whereas any principal with a persistent positive share can construct deviations yielding strictly positive limiting gains. We further show that the feasibility of BRACE fails in the event of an unbounded population of Sybils and provide a precise cost threshold that ensures disincentivization of such attacks in large markets.</description>

      <title>Applying an axiomatic approach to revenue allocation in airlines problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) states that the revenue from interline tickets must be shared among the different airlines according to a weighted system. We analyze this problem following an axiomatic approach, and our theoretical results support IATA's procedure. Our first result justifies the use of a weighted system, but it does not specify which weights should be applied. Assuming that the weights are fixed, we provide several results that further support the use of IATA's mechanism. Finally, we provide results for the case in which all flights can be considered equivalent and no weighting is required.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Transportation Cost Planning Theory: A Multi-Layered Framework Integrating Stepwise Functions, AI-Driven Dynamic Pricing, and Sustainable Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical landscape of transportation cost planning is shifting from deterministic linear models to dynamic, data-driven optimization. As supply chains face volatility, static 20th-century cost assumptions prove increasingly inadequate. Despite rapid technological advancements, a unified framework linking economic production theory with the operational realities of autonomous, sustainable logistics remains absent. Existing models fail to address non-linear stepwise costs and real-time stochastic variables introduced by market dynamics. This study reconstructs transportation cost planning theory by synthesizing Grand, Middle-Range, and Applied theories. It aims to integrate stepwise cost functions, AI-driven decision-making, and environmental externalities into a cohesive planning model. A systematic theoretical synthesis was conducted using 28 high-impact papers published primarily between 2018 and 2025, employing multi-layered analysis to reconstruct cost drivers. The study identifies three critical shifts: the transition from linear to stepwise fixed costs, the necessity of AI-driven dynamic pricing for revenue optimization, and the role of Autonomous Electric Vehicles (AEVs) in minimizing long-term marginal costs. A "Dynamic-Sustainable Cost Planning Theory" is proposed, arguing that cost efficiency now depends on algorithmic prediction and autonomous fleet utilization rather than simple distance minimization.</description>

      <title>Computing Evolutionarily Stable Strategies in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for computing evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) in symmetric perfect-recall extensive-form games of imperfect information. Our main algorithm is for two-player games, and we describe how it can be extended to multiplayer games. The algorithm is sound and computes all ESSs in nondegenerate games and a subset of them in degenerate games which contain an infinite continuum of symmetric Nash equilibria. The algorithm is anytime and can be stopped early to find one or more ESSs. We experiment on an imperfect-information cancer signaling game as well as random games to demonstrate scalability.</description>

      <title>Paying and Persuading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06007v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study dynamic contracting where Sender privately observes a Markovian state and seeks to motivate Receiver, who acts. Sender provides incentives in two ways: payments, which alter payoffs ex-post, and (Bayesian) persuasion, which shapes Receiver interim beliefs about payoffs. For all stage game payoffs, discount rates, and Markov transition rules, transfers are a last resort-there is an optimal contract where payments occur only after Sender commits to reveal the state at every continuation history. In an example, the optimal contract is a loyalty program: Sender chooses the static optimal information structure until a random promotion time, after which Sender reveals the state and pays Receiver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a prior-free model of data-driven decision making in which the decision maker observes the entire distribution of signals generated by a known experiment under an unknown distribution of the state variable and evaluates actions according to their worst-case payoff over the set of state distributions consistent with that observation. We show how our model applies to partial identification in econometrics and propose a ranking of experiments in which E is robustly more informative than E' if the value of the decision maker's problem after observing E is always at least as high as the value of the decision maker's problem after observing E'. This comparison, which is strictly weaker than Blackwell's classical order, holds if and only if the null space of E is contained in the null space of E'.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a mechanism design framework where a platform designs GenAI models to screen users who obtain instrumental value from the generated conversation and privately differ in their preference for latency. We show that the revenue-optimal mechanism is simple: deploy a single aligned (user-optimal) model and use token cap as the only instrument to screen the user. The design decouples model training from pricing, is readily implemented with token metering, and mitigates misalignment pressures.</description>
