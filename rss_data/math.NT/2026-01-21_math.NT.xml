      <title>On the Narrow 2-Class Field Tower of Some Real Quadratic Number Fields: Lengths Heuristics Follow-Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we continue the investigation of the length of the narrow $2$-class field tower of real quadratic number fields $\mathrm{k}$ whose discriminants are not a sum of two squares and for which their $2$-class groups are elementary of order $4$. Letting $\mathrm{G}$ equal the Galois group of the second Hilbert narrow $2$-class field over $\mathrm{k}$, and $[\mathrm{G}_i]$ denote the lower central series of $\mathrm{G}$, we give heuristic evidence that the length of the narrow $2$-class field tower of $\mathrm{k}$ is equal to $2$ when $\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{G}_3$ is of type $64.150$ (in the tables of Hall and Senior). We also give the formulation of the relevant unit groups of the narrow Hilbert $2$-class field for these fields.</description>

      <title>Distance of Quadratic Algebraic Numbers from the Middle-Third Cantor Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distance from quadratic irrational numbers to the middle-third Cantor set $C$. Mahler asked whether $C$ contains any irrational algebraic numbers; this remains open even for quadratic irrationals. Rather than assuming an answer to this problem, we obtain uniform lower bounds for the distance from a quadratic irrational $\alpha$ to $C$ in terms of the height $H$ of the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$.
  We encode $\alpha$ by its orbit under the map $x \mapsto 3x \bmod 1$ and define the exit time $\operatorname{exit}(\alpha)$ as the first iterate that enters the middle interval $[1/3,2/3]$. Our main unconditional result is a quadratic exit bound $\operatorname{exit}(\alpha) \le A (\log_3 H)^2 + B$ for absolute constants $A,B &gt; 0$, valid for all quadratic irrationals whose orbit stays a fixed small distance away from the coarse Cantor boundaries. As a consequence we obtain a distance lower bound $\operatorname{dist}(\alpha,C) \ge H^{-\kappa \log H}$ for some constant $\kappa &gt; 0$.
  On the dynamical side we classify orbits by an $L/M/R$ coding and prove that the total number of visits to the right interval $[2/3,1)$ is $O(\log H)$. A finite case analysis on a bounded portion of the orbit is reduced to checking a finite list of explicit affine inequalities on subintervals of $[0,1]$, which we verify with short computer scripts; all Diophantine and dynamical estimates are proved by hand.</description>

      <title>Computations of higher elliptic units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a conjecture on the construction of generalised elliptic units above number fields with exactly one complex place. These elliptic units obtained as values of multiple elliptic Gamma functions. These form a collection of multivariate meromorphic functions which were studied in the late 1990s and early 2000s in mathematical physics. Our construction extends the scheme of a recent article by Bergeron, Charollois and Garc\'ia where they constructed conjectural elliptic units above complex cubic fields using the elliptic Gamma function. The elliptic units we construct are expected to generate specific abelian extensions of the base field where they are evaluated, thus giving a conjectural solution to Hilbert's 12th problem for the number fields with exactly one complex place. We provide several examples to support our conjecture in optimal cases for cubic, quartic and quintic fields.</description>

      <title>A $p$-adic cohomological approach to congruences of meromorphic modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study congruences relating Fourier coefficients of meromorphic modular forms and Frobenius eigenvalues of elliptic curves corresponding to their poles. We develop a $p$-adic cohomological framework that interprets these congruences via the interaction between the rigid cohomology of modular curves and the crystalline structure of the associated elliptic curves. Using comparison theorems and the Gysin sequence, we relate the Frobenius actions in cohomology to the $U_p$-operator acting on spaces of overconvergent modular forms. Our approach applies uniformly to both modular curves and Shimura curves admitting smooth integral models over $\mathbb{Z}_p$.</description>

      <title>Fast Computing Formulas for some Dirichlet L-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\chi_k$ a self$-$dual primitive Dirichlet character mod $k$ several reduced identities of Dirichlet $L-$functions $L_k(s):=L(s,\chi_k)$, expressed as linear combinations of Hurwitz $\zeta$ functions, are found for $s=2,3$ and some selected values of $k$. By using a merged approach between the Wilf$-$Zeilberger method and a Dougall$'$s $_5H_5$ technique, new proven accelerated series of hypergeometric$-$type are derived for specific Hurwitz $\zeta$ function values. These fast series that are computed by means of the binary splitting algorithm, enter into the reduced identities found producing very efficient formulas to compute these selected $L-$functions. The new algorithms include $\zeta(3):=L_1(3)$, (Apery$'$s constant), $G:=L_\text{-4}(2)$ (Catalan$'$s constant) as well as $\text{}L_\text{k}(2)\text{}$ for $k=-7, -8, -15, -20, -24$ together with $L_k(3)$ for $k=5, 8, 12$. Formulas were tested and verified up to 100 million decimal places for each $L-$value.</description>

      <title>Improved Averaged Distribution of $d_3(n)$ in Prime Arithmetic Progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that $d_3(n)$ has exponent of distribution $\theta$ if, for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the expected asymptotic holds uniformly for all moduli $q \le x^{\theta-\varepsilon}$. Nguyen proved that, after averaging over reduced residue classes $a \bmod q$, the function $d_3(n)$ has exponent of distribution $2/3$, following earlier work of Banks et al. Using the Petrow--Young subconvexity bound for Dirichlet $L$-functions, we improve this to an exponent of distribution $8/11$ when averaging over residue classes modulo a prime $q$.</description>

      <title>Torsion points of small order on cyclic covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$. III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d&gt;1$ be an integer and $K_0$ a perfect field such that $char(K_0)$ does not divide $d$. Let $n&gt;d$ be an integer that is prime to $d$. Let $f(x)\in K_0[x]$ be a degree $n$ monic polynomial without repeated roots, and $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ a smooth projective model of the affine curve $y^d=f(x)$. Let $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ be the Jacobian of the $K_0$-curve $\mathcal{C}_{f,d} $. As usual, we identify $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ with its canonical image in $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ (such that the only ``infinite point'' of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$).
  We say that an integer $m&gt;1$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$ if there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ as above such that $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}(K_0)$ contains a torsion point of order $m$.
  Let us put $\ell_0:=[(n+d)/d], \ m_0:=\ell_0 d$. Earlier we proved that if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable, then either $m=d$ or $m = n$ or $m \ge m_0$ (in addition, both $d$ and $n$ are $(n,d)$-reachable over every $K_0$). We also proved that if $m_0$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over some $K_0$ then $n-m_0+\ell_0\ge 0$.
  In the present paper we discuss the $(n,d)$-reachability of $m_0$ when $n-m_0+\ell_0=0$ or $1$.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of sets of numbers whose continued fractions contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continued fractions with prescribed structures on sequences of their partial quotients have been intensively studied in the literature. As far as an integer sequence, especially a randomly generated one is concerned, an attractive question is whether it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. In this paper we study the fractal structure of irrational numbers whose sequences of partial quotients are strictly increasing and contain arbitrarily long, quantified arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Non-Wieferich property of prime ideals and a conjecture of Erd\"os</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}$ and $\alpha\in\mathcal{O}$. For any prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\mathcal{O}$, we obtain its higher $\alpha$-Wieferich property, which implies a nonexistence theorem for higher Wieferich unramified prime ideals. If $\beta\in\mathcal{O}$ is relatively prime to $\alpha$ and all prime ideal factors of $(\beta)$ are unramified and have residue degree $1$, we apply our higher $\alpha$-Wieferich property to establish the asymptotic equidistribution of digits in $\beta$-adic expansions of $\alpha^n$, which is a generalization of the Dupuy-Weirich theorem. When $(\beta)$ have ramified prime ideal factors, we also obtain a result on the block complexity of $\beta$-adic expansions of $\alpha^n$.</description>

      <title>2-Adic Obstructions to Presburger-Definable Characterizations of Collatz Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I investigate structural limitations of Presburger-arithmetic-based approaches to the Collatz problem. I show that the Collatz cycle equation admits a unique solution in the $2$-adic integers, which I term a \emph{ghost cycle}. These ghost cycles are shown to be genuine periodic orbits of the $2$-adic Collatz map, satisfying all local parity constraints.
  I prove unconditionally that the divisibility predicate $\mathcal{D}_y = \{(x, C) \in \mathbb{N}^2: (2^x - 3^y) \mid C\}$, which acts as the algebraic necessary condition for integrality, is not semilinear for any fixed number of odd steps $y \ge 1$. This result is established by demonstrating that the fibers of $\mathcal{D}_y$ exhibit unbounded periods, an obstruction to Presburger definability. Consequently, strategies relying solely on Presburger arithmetic or finite automata to define the integrality constraint cannot capture the distinction between ghost cycles and genuine integer cycles. I conclude with a heuristic argument suggesting that because ghost cycles satisfy the algebraic cycle equation, the non-existence of integer cycles cannot be proven solely through algebraic manipulation of the cycle equation itself.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic degenerate logarithm and heterogeneous stirling numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let Y be a random variable whose moment-generating function exists in some neighborhood of the origin. While probabilistic Stirling numbers of the first and second kind have been introduced, early definitions often failed to satisfy fundamental orthogonality and inverse relations or lacked consistency with classical forms in the case when Y = 1. This paper addresses these limitations by utilizing redefined probabilistic Stirling numbers of the first kind and the second kind alongside their degenerate counterparts. Our primary objective is twofold: first,to introduce the probabilistic (degenerate) logarithm associated with Y, providing explicit
  expressions for various random variables and defining new probabilistic degenerate Daehee and Cauchy numbers; and second, to investigate probabilistic heterogeneous Stirling numbers and establish a probabilistic degenerate version of the Schlomilch formula, demonstrating that these new frameworks maintain the essential algebraic properties of their classical counterparts.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the relationship between Rankin-Cohen brackets for vector-valued modular forms and Petersson's inner products, deriving an explicit description of the adjoint map for the bracket operator. The study extends to the cases of Jacobi forms and skew-holomorphic Jacobi forms, establishing connections between their respective Rankin-Cohen brackets and those defined for vector-valued modular forms through an isomorphism. Adjoint maps for these extended bracket operators are also examined.</description>

      <title>Counting Irreducible polynomials with coefficients from thin subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L. Bary-Soroker and R. Shmueli (2026) have given an asymptotic formula for the number of irreducible polynomials over the finite fields $\mathbb F_q$ of $q$ elements, such that their coefficients are perfect squares in $\mathbb F_q$ and also extended this to classes of polynomials with coefficients described by finitely many unions of intersections of polynomial images. Here we use a different approach, which allows us to obtain another generalisation of this result to polynomials with coefficients from small subgroups of $\mathbb F_q^*$. As a demonstration of the power of our approach, we also use it to count such irreducible polynomials with an additional condition, namely, with a prescribed value of their discriminant. This generalisation seems to be unachievable via the approach of L. Bary-Soroker and R. Shmueli (2026).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several complexity measures such as degree, sparsity and multiplicative index for cryptographic functions including the Diffie-Hellman mapping and the discrete logarithm in a finite field have been studied in the literature. In 2022, Reis and Wang introduced another complexity measure, the additive index, of a self-mapping of a finite field. In this paper, under certain conditions, we determine lower bounds on the additive index of the univariate Diffie-Hellman mapping and a self-mapping of $\mathbb{F}_q$ which can be identified with the discrete logarithm in a finite field.</description>

      <title>Calculating The Local Ideal Class Monoid and Gekeler Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A = \mathbb{F}_q[T]$, $\mathfrak{p} \subset A$ prime, $f(x) \in A[x]$ irreducible and set $R = A[x]/f(x)$. Denote its completion by $R_\mathfrak{p}$. The ideal class monoid $\text{ICM}(R_\mathfrak{p})$ is the set of fractional $R_\mathfrak{p}$ ideals modulo the principal $R_\mathfrak{p}$ ideals. We provide an algorithm to compute $\text{ICM}(R_\mathfrak{p})$. In the process we also get algorithms to compute the overorders and weak equivalence classes of $R_\mathfrak{p}$. We then use the algorithms to compute the product of local Gekeler ratios $\prod_{\mathfrak{p} \subset A} v_\mathfrak{p}(f) = \prod_{\mathfrak{p} \subset A} \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{|\{M \in \text{Mat}_r(A/\mathfrak{p}^n)\mid \text{charpoly}(M)=f\}}{|\text{SL}_r(A/\mathfrak{p}^n)|/|\mathfrak{p}|^{n(r-1)}}$. This provides part of an algorithm to compute the weighted size of an isogeny class of Drinfeld modules.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for $\theta$-expansions and the Failure of the Strong Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents fundamental metrical theorems for a class of continued fraction-like expansions known as $\theta$-expansions. We first prove Khinchine's Weak Law of Large Numbers for the sum of digits, followed by the Diamond-Vaaler Strong Law for the sum of digits minus the largest one. Our main result is a general theorem on the failure of the strong law, showing that no regular norming sequence can yield a finite, non-zero almost sure limit. This result extends a classical theorem of Philipp to the $\theta$-expansion setting. The proofs leverage the system's explicit invariant measure and a detailed analysis of its mixing properties.</description>

      <title>Locally analytic vectors in the completed cohomology of quaternionic Shimura curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the methods introduced by Lue Pan to study the locally analytic vectors of the completed cohomology of Shimura curves associated to an indefinite quaternion algebra $D$ which is ramified at a prime number $p$. Let $D_p^{\times}$ be the group of units of $D$ at $p$. Using $p$-adic uniformization of the quaternionic Shimura curves, we compute the Hecke eigenspace of the completed cohomology with the Hecke eigenvalues associated to a classical automorphic form on another quaternion algebra $\bar D$ (switching invariants of $D$ at $p,\infty$). We present this locally analytic $D_p^\times$-representation using the de Rham complex of the Lubin-Tate tower of dimension $1$. This is analogous to the Breuil-Strauch conjecture for the group $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. We show that the locally analytic $D_p^{\times}$-representation does not detect the Hodge filtration of the local de Rham Galois representation at $p$ in the crystalline case, and also give applications for the locally analytic Jacquet--Langlands correspondence for $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ and $D_p^\times$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric multiple Eisenstein series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the symmetric multiple Eisenstein series, a variant of the multiple Eisenstein series. As a fundamental result, we show that they satisfy the linear shuffle relation. As a case study, we investigate the vector space spanned by symmetric double Eisenstein series of weight $k$. When $k$ is even, it coincides with the space spanned by modular forms of weight $k$ and the derivative of the Eisenstein series of weight $k-2$. For $k$ odd, we prove that its dimension equals $\lfloor k/3\rfloor$. We further provide an explicit correspondence between the linear shuffle relation and the Fay-shuffle relation satisfied by elliptic double zeta values, which may be of independent interest. In connection with modular forms, we prove that every modular form can be expressed as a linear combination of symmetric triple Eisenstein series. This will serve as a first step toward understanding modular phenomena for symmeric multiple zeta values observed by Kaneko and Zagier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a finite field of characteristic $p$. We describe and implement a practical algorithm for computing the $p$-divisible group $Jac(X)[p^\infty]$ via computing its Dieudonn\'{e} module, or equivalently computing the Frobenius and Verschiebung operators on the first crystalline cohomology of $X$. We build on Tuitman's $p$-adic point counting algorithm, which computes the rigid cohomology of $X$ and requires a ``nice'' lift of $X$ to be provided.</description>

Abstract: We consider the equality of the values of the $n$th and $k$th elementary symmetric polynomials of $n$ not necessarily distinct positive integers. For $k &lt; n$, we prove that this equation always has a solution, but only finitely many solutions. Furthermore, we consider the equality of the values of the $n$th and $(n-2)$th elementary symmetric polynomials of $n$ not necessarily distinct positive integers. In particular, we show that the number of solutions of this equation tends to infinity if $n$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence $S=(x_1,\ldots, x_k)$ in $\mathbb Z_p$ is called a $(Q_p,\mathbf 1)$-weighted zero-sum sequence if there exist $a_1,\ldots,a_k\in Q_p$ such that $a_1x_1+\cdots+a_kx_k=0$ and $a_1+\cdots+a_k=0$. The constant $E_{Q_p,\mathbf 1}$ is defined to be the smallest positive integer $k$ such that every sequence of length $k$ in $\mathbb Z_p$ has a $(Q_p,\mathbf 1)$-weighted zero-sum subsequence of length $p$. We determine the constant $E_{Q_p,\mathbf 1}$ and the related constants $C_{Q_p,\mathbf 1}$ and $D_{Q_p,\mathbf 1}$. We also study some $(Q_p,B)$-weighted zero-sum constants where $B$ is a subset of $Q_p$.</description>

Abstract: We study covering graphs of the Paley graph associated to a finite field of characteristic p in the case where the covering transformation group is cyclic of prime order distinct from p. When the field has q = p elements, we show that the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix determine the graph isomorphism class among translation invariant covers. When q = p^r &gt; p, we construct examples of cospectral covering graphs that are not isomorphic as graphs.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the recent Connes-Consani-Moscovici $D_{\log}^{(\lambda, N)}$ operators, whose spectra are currently hypothesized to approach the zeros of $\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2} +is\right)$ as $\lambda, N \rightarrow \infty$. It turns out that when considering different standard notions of error, the dissonance between the spectra and Riemann $\zeta$ zeros either appears to or can be proven to be inverse logarithmic in nature, which elegantly fits the distribution of prime numbers.</description>

Abstract: In complex dynamics, a fundamental result of Fatou and Julia asserts that every attracting cycle of a rational map attracts a critical point. The analogous statement fails in non-Archimedean dynamics. For a non-Archimedean rational map, this paper establishes a sharp condition on the multiplier of an attracting cycle ensuring it attracts a critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ball, Ortega--Moreno, and Prodromou asked whether, for every odd prime $p$, one can find a $1$-factor of the complete graph $K_{p+1}$ with some arithmetic restrictions related to quadratic residues. This problem is motivated by $1$-factorizations that are compatible with the sign pattern of certain Paley-type matrices. Recently, Afifurrahman et al. made some partial progress. In this paper, we completely resolve the problem.</description>

Abstract: For an orthogonal modular variety, we construct a complex which is defined in terms of lattices and elliptic modular forms, which resembles the Gersten complex in Milnor K-theory, and which has a morphism to the Gersten complex of the modular variety by the Borcherds lifting. This provides a formalism for approaching the higher Chow groups of the modular variety by special cycles and Borcherds products. The construction is an incorporation of the theory of Borcherds products and ideas from Milnor K-theory.</description>

      <title>p-adic adelic metrics and Quadratic Chabauty I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.03873v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new construction of $p$-adic heights on varieties over number fields using $p$-adic Arakelov theory. In analogy with Zhang's construction of real-valued heights in terms of adelic metrics, these heights are given in terms of $p$-adic adelic metrics on line bundles. In particular, we describe a construction of canonical $p$-adic heights on abelian varieties and we show that we recover the canonical Mazur--Tate height and, for Jacobians, the height constructed by Coleman and Gross. Our main application is a new and simplified approach to the Quadratic Chabauty method for the computation of rational points on certain curves over the rationals, by pulling back the canonical height on the Jacobian with respect to a carefully chosen line bundle. We show that our construction allows us to reprove, without using $p$-adic Hodge theory or arithmetic fundamental groups, several results due to Balakrishnan and Dogra. Our method also extends to primes $p$ of bad reduction. One consequence of our work is that for any canonical height ($p$-adic or $\mathbb{R}$-valued) on an abelian variety (and hence on pull-backs to other varieties), the local contribution at a finite prime $q$ can be constructed using $q$-analytic methods.</description>

Abstract: An asymptotic formula for the number of prime solutions of a general diagonal system of Diophantine equations is established, contingent on the existence of an appropriate mean value bound and on local solvability. In conjunction with the Vinogradov Mean Value Theorem this yields an asymptotic formula for solutions of Vinogradov systems and in conjunction with Hooley's work on seven cubes this yields a conditional result for the Waring-Goldbach problem on seven cubes of primes, contingent on Hooley's form of the Riemann hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: The solvability of Diophantine quartic equations is a contemporary area of interest due to its connection with \textit{generalized Fermat's equation}. In this work, we are interested in the integer solutions of a similar quartic equation $pu^{2} = v^{2}+w^{2}$. For a particular form of $u,v$, and $w$, we prove that the elliptic curves $E_p: y^2 = x(x-1)(x+p^2)$, for primes $p \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$ where $q = (p^2+1)/2$ is also prime, exhibit a sharp dichotomy based on the solution of the aforementioned Diophantine equation: either $\mathrm{rank}(E_p(\mathbb{Q})) = 2$ with trivial Shafarevich-Tate group or $\mathrm{rank} = 0$ with $\Sha(E_p/\mathbb{Q})[2] \cong (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^2$.</description>

      <title>Non-vanishing of Kolyvagin systems and Iwasawa theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve and $p$ an odd prime. In 1991 Kolyvagin conjectured that the system of cohomology classes for torsion quotients of the $p$-adic Tate module of $E$ derived from Heegner points over ring class fields of a suitable imaginary quadratic field $K$ (i.e., the Heegner point Kolyvagin system of $E/K$) is non-trivial. In this paper we prove Kolyvagin's conjecture when $p$ is a prime of good ordinary reduction for $E$ that splits in $K$. In particular, our results cover many cases where $p$ is an Eisenstein prime for $E$, complementing Wei Zhang's earlier results on the conjecture by a different approach.
  Our methods also yield a proof of a refinement of Kolyvagin's conjecture expressing the divisibility index of the Heegner point Kolyvagin system in terms of the Tamagawa numbers of $E$, as conjectured by Wei Zhang in 2014, as well as proofs of analogous results for the Kolyvagin system obtained from Kato's Euler system.</description>

      <title>Counting rationals and diophantine approximation in missing-digit Cantor sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a new upper bound for the number of rationals up to a given height in a missing-digit set, making progress towards a conjecture of Broderick, Fishman, and Reich. This enables us to make novel progress towards another conjecture of those authors about the corresponding intrinsic diophantine approximation problem. Moreover, we make further progress towards conjectures of Bugeaud--Durand and Levesley--Salp--Velani on the distribution of diophantine exponents in missing-digit sets.
  A key tool in our study is Fourier $\ell^1$ dimension introduced by the last named author in [H. Yu, Rational points near self-similar sets, arXiv:2101.05910]. An important technical contribution of the paper is a method to compute this quantity.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for $t$-Core Partitions and Stanton's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A partition is a $t$-core partition if $t$ is not one of its hook lengths. Let $c_t(N)$ be the number of $t$-core partitions of $N$. In 1999, Stanton conjectured $c_t(N) \le c_{t+1}(N)$ if $4 \le t \ne N-1$. This was proved for $t$ fixed and $N$ sufficiently large by Anderson, and for small values of $t$ by Kim and Rouse. In this paper, we prove Stanton's conjecture in general. Our approach is to find a saddle point asymptotic formula for $c_t(N)$, valid in all ranges of $t$ and $N$. This includes the known asymptotic formulas for $c_t(N)$ as special cases, and shows that the behavior of $c_t(N)$ depends on how $t^2$ compares in size to $N$. For example, our formula implies that if $t^2 = \kappa N + o(t)$, then $c_t(N) = \frac{\exp\left(2\pi\sqrt{A N}\right)}{B N} (1 + o(1))$ for suitable constants $A$ and $B$ defined in terms of $\kappa$.</description>

Abstract: In 2009, Bringmann arXiv:0708.0691 [math.NT] used the circle method to prove an asymptotic formula for the Fourier coefficients of rank generating functions. In this paper, we prove that Bringmann's formula, when summing up to infinity and in the case of prime modulus, gives a Rademacher-type exact formula involving sums of vector-valued Kloosterman sums. As a corollary, in another paper arXiv:2406.07469 [math.NT], we will provide a new proof of Dyson's conjectures by showing that the certain Kloosterman sums vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03803v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an analog for shifted primes of the Kubilius model of prime factors of integers. We prove a total variation distance estimate for the difference between the model and actual prime factors of shifted primes, and apply it to show that the prime factors of shifted primes in disjoint sets behave like independent Poisson variables. As a consequence, we establish a transference principle between the anatomy of random integers up to x and of random shifted primes p+a with p &lt; x.</description>

Abstract: Let $P^-(n)$ denote the smallest prime factor of a natural integer $n&gt;1$. Furthermore let $\mu$ and $\omega$ denote respectively the M\"obius function and the number of distinct prime factors function. We show that, given any set ${{\scr P}}$ of prime numbers with a natural density, we have $\sum_{P^-(n)\in \scr P}\mu(n)\omega(n)/n=0$ and provide a effective estimate for the rate of convergence. This extends a recent result of Alladi and Johnson, who considered the case when ${\scr P}$ is an arithmetic progression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03519v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a real quadratic field in which a fixed prime $p$ is inert, and $E_0$ be an imaginary quadratic field in which $p$ splits; put $E=E_0 F$. Let ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}$ be the special fiber over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ of the Shimura variety for $G(U(1,n-1)\times U(n-1,1))$ with hyperspecial level structure at $p$ for some integer $n\geq 2$. Let ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}(K_{\mathfrak{p}}^{1})$ be the special fiber over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ of a Shimura variety for $G(U(1,n-1)\times U(n-1,1))$ with parahoric level structure at $p$ for some integer $n\geq 2$. We exhibit elements in the higher Chow group of the supersingular locus of ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}$ and study the stratification of ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}.$ Moreover, we study the geometry of ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}(K_{\mathfrak{p}}^{1})$ and prove a form of Ihara lemma. With Ihara lemma, we prove the the arithmetic level raising map is surjective for $n=2,3.$</description>

      <title>Hankel continued fractions and Hankel determinants for $q$-deformed metallic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix $n$ a positive integer. Take the $n$-th metallic number $\phi_n=\frac{n+\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}$ (e.g. $\phi_1$ is the golden number) and let $\Phi_n(q)$ be its $q$-deformation in the sense of S. Morier-Genoud and V. Ovsienko. This is an algebraic continued fraction which admits an expansion into a Taylor series around $q=0$, with integral coefficients. By using the notion of Hankel continued fraction introduced by the first author in 2016 we determine explicitly the first $n+2$ sequences of shifted Hankel determinants of $\Phi_n$ and show that they satisfy the following properties:
  1) They are periodic and consist of $-1,0,1$ only.
  2) They satisfy a three-term Gale-Robinson recurrence, i.e. they form discrete integrable dynamical systems.
  3) They are all completely determined by the first sequence.
  This article thus validates a conjecture formulated by V. Ovsienko and the second author in a recent paper and establishes new connections between $q$-deformations of real numbers and sequences of Catalan or Motzkin numbers.</description>

      <title>The prime number theorem over integers of power-free polynomial values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree $d\ge 1$. Let $k\ge2$ be an integer. The number of integers $n$ such that $f(n)$ is $k$-free is widely studied in the literature. In principle, one expects that $f(n)$ is $k$-free infinitely often, if $f$ has no fixed $k$-th power divisor. In 2022, Bergelson and Richter established a new dynamical generalization of the prime number theorem (PNT). Inspired by their work, one may expect that this generalization of the PNT also holds over integers of power-free polynomial values. In this note, we establish such variants of Bergelson and Richter's theorem for several polynomials studied by Estermann, Hooley, Heath-Brown, Booker and Browning.</description>

      <title>Serre's question on thin sets in projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We answer a question of Serre from the 1980s on rational points of bounded height on projective thin sets, in degree at least $4$. For degrees $2$ and $3$ we improve the known bounds in general. The focus is on thin sets of type II, namely corresponding to the images of ramified dominant quasi-finite covers of projective space, as thin sets of type I are already well understood via dimension growth results by the third author in 2002 (published in 2023) by a global variant of Heath-Brown's $p$-adic determinant method. For type II, we obtain a uniform affine variant of Serre's question which implies the projective case and for which the implicit constant is furthermore polynomial in the degree. We are able to avoid logarithmic factors when the degree is at least $5$ and we prove our results over any global field, of any characteristic. A key ingredient for obtaining the affine variant comes from Binyamini-Cluckers-Novikov (2024) and Binyamini-Cluckers-Kato (2025) where a question of the third author was answered by providing bounds, for rational points on irreducible curves, which are quadratic in the degree. A second key ingredient is an adaptation of Salberger's global determinant method to the case of weighted polynomials. The third key ingredient is the design of our affine variant of Serre's question, for weighted polynomials which are not necessarily weighted homogeneous.</description>

      <title>A dimensional mass transference principle from balls to open sets and applications to dynamical Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass transference principle of Beresnevich and Velani is a powerful mechanism for determining the Hausdorff dimension/measure of $\limsup$ sets that arise naturally in Diophantine approximation. However, in the setting of dynamical Diophantine approximation, this principle often fails to apply effectively, as the radii of the balls defining the dynamical $\limsup$ sets generally depend on the orbit of the point $x$ itself.
  In this paper, we develop a dimensional mass transference principle that enables us to recover and extend classical results on shrinking target problems, particularly for the $\beta$-transformation and the Gauss map. Moreover, our result shows that the corresponding $\limsup$ sets have large intersection properties. A potentially interesting feature of our method is that, in many cases, shrinking target problems are closely related to finding an appropriate Gibbs measure, which may reveal new aspects of the link between thermodynamic formalism and dynamical Diophantine approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\pi$ and $\pi'$ be unitary cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}(n)$ and $\mathrm{GL}(n')$ over a number field $F$. We establish a new zero-free region for all $\mathrm{GL}(1)$-twists of the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(s,\pi\times\pi')$, generalizing Tatuzawa's refinement of Siegel's work on Dirichlet $L$-functions. As a corollary, we show that for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists an effectively computable constant $c&gt;0$ depending only on $(n,n',[F:\mathbb{Q}],\varepsilon)$ such that $L(s,\pi\times\pi')$ has at most one zero (necessarily simple) in the region \[ \mathrm{Re}(s)\geq 1-c/(C(\pi)C(\pi')(|\mathrm{Im}(s)|+1))^{\varepsilon}, \] where $C(\pi)$ and $C(\pi')$ are the analytic conductors. A crucial component of our proof is a new standard zero-free region for any twist of $L(s,\pi\times\widetilde{\pi})$ by an idele class character $\chi$ apart from a possible single exceptional zero (necessarily real and simple) that can occur only when $\pi\otimes\chi^2=\pi$. This extends earlier work of Humphries and Thorner.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for partitions involving generalised divisor functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an $f$-restricted partition $p_f(n,k)$ of fixed length $k$ given by the bivariate generating series \begin{align*} Q_f(z,u) \coloneqq 1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} p_f(n,k) u^kz^n =\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}(1+uz^k)^{\Delta_f(k)}, \end{align*} where $\Delta_f(n)=f(n+1)-f(n)$. In this article, we establish a central limit theorem for the number of summands in such partitions when $f(n)=\sigma_r(n)$ denotes the generalised divisor function, defined as $\sigma_r(n)=\sum_{d|n}d^r$ for integer $r\geq 2$. This can be considered as a generalisation of the work of Lipnik, Madritsch, and Tichy, who previously studied this problem for $f(n)=\lfloor{n}^{\alpha}\rfloor$ with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. A key element of our proof relies on the analytic behaviour of the Dirichlet series \begin{align*} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sigma_r(n+1)}{n^s}, \end{align*} for $\mathrm{Re}(s)&gt;1$. We study this problem employing the identity involving the Ramanujan sum. Furthermore, we analyse the Euler product arising from the above Dirichlet series by adopting the argument of Alkan, Ledoan and Zaharescu.</description>

Abstract: Let $a_k(n)$ denote the number of partitions of $n$ wherein even parts come in only one color, while the odd parts may be ``colored" with one of $k$ colors, for fixed $k$. In this note, we find some congruences for $a_k(n)$ in the spirit of Ramanujan's congruences. We prove a number of results for $a_k(n)$ modulo powers of $2$ for infinitely many values of $k$. Our approach is truly elementary, relying on generating function manipulations, theta functions and $q$-dissection techniques. We then close by demonstrating an infinite family of congruences modulo 11 which is proven using a result of Ahlgren.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a lower bound for the frequency with which an irreducible monic cubic polynomial can be expressed as a sum of two squares ($\square_{2}$). This provides a quantitative answer to a question posed by Grechuk (2021) concerning the infinitude of such values. Our proof relies on a two-dimensional unit argument and the arithmetic of degree six number fields. For example, we show that if $h \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$, then \begin{align*} \# \{n : n^3+h \in \square_{2}, \ 1 \leq n \leq x \} \gg x^{1/3-o(1)}. \end{align*} These arguments may be generalised to study the representation of irreducible monic cubic polynomials by the quadratic form $x^2+ny^2$, where $n \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

  $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{O(p)}\cdot n^{O(1)}\right)$-time, unless $\text{P}=\text{NP}$.
  $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{2^{o(p)}}\cdot 2^{o(n)}\right)$-time, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis is false.
  The proofs are based on a Karp reduction from a variant of the subset-sum problem that imposes restrictions on vectors orthogonal to the vector of its weights. While more extensive hardness results for the shortest vector problem in all $\ell_p$-norms have already been established under randomized reductions, the results in this paper are fully deterministic.</description>

      <title>The intrinsic subgroup of an elliptic curve and Mazur's torsion theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study a biadditive symmetric (not necessarily perfect) pairing on the torsion part $\mathrm{Pic}(X)_{\mathrm{tors}}$ of the Picard group of a smooth projective curve $X$ over a field $k$ with values in $k^\times \otimes \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$. We call its kernel the intrinsic subgroup of $X$. It turns out that some information on the reduction type of $X$ can be read off from the intrinsic subgroup. Mazur's torsion theorem says that there are exactly 15 isomorphism classes of abelian groups that appear as the rational torsion points of an elliptic curve $X$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ (identified with $\mathrm{Pic}(X)_{\mathrm{tors}}$). We refine this result by determining which subgroups of those 15 groups appear as the intrinsic subgroups.</description>

      <title>A discrete approach to Dirichlet L-functions, their special values and zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain new infinite families of identities among special values of Dirichlet $L$-functions using finite spectral sums. More precisely, we study Dirichlet $L$-functions via discrete analogues $L_n$ arising from the spectral theory of cyclic graphs as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Applying a refined Euler-Maclaurin asymptotic expansion due to Sidi, together with an independent polynomiality property of these finite spectral sums at integers, we obtain exact special-value formulas, even starting at $n=1$. This yields new expressions for certain trigonometric sums of interest in physics, and recovers, by a different method, the striking formulas of Xie, Zhao, and Zhao.
  Concerning zeros, using the same asymptotic expansion, we prove that for odd primitive characters, an asymptotic functional equation relating $L_n(1-s,\overline{\chi })$ to $L_n(s,\chi)$ is equivalent to the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for the corresponding Dirichlet $L$-function $L(s,\chi)$. We also provide some remarks about the non-existence of possible real zeros.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any sufficiently large positive integer $\ell$, suppose that $\ell$ can be expressed as $ \ell=p_1^4+p_2^4+p_3^4+p_4^4$, where $p_1, p_2,p_3,p_4$ are primes. For such $\ell$, in this paper we will use circle method and sieves to prove that the proportion of $\ell$ in positive integers is at least $\frac{1}{27241.64}$ .</description>

      <title>On difference sets of dense subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the structure of the difference set $E - E$ for subsets $E \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper Banach density. Fish asked in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 146 (2018), 3449-3453] whether, for every such set $E$, there exists a nonzero integer $k$ such that $k \cdot \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\}.$ Although this question remains open, we establish a relatively weaker form of this conjecture. Specifically, we prove that if $\langle a_j\rangle_{j=1}^m$ is any finite sequence in $\mathbb{N},$ then there exist infinitely many integers $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ and a sequence $\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ such that $k \cdot MT\left(\langle a_j \rangle_{j=1}^m, \langle x_n\rangle_{n}\right) \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\},$ where $MT\left(\langle a_j \rangle_{j=1}^m, \langle x_n\rangle_{n}\right)$ denotes the milliken-Taylor configuration generated by the sequences $\langle a_j\rangle_{j=1}^m$ and $\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.</description>

      <title>The infinitude of square-free palindromes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We settle an open problem regarding palindromes; that is, positive integers which are the same when written forwards and backwards. In particular, we prove that for any fixed base $b\geq 2$, there exist infinitely many square-free palindromes in base $b$. We also provide an asymptotic expression for the number of such integers $\leq x$. The core of our proof utilises a hybrid $p$-adic/Archimedean van der Corput process, used in conjunction with an equidistribution estimate of Tuxanidy and Panario, as well as an elementary argument of Cilleruelo, Luca and Shparlinski.</description>

      <title>Resolution of Erd\H{o}s Problem #728: a writeup of Aristotle's Lean proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07421v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erd\H{o}s Problem #728; this is the first Erd\H{o}s problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erd\H{o}s which has been collected in the Erd\H{o}s Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility.
  The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0&lt;C_1&lt;C_2$ and $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that \[ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n &lt; a+b-n &lt; C_2\log n. \] The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $\nu_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erd\H{o}s and by Pomerance.</description>

      <title>Crystallinity for syntomic cohomology, \'etale cohomology, and algebraic $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove for $n\geq c-1$ that the functor taking an animated ring $R$ to its mod $(p^c,v_1^{p^n})$ syntomic cohomology factors through the functor $R \mapsto R/p^{c(n+2)}$, a phenomenon we term crystallinity for mod $(p^c,v_1^{p^n})$ syntomic cohomology. As an application, we completely and explicitly compute the mod $(p,v_1 ^{p^{n}-1})$ algebraic $K$-theory of $\mathbb Z/p^{k}$ whenever $k \geq n+2$ and $p&gt;2$. As a second application, we deduce crystallinity for the mod $p^c$ syntomic complexes associated to smooth $p$-adic formal schemes, and in particular for the Galois equivariant mod $p^c$ \'etale cohomologies of their adic generic fibers. Finally, we strengthen known $p$-adic convergence theorems for the topological Hochschild homology of ring spectra, and as a result relate crystallinity for algebraic $K$-theory to Lichtenbaum--Quillen theorems.</description>

Abstract: Exceptional real groups have quaternionic forms of split rank 4 that contain dual pairs $G\times G'$, where $G'$ is the split Lie group of the type $G_2$, and $G$ a Lie group of split rank one. In this paper we restrict the minimal representation of the quaternionic group to the dual pair and prove some significant results for the resulting correspondence of representations.</description>

      <title>Cyclotomic integral points for affine dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f:\mathbb{A}^N\to\mathbb{A}^N$ be a regular endomorphism of algebraic degree $d\geq2$ (i.e., $f$ extends to an endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^N$ of algebraic degree $d$) defined over a number field. We prove that if the set of cyclotomic $f$-preperiodic points is Zariski-dense in $\mathbb{A}^N$, then some iterate $f^{\circ l}$ ($l\geq1$) is a quotient of a surjective algebraic group endomorphism $g:\mathbb{G}_m^N\to\mathbb{G}_m^N$, over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. This result generalizes a theorem of Dvornicich and Zannier on cyclotomic preperiodic points of one-variable polynomials to higher dimensions. In fact, we prove a much more general rigidity result for dominant endomorphisms $f$ on an affine variety $X$ defined over a number field, concerning "almost $f$-invariant" Zariski-dense subsets of cyclotomic integral points. We apply our results to backward orbits of regular endomorphisms on $\mathbb{A}^N$ of algebraic degree $d\geq2$, and to periodic points of automorphisms of H\'enon type on $\mathbb{A}^N$.</description>

      <title>The Greedy Algorithm for Dissociated Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac \pi 2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1&lt;C&lt;c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</description>
