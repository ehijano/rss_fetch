      <title>Machine Learning Approaches for Defect Detection in a Microwell-based Medical Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidic devices offer numerous advantages in medical applications, including the capture of single cells in microwell-based platforms for genomic analysis. As the cost of sequencing decreases, the demand for high-throughput single-cell analysis devices increases, leading to more microwells in a single device. However, their small size and large quantity increase the quality control (QC) effort. Currently, QC steps are still performed manually in some devices, requiring intensive training and time and causing inconsistency between different operators. A way to overcome this issue is to through automated defect detection. Computer vision can quickly analyze a large number of images in a short time and can be applied in defect detection. Automated defect detection can replace manual inspection, potentially decreasing variations in QC results. We report a machine learning (ML) algorithm that applies a convolution neural network (CNN) model with 9 layers and 64 units, incorporating dropouts and regularizations. This algorithm can analyze a large number of microwells produced by injection molding, significantly increasing the number of images analyzed compared to manual operator, improving QC, and ensuring the delivery of high-quality products to customers.</description>

      <title>MSMF: Multi-Scale Multi-Modal Fusion for Enhanced Stock Market Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents MSMF (Multi-Scale Multi-Modal Fusion), a novel approach for enhanced stock market prediction. MSMF addresses key challenges in multi-modal stock analysis by integrating a modality completion encoder, multi-scale feature extraction, and an innovative fusion mechanism. Our model leverages blank learning and progressive fusion to balance complementarity and redundancy across modalities, while multi-scale alignment facilitates direct correlations between heterogeneous data types. We introduce Multi-Granularity Gates and a specialized architecture to optimize the integration of local and global information for different tasks. Additionally, a Task-targeted Prediction layer is employed to preserve both coarse and fine-grained features during fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MSMF outperforms existing methods, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and reducing prediction errors across various stock market forecasting tasks. This research contributes valuable insights to the field of multi-modal financial analysis and offers a robust framework for enhanced market prediction.</description>

      <title>Multi-granularity Score-based Generative Framework Enables Efficient Inverse Design of Complex Organics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently retrieving an enormous chemical library to design targeted molecules is crucial for accelerating drug discovery, organic chemistry, and optoelectronic materials. Despite the emergence of generative models to produce novel drug-like molecules, in a more realistic scenario, the complexity of functional groups (e.g., pyrene, acenaphthylene, and bridged-ring systems) and extensive molecular scaffolds remain challenging obstacles for the generation of complex organics. Traditionally, the former demands an extra learning process, e.g., molecular pre-training, and the latter requires expensive computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose OrgMol-Design, a multi-granularity framework for efficiently designing complex organics. Our OrgMol-Design is composed of a score-based generative model via fragment prior for diverse coarse-grained scaffold generation and a chemical-rule-aware scoring model for fine-grained molecular structure design, circumventing the difficulty of intricate substructure learning without losing connection details among fragments. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in four real-world and more challenging benchmarks covering broader scientific domains, outperforming advanced molecule generative models. Additionally, it delivers a substantial speedup and graphics memory reduction compared to diffusion-based graph models. Our results also demonstrate the importance of leveraging fragment prior for a generalized molecule inverse design model.</description>

      <title>The mutual pulling force of human muscle fibers can treat mild cancer and rhinitis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muscles can store a large amount of genetic information, and in order to transform humans into computers, we need to start by increasing muscle tension. When people with cancer go on happy trips, some cancers often heal without treatment; Rhinitis can cause blockage of the nostrils, but after running, the nostrils naturally ventilate. Both are related to exercise, and the mystery behind them can treat both conditions. Cancer belongs to systemic diseases, and the eradication method for systemic diseases should start from the entire body system, treat the symptoms and prevent recurrence. This article uses special exercise methods and detailed methods to treat diseases, and finds that treating diseases from the perspective of the human system is indeed effective. This article adopts a comparative experimental method to compare the changes in the body before and after. Through this article, it is concluded that exercise and certain methods can cure mild rhinitis and promote rapid ventilation; Explaining from the perspective of muscle pulling force that older individuals are more prone to developing cellular variant cancer; Enhancing muscle tension in the human body can promote the cure of some cancers</description>

      <title>MarS: a Financial Market Simulation Engine Powered by Generative Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models aim to simulate realistic effects of various actions across different contexts, from text generation to visual effects. Despite efforts to build real-world simulators, leveraging generative models for virtual worlds, like financial markets, remains underexplored. In financial markets, generative models can simulate market effects of various behaviors, enabling interaction with market scenes and players, and training strategies without financial risk. This simulation relies on the finest structured data in financial market like orders thus building the finest realistic simulation. We propose Large Market Model (LMM), an order-level generative foundation model, for financial market simulation, akin to language modeling in the digital world. Our financial Market Simulation engine (MarS), powered by LMM, addresses the need for realistic, interactive and controllable order generation. Key objectives of this paper include evaluating LMM's scaling law in financial markets, assessing MarS's realism, balancing controlled generation with market impact, and demonstrating MarS's potential applications. We showcase MarS as a forecast tool, detection system, analysis platform, and agent training environment. Our contributions include pioneering a generative model for financial markets, designing MarS to meet domain-specific needs, and demonstrating MarS-based applications' industry potential.</description>

      <title>Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number, while the inclusion of surrounding coarse element neighbors was found to improve predictions at Re=1600, but not at Re=3200.</description>

      <title>Graph Laplacian-based Bayesian Multi-fidelity Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel probabilistic approach for generating multi-fidelity data while accounting for errors inherent in both low- and high-fidelity data. In this approach a graph Laplacian constructed from the low-fidelity data is used to define a multivariate Gaussian prior density for the coordinates of the true data points. In addition, few high-fidelity data points are used to construct a conjugate likelihood term. Thereafter, Bayes rule is applied to derive an explicit expression for the posterior density which is also multivariate Gaussian. The maximum \textit{a posteriori} (MAP) estimate of this density is selected to be the optimal multi-fidelity estimate. It is shown that the MAP estimate and the covariance of the posterior density can be determined through the solution of linear systems of equations. Thereafter, two methods, one based on spectral truncation and another based on a low-rank approximation, are developed to solve these equations efficiently. The multi-fidelity approach is tested on a variety of problems in solid and fluid mechanics with data that represents vectors of quantities of interest and discretized spatial fields in one and two dimensions. The results demonstrate that by utilizing a small fraction of high-fidelity data, the multi-fidelity approach can significantly improve the accuracy of a large collection of low-fidelity data points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1709.10048v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper gives an introduction to rate equations in nonlinear continuum mechanics which should obey specific transformation rules. Emphasis is placed on the geometrical nature of the operations involved in order to clarify the different concepts. The paper is particularly concerned with common classes of constitutive equations based on corotational stress rates and their proper implementation in time for solving initial boundary value problems. Hypoelastic simple shear is considered as an example application for the derived theory and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Scattering-Based Characteristic Mode Theory for Structures in Arbitrary Background: Computation, Benchmarks, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for computing substructure characteristic modes. This method leverages electromagnetic scattering matrices and spherical wave expansion to directly decompose electromagnetic fields. Unlike conventional methods that rely on the impedance matrix generated by the method of moments (MoM), our technique simplifies the problem into a small-scale ordinary eigenvalue problem, improving numerical dynamics and computational efficiency. We have developed analytical substructure characteristic mode solutions for a scenario involving two spheres, which can serve as benchmarks for evaluating other numerical solvers. A key advantage of our method is its independence from specific MoM frameworks, allowing for the use of various numerical methods. This flexibility paves the way for substructure characteristic mode decomposition to become a universal frequency-domain technique.</description>
