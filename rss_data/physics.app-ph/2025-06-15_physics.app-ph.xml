      <title>InGaN Nanopixel Arrays on Single Crystal GaN Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) quantum well (QW) micro- and nano-scale light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are vital to the next-generation optoelectronic applications such as ultrahigh-speed optical interconnects and near-eye augmented/virtual reality displays. However, scaling to nanoscale dimensions introduces several challenges, including an increased nonradiative recombination from surface states and defect-related emission degradation. In this work, we present a high-performance, strain-relaxed nanoscale LED array, fabricated using a top-down nanostructuring approach applied to a high-quality, all-InGaN (quantum well/barrier) LED structure grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) on bulk GaN substrates. Combining an ultra-low threading dislocation density bulk GaN substrate and effective sidewall passivation with atomic layer deposition (ALD) results in excellent diode rectification characteristics and extremely low leakage currents. Electroluminescence measurements reveal bright blue emission with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.46% at an elevated injection current density of ~1.2 kA/cm2.</description>

      <title>Metallization of leaf-derived lignocellulose scaffolds for high performance flexible electronics and oligodynamic disinfection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vascular tubules in natural leaves form quasi-fractal networks that can be metallized. Traditional metallization techniques for these lignocellulose structures are complex, involving metal sputtering, nanoparticle solutions, or multiple chemical pretreatments. Here we present a novel, facile, and reliable method for metallizing leaf-derived lignocellulose scaffolds using silver microparticles. The method achieves properties on-par with the state-of-the-art, such as broadband optical transmittance of over 80%, sheet resistances below 1 Ohm/sq., and a current-carrying capacity exceeding 6 A over a 2.5 x 2.5 cm^2 quasi-fractal electrode. We also demonstrate copper electrodeposition as a cost-effective approach towards fabricating such conductive, biomimetic quasi-fractals. Additionally, we show that these metallized structures can effectively eliminate pathogenic microorganisms like fecal coliforms and E. coli, which are bacterial indicators of microbiological contamination of water. We finally show that these oligodynamic properties can be significantly enhanced with a small externally applied voltage, indicating the noteworthy potential of such structures for water purification and pollution control.</description>

      <title>On Apparent Absence of Green Gap in InGaN/GaN Quantum Disks and Wells Grown by Plasma-Assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: III-nitride based full-color blue, green and red-light emitting diodes are critically important for a broad range of important applications. To date, however, green or red color III-nitride light emitters grown by conventional growth techniques are limited in efficiency compared to blue emitters. As opposed to metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), while grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE), the most intense emission is generally observed in the green spectral region in InGaN/GaN based light emitters. Such counterintuitive phenomenon of efficiency increase with increasing emission wavelength has been observed in both InGaN/GaN quantum-disks in nanowire and planar quantum-wells structures grown by PAMBE. Here, we experimentally show that the apparent absence of green gap in longer green wavelength is due to the difficulty of elimination of indium-rich non-radiative clusters and phase segregation in shorter blue wavelength quantum wells/disks.Excess indium due to the dissociation of the In-N bonds during growth lead to nitrogen vacancies and metallic inclusions. In radio-frequency PAMBE, the energy of the nitrogen radicals was found to be a driving force for indium incorporation.Our detailed growth and associated photoluminescence studies suggests that uniform phase and absence of metallic inclusion is the underlying mechanism of efficient green InGaN/GaN quantum wells/disks grown with sufficiently energetic plasma flux. Our study is valid for achieving very efficient green and red color InGaN/GaN and breaking the green gap bottleneck in quantum wells/disks grown by state-of-the-art high-power plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy</description>

      <title>MEMS Switch Enabled Spatiotemporally Modulated Isolators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the simulation, design, and implementation of a compact MEMS switch based spatiotemporally modulated (STM) bandpass filtering isolator to improve self-interference cancellation (SIC) in underwater acoustic communication networks. Conventional ferrite circulators are unavailable in ultrasonic frequency ranges limiting SIC to techniques such as spatial cancellation and adaptive digital cancellation. This study details a sub-megahertz electronic non-magnetic filtering isolator. High power-handling, compact, and reliable MEMS switches enable the periodically time varying filter circuit to be non-reciprocal. A printed circuit board (PCB) implementation shows strong agreement with spectral admittance matrix simulations with a maximum measured isolation of 15.99 dB. In conjunction with digital SIC methods, this isolator can enable in-band full duplex underwater communication, environmental sensing, and imaging.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Free-Standing Nanostructures from Bulk Diamond over Millimeter Scales for Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum devices based on optically addressable spin qubits in diamond are promising platforms for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and communication. Nano- and microstructuring of the diamond crystal is essential to enhance device performance, yet fabrication remains challenging and often involves trade-offs in surface quality, aspect ratio, device size, and uniformity. We tackle this hurdle with an approach producing millimeter-scale, thin (down to 70 nm) and highly parallel (&lt; 0.35 nm/$\mu$m}) membranes from single-crystal diamond. The membranes remain contamination-free and possess atomically smooth surfaces ($\mathrm{R_q}$ &lt; 200 pm) as required by state-of-the-art quantum applications. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of our method by fabricating large fields of free-standing and homogeneous photonic nano- and microstructures. Leveraging a refined photolithography-based strategy, our method offers enhanced scalability and produces robust structures suitable for direct use, while remaining compatible with heterogeneous integration through pick-and-place transfer techniques.</description>

      <title>Passive radiative cooling using temperature-dependent emissivity can sometimes outperform static emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In passive sky-facing radiative cooling, wavelength-selective thermal emitters in the atmospheric transparency window of 8-13 $\mu$m can reach lower temperatures compared to broadband emitters, but broadband emitters always have higher cooling power when the emitter is warmer than the ambient. Here, we propose a temperature-tunable thermal emitter that switches between a wavelength-selective state -- with high emissivity only in the atmospheric transparency window of 8-13 $\mu$m -- and a broadband-emissive state with high emissivity in the 3-25 $\mu$m range, thus maintaining high cooling potential across all temperatures. We also propose a realization of such a temperature-tunable emitter using the phase transition of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$), which can be tuned to the ambient temperature using a combination of doping and defect engineering.</description>

      <title>Uni-Traveling-Carrier Photodiode Based on MoS2/GaN van der Waals Heterojunction for High-Speed Visible-Light Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uni-traveling-carrier photodiodes (UTC-PDs), which utilize only electrons as the active carriers, have become indispensable in high-speed optoelectronics due to their unique capabilities, such as high saturation power and broad bandwidth. However, extending the operating wavelengths into the visible region for wider applications is challenging due to the lack of suitable wide-bandgap III-V semiconductor combinations with the necessary band alignment and lattice matching. Here, we show that a UTC-PD based on a van der Waals heterojunction composed of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), as a photoabsorption layer and a gallium nitride (GaN) film as a carrier transport layer, offers a solution to this challenge. The fast vertical carrier transport across the heterointerface is enabled by the direct epitaxial growth of a MoS2 layer on a GaN film. Our device demonstrates a frequency response in the several-GHz range with a quantum efficiency on the order of 1% throughout the entire visible spectrum, highlighting the promise for high-speed visible optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>PAMBE growth of GaN nanowires on metallic ZrN buffers -- a critical impact of ZrN layer thickness on the growth temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An impact of thin metallic ZrN layers on Si and sapphire wafers on substrate temperature during MBE growth of GaN nanowires is studied. Using nucleation kinetics of GaN as a sensitive probe we show that a thin ZrN layer strongly increases the substrate temperature, which significantly affects the dimensions and density of the nanowires. To quantify the effect we developed a technique of optical pyrometer calibration that allows reliable determination of emissivity, and thus precise measurement of temperature of substrates with unknown optical parameters, such as ZrN buffers of various thicknesses. Our results show that emissivity of ZrN-coated Si and sapphire wafers differs significantly from the bulk ZrN and increases drastically for films thinner than ~100 nm. Simple calculations indicate that ignoring the influence of the thin film may lead to huge errors in temperature readings and consequently to losing the growth control. Then, we show that we can compensate for the impact of ZrN buffer on substrate temperature and grow identical nanowire arrays on Si substrates with and without ZrN layers. Finally, having identical arrays of GaN nanowires we used X-ray diffraction to compare nanowire arrangements on Si and ZrN/Si substrates with a thin SiN nucleation layer.</description>

      <title>Radar Ranging Using Rydberg Atomic Homodyne Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radar ranging is a key technology for environment sensing, target tracking, and navigation, yet traditional radar front-ends are still physically limited by antenna aperture and microwave electronics bandwidth. To overcome these limitations, we propose and experimentally validate a homodyne radar architecture based on Rydberg atoms, which uses a centimeter-scale atomic vapor cell replacing the antenna-to-mixer portion of a conventional receiver end. This approach is based on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting effect, where zero-intermediate-frequency mixing is performed directly within the atomic medium through an external co-frequency reference for optical baseband readout. Aiming at the intrinsically narrow instantaneous atomic bandwidth, we implement a non-uniform stepped-frequency synthesis strategy combining coarse laser frequency tuning with fine AC-Stark shift compensation, enabling an effective synthesized bandwidth of GHz-level across the S-band (2.6-3.6 GHz). Additionally, we establish a nonlinear response model of the Rydberg atomic homodyne receiver and propose a customized nonlinear predistortion method that extends the linear dynamic range by more than 7 dB. We develop a CS-Rydberg algorithm incorporating compressive sensing to suppress noise and mitigate the undersampling problem. Experimental validations within target distances from 1.6 to 1.9 m demonstrate centimeter-level ranging accuracy (root-mean-square error = 1.04 cm) and a range resolution better than 15 cm. These results validate the feasibility of quantum radar receiving technology based on Rydberg atoms, providing essential groundwork toward next-generation radar systems featuring ultra-wide spectral agility, quantum-traceable calibration, and simplified architectures beyond traditional electronic front-ends.</description>

      <title>Strategy for Bayesian Optimized Beam Steering at TRIUMF-ISAC's MEBT and HEBT Beamlines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In preparation for operation of multiple Rare Isotope Beams (RIBs) when the Advanced Rare Isotope Laboratory (ARIEL) becomes operational, TRIUMF embarked on a program of advanced beam tuning applications and machine learning tools. The strategy for operationalzing Bayesian Optimization for beam steering purposes is being developed. A previously reported centroid correction algorithm is used to tune accelerated charged particle beams at TRIUMF's ISAC postaccelerator facility. We present findings and results from multiple machine development experiments conducted between October and November 2024, as part of a pivot toward semi-automated machine tuning methods. These findings were instrumental in shaping the tuning strategy for the medium and high energy beam transport (MEBT, HEBT) lines at ISAC, by sequentially optimizing sub-sections of the beamlines.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the mystery of enhanced open-circuit voltages in nanotextured perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells have reached power conversion efficiencies that rival those of established silicon photovoltaic technologies. Nanotextures in perovskite solar cells optimise light trapping and scattering, thereby improving optical absorption. In addition, nanotextures have been experimentally shown to enhance electronic performance, in particular, by increasing the open-circuit voltage $V_{\text{OC}}$ -- a phenomenon that, until now, has remained not fully understood. This study investigates the underlying reasons by combining multi-dimensional optical and charge-transport simulations for a single-junction perovskite solar cell. Our results reveal that the increased open-circuit voltage is not driven by optical effects but by the textured geometry itself. For voltages near $V_{\text{OC}}$, texturing one of the absorber/transport layer interfaces increases the imbalance between electron and hole densities in the absorber, thereby reducing Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, which is the dominant loss mechanism in this study. While idealised solar cells benefit unconditionally from increasing texture height, in realistic cells there is an optimal texture height which maximizes the power conversion efficiency. These findings provide new insights into the opto-electronic advantages of texturing and offer guidance for the design of next-generation textured perovskite-based solar cells, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors.</description>
