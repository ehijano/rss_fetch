      <title>Sharp lower bound for the charged Hawking mass in the electrostatic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove sharp lower bounds for the charged Hawking mass of stable surfaces in electrostatic space-times in various contexts. An upper bound for the genus of stable surfaces in the electrostatic system is provided. We also study the positivity for the charged Hawking mass of a minimal surface with index one in the electrostatic space-times. A criterion for a CMC surface in the Reissner-Nordstrom deSitter space to be stable is presented.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of the Lie superalgebra D(2,1;a)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every parabolic subgroup $P$ of a Lie supergroup $G$, the homogeneous superspace $G/P$ carries a $G$-invariant supergeometry. We address the question whether $\mathfrak{g}=\text{Lie}(G)$ is the maximal supersymmetry of this supergeometry in the case of the exceptional Lie superalgebra $D(2,1;a)$. For each choice of parabolic $\mathfrak{p}\subset\mathfrak{g}$, we consider the corresponding negatively graded Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak{m}\subset\mathfrak{g}$, and compute its Tanaka--Weisfeiler prolongations, with reduction of the structure group when required, thus realizing $D(2,1;a)$ via symmetries of supergeometries.
  This gives 6 inequivalent supergeometries: one of these is a vector superdistribution, two are given by cone fields of supervarieties, and the remaining three are higher order structure reductions (a novel feature). We describe those supergeometries and realize $D(2,1;a)$ supersymmetry explicitly in each case.</description>

      <title>Zariski-dense deformations of standard discontinuous groups for pseudo-Riemannian homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X=G/H$ be a homogeneous space of a Lie group $G$. When the isotropy subgroup $H$ is non-compact, a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ may fail to act properly discontinuously on $X$. In this article, we address the following question: in the setting where $G$ and $H$ are reductive Lie groups and $\Gamma \backslash X$ is a standard quotient, to what extent can one deform the discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ while preserving the proper discontinuity of the action on $X$?
  We provide several classification results, including conditions under which local rigidity holds for compact standard quotients $\Gamma\backslash X$, when a standard quotient can be deformed into a non-standard quotient, a characterization of the largest Zariski-closure of discontinuous groups under small deformations, and conditions under which Zariski-dense deformations occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the perspective of Morse theory, it is natural to investigate gradient flow trajectories between critical points. In this short note, we explore the minimal hypersurface analogue of this phenomenon and present examples that suggest additional topological and variational obstructions to the existence of connecting mean curvature flows.</description>

      <title>Improved explicit estimates for the discrete Laplace operator with hyperbolic circle patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ge in his thesis \cite{Ge-thesis} introduced the combinatorial Calabi flows and established the long time existence and convergence of solutions to the flows in both hyperbolic and Euclidean background geometries. It is noteworthy that the existence of solutions to the combinatorial Calabi flows in hyperbolic background geometry proves to be more intricate and challenging compared to the Euclidean background geometry. The main difficulty is to establish the compactness, especially the lower boundeness along the flow equations. In this paper, we give two explicit estimates for the discrete Laplace operator based on the Glickenstein-Thomas formulation \cite{Glickenstein2017} for discrete hyperbolic conformal structures. As applications, we give new proofs of the long time existence of solutions to the combinatorial Calabi flows established by Ge-Xu \cite{Ge2016}, Ge-Hua \cite{Ge2018} and the combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flows established by Lin-Zhang \cite{Lin2019} in hyperbolic background geometry.</description>

      <title>Lin-Lu-Yau Ricci curvature on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for defining Lin-Lu-Yau (LLY) Ricci curvature on both undirected and directed hypergraphs. By establishing upper bounds and monotonicity properties for the parameterized curvature $\kappa_\alpha$, we justify the well-posedness and compatibility of our definitions. Furthermore, we prove a Bonnet-Myers-type theorem for hypergraphs, which highlights the potential of LLY Ricci curvature in hypergraph analysis, particularly in studying geometric and structural properties. Our results extends the foundational definitions of graph Ricci curvature by Ollivier and Lin-Lu-Yau to the hypergraph setting.</description>

      <title>Extensions and Applications of Bredon's Trick in Geometric and Topological Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of Bredon's trick, a powerful local-to-global extension principle with broad applications across differential geometry and computational topology. Our main contributions include: (1) novel applications to stratified pseudomanifolds via Verona cohomology with explicit verification of axiomatic conditions; (2) new frameworks for Ricci flow singularity analysis using local curvature concentration; (3) stability theorems for persistent homology in distributed computational settings; and (4) rigorous applications to medical imaging and neural network topology. By systematically developing the theoretical foundations and providing concrete implementations, this work establishes Bredon's trick as a unifying framework for modern local-to-global arguments in geometric analysis and applied topology.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for convex anisotropic capillary hypersurfaces in the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the results of Mei, Wang, Weng and Xia [Math. Z., 2025, MR4911815] on capillary convex bodies are extended to the anisotropic setting. We develop a theory for anisotropic capillary convex bodies in the half-space and establish a general Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality for mixed volumes of anisotropic capillary convex bodies. Thus, this weakens the conditions of the inequality in [Ding-Gao-Li,arXiv:2408.10740, Theorem 1.4] and extends it to a more general case.</description>

      <title>On a parabolic curvature lower bound generalizing Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal transport plays a major role in the study of manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below. Some results in this setting have been extended to super Ricci flows, revealing a unified approach to analysis on Ricci nonnegative manifolds and Ricci flows. However we observe that the monotonicity of Perelman's functionals ($\mathcal{F}$, $\mathcal{W}$, reduced volume), which hold true for Ricci flows and Ricci nonnegative manifolds, cannot be strictly generalized to super Ricci flows. In 2010 Buzano introduced a condition which still generalizes Ricci flows and Ricci nonnegative manifolds, and on which Perelman's monotonicities do hold. We provide characterizations of this condition using optimal transport and understand it heuristically as Ricci nonnegativity of the space-time. This interpretation is consistent with its equivalence to Ricci nonnegativity on Perelman's infinite dimensional manifold.
  More precisely, we prove that for smooth evolutions of Riemannian manifolds, this condition is equivalent to a Bochner inequality (resembling Perelman's Harnack inequality but for the forward heat flow), a gradient estimate for the heat flow, a Wasserstein contraction along the adjoint heat flow, the convexity of a modified entropy along Wasserstein geodesics, and an Evolutionary Variational Inequality (EVI). The optimal transport statements use Perelman's $L$ distance as cost, as first studied on Ricci flows by Topping and by Lott. We also consider dimensionally improved and weighted versions of these conditions. The dimensional Bochner inequality and all gradient estimates for the forward heat equation, along with the EVIs, appear to be new even for general Ricci flows, and are related to the Hamiltonian perspective on the $L$ distance. Most of our proofs do not use tensor calculus or Jacobi fields, suggesting the possibility of future extensions to more singular settings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce three biharmonic Steklov problems on differential forms with Neumann boundary conditions and show that they are elliptic. We prove the existence of a discrete spectrum for each of those problems and give associated variational characterizations for their eigenvalues. We establish eigenvalue estimates known as Kuttler-Sigillito inequalities, relating the eigenvalues of these problems with the eigenvalues of the Steklov, Dirichlet and Neumann standard problems as well as the biharmonic Steklov problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions on differential forms.</description>

Abstract: We show that for a broad family of noncompact homogeneous Riemannian manifolds, the corresponding homogeneous Ricci flow solutions have finite extinction time, thereby confirming the dynamical Alekseevskii conjecture for these spaces. As an application, we prove that on such homogeneous manifolds \( G/H \), the space of all \( G \)-invariant positive scalar curvature metrics is contractible.</description>

      <title>Differentiable structures on a union of two open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper the authors classified differentiable structures on the non-Hausdorff one-dimensional manifold $\mathbb{L}$ called the line with two origins which is obtained by gluing two copies of the real line $\mathbb{R}$ via the identity homeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}\setminus 0$.
  Here we give a classification of differentiable structures on another non-Hausdorff one-dimensional manifold $\mathbb{Y}$ (called letter "$Y$") obtained by gluing two copies of $\mathbb{R}$ via the identity map of positive reals. It turns out that, in contrast to the real line, for every $r=1,\ldots,\infty$, both manifolds $\mathbb{L}$ and $\mathbb{Y}$ admit uncountably many pair-wise non-diffeomorphic $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures.
  We also observe that the proofs of these classifications are very similar. This allows to formalize the arguments and extend them to a certain general statement about arrows in arbitrary categories.</description>

      <title>Global minimizers for fast diffusion versus nonlocal interactions on negatively curved manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of ground states for a free energy functional on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. The energy, which consists of an entropy and an interaction term, is associated to a macroscopic aggregation model that includes nonlinear diffusion and nonlocal interactions. We consider specifically the regime of fast diffusion, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the behaviour of the interaction potential for global energy minimizers to exist. We first consider the case of manifolds with constant bounds of sectional curvatures, then extend the results to manifolds with general curvature bounds. To establish our results we derive several new Carlson-Levin type inequalities for Cartan-Hadamard manifolds.</description>

      <title>Learning Beyond Euclid: Curvature-Adaptive Generalization for Neural Networks on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop new generalization bounds for neural networks trained on data supported on Riemannian manifolds. Existing generalization theories often rely on complexity measures derived from Euclidean geometry, which fail to account for the intrinsic structure of non-Euclidean spaces. Our analysis introduces a geometric refinement: we derive covering number bounds that explicitly incorporate manifold-specific properties such as sectional curvature, volume growth, and injectivity radius. These geometric corrections lead to sharper Rademacher complexity bounds for classes of Lipschitz neural networks defined on compact manifolds. The resulting generalization guarantees recover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve substantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional manifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the tightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential volume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved spaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework provides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning capacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep learning on structured data domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the twisted Bredon-Illman cohomology defined by Mukherjee-Mukherjee applied to compact Lie group action groupoids is Morita-invariant. This cohomology uses coefficient systems twisted over the discrete tom Dieck equivariant fundamental groupoid. To show Morita invariance, we use bibundles to transfer coefficient systems from one groupoid to another Morita equivalent one. This generalises results of Pronk-Scull on ordinary Bredon-Illman cohomology by removing both the finite isotropy condition and restrictions on the coefficient systems.</description>

      <title>Carnot-Carath\'eodory Balls on Manifolds with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nagel, Stein, and Wainger introduced a detailed quantitative study of Carnot--Carath\'eodory balls on a smooth manifold without boundary. Most importantly, they introduced scaling maps adapted to Carnot--Carath\'eodory balls and H\"ormander vector fields. Their work was extended by many authors and has since become a key tool in the study of the interior theory of subelliptic PDEs; in particular, the study of maximally subelliptic PDEs. We introduce a generalization of this quantitative theory to manifolds with boundary, where we have scaling maps both on the interior and on the part of the boundary which is non-characteristic with respect to the vector fields. This is the first paper in a forthcoming series devoted to studying maximally subelliptic boundary value problems.</description>

Abstract: In Floer theory one has to deal with two-level manifolds like for instance the space of $W^{2,2}$ loops and the space of $W^{1,2}$ loops. Gradient flow lines in Floer theory are then trajectories in a two-level manifold. Inspired by our endeavor to find a general setup to construct Floer homology we therefore address in this paper the question if the space of paths on a two-level manifold has itself the structure of a Hilbert manifold. In view of the two topologies on a two-level manifold it is unclear how to define the exponential map on a general two-level manifold. We therefore study a different approach how to define charts on path spaces of two-level manifolds. To make this approach work we need an additional structure on a two-level manifold which we refer to as tameness. We introduce the notion of tame maps and show that the composition of tame is tame again. Therefore it makes sense to introduce the notion of a tame two-level manifold. The main result of this paper shows that the path spaces on tame two-level manifolds have the structure of a Hilbert manifold.</description>

      <title>Perimeter on a manifold, with applications to partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perimeter of a measurable subset of $\mathbb R^N$ is the total variation of its characteristic function. We generalize this notion to a subset $E$ of a closed Riemannian manifold. We show that the perimeter of $E$ is the limit of the hear kernel regularization of its characteristic function. A generalization of the isoperimetric inequality and of the Fleming-Rishel formula follow. These results are applied to a quasilinear elliptic problem in $\mathbb R^N$ for which the usual symmetrization methods fail. It will be tackled successfully by introducing a symmetrization method on the sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By analogy with Weinstein's neighbourhood theorem, we prove a uniqueness result for symplectic neighbourhoods of a large family of stratified subspaces. This result generalizes existing constructions, e.g., in the search for exotic Lagrangians. Along the way, we prove a strong version of Moser's trick and a (non-symplectic) tubular neighbourhood theorem for these stratified subspaces.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we investigate the effects of metric perturbations of closed surfaces on the number of nodal domains. In particular, we show that the nodal domain count for Laplace eigenfunctions is (locally) maximised for non-generic metrics. We also investigate localised perturbations and showcase some interesting applications regarding Courant sharp metrics on closed surfaces and associated boundary nodal-data prescription problems.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy Problem for Symmetric Hyperbolic Systems with Nonlocal Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the initial value problem for symmetric hyperbolic systems on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds with potentials that are both nonlocal in time and space. When the potential is retarded and uniformly bounded in time, we establish well-posedness of the Cauchy problem on a time strip, proving existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions. If the potential is not retarded but has only short time range, we show that strong solutions still exist, under the additional assumptions that the uniform bound in time is sufficiently small compared to the range in time and that its kernel decays sufficiently fast in time with respect to the zero-order terms of the system. Furthermore, we present a counterexample demonstrating that when the uniform bound is too large compared to the time range, solutions may fail to exist. As an application, we discuss Maxwell's equations in linear dispersive media on ultrastatic spacetimes, as well as the Dirac equation with nonlocal potential naturally arising in the theory of causal fermion systems. Our paper aims to represent the starting point for a rigorous study for the Cauchy problem for the semiclassical Einstein equations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and analyze a new geometric structure on topological surfaces generalizing the complex structure. To define this so called higher complex structure we use the punctual Hilbert scheme of the plane. The moduli space of higher complex structures is defined and is shown to be a generalization of the classical Teichm\"uller space. We give arguments for the conjectural isomorphism between the moduli space of higher complex structures and Hitchin's component.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of an equidistributed sequence of nondegenerate closed geodesics for generic Finsler, symmetric Finsler and Riemannian metrics on every closed surface. The proof relies on the volume property of embedded contact homology, established by Cristofaro-Gardiner, Hutchings and Ramos, along with specific local variational constructions and transversality arguments. Our approach is motivated by Irie's equidistribution result in [19] for three-dimensional Reeb flows and the analogous result presented by Marques, Neves and Song [27] for embedded minimal hypersurfaces.</description>

Abstract: In his ``Four Lectures", Gromov conjectured a scalar curvature extremality property of convex polytopes. Moreover, Gromov outlined a proof of the conjecture in the special case when the dihedral angles are acute. Gromov's argument relies on Dirac operator techniques together with a smoothing construction. In this paper, we give the details of such a smoothing construction, thereby providing a detailed proof of Gromov's theorem.</description>

      <title>On constant mean curvature 1-immersions of surfaces into hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Bryant on constant mean curvature (CMC) $1$-immersions of surfaces into the hyperbolic space H^3 and after the results of Tarantello (2023), we pursue a possible parametrization for the moduli space of (CMC) 1-immersions of a surface S (closed, orientable and of genus &gt;1) into hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Those immersions enter as "critical" object in our analysis. In fact, they can be attained only as limits of the (CMC) c-immersions (as c tends to 1), obtained in Huang-Lucia-Tarantello (2022), for |c|&lt;1. However, such passage to the limit can be prevented by possible blow-up phenomena, so that the pullback metrics of the (CMC) c-immersions may yield (at the limit) to a singular metric with conical singularities at finitely many points (the blow-up points). In case of genus g=2, blow up can occur only at a single point, and in Tarantello (2023) it was shown how it could be prevented and the passage to the limit ensured in terms of the Kodaira map. In this note we sharpen this result and for genus g=2, we obtaina condition (we believe sharp) which involves only the Kodaira map on the six Weierstrass points. In addition we tackle the case of higher genus, where multiple blow-up points occur. In this case, we need to identify a suitable replacement of the Kodaira map, now defined on the space of non-zero effective divisors. More importantly, we need to improve in a substantial way the asymptotic analysis of Tarantello (2023) limited to the case of "blow-up" with minimal mass. In this direction we give a contribution which best applies to the case of genus g=3, but also provides a relevant step and a convincing indication on what should happen in the general case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Fano manifold of dimension at least $2$ and $D$ be a smooth divisor in a multiple of the anticanonical class, $\frac1\alpha(-K_X)$ with $\alpha&gt;1$. It is well-known that K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on $X$ with conic singularities along $D$ may exist only if the angle $2\pi\beta$ is bigger than some positive limit value $2\pi\beta_*$. Under the hypothesis that the automorphisms of $D$ are induced by the automorphisms of the pair $(X,D)$, we prove that for $\beta&gt;\beta_*$ close enough to $\beta_*$, such K\"ahler-Einstein metrics do exist. We identify the limits at various scales when $\beta\rightarrow\beta_*$ and, in particular, we exhibit the appearance of the Tian-Yau metric of $X\setminus D$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given closed two-form, we introduce the cone Yang-Mills functional which is a Yang-Mills-type functional for a pair $(A,B)$, a connection one-form $A$ and a scalar $B$ taking value in the adjoint representation of a Lie group. The functional arises naturally from dimensionally reducing the Yang-Mills functional over the fiber of a circle bundle with the two-form being the Euler class. We write down the Euler-Lagrange equations of the functional and present some of the properties of its critical solutions, especially in comparison with Yang-Mills solutions. We show that a special class of three-dimensional solutions satisfy a duality condition which generalizes the Bogomolny monopole equations. Moreover, we analyze the zero solutions of the cone Yang-Mills functional and give an algebraic classification characterizing principal bundles that carry such cone-flat solutions when the two-form is non-degenerate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a flat extension of a connection $\theta$ on a principal bundle. Roughly speaking, $\theta$ admits a flat extension if it arises as the pull-back of a component of a Maurer-Cartan form. For trivial bundles over closed oriented $3$-manifolds, we relate the existence of certain flat extensions to the vanishing of the Chern-Simons invariant associated with $\theta$. As an application, we recover the obstruction of Chern-Simons for the existence of a conformal immersion of a Riemannian $3$-manifold into Euclidean $4$-space. In addition, we obtain corresponding statements for a Lorentzian $3$-manifold, as well as a global obstruction for the existence of an equiaffine immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$ of a $3$-manifold that is equipped with a torsion-free connection preserving a volume form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amply regular graphs are graphs with local distance-regularity constraints. In this paper, we prove a weaker version of a conjecture proposed by Qiao, Park, and Koolen on diameter bounds of amply regular graphs and make new progress on Terwilliger's conjecture on finiteness of amply regular graphs. Terwilliger's conjecture can be considered as a natural extension of the Bannai-Ito conjecture about distance-regular graphs confirmed by Bang, Dubickas, Koolen, and Moulton. As a consequence, we show that there are only finitely many amply regular graphs with parameters $(n,d,\alpha,\beta)$ satisfying $\alpha\leq 6\beta-9$. We achieve these results by a significantly improved Lin--Lu--Yau curvature estimate and new Bakry--\'Emery curvature estimates. We further discuss applications of our curvature estimates to bounding eigenvalues, isoperimetric constants, and expansion properties. In addition, we obtain a volume estimate, which is sharp for hypercubes.</description>

      <title>Constructing stable Hilbert bundles via Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On any complex smooth projective curve with positive genus, we construct Hilbert bundles that admit Hermitian--Einstein metrics. Our main constructive step is by investigating the arithmetic property of the upper half plane in Bridgeland's definition of stability conditions
  and its homological countparts. The main analytic ingredient in our proof is a notion called a well-approximating sequence of stable bundles. This notion helps us to apply the Diophantine approximation to Donaldson's functional and bound the $L^\infty$ norm of Hermitian-Einstein metrics. We further study the continuous structures, smooth structures, and holomorphic structures on such Hilbert bundles. We hope that this construction can shed some new light on the geometric background of quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>The Light ray transform for pseudo-Euclidean metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ray transform $L$ over null (light) rays in the pseudo-Euclidean space with signature $(n',n'')$, $n'\ge2$, $n''\ge2$. We analyze the normal operator $L'L$, derive an inversion formula, and prove stability estimates. We show that the symbol $p(\xi)$ is elliptic but singular at the light cone. We analyze $L$ as an Fourier Integral Operator as well. Finally, we compare this to the Minkowski case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition problem for an operator field in small dimensions. In dimensions three and four, we find tensorial conditions for an operator field $L$, similar to a nilpotent Jordan block, to possess local coordinates in which $L$ takes a strictly upper triangular form. We prove the Tempesta-Tondo conjecture for higher order brackets of Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis type.</description>

      <title>Orientation Scores should be a Piece of Cake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We axiomatically derive a family of wavelets for an orientation score, lifting from position space $\mathbb{R}^2$ to position and orientation space $\mathbb{R}^2\times S^1$, with fast reconstruction property, that minimise position-orientation uncertainty. We subsequently show that these minimum uncertainty states are well-approximated by cake wavelets: for standard parameters, the uncertainty gap of cake wavelets is less than 1.1, and in the limit, we prove the uncertainty gap tends to the minimum of 1. Next, we complete a previous theoretical argument that one does not have to train the lifting layer in (PDE-)G-CNNs, but can instead use cake wavelets. Finally, we show experimentally that in this way we can reduce the network complexity and improve the interpretability of (PDE-)G-CNNs, with only a slight impact on the model's performance.</description>

      <title>Behaviors of Gauss curvatures and mean curvatures of Lightcone framed surfaces in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the differential geometric properties of lightcone framed surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space. In general, a mixed type surface is a connected regular surface with non-empty spacelike and timelike point sets. While a lightcone framed surface is a mixed type surface with singular points at least locally. We introduce a useful tool, so called modified frame along the lightcone framed surface, to study the differential geometric properties of the lightcone framed surface. As results, we show the behaviors of the Gaussian curvature and mean curvature of the lightcone framed surface at not only lightlike points but also singular points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for computing an approximate Riemannian barycenter of a collection of points lying on a Riemannian manifold. Our approach relies on the use of theoretically proven under- and over-approximations of the Riemannian distance function. We compare it to Riemannian steepest descent on the exact objective function of the Riemannian barycenter and to an approach that approximates the Riemannian logarithm using lifting maps. Experiments are conducted on the Stiefel manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Bryant soliton is the unique asymptotically cylindrical steady gradient Ricci soliton, in any dimension $n \geq 3$ and without any curvature assumptions. This generalizes a celebrated theorem of Brendle. We also prove that any steady gradient Ricci soliton asymptotic to a cylinder over the homogeneous lens space $\mathbb{S}^{2m+1}/\mathbb{Z}_k = L_{m,k}$, for $m \geq 1$ and $k \geq 3$, is a noncollapsed Appleton soliton on the complex line bundle $O(-k)$ over $\mathbb{CP}^m$. Specializing to dimension 4, we classify steady gradient Ricci soliton singularity models on smooth orbifolds with tangent flows at infinity of the form $(SU(2)/\Gamma) \times \mathbb{R}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the branched $\alpha$-flows on closed surfaces with Euler characteristic \(\chi \leq 0\). Based on the strict convexity of the branched $\alpha$-potentials, we establish the long time existence and convergence of the solutions to the branched $\alpha$-flows, which generalizes Ge and Xu's main results \cite{2015,2015A} on the $\alpha$-flows. In addtion, we study the prescribed curvature problems under the relaxed precondition $\chi(M)\in \mathbb{Z}$ via alternative $\alpha$-flows, establishing admissibility conditions for prescribed curvatures and their exponential convergence to target metrics.</description>

Abstract: For each degree p and each natural number k $\ge$ 1, we construct a oneparameter family of Riemannian metrics on any oriented closed manifold with volume one and the sectional curvature bounded below such that the k-th positive eigenvalue of the Hodge-Laplacian acting on differential p-forms converges to zero. This result imposes a constraint on the sectional curvature for our previous result in [AT24].</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of prescribing Chern scalar curvatures on complete Hermitian manifolds. Firstly, we re-prove our recent result for prescribing sign-changing Chern scalar curvatures on compact Hermitian manifolds by using the classical maximum principle. Secondly, we study this problem on complete noncompact Hermitian manifolds, and generalize the Aviles-McOwen's existence results [J. Differential Geom., 21 (1985): 269-281] from Poincar\'e disks to higher dimensional Hermitian manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We prove Lojasiewicz inequalities for the harmonic map energy for maps from surfaces of positive genus into general analytic target manifolds which are close to simple bubble trees and as a consequence obtain new results on the convergence of harmonic map flow and on the energy spectrum of harmonic maps with small energy.
  Our results and techniques are not restricted to particular targets or to integrable settings and we are able to lift general Lojasiewicz-Simon inequalities valid near harmonic maps $\hat \omega:S^2\to N$ to the singular setting whenever the bubble $\hat \omega$ is attached at a point which is not a branch point.</description>

      <title>Field Theory via Higher Geometry I: Smooth Sets of Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most modern theoretical considerations of the physical world suggest that nature is: (1) field-theoretic, (2) smooth, (3) local, (4) gauged, (5) containing fermions, and (6) non-perturbative. Tautologous as this may sound to experts, it is remarkable that the mathematical notion of geometry which reflects all of these aspects - namely, ``supergeometric homotopy theory'' - has received little attention. Elaborate algebraic machinery is known for perturbative field theories both at the classical and quantum level, but to tackle the deep open questions of the subject, these will need to be lifted to a global geometry of physics.
  Our aim in this series is to introduce inclined physicists to this theory, to fill mathematical gaps in the existing literature, and to rigorously develop the full power of supergeometric homotopy theory and apply it to the analysis of fermionic (not necessarily super-symmetric) field theories. Secondarily, this will also lead to a streamlined and rigorous perspective we hope would also be desirable to mathematicians.
  In this first part, we explain how classical bosonic Lagrangian field theory (variational Euler-Lagrange theory) finds a natural home in the ``topos of smooth sets'', thereby neatly setting the scene for the higher supergeometry discussed in later parts of the series. This introductory material will be largely known to a few experts but has never been comprehensively laid out before. A key technical point we make is to regard jet bundle geometry systematically in smooth sets instead of just its subcategories of diffeological spaces or even Fr{\'e}chet manifolds -- or worse simply as a formal object. Besides being more transparent and powerful, it is only on this backdrop that a reasonable supergeometric jet geometry exists, needed for satisfactory discussion of any field theory with fermions.</description>

Abstract: We repeat, using methods developed for BKM systems, the famous results of S. Novikov (1974), J. Moser (1981, 1982) , and A. Veselov (1980) that relate Schr\"odinger-Hill operators with finite-band spectra, solutions of the Neumann system, and certain solutions of the KdV equations. Our general motivation is to determine whether it is possible to apply inverse scattering methods to BKM systems, and in the conclusion, we indicate initial observations in this direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Dirac-type operators on manifolds with boundary, and set out to determine all local smooth boundary conditions that give rise to (strongly) regular self-adjoint operators. By combining the general theory of boundary value problems for Dirac operators as in [BB12] and pointwise considerations, for local smooth boundary conditions the question of being self-adjoint resp. regular is fully translated into linear-algebraic language at each boundary point. We analyse these conditions and classify them in low dimensions and ranks. In particular, we classify all local self-adjoint regular boundary conditions for Dirac spinors (four spinor components) in dimensions $3$ and $4$. With the same techniques we can also treat transmission boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gromov's isoperimetric gap conjecture for Hadamard spaces states that cycles in dimensions greater than or equal to the asymptotic rank admit linear isoperimetric filling inequalities, as opposed to the inequalities of Euclidean type in lower dimensions. In the case of asymptotic rank 2, recent progress was made by Dru\c{t}u-Lang-Papasoglu-Stadler who established a homotopical inequality for Lipschitz 2-spheres with exponents arbitrarily close to 1. We prove a homological inequality of the same type for general cycles in dimensions at least 2, assuming that the ambient space has finite linearly controlled asymptotic dimension. This holds in particular for all Hadamard 3-manifolds and finite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that in any spacetime dimension and under the null energy condition, every totally geodesic connected smooth compact null hypersurface (hence every compact Cauchy horizon) admits a smooth lightlike tangent vector field of constant surface gravity. That is, we solve the open degenerate case by showing that, if there is a complete generator, then there exists a smooth future-directed geodesic lightlike tangent field. The result can be stated as an existence result for a particular cohomological equation. The proof uses elements of ergodic theory, Hodge theory and Riemannian flow theory. We emphasize that, remarkably, these results really require only the null energy condition, whereas previous works assumed, already in the Killing or the non-degenerate case, the stronger dominant energy condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on noncompact Riemannian manifolds in connection with nonnegative curvature and Euclidean volume growth assumptions. Assuming a nonnegative Ricci curvature lower bound, we show that almost extremal functions are close in gradient norm to radial Euclidean bubbles. In the case of nonnegative sectional curvature lower bounds, we additionally deduce that vanishing is the only possible behavior, in the sense that almost extremal functions are almost zero globally. Our arguments rely on nonsmooth concentration compactness methods and Mosco-convergence results for the Cheeger energy on noncompact varying spaces, generalized to every exponent $p\in (1,\infty)$.</description>
