      <title>NeuralODEs for VLEO simulations: Introducing thermoNET for Thermosphere Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neural architecture termed thermoNET, designed to represent thermospheric density in satellite orbital propagation using a reduced amount of differentiable computations. Due to the appearance of a neural network on the right-hand side of the equations of motion, the resulting satellite dynamics is governed by a NeuralODE, a neural Ordinary Differential Equation, characterized by its fully differentiable nature, allowing the derivation of variational equations (hence of the state transition matrix) and facilitating its use in connection to advanced numerical techniques such as Taylor-based numerical propagation and differential algebraic techniques. Efficient training of the network parameters occurs through two distinct approaches. In the first approach, the network undergoes training independently of spacecraft dynamics, engaging in a pure regression task against ground truth models, including JB-08 and NRLMSISE-00. In the second paradigm, network parameters are learned based on observed dynamics, adapting through ODE sensitivities. In both cases, the outcome is a flexible, compact model of the thermosphere density greatly enhancing numerical propagation efficiency while maintaining accuracy in the orbital predictions.</description>

      <title>Paths to Robust Exoplanet Science Yield Margin for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will seek to detect and characterize potentially Earth-like planets around other stars. To ensure that the mission achieves the Astro2020 Decadal's recommended goal of 25 exoEarth candidates (EECs), we must take into account the probabilistic nature of exoplanet detections and provide "science margin" to budget for astrophysical uncertainties with a reasonable level of confidence. In this study, we explore the probabilistic distributions of yields to be expected from a blind exoEarth survey conducted by such a mission. We identify and estimate the impact of all major known sources of astrophysical uncertainty on the exoEarth candidate yield. As expected, eta_Earth uncertainties dominate the uncertainty in EEC yield, but we show that sampling uncertainties inherent to a blind survey are another important source of uncertainty that should be budgeted for during mission design. We adopt the Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor Design B (LUVOIR-B) as a baseline and modify the telescope diameter to estimate the science margin provided by a larger telescope. We then depart from the LUVOIR-B baseline design and identify six possible design changes that, when compiled, provide large gains in exoEarth candidate yield and more than an order of magnitude reduction in exposure times for the highest priority targets. We conclude that a combination of telescope diameter increase and design improvements could provide robust exoplanet science margins for HWO.</description>

      <title>Significant mutual inclinations between the stellar spin and the orbits of both planets in the HAT-P-11 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet-star and planet-planet obliquity encode a planetary system's dynamical history, but both obliquities are hard to measure for misaligned systems with close-in companions. HAT-P-11 is a K4 star with two known planets: a close-in, misaligned super-Neptune with a approx 5-day orbit, and an outer super-Jupiter with a approx 10-year orbit. In this work we present a joint orbit fit of HAT-P-11 system with astrometry and RV data.
  By combining our results with previous constraints on the orientation of the star and the inner planet, we find that all three angular momenta -- those of the star, planet b, and planet c -- are significantly misaligned. We confirm the status of planet c as a super-Jupiter, with 3.06 pm 0.42 Jupiter mass, at a semimajor axis of 4.192 pm 0.07 AU, and planet b's minimum mass of 0.073 pm 0.0053 Jupiter mass. We present the posterior probability distribution of obliquity between star A and planet c, and between planet b and planet c.</description>

      <title>Planet-Planet Scattering and ZLK Migration -- The Dynamical History of HAT-P-11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two planets of the HAT-P-11 system represent fascinating dynamical puzzles due to their significant eccentricities and orbital misalignments. In particular, HAT-P-11 b is on a close-in orbit that tides should have circularized well within the age of the system. Here we propose a two-step dynamical process that can reproduce all intriguing aspects of the system. We first invoke planet-planet scattering to generate significant eccentricities and mutual inclinations between the planets. We then propose that this misalignment initiated von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles and high-eccentricity migration that ultimately brought HAT-P-11 b to its present-day orbit. We find that this scenario is fully consistent only when significant tidally-driven radius inflation is accounted for during the tidal migration. We present a suite of N-body simulations exploring each phase of evolution and show that this scenario is consistent with all observational posteriors and the reported age of the system.</description>

      <title>On Kinematic Measurements of Self-Gravity in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using controlled injection and recovery experiments, we devised an analysis prescription to assess the quality of dynamical measurements of protoplanetary disk gas masses based on resolved (CO) spectral line data, given observational limitations (resolution, sampling, noise), measurement bias, and ambiguities in the geometry and physical conditions. With sufficient data quality, this approach performed well for massive disks ($M_{\rm d}/M_\ast=0.1$): we inferred $M_{\rm d}$ posteriors that recovered the true values with little bias ($\lesssim$ 20%) and uncertainties within a factor of two (2$\sigma$). The gas surface density profiles for such cases are recovered with remarkable fidelity. Some experimentation indicates that this approach becomes insensitive when $M_{\rm d}/M_\ast\lesssim5$%, due primarily to degeneracies in the surface density profile parameters. Including multiple lines that probe different vertical layers, along with some improvements in the associated tools, might push that practical boundary down by another factor of $\sim$two in ideal scenarios. We also demonstrated this analysis approach using archival ALMA observations of the MWC 480 disk (\"Oberg et al. 2021): we measured $M_{\rm d}=0.13^{\: +0.04}_{\: -0.01} \: M_\odot$ (corresponding to $M_{\rm d}/M_\ast=7\pm1$%) and identified kinematic substructures consistent with surface density gaps around 65 and 135 au. Overall, this (and similar work) suggests that these dynamical measurements offer powerful new constraints with sufficient accuracy and precision to quantify gas masses and surface densities at the high end of the $M_{\rm d}/M_\ast$ distribution, and therefore can serve as key benchmarks for detailed thermo-chemical modeling. We address some prospects for improvements, and discuss various caveats and limitations to guide future work.</description>

      <title>LBT SHARK-VIS Observes a Major Resurfacing Event on Io</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since volcanic activity was first discovered on Io from Voyager images in 1979, changes on Io's surface have been monitored from both spacecraft and ground-based telescopes. Here, we present the highest spatial resolution images of Io ever obtained from a ground-based telescope. These images, acquired by the SHARK-VIS instrument on the Large Binocular Telescope, show evidence of a major resurfacing event on Io's trailing hemisphere. When compared to the most recent spacecraft images, the SHARK-VIS images show that a plume deposit from a powerful eruption at Pillan Patera has covered part of the long-lived Pele plume deposit. Although this type of resurfacing event may be common on Io, few have been detected due to the rarity of spacecraft visits and the previously low spatial resolution available from Earth-based telescopes. The SHARK-VIS instrument ushers in a new era of high resolution imaging of Io's surface using adaptive optics at visible wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Exoplanet Ephemerides by Leveraging Professional and Citizen Science Data: A Test Case with WASP-77A b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated ephemeris and physical parameters for the exoplanet WASP-77 A b. In this effort, we combine 64 ground- and space-based transit observations, 6 space-based eclipse observations, and 32 radial velocity observations to produce the most precise orbital solution to date for this target, aiding in the planning of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel observations and atmospheric studies. We report a new orbital period of 1.360029395 +- 5.7e-8 days, a new mid-transit time of 2459957.337860 +- 4.3e-5 BJDTDB (Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time scale; arXiv:1005.4415) and a new mid-eclipse time of 2459956.658192 +- 6.7e-5 BJDTDB. Furthermore, the methods presented in this study reduce the uncertainties in the planet mass to 1.6654 +- 4.5e-3 Mjup and orbital period to 1.360029395 +- 5.7e-8 days by factors of 15.1 and 10.9, respectively. Through a joint fit analysis comparison of transit data taken by space-based and citizen science-led initiatives, our study demonstrates the power of including data collected by citizen scientists compared to a fit of the space-based data alone. Additionally, by including a vast array of citizen science data from ExoClock, Exoplanet Transit Database (ETD), and Exoplanet Watch, we can increase our observational baseline and thus acquire better constraints on the forward propagation of our ephemeris than what is achievable with TESS data alone.</description>

      <title>Recipes for forming a carbon-rich giant planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of carbon-to-oxygen ratios has yielded intriguing insights into the composition of close-in giant exoplanets, giving rise to a distinct classification: carbon-rich planets, characterized by a carbon-to-oxygen ratio $\ge$ 1 in their atmospheres, as opposed to giant planets exhibiting carbon-to-oxygen ratios close to the protosolar value. In contrast, despite numerous space missions dispatched to the outer solar system and the proximity of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, our understanding of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio in these giants remains notably deficient. Determining this ratio is crucial as it serves as a marker linking a planet's volatile composition directly to its formation region within the disk. This article provides an overview of the current understanding of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio in the four gas giants of our solar system and explores why there is yet no definitive dismissal of the possibility that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune could be considered carbon-rich planets. Additionally, we delve into the three primary formation scenarios proposed in existing literature to account for a bulk carbon-to-oxygen ratio $\ge$ 1 in a giant planet. A significant challenge lies in accurately inferring the bulk carbon-to-oxygen ratio of our solar system's gas giants. Retrieval methods involve integrating in situ measurements from entry probes equipped with mass spectrometers and remote sensing observations conducted at microwave wavelengths by orbiters. However, these methods fall short of fully discerning the deep carbon-to-oxygen abundance in the gas giants due to their limited probing depth, typically within the 10-100 bar range.</description>

      <title>Macro-scale roughness reveals the complex history of asteroids Didymos and Dimorphos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphological mapping is a fundamental step in studying the processes that shaped an asteroid surface. Yet, it is challenging and often requires multiple independent assessments by trained experts. Here, we present fast methods to detect and characterize meaningful terrains from the topographic roughness: entropy of information, and local mean surface orientation. We apply our techniques to Didymos and Dimorphos, the target asteroids of NASA's DART mission: first attempt to deflect an asteroid. Our methods reliably identify morphological units at multiple scales. The comparative study reveals various terrain types, signatures of processes that transformed Didymos and Dimorphos. Didymos shows the most heterogeneity and morphology that indicate recent resurfacing events. Dimorphos is comparatively rougher than Didymos, which may result from the formation process of the binary pair and past interaction between the two bodies. Our methods can be readily applied to other bodies and data sets.</description>

      <title>Growth of the Moon due to bodies ejected from the Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the orbits of bodies ejected from the Earth has been studied at the stage of its accumulation and early evolution after impacts of large planetesimals. In the considered variants of calculations of the motion of bodies ejected from the Earth, most of the bodies left the Hill sphere of the Earth and moved in heliocentric orbits. Their dynamical lifetime reached several hundred million years. At higher ejection velocities vej the probabilities of collisions of bodies with the Earth and Moon were generally lower. Over the entire considered time interval at the ejection velocity vej, equal to 11.5, 12 and 14 km/s, the values of the probability of a collision of a body with the Earth were approximately 0.3, 0.2 and 0.15-0.2, respectively. At ejection velocities vej&lt;11.25 km/s, i.e., slightly exceeding a parabolic velocity, most of the ejected bodies fell back to the Earth. The probability of a collision of a body ejected from the Earth with the Moon moving in its present orbit was approximately 15-35 times less than that with the Earth at vej&gt;11.5 km/s. The probability of a collision of such bodies with the Moon was mainly about 0.004-0.008 at ejection velocities of at least 14 km/s and about 0.006-0.01 at vej=12 km/s. It was larger at lower ejection velocities and was in the range of 0.01-0.02 at vej=11.3 km/s. The Moon may contain material ejected from the Earth during the accumulation of the Earth and during the late heavy bombardment. At the same time, as obtained in our calculations, the bodies ejected from the Earth and falling on the Moon embryo would not be enough for the Moon to grow to its present mass from a small embryo moving along the present orbit of the Moon. This result argues in favor of the formation of a lunar embryo and its further growth to most of the present mass of the Moon near the Earth.</description>

      <title>SMA 200-400 GHz Survey for Dust Properties in the Icy Class II Disks in the Taurus Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new SMA survey of 47 Class II sources in the Taurus-Auriga region. Our observations made 12 independent samples of flux densities over the 200-400 GHz frequency range. We tightly constrained the spectral indices of most sources to a narrow range of $2.0\pm0.2$; only a handful of spatially resolved (e.g., diameter $&gt;$250 au) disks present larger spectral indices. The simplest interpretation for this result is that the (sub)millimeter luminosities of all of the observed target sources are dominated by very optically thick (e.g., $\tau\gtrsim$5) dust thermal emission. Some previous works that were based on the optically thin assumption thus might have underestimated optical depths by at least one order of magnitude. Assuming DSHARP dust opacities, this corresponds to underestimates of dust masses by a similar factor. Moreover, some population synthesis models show that to explain the observed, narrowly distributed spectral indices, the disks in our selected sample need to have very similar dust temperatures ($T_{\small{dust}}$). Given a specific assumption of median $T_{\small{dust}}$, the maximum grain sizes ($a_{\small{max}}$) can also be constrained, which is a few times smaller than 0.1 mm for $T_{\small{dust}}\sim$100 K and a few mm for $T_{\small{dust}}\sim$24 K. The results may indicate that dust grain growth outside the water snowline is limited by the bouncing/fragmentation barriers. In the Class II disks, the dust mass budget outside of the water snowline may be largely retained instead of being mostly consumed by planet formation. While Class II disks still possess sufficient dust masses to feed planet formation at a later time, it is unknown whether or not dust coagulation and planet formation can be efficient or natural outside of the water snowline.</description>

      <title>Comet 81/P Wild 2: changes in the spin axis orientation during the last five apparitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comet 81P (Wild 2) is characterized by the presence of a prominent-fan shaped dust emission originating from an active source at high latitude on the nucleus, whose axis is assumed to coincide with the comet's rotation axis. Therefore, several authors estimated the spin axis orientation of 81P in past apparitions based on the polar jet model. By measuring the PAs of the fan on CCD images taken with different telescopes during the 2009-10 and 2022-23 apparitions, we estimated a position of the comet's spin axis at RA=295.0{\deg}$\pm$ 7.5{\deg}, Dec=14.5{\deg}$\pm$ 4.0{\deg} for the 2009-10 apparition and at RA=296.7{\deg}$\pm$ 2.0{\deg}, Dec=17.3{\deg}$\pm$ 2.5{\deg} for the 2022-23 apparition. Despite some degree of uncertainty of the estimate for the 2009-10 apparition, we interpolated the estimate for 2009-10 and 2022-23 with the published data of the previous apparition of 1997, to assess the presence and the extent of a drift of the pole since the 1997 passage. The analysis over a long time span of five consecutive apparitions confirms previous observations that the spin axis of comet 81P is subject to a slow drift with variable rate, probably connected to outgassing-induced jet forces and the related non-gravitational perturbations of its orbital period.</description>

      <title>A Larger Sample Confirms Small Planets Around Hot Stars Are Misaligned</title>

Abstract: The distribution of stellar obliquities provides critical insight into the formation and evolution pathways of exoplanets. In the past decade, it was found that hot stars hosting hot Jupiters are more likely to have high obliquities than cool stars, but it is not clear whether this trend exists only for hot Jupiters or holds for other types of planets. In this work, we extend the study of the obliquities of hot (6250-7000\,K) stars with transiting super-Earth and sub-Neptune-sized planets. We constrain the obliquity distribution based on measurements of the stars' projected rotation velocities. Our sample consists of 170 TESS and \textit{Kepler} planet-hosting stars and 180 control stars chosen to have indistinguishable spectroscopic characteristics. In our analysis, we find evidence suggesting that the planet hosts have a systematically higher $\langle \sin i \rangle$ compared to the control sample. This result implies that the planet hosts tend to have lower obliquities. However, the observed difference in $\langle \sin i \rangle$ is not significant enough to confirm spin-orbit alignment, as it is 3.8$\sigma$ away from perfect alignment. We also find evidence that within the planet-hosting stars there is a trend of higher obliquity (lower $\langle \sin i\rangle$) for the hotter stars ($\teff &gt; 6250$ K) than for the cooler stars in the sample. This suggests that hot stars hosting smaller planets exhibit a broader obliquity distribution($\langle \sin i\rangle = 0.79 \pm 0.053$) than cooler planet-hosting stars, indicating that high obliquities are not exclusive to hot Jupiters and instead are more broadly tied to hot stars.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of meteor surveying from a Venus orbiter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meteor and bolide phenomena caused by the atmospheric ablation of incoming meteoroids are predicted to occur at the planet Venus. Their systematic observation would allow to measure and compare the sub-mm to m meteoroid flux at different locations in the solar system. Using a physical model of atmospheric ablation, we demonstrate that Venus meteors would be brighter, shorter-lived, and appear higher in the atmosphere than Earth meteors. To investigate the feasibility of meteor detection at Venus from an orbiter, we apply the SWARMS survey simulator tool to sets of plausible meteoroid population parameters, atmospheric models and instrument designs suited to the task, such as the Mini-EUSO camera operational on the ISS since 2019. We find that such instrumentation would detect meteors at Venus with a 1.5x to 2.5x higher rate than at Earth. The estimated Venus-Earth detection ratio remains insensitive to variations in the chosen observation orbit and detector characteristics, implying that a meteor survey from Venus orbit is feasible, though contingent on the availability of suitable algorithms and methods for efficient on-board processing and downlinking of the meteor data to Earth. We further show that a hypothetical camera onboard the upcoming EnVision mission to Venus similar to the ISS instrument should detect many times more meteors than needed for an initial characterisation of the large meteoroid population at 0.7 au from the Sun.</description>

      <title>HIP 41378 observed by CHEOPS: Where is planet d?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HIP 41378 d is a long-period planet that has only been observed to transit twice, three years apart, with K2. According to stability considerations and a partial detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, $P_\mathrm{d} = 278.36$ d has been determined to be the most likely orbital period. We targeted HIP 41378 d with CHEOPS at the predicted transit timing based on $P_\mathrm{d}= 278.36$ d, but the observations show no transit. We find that large ($&gt;22.4$ hours) transit timing variations (TTVs) could explain this non-detection during the CHEOPS observation window. We also investigated the possibility of an incorrect orbital solution, which would have major implications for our knowledge of this system. If $P_\mathrm{d} \neq 278.36$ d, the periods that minimize the eccentricity would be $101.22$ d and $371.14$ d. The shortest orbital period will be tested by TESS, which will observe HIP 41378 in Sector 88 starting in January 2025. Our study shows the importance of a mission like CHEOPS, which today is the only mission able to make long observations (i.e., from space) to track the ephemeris of long-period planets possibly affected by large TTVs.</description>

      <title>Lethal surface ozone concentrations are possible on habitable zone exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ozone ($\textrm{O}_3$) is important for the survival of life on Earth because it shields the surface from ionising ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, the existence of $\textrm{O}_3$ in Earth's atmosphere is not always beneficial. Resulting from anthropogenic activity, $\textrm{O}_3$ exists as a biologically harmful pollutant at the surface when it forms in the presence of sunlight and other pollutants. As a strong oxidiser, $\textrm{O}_3$ can be lethal to several different organisms; thus, when assessing the potential habitability of an exoplanet, a key part is determining whether toxic gases could be present at its surface. Using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 6 (WACCM6; a three-dimensional chemistry-climate model), twelve atmospheric simulations of the terrestrial exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 e are performed with a variety of $\textrm{O}_2$ concentrations and assuming two different stellar spectra proposed in the literature. Four atmospheric simulations of the exoplanet Proxima Centauri b are also included. Some scenarios for both exoplanets exhibit time-averaged surface $\textrm{O}_3$ mixing ratios exceeding harmful levels of 40 ppbv, with 2200 ppbv the maximum concentration found in the cases simulated. These concentrations are toxic and can be fatal to most life on Earth. In other scenarios $\textrm{O}_3$ remains under harmful limits over a significant fraction of the surface, despite there being present regions which may prove inhospitable. In the case that $\textrm{O}_3$ is detected in a terrestrial exoplanet's atmosphere, determining the surface concentration is an important step when evaluating a planet's habitability.</description>

      <title>The Solar System Notification Alert Processing System (SNAPS): Asteroid Population Outlier Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar System Notification Alert Processing System (SNAPS) is a ZTF and Rubin Observatory alert broker that will send alerts to the community regarding interesting events in the Solar System. SNAPS is actively monitoring Solar System objects and one of its functions is to compare objects (primarily main belt asteroids) to one another to find those that are outliers relative to the population. In this paper, we use the SNAPShot1 dataset which contains 31,693 objects from ZTF and derive outlier scores for each of these objects. SNAPS employs an unsupervised approach; consequently, to derive outlier rankings for each object, we propose four different outlier metrics such that we can explore variants of outlier scores and add confidence to outlier rankings. We also provide outlier scores for each object in each permutation of 15 feature spaces, between 2 and 15 features, which yields 32,752 total feature spaces. We show that we can derive population outlier rankings each month at Rubin Observatory scale using four Nvidia A100 GPUs, and present several avenues of scientific investigation that can be explored using population outlier detection.</description>

      <title>The key science drivers for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-mm and mm wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities: Where are all the baryons? How do structures interact with their environments? What does the time-varying (sub-)mm sky look like? In order to make major advances on these questions and others, what is needed now is a facility capable of rapidly mapping the sky spatially, spectrally, and temporally, which can only be done by a high throughput, single-dish observatory. An extensive design study for this new facility is currently being undertaken. In this paper, we focus on the key science drivers and the requirements they place on the observatory. As a 50m single dish telescope with a 1-2{\deg} field of view, the strength of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) is in science where a large field of view, highly multiplexed instrumentation and sensitivity to faint large-scale structure is important. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned telescopes.</description>

      <title>An Expanding Accretion Disk and a Warm Disk Wind As Seen In the Spectral Evolution of HBC 722</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the post-outburst evolution of the FU Ori object HBC 722 in optical/near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy. Using a modified viscous accretion disk model, we fit the outburst epoch SED to determine the physical parameters of the disk, including $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} = 10^{-4.0} \ M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, $R_\mathrm{inner} = 3.65 \ R_\odot$, $i = 79^\circ$, and a maximum disk temperature of $T_\mathrm{max} = 5700$ K. We then use a decade of optical/NIR spectra to demonstrate a changing accretion rate drives the visible-range photometric variation, while the NIR shows the outer radius of the active accretion disk expands outward as the outburst progresses. We also identify the major components of the disk system: a plane-parallel disk atmosphere in Keplerian rotation and a 2-part warm disk wind that is collimated near the star and wide-angle at larger radii. The wind is traced by classic wind lines, and appears as a narrow, low-velocity, deep absorption component in several atomic lines spanning the visible spectrum and in the CO 2.29$\mu$m band. We compare the wind lines to those computed from wind models for other FU Ori systems and rapidly accreting young stellar disks and find a 4000-6000 K wind can explain the observed line profiles. Fitting the progenitor spectrum, we find $M_* = 0.2 \ M_\odot$ and $\dot{M}_\mathrm{progenitor} = 7.8 \times 10^{-8} \ M_\odot \ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Finally, we discuss HBC 722 relative to V960 Mon, another FU Ori object we have previously studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Gaia22dkvLb: A Microlensing Planet Potentially Accessible to Radial-Velocity Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report discovering an exoplanet from following up a microlensing event alerted by Gaia. The event Gaia22dkv is toward a disk source rather than the traditional bulge microlensing fields. Our primary analysis yields a Jovian planet with M_p = 0.59^{+0.15}_{-0.05} M_J at a projected orbital separation r_perp = 1.4^{+0.8}_{-0.3} AU, and the host is a ~1.1 M_sun turnoff star at ~1.3 kpc. At r'~14, the host is far brighter than any previously discovered microlensing planet host, opening up the opportunity of testing the microlensing model with radial velocity (RV) observations. RV data can be used to measure the planet's orbital period and eccentricity, and they also enable searching for inner planets of the microlensing cold Jupiter, as expected from the ''inner-outer correlation'' inferred from Kepler and RV discoveries. Furthermore, we show that Gaia astrometric microlensing will not only allow precise measurements of its angular Einstein radius theta_E, but also directly measure the microlens parallax vector and unambiguously break a geometric light-curve degeneracy, leading to definitive characterization of the lens system.</description>

Abstract: Hera represents the European Space Agency's inaugural planetary defense space mission and plays a pivotal role in the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment international collaboration with NASA DART mission that performed the first asteroid deflection experiment using the kinetic impactor techniques. With the primary objective of conducting a detailed post-impact survey of the Didymos binary asteroid following the DART impact on its small moon called Dimorphos, Hera aims to comprehensively assess and characterize the feasibility of the kinetic impactor technique in asteroid deflection while conducting an in-depth investigation of the asteroid binary, including its physical and compositional properties as well as the effect of the impact on the surface and shape of Dimorphos. In this work, we describe the Hera radio science experiment, which will allow us to precisely estimate critical parameters, including the mass, which is required to determine the momentum enhancement resulting from the DART impact, mass distribution, rotational states, relative orbits, and dynamics of the asteroids Didymos and Dimorphos. Through a multi-arc covariance analysis, we present the achievable accuracy for these parameters, which consider the full expected asteroid phase and are based on ground radiometric, Hera optical images, and Hera to CubeSats InterSatellite Link radiometric measurements. The expected formal uncertainties for Didymos and Dimorphos GM are better than 0.01% and 0.1%, respectively, while their J2 formal uncertainties are better than 0.1% and 10%, respectively.

      <title>Fleeting but not Forgotten: the Imprint of Escaping Hydrogen Atmospheres on Super-Earth Interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small, close-in exoplanets are divided into two sub-populations: super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. Most super-Earths are thought to have lost their primordially accreted hydrogen-dominated atmospheres via thermally driven winds. We consider the global chemical equilibrium of super-Earths and the lasting impacts of their fleeting hydrogen atmospheres. We find that hydrogen is efficiently sequestered into the interior, oxidising iron and endogenously producing $\sim0.5-1.0\%$ water by mass. As the atmospheres of super-Earths are continuously sculpted by mass loss and chemical equilibration, they remain hydrogen-dominated by mole (number) fraction but become steam-dominated by mass, which may be observable with JWST for planets transitioning across the radius valley. One of the main effects of efficient sequestration of hydrogen into the interior is to produce an under-dense bulk interior compared to that of Earth. We predict bulk densities of super-Earths to be $\sim 5.0 \text{ g cm}^{-3}$ for a $1M_\oplus$ planet, which is consistent with high-precision mass measurements and also population-level inference analyses from atmospheric escape models.</description>
