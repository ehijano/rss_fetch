      <title>Direct Measurements of Synchrotron-Emitting Electrons at Near-Sun Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present the first-ever direct measurements of synchrotron-emitting heliospheric traveling shocks, intercepted by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during its close encounters. Given that much of our understanding of powerful astrophysical shocks is derived from synchrotron radiation, these observations by PSP provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore how shocks accelerate relativistic electrons and the conditions under which they emit radiation. The probe's unparalleled capabilities to measure both electromagnetic fields and energetic particles with high precision in the near-Sun environment has allowed us to directly correlate the distribution of relativistic electrons with the resulting photon emissions. Our findings reveal that strong quasi-parallel shocks emit radiation at significantly higher intensities than quasi-perpendicular shocks due to the efficient acceleration of ultra-relativistic electrons. These experimental results are consistent with theory and recent observations of supernova remnant shocks and advance our understanding of shock physics across diverse space environments.</description>

      <title>Interaction of the Prominence Plasma within the Magnetic Cloud of an ICME with the Earth's Bow Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic cloud within an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) is characterized by high magnetic field intensities. In this study, we investigate the interaction of a magnetic cloud carrying a density structure with the Earth's bow shock during ICME event on 24 April 2023. Elevated abundances of cold protons and heavier ions, namely alpha particles, and singly charged helium ions associated with the prominence plasma are observed within this structure. The plasma downstream of the bow shock exhibits an irregular compression pattern which could be due to the presence of heavy ions. Heavy ions carry a significant fraction of upstream flow energy, however, due to their different charge per mass ratio and rigidity, they are less scattered by the electromagnetic and electrostatic waves at the shock. We find that ions thermal energy is only a small fraction of the background magnetic energy density downstream of the shock. While increased ion fluxes reduce the characteristic wave speeds in the that region. As such, we observe a transition state of an unstable bow shock in which the plasma flow is super Alfv\'enic both upstream and downstream of the bow shock. Our findings help with understanding of the intense space weather impacts of such events.</description>

      <title>Loss of 12 Starlink Satellites Due to Pre-conditioning of Intense Space Weather Activity Surrounding the Extreme Geomagnetic Storm of 10 May 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the orbital decay and subsequent reentries of 12 Starlink satellites from 16 April to 15 May 2024. By examining Two-Line Element data, we observed a significant increase in orbital decay following the geomagnetic storm on 10 May 2024, consistent with expectations of increased thermospheric density. An unexpected increase in decay rates for 10 satellites was identified around 25 April 2024, while two lower-altitude satellites remained unaffected. Detailed analysis revealed that this enhanced decay rate prior to the storm was influenced by a spike in the O/N2 ratio and an increase in Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) flux. Moreover, most of the satellites exhibited sharp decay during the early recovery phase of the geomagnetic storm. Based on the positions and local times of changes in decay rates, it is likely that the satellites were affected by various processes during elevated space weather activity, such as enhanced EUV flux, Joule heating, particle precipitation, and the equatorial neutral anomaly. This study highlights the complex role of preconditioning due to enhanced EUV flux and extreme space weather activity in the orbital dynamics of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites.</description>

      <title>Origin of 3He abundance enhancements in gradual solar energetic particle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examined the origin of 3He abundance enhancement in 23 high-energy (25-50 MeV) solar proton events that coincide with 3He-rich periods detected by ACE ULEIS in 1997-2021. In seven events, 3He enhancement was due to 3He leftover from preceding events or independent 3He events occurring during proton events. One event is the most likely impulsive (3He-rich), and another is unclear. Reaccelerated remnant flare material was the most probable cause of 3He enhancements in the remaining 14 proton events. Imaging observations showed coronal jets in the parent active regions in six of these 14 events. Remarkably, the highest 3He/4He occurred in events with jets, implying their contribution to 3He enhancement.</description>

      <title>Some generalizations of the convective model of jet generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For analytical description of the initial stage of jet generation in nonequilibrium inhomogeneous plasma in the magnetohydrodynamic approximation, possible generalizations of solutions of the nonlinear equation for the stream function are analyzed. The jet generation model is based on the mechanism of convective instability and the frozen-in condition of magnetic field lines and is characterized by a number of free parameters. The equation for the radial part of the stream function is satisfied by first-order Bessel functions. To satisfy all the conditions near the jet axis and on its periphery, the found solutions are smoothly joined at the boundary. The final analytical solution for the velocity field is applicable to arbitrary values of dimensionless coordinates. The poloidal velocity increases approximately exponentially, and the azimuthal velocity - according to a superexponential law. In this paper, the velocity field of the jet, which consists of seven sections, is calculated. The rotation of the jet turns out to be differential, and to obtain a solution in quadratures for the azimuthal velocity, one can use not only linear but also power dependences on the altitude. For the exponent n &lt; 1, a noticeable increase in the azimuthal velocity with radius is observed immediately from the jet axis, and for n &gt; 1, a region of relative calm is observed near the axis. The jet model is generalized to the case of an arbitrary dependence of the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency on the altitude. The corresponding solutions are found for the radial and vertical velocity components. For the initial stage of development, the vertical and azimuthal components of the generated magnetic field of the jet were also found in the work.</description>

      <title>In-situ observations of the three-dimensional energy cascade rate and Yaglom flux in the Earth's magnetosheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the energy cascade rate in space plasmas is a challenging task for several reasons. This quantity is (i) inherently three-dimensional (ii) scale-dependent, (iii) anisotropic in the interplanetary plasma, and (iv) requires measurements of plasma parameters in at least four points. Here, we show how three of such problems have been addressed by applying the novel Lag Polyhedra Derivative Ensemble (LPDE) technique to the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission in the Earth's magnetosheath.</description>
