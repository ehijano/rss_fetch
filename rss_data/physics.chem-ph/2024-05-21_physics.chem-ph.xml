      <title>Quantum delocalization, structural order, and density response of the strongly coupled electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of electronic correlations and quantum delocalization onto the static structure factor and static density response function of the strongly coupled electron liquid. In contrast to a classical system, the density response of the electron liquid vanishes on small length scales due to quantum delocalization effects, which we rigorously quantify in terms of imaginary-time correlation functions and dynamic Matsubara response functions. This allows us to analyze the interplay of structural order and dynamic quantum effects as it manifests in the dynamic Matsubara local field correction. Finally, we identify an effective electronic attraction in the spin-offdiagonal static density response when the wavelength of the perturbation is commensurate with the average interparticle distance.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Multi-configurational methods in bio-inorganic chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal ions play crucial roles in the structure and function of numerous proteins, contributing to essential biological processes such as catalysis, electron transfer, and oxygen binding. However, accurately modeling the electronic structure and properties of metalloproteins poses significant challenges due to the complex nature of their electronic configurations and strong correlation effects. Multiconfigurational quantum chemistry methods are, in principle, the most appropriate tools for addressing these challenges, offering the capability to capture the inherent multi-reference character and strong electron correlation present in bio-inorganic systems. Yet their computational cost has long hindered wider adoption, making methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) the method of choice. However, advancements over the past decade have substantially alleviated this limitation, rendering multiconfigurational quantum chemistry methods more accessible and applicable to a wider range of bio-inorganic systems. In this perspective, we discuss some of these developments and how they have already been used to answer some of the most important questions in bio-inorganic chemistry. We also comment on ongoing developments in the field and how the future of the field may evolve.</description>

      <title>Shortcut to Chemically Accurate Quantum Computing via Density-based Basis-set Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises a computational advantage over classical methods in electronic-structure calculations, with expected applications in drug design and materials science. Accessing a quantitative description of chemical systems while minimizing quantum resources, such as the number of qubits, is an essential challenge given the limited capabilities of current quantum processors. We provide a shortcut towards quantum computations at chemical accuracy by approaching the complete-basis-set limit (CBS) through integrating density-functional theory into quantum algorithms via density-based basis-set corrections coupled to basis-sets crafted on-the-fly and specifically adapted to a given system/user-defined qubit budget. The approach self-consistently accelerates the basis-set convergence, improving electronic densities, ground-state energies, and first-order properties such as dipole moments. It can also serve as a classical, \textit{a posteriori}, energy correction to quantum hardware calculations. The strategy is assessed using GPU-accelerated state-vector emulation up to 32 qubits. We converge the ground-state energies of four systems (He, Be, H$_2$, LiH) within chemical accuracy of the CBS full-configuration-interaction reference, while offering a systematic increase of accuracy beyond a double-zeta quality for various molecules up to the H$_8$ hydrogen chain. We also obtain dissociation curves for H$_2$ and LiH that reach the CBS limit whereas for the challenging simulation of the N$_2$ triple-bond breaking, we achieve a near-triple-zeta quality at the cost of a minimal basis-set. This hybrid strategy allows us to obtain quantitative results that would otherwise require brute-force quantum simulations using far more than 100 logical qubits, thereby opening up opportunities to explore real-world chemistry with reasonable computational resources.</description>

      <title>Ab initio intermolecular interactions mediate thermochemically real-fluid effects that affect system reactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of supercritical fluids are dictated by intermolecular interactions that involve two or more molecules. Such intermolecular interactions were described via intermolecular potentials in historical supercritical combustion modeling studies, but have been treated empirically and with no consideration of radical interactions or multi-body interactions involving more than two molecules. This approach has been adopted long ago, assuming sufficient characterization of real-fluid effects during supercritical combustion. Here, with data from ab initio multi-body intermolecular potentials, non-empirical Virial Equation of State (EoS), and real-fluid thermochemical and kinetic simulations, we reveal that empirical intermolecular potentials can lead to significant errors in representing supercritical fluids under common combustion situations, which can be impressively described by ab initio intermolecular potentials. These interactions are also found to greatly influence autoignition delay times, a common measure of global reactivity, with significant contributions from radical interactions and multi-body interactions. It is therefore of necessity to incorporate ab initio intermolecular interactions in studying supercritical combustion and various dynamic systems involving supercritical fluids, which has now been enabled through the new framework developed in the present study.</description>

      <title>Guided Multi-objective Generative AI to Enhance Structure-based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. Yet, despite recent advances in machine learning, existing models cannot generate molecules that satisfy all desired physicochemical properties. Herein, we describe IDOLpro, a novel generative chemistry AI combining deep diffusion with multi-objective optimization for structure-based drug design. The latent variables of the diffusion model are guided by differentiable scoring functions to explore uncharted chemical space and generate novel ligands in silico, optimizing a plurality of target physicochemical properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness by generating ligands with optimized binding affinity and synthetic accessibility on two benchmark sets. IDOLpro produces ligands with binding affinities over 10% higher than the next best state-of-the-art on each test set. On a test set of experimental complexes, IDOLpro is the first to surpass the performance of experimentally observed ligands. IDOLpro can accommodate other scoring functions (e.g. ADME-Tox) to accelerate hit-finding, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization for drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen peroxide forms spontaneously in water (bulk, film, or microdroplet) via reduction of dissolved oxygen at solid-water interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zare and co-workers have recently claimed that hydrogen peroxide is spontaneously generated on the air-water interface of sprayed microdroplets, i.e., that H2O2 forms without an external energy source or co-reactant or catalyst. Specifically, they find that the H2O2(aq) concentration in sprayed microdroplets increases by a factor of 3.5 (or 2.5) as the spray chamber's relative humidity (RH) is changed from 15% to 50% (or from 15% to 95%). Building on these results, they imply causation for the seasonality of viral infections arising from the RH-dependent H2O2 generation in environmental microdroplets. Here, we present an alternative explanation for their observations.</description>

      <title>Computational predictions of hydrogen-assisted fatigue crack growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new model is presented to predict hydrogen-assisted fatigue. The model combines a phase field description of fracture and fatigue, stress-assisted hydrogen diffusion, and a toughness degradation formulation with cyclic and hydrogen contributions. Hydrogen-assisted fatigue crack growth predictions exhibit an excellent agreement with experiments over all the scenarios considered, spanning multiple load ratios, H2 pressures and loading frequencies. These are obtained without any calibration with hydrogen-assisted fatigue data, taking as input only mechanical and hydrogen transport material properties, the material's fatigue characteristics (from a single test in air), and the sensitivity of fracture toughness to hydrogen content. Furthermore, the model is used to determine: (i) what are suitable test loading frequencies to obtain conservative data, and (ii) the underestimation made when not pre-charging samples. The model can handle both laboratory specimens and large-scale engineering components, enabling the Virtual Testing paradigm in infrastructure exposed to hydrogen environments and cyclic loading.</description>

      <title>Conditions for enhancement of chemical reactions in gas phase inside a dark cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing chemical reactions, such as $A+B \to [\textit{activated complex}]^\# \to C+D$, in gas phase through its coupling to quantum-electrodynamics (QED) modes in a dark cavity is investigated. The main result is that the enhancement of the reaction rate by a dark cavity is for asymmetric reactions (products different from reactants.) Notice that in addition to the cavity been dark, the reactants are in their ground electronic and vibrational states, i.e., it is indeed dark. Theoretical derivation, utilizing the non-Hermitian formalism of quantum mechanics (NHQM), provides conditions and guidelines for selecting the proper type of reactions that can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Nevertheless, the time-dependent simulations of such experiments can be carried out using the standard (Hermitian) scattering theory (but including the conditions derived via NHQM). We believe that this work opens a gate to new types of studies and hopefully helps to close the gap between theory and experiments in this fascinating, relatively new field of research. As an example, we demonstrate that the asymmetric reaction rates of $O+D_2\to [ODD]^{\#} \to OD+D$ and $H+ArCl \to [ArHCl]^{\#} \to H+Ar+Cl$ can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Contrary, the dark cavity effect on the symmetric reaction of hydrogen exchange in methane will be negligible.</description>

      <title>Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids using Density Functional theory (DFT) methods. In this construction we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix whose eigenstates also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that for the basis of each step of the iteration we use the previous eigenstate basis in the interstitial region but augmented inside the MT sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the energy window of that eigenstate. To reduce the number of times the KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at some energy inside the window) so that the KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration, for practical applications on the order of 10 to 100 windows. This method combines the energy dependence of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment of basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW).</description>

      <title>Elucidating the role of electron transfer in the photoluminescence of $\mathrm{MoS_{2}}$ quantum dots synthesized by fs-pulse ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Herein, $\mathrm{MoS_{2}}$ quantum dot (QDs) with controlled optical, structural, and electronic properties are synthesized using the femtosecond pulsed laser ablation in liquid (fs-PLAL) technique by varying pulse-width, ablation power, and ablation time to harness the potential for next-generation optoelectronics and quantum technology. Furthermore, this work elucidates key aspects of the mechanisms underlying the near-UV and blue emission, the accompanying large Stokes-shift, and the consequent change in sample color with laser exposure parameters pertaining to $\mathrm{MoS_{2}}$ QDs. Through spectroscopic analysis, including UV-visible absorption, photoluminescence, and Raman spectroscopy, we successfully unravelled the mechanisms for the change in optoelectronic properties of $\mathrm{MoS_{2}}$ QDs with laser parameters. We realize that the occurrence of a secondary phase, specifically $\mathrm{MoO_{3-x}}$, is responsible for the significant Stokes-shift and blue emission observed in this QDs system. The primary factor influencing these activities is the electron transfer observed between these two phases, as validated by excitation dependent photoluminescence, XPS and Raman spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Solvent Selectivity controls Micro- versus Macro-phase Separation in Multiblock Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble were used to obtain critical parameters and conditions leading to microphase separation for block copolymers with solvophilic and solvophobic segments. Solvent selectivity was systematically varied to distinguish between systems that undergo macrophase separation to ones that microphase separate in the dilute phase, prior to macrophase separating. Finite-size scaling was used to obtain the critical parameters. Interestingly, corrections to scaling increase significantly for systems that form finite aggregates. The threshold value of solvent selectivity for aggregation was determined for symmetric diblock chains of varying length. The results indicate that long diblock copolymers form micelles in the dilute phase prior to macrophase separation, even in marginally selective solvents. The dependence of critical temperature on solvent selectivity was obtained for triblock, multiblock, and alternating chains. For highly selective solvents, strong structuring of both dilute and dense phases makes it harder to reach equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an optomechanical scheme for reaching quantum entanglement in vibration polaritons. The system involves $N$ molecules, whose vibrations can be fairly entangled with plasmonic cavities. We find that the vibration-photon entanglement can exist at room temperature and is robust against thermal noise. We further demonstrate the quantum entanglement between the vibrational modes through the plasmonic cavities, which shows a delocalized nature and an incredible enhancement with the number of molecules. The underlying mechanism for the entanglement is attributed to the strong vibration-cavity coupling which possesses collectivity. Our results provide a molecular optomechanical scheme which offers a promising platform for the study of noise-free quantum resources and macroscopic quantum phenomena.</description>

Abstract: An equation that determines the numbers of electrons for molecules is proposed based on chemical common sense. It shows that all molecules are entangled in number of electrons and results in the fundamental assumption of molecular energy convexity that underpins molecular quantum mechanics. It also leads to the concept of fractional numbers of electrons for molecules in a statistical sense. The energy of a molecule is piecewise linear with respect to its continuous number of electrons. Wavefunction interpretation of this equation of nature shows that an individual molecule with noninteger number of electrons is locally physical albeit locally unreal. The complete theoretical proof of the equation is still to be had.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopy detected in the time domain entails many techniques, such as FTIR, pump-probe, FT-Raman, and 2DES, and applications, such as molecule characterization, excited state dynamics studies, or spectra classifications. Surprisingly, all these techniques use sampling schemes that rarely exploit the a priori knowledge the scientist has before the experiment. Indeed, not all the sampling coordinates carry the same amount of information. In this work, we rationalize with examples the various advantages of a smart sampling scheme tailored to the specific experiment characteristics and/or the expected results. The application of a Fisher information approach allows for finding the best sampling scheme to minimize the variance of a desired observable, greatly improving, for example, spectral classifications and multidimensional spectroscopy. In general, we demonstrate how a smart sampling allows reducing by one to two orders of magnitude the acquisition time of an experiment while still providing a similar level of information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several methods in nonadiabatic molecular dynamics are based on Madelung's hydrodynamic description of nuclear motion, while the electronic component is treated as a finite-dimensional quantum system. In this context, the quantum potential leads to severe computational challenges and one often seeks to neglect its contribution, thereby approximating nuclear motion as classical. The resulting model couples classical hydrodynamics for the nuclei to the quantum motion of the electronic component, leading to the structure of a complex fluid system. This type of mixed quantum-classical fluid models have also appeared in solvation dynamics to describe the coupling between liquid solvents and the quantum solute molecule. While these approaches represent a promising direction, their mathematical structure requires a certain care. In some cases, challenging higher-order gradients make these equations hardly tractable. In other cases, these models are based on phase-space formulations that suffer from well-known consistency issues. Here, we present a new complex fluid system that resolves these difficulties. Unlike common approaches, the current system is obtained by applying the fluid closure at the level of the action principle of the original phase-space model. As a result, the system inherits a Hamiltonian structure and retains energy/momentum balance. After discussing some of its structural properties and dynamical invariants, we illustrate the model in the case of pure-dephasing dynamics. We conclude by presenting some invariant planar models.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Model for Catalytic Methane Pyrolysis</title>

Abstract: Methane pyrolysis provides a scalable alternative to conventional hydrogen production methods, avoiding greenhouse gas emissions. However, high operating temperatures limit economic feasibility on an industrial scale. A major scientific goal is, therefore, to find a catalyst material that lowers operating temperatures, making methane pyrolysis economically viable. In this work, we derive a model that provides a qualitative comparison of possible catalyst materials. The model is based on calculations of adsorption energies using density functional theory. Thirty different elements were considered. Adsorption energies of intermediate molecules in the methane pyrolysis reaction correlate linearly with the adsorption energy of carbon. Moreover, the adsorption energy increases in magnitude with decreasing group number in the $d$-block of the periodic table. For a temperature range between 600 and 1200 K and a normalized partial pressure range for $\mathrm{H_2}$ between $10^{-1}$ and $10^{-5}$, a total of eighteen different materials were found to be optimal catalysts at least once. This indicates that catalyst selection and reactor operating conditions should be well-matched. The present work establishes the foundation for future large-scale studies of surfaces, alloy compositions, and material classes using machine learning algorithms.</description>

Abstract: The constraint coordinate-momentum phase space (CPS) formulation of finite-state quantum systems has recently revealed that the triangle window function approach is an isomorphic representation of the exact population-population correlation function of the two-state system. We use the triangle window (TW) function and the CPS mapping kernel element to formulate a novel useful representation of discrete electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs). When it is employed with nonadiabatic field (NaF) dynamics, a new variant of the NaF approach (i.e., NaF-TW) is proposed. Extensive benchmark tests of model systems in both the condensed phase and gas phase demonstrate that the NaF-TW approach is competent in faithfully capturing the dynamical interplay between electronic and nuclear DOFs. In comparison to the symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) method where triangle window functions were originally proposed, the performance of NaF-TW is significantly better when the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion in the asymptotic region is important.</description>
