      <title>A relation between the Dirichlet and the Regularity problem for Parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the Dirichlet and Regularity problem for parabolic operators of the form $ L = \mbox{div}(A\nabla\cdot) - \partial_t $ on cylindrical domains $ \Omega = \mathcal O \times \mathbb R $, where the base $ \mathcal O \subset \mathbb R^{n} $ is a $1$-sided chord arc domain (and for one result Lipschitz) in the spatial variables.
  In the paper we answer the question when the solvability of the $L^p$ Regularity problem for $L$ (denoted by $ (R_L)_{p} $) can be deduced from the solvability of the $ L^{p'} $ Dirichlet problem for the adjoint operator $L^*$ (denoted $ (D_L^*)_{p'} $).
  We show that this holds if for at least of $q\in(1,\infty)$ the problem $ (R_L)_{q} $ is solvable.
  This result is a parabolic equivalent of two elliptic results of Kenig-Pipher (1993) and Shen (2006), the combination of which establishes the elliptic version of our result. For the converse, see Dindo\v{s}-Dyer (2019) where it is shown that $ (R_L)_{p}$ implies $ (D_L^*)_{p'}$ on parabolic $\mbox{Lip}(1,1/2)$ domains.</description>

      <title>Transition Threshold for Strictly Monotone Shear Flows in Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of spectrally stable, strictly monotone, smooth shear flows in the 2D Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{T} \times \mathbb{R}$ with small viscosity $\nu$. We establish nonlinear stability in $H^s$ for $s \geq 2$ with a threshold of size $\epsilon \nu^{1/3}$ for time smaller than $c_*\nu^{-1}$ with $\epsilon, c_* \ll 1$. Additionally, we demonstrate nonlinear inviscid damping and enhanced dissipation.</description>

      <title>Microlocal inversion of a restricted mixed ray transform for second-order tensor fields in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a restricted mixed ray transform acting on second-order tensor fields in 3-dimensional Euclidean space and prove the invertibility of this integral transform using microlocal techniques. Here, the mixed ray transform is restricted over lines passing through a fixed curve $\gamma$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying certain geometric conditions. The main theorem of the article shows that a second-order tensor field can be recovered from its restricted mixed-ray transform up to the kernel of the transform, a smoothing term, and a known singular term.</description>

      <title>Local-in-time analytic solutions for an inviscid model of superfluidity in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the existence of solutions for the inviscid version of the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov equations in 3D, a macro-scale model of superfluidity. This system couples the incompressible Euler equations for the normal fluid and superfluid using a nonlinear mutual friction term that acts only at points of non-zero superfluid vorticity. In the first rigorous study of the inviscid HVBK system, we construct a unique local-in-time solution that is analytic in time and space.</description>

      <title>A note for double H\"{o}lder regularity of the hydrodynamic pressure for weak solutions of Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof for the double H\"{o}lder regularity of the hydrodynamic pressure for weak solutions of the Euler Equations in a bounded $C^2$-domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$; $d\geq 3$. That is, for velocity $u \in C^{0,\gamma}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^d)$ with some $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1/2$, we show that the pressure $p \in C^{0,2\gamma}(\Omega)$. This is motivated by the studies of turbulence and anolalous dissipation in mathematical hydrodynamics and, recently, has been established in [L. De Rosa, M. Latocca, and G. Stefani, Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024.3 (2024), 2511-2560] over $C^{2,\alpha}$-domains by means of pseudodifferential calculus. Our approach involves only standard elliptic PDE techniques, and relies crucially on the modified pressure introduced in [C. W. Bardos, D. W. Boutros, and E. S. Titi, H\"{o}lder regularity of the pressure for weak solutions of the 3D Euler equations in bounded domains, arXiv: 2304.01952] and the potential estimates in [L. Silvestre, unpublished notes]. The key novel ingredient of our proof is the introduction of two cutoff functions whose localisation parameters are carefully chosen as a power of the distance to $\partial\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Harnack inequality for singular or degenerate parabolic equations in non-divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of linear parabolic equations in non-divergence form in which the leading coefficients are measurable and they can be singular or degenerate as a weight belonging to the $A_{1+\frac{1}{n}}$ class of Muckenhoupt weights. Krylov-Safonov Harnack inequality for solutions is proved under some smallness assumption on a weighted mean oscillation of the weight. The novelty of the paper is an introduction of a class of generic weighted parabolic cylinders in which several growth lemmas are proved. A perturbation method is used and the Aleksandrov-Bakelman-Pucci type maximum principle for parabolic operators is crucially applied to suitable barrier functions to prove the growth lemmas. As corollaries, H\"{o}lder regularity estimates of solutions with respect to a quasi-distance, and a Liouville type theorem are obtained in the paper.</description>

      <title>A shape optimization problem in cylinders and related overdetermined problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a shape optimization problem for the torsional energy associated with a domain contained in an infinite cylinder, under a volume constraint. We prove that a minimizer exists for all fixed volumes and show some of its geometric and topological properties. As this issue is closely related to the question of characterizing domains in cylinders that admit solutions to an overdetermined problem, our minimization result allows us to deduce interesting consequences in that direction. In particular, we find that, for some cylinders and some volumes, the ``trivial" domain given by a bounded cylinder is not the only domain where the overdetermined problem has a solution. Moreover, it is not even a minimizer, which indicates that solutions with flat level sets are not always the best candidates for optimizing the torsional energy.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions for some systems of superdiffusive integro-differential equations in population dynamics depending on the natality and mortality rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of stationary solutions for some systems of reaction-diffusion type equations with superdiffusion in the corresponding H^2 spaces. Our method is based on the fixed point theorem when the elliptic problems contain first order differential operators with and without the Fredholm property, which may depend on the outcome of the competition between the natality and the mortality rates contained in the equations of our systems.</description>

      <title>Long distance propagation of wave beams in paraxial regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the propagation of high frequency wave-beams in highly turbulent atmospheres. Using a paraxial model of wave propagation, we show in the long-distance weak-coupling regime that the wavefields are approximately described by a complex Gaussian field whose scintillation index is unity. This provides a model of the speckle formation observed in many practical settings. The main step of the derivation consists in showing that closed-form moment equations in the It\^o-Schr\"odinger regime are still approximately satisfied in the paraxial regime. The rest of the proof is then an extension of results derived in [Bal, G. and Nair, A., arXiv:2402.17107.]</description>

      <title>Small scales in inviscid limits of steady fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the 2D incompressible steady Navier-Stokes equation in a channel $(-L,0)\times(-1,1)$ with the no-slip boundary condition on $\{Y = \pm 1\}$, and consider the inviscid limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. In the special case of Euler shear flow $(u_e(Y),0)$, we construct a steady Navier-Stokes solution for $\varepsilon \ll1$, $$\left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;u^\varepsilon \sim u_e + u_p + O(\sqrt{\varepsilon}),\\ &amp;v^\varepsilon \sim h(Y) \exp\{Xu_e(Y)/\varepsilon\} + O(\sqrt{\varepsilon}), \end{aligned}\right. $$ where $u_p$ represents the classical Prandtl layer profile, and $h(Y)$ is an arbitrary smooth, compactly-supported function with small magnitude. While the classical Prandtl boundary layer $u_p$ exhibits a small scale of order $\sqrt{\varepsilon}$ in $Y$ near $Y = \pm 1$, the profile we construct reveals an $\varepsilon$ small scale of $Xu_e(Y)$ in the vertical velocity component.</description>

      <title>On scattering for two-dimensional quintic Schr\"odinger equation under partial harmonic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the scattering theory for the two dimensional defocusing quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation(NLS) with partial harmonic oscillator which is given by \begin{align}\label{NLS-abstract} \begin{cases}\tag{PHNLS} i\partial_tu+(\partial_{x_1}^2+\partial_{x_2}^2)u-x_2^2u=|u|^4u,&amp;(t,x_1,x_2)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R},\\ u(0,x_1,x_2)=u_0(x_1,x_2). \end{cases} \end{align} 
  First, we establish the linear profile decomposition for the Schr\"odinger operator $e^{it(\partial_{x_1}^2+\partial_{x_2}^2-x_2^2)}$ by utilizing the classical linear profile decomposition associated with the Schr\"odinger equation in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. Then, applying the normal form technique, we approximate the nonlinear profiles using solutions of the new-type quintic dispersive continuous resonant (DCR) system. This allows us to employ the concentration-compactness/rigidity argument introduced by Kenig and Merle in our setting and prove scattering for equation (PHNLS) in the weighted Sobolev space.
  The second part of this paper is dedicated to proving the scattering theory for this mass-critical (DCR) system. Inspired by Dodson's seminal work [B. Dodson, Amer. J. Math. 138 (2016), 531-569], we develop long-time Strichartz estimates associated with the spectral projection operator $\Pi_n$, along with low-frequency localized Morawetz estimates, to address the challenges posed by the Galilean transformation and spatial translation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we examine a mutual control problem for systems of two abstract evolution equations subject to a proportionality final condition. Related observability and semi-observability problems are discussed. The analysis employs a vector fixed-point approach, using matrices rather than constants, and applies the technique of Bielecki equivalent norms.</description>

      <title>Approximation of divergence-free vector fields vanishing on rough planar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any divergence-free vector field of Sobolev class $W^{m,p}_0(\Omega)$ in bounded open subset $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, we are interested in approximating it in $W^{m,p}$ with divergence-free smooth vector fields compactly supported in $\Omega$. We show that this approximation property holds in the following cases. For $p&gt;2$, this holds given that $\partial \Omega$ has zero Lebesgue measure (a weaker but more technical condition is sufficient); For $p \leq 2$, this holds if $\Omega^c$ can be decomposed into finitely many disjoint closed set, each of which is connected or $d$-Ahlfors regular for some $d\in[0,2]$. This has links to the uniqueness of weak solutions to the Stokes equation in $\Omega$. For H\"older spaces, we prove this property in general bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Domain characterization for Schr\"odinger operators with sub-quadratic singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the domain of the Schr\"odinger operators $S=-\Delta+c|x|^{-\alpha}$ in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^N)$, with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$ and $c\in\mathbb{R}$. When $\alpha p&lt; N$, the domain characterization is essentially known and can be proved using different tools, for instance kernel estimates and potentials in the Kato class or in the reverse H\"older class. However,the other cases seem not to be known, so far.In this paper, we give the explicit description of the domain of $S$ for all range of parameters $p,\alpha$ and $c$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the fractional logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equation $$ (-\Delta)^{s} u+h(x) u=u \log u^{2} $$ on lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^d$, where $s\in (0,1)$. If $h(x)$ is a bounded periodic potential, we prove the existence of ground state solution by mountain pass theorem and Lions lemma. If $h(x)$ is a coercive potential, we show the existence of ground state sign-changing solutions by the method of Nehari manifold.</description>

      <title>The Weakly Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation in Higher Dimensions with Quasi-periodic Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, under the exponential/polynomial decay condition in Fourier space, we prove that the nonlinear solution to the quasi-periodic Cauchy problem for the weakly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in higher dimensions will asymptotically approach the associated linear solution within a specific time scale. The proof is based on a combinatorial analysis method. Our results and methods work for {\em arbitrary} space dimensions and focusing/defocusing {\em arbitrary} power-law nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the quintic wave equation with nonlocal weak damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a new scheme for studying the dynamics of a quintic wave equation with nonlocal weak damping in a 3D smooth bounded domain. As an application, the existence and structure of weak, strong, and exponential attractors for the solution semigroup of this equation are obtained. The investigation sheds light on the well-posedness and long-time behavior of nonlinear dissipative evolution equations with nonlinear damping and critical nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Hypersonic flow onto a large curved wedge and the dissipation of shock wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For supersonic flow past an obstacle, experiments show that the flow field after shocks changes slightly for incoming flow with Mach number larger to 5, named hypersonic flow. Hypersonic similarity principle was first found by Qian for thin wedge by studying potential flow. In this paper, we explore the existence of smooth flow field after shock for hypersonic potential flow past a curved smooth wedge with neither smallness assumption on the height of the wedge nor that it is a BV perturbation of a line. The asymptotic behaviour of the shock is also analysed. We proved that for given Bernoulli constant of the incoming flow, there exists a sufficient large constant such that if the Mach number of the incoming flow is larger than it, then there exists a global shock wave attached to the tip of the wedge together with a smooth flow field between it and the wedge. The state of the flow after shock is in a neighbourhood of a curve that is determined by the wedge and the density of the incoming flow. If the slope of the wedge has a positive limit as $x$ goes to infinity, then the slope of the shock tends to that of the self-similar case that the same incoming flow past a straight wedge with slope of the limit. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the slope of the wedge is parallel to the incoming flow at infinity, then the strength of the shock will attenuate to zero at infinity. The restrictions on the surface of a wedge have been greatly relaxed compared to the previous works on supersonic flow past wedges. The method employed in this paper is characteristic decomposition, and the existence of the solution is obtained by finding an invariant domain of the solution based on geometry structures of the governing equations. The idea and the method used here may be helpful for other problems.</description>

      <title>Upper semicontinuity for a class of nonlocal evolution equations with Neumann condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the following nonlocal autonomous evolution equation in a bounded domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ \[ \partial_t u(x,t) =- h(x)u(x,t) + g \Big(\int_{\Omega} J(x,y)u(y,t)dy \Big) +f(x,u(x,t)) \] where $h\in W^{1,\infty}(\Omega)$, $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $f:\mathbb{R}^N\times\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ are continuously differentiable function, and $J$ is a symmetric kernel; that is, $J(x,y)=J(y,x)$ for any $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^N$. Under additional suitable assumptions on $f$ and $g$, we study the asymptotic dynamics of the initial value problem associated to this equation in a suitable phase spaces. More precisely, we prove the existence, and upper semicontinuity of compact global attractors with respect to kernel $J$.</description>

      <title>Output-feedback stabilization of an underactuated network of N interconnected n + m hyperbolic PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we detail the design of an output feedback stabilizing control law for an underactuated network of N subsystems of n + m heterodirectional linear first-order hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations interconnected through their boundaries. The network has a chain structure, as only one of the subsystems is actuated. The available measurements are located at the opposite extremity of the chain. The proposed approach introduces a new type of integral transformation to tackle in-domain couplings in the different subsystems while guaranteeing a ''clear actuation path'' between the control input and the different subsystems. Then, it is possible to state several essential properties of each subsystem: output trajectory tracking, input-to-state stability, and predictability (the possibility of designing a state prediction). We recursively design a stabilizing state-feedback controller by combining these properties. We then design a state-observer that reconstructs delayed values of the states. This observer is combined with the state-feedback control law to obtain an output-feedback controller. Simulations complete the presentation.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Wave Localisation in Systems of Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of metamaterials composed of high-contrast subwavelength resonators and show the existence of localised modes in such a setting. A crucial assumption in this paper is time-modulated material parameters. We prove a so-called capacitance matrix approximation of the wave equation in the form of an ordinary differential equation. These formulas set the ground for the derivation of a first-principles characterisation of localised modes in terms of the generalised capacitance matrix. Furthermore, we provide numerical results supporting our analytical results showing for the first time the phenomenon of space-time localised waves in a perturbed time-modulated metamaterial. Such spatio-temporal localisation is only possible in the presence of subwavelength resonances in the unperturbed structure. We introduce the time-dependent degree of localisation to quantitatively determine the localised modes and provide a variety of numerical experiments to illustrate our formulations and results.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear nonlocal reaction-diffusion problem with local reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyse the asymptotic behaviour of some nonlocal diffusion problems with local reaction term in general metric measure spaces. We find certain classes of nonlinear terms, including logistic type terms, for which solutions are globally defined with initial data in Lebesgue spaces. We prove solutions satisfy maximum and comparison principles and give sign conditions to ensure global asymptotic bounds for large times. We also prove that these problems possess extremal ordered equilibria and solutions, asymptotically, enter in between these equilibria. Finally we give conditions for a unique positive stationary solution that is globally asymptotically stable for nonnegative initial data. A detailed analysis is performed for logistic type nonlinearities. As the model we consider here lack of smoothing effect, important focus is payed along the whole paper on differences in the results with respect to problems with local diffusion, like the Laplacian operator.</description>

      <title>On the existence of solutions for a parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis model with flux limitation and logistic source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the existence of solutions of a parabolic-elliptic system of partial differential equations describing the behaviour of a biological species $u$ and a chemical stimulus $v$ in a bounded and regular domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^N$. The equation for $u$ is a parabolic equation with a nonlinear second order term of chemotaxis type with flux limitation as $ -\chi div (u |\nabla \psi|^{p-2} \nabla v)$, for $p&gt;1$. The chemical substance distribution $v$ satisfies the elliptic equation $-\Delta v+v=u$. The evolution of $u$ is also determined by a logistic type growth term $\mu u(1-u)$. The system is studied under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The main result of the article is the existence of uniformly bounded solutions for $p&lt;3/2$ and any $N\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of the composite wave of rarefaction wave and contact wave to nonlinear viscoelasticity model with non-convex flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the wave propagations of viscoelastic materials, which has been derived by Taiping-Liu to approximate the viscoelastic dynamic system with fading memory (see [T.P.Liu(1988)\cite{LiuTP}]) by the Chapman-Enskog expansion. By constructing a set of linear diffusion waves coupled with the high-order diffusion waves to achieve cancellations to approximate the viscous contact wave well and explicit expressions, the nonlinear stability of the composite wave is obtained by a continuum argument.
  It emphasis that, the stress function in our paper is a general non-convex function, which leads to several essential differences from strictly hyperbolic systems such as the Euler system. Our method is completely new and can be applied to more general systems and a new weighted Poincar\'e type of inequality is established, which is more challenging compared to the convex case and this inequality plays an important role in studying systems with non-convex flux.</description>

      <title>Controllability Problems for the Heat Equation in a Half-Plane Controlled by the Neumann Boundary Condition with a Point-Wise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, the problems of controllability and approximate controllability are studied for the control system $w_t=\Delta w$, $w_{x_1}(0,x_2,t)=u(t)\delta(x_2)$, $x_1&gt;0$, $x_2\in\mathbb R$, $t\in(0,T)$, where $u\in L^\infty(0,T)$ is a control. To this aid, it is investigated the set $\mathcal{R}_T(0)\subset L^2((0,+\infty)\times\mathbb R)$ of its end states which are reachable from $0$. It is established that a function $f\in\mathcal{R}_T(0)$ can be represented in the form $f(x)=g\big(|x|^2\big)$ a.e. in $(0,+\infty)\times\mathbb R$ where $g\in L^2(0,+\infty)$. In fact, we reduce the problem dealing with functions from $L^2((0,+\infty)\times\mathbb R)$ to a problem dealing with functions from $L^2(0,+\infty)$. Both a necessary and sufficient condition for controllability and a sufficient condition for approximate controllability in a given time $T$ under a control $u$ bounded by a given constant are obtained in terms of solvability of a Markov power moment problem. Using the Laguerre functions (forming an orthonormal basis of $L^2(0,+\infty)$), necessary and sufficient conditions for approximate controllability and numerical solutions to the approximate controllability problem are obtained. It is also shown that there is no initial state that is null-controllable in a given time $T$. The results are illustrated by an example.</description>

      <title>Existence results for Kazdan-Warner type equations on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, motivated by the work of Huang-Lin-Yau (Commun. Math. Phys. 2020), Sun-Wang (Adv. Math. 2022) and Li-Sun-Yang (Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations 2024), we investigate the existence of Kazdan-Warner type equations on a finite connected graph, based on the theory of Brouwer degree. Specifically, we consider the equation \begin{equation*} -\Delta u=h(x)f(u)-c, \end{equation*} where $h$ is a real-valued function defined on the vertex set $V$, $c\in\mathbb{R}$ and \begin{equation*} f(u)= \left(1-\displaystyle\frac{1}{1+u^{2n}}\right)e^u \end{equation*} with $n\in \mathbb{N}^*$. Different from the previous studies, the main difficulty in this paper is to show that the corresponding equation has only three constant solutions, based on delicate analysis and the connectivity of graphs, which have not been extensively explored in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Existence, symmetry and regularity of ground states of a non linear choquard equation in the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the positive solutions of the following nonlinear Choquard equation involving the green kernel of the fractional operator $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^N})^{-\alpha/2}$ in the hyperbolic space \begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned} -\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^{N}} u \, - \, \lambda u \, &amp;= \left[(- \Delta_{\mathbb{B}^{N}})^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}}|u|^p\right]|u|^{p-2}u,
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation} where $\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^{N}}$ denotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $\mathbb{B}^{N}$, $\lambda \leq \frac{(N-1)^2}{4}$, $1 &lt; p &lt; 2^*_{\alpha} = \frac{N+\alpha}{N-2}$, $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; N$, $N \geq 3$, $2^*_\alpha$ is the critical exponent in the context of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. This study is analogous to the Choquard equation in the Euclidean space, which involves the non-local Riesz potential operator. We consider the functional setting within the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb{B}^N)$, employing advanced harmonic analysis techniques, particularly the Helgason Fourier transform and semigroup approach to fractional Laplacian. Moreover, the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on complete Riemannian manifolds, as developed by Varopoulos, is pivotal in our analysis. We prove an existence result for the above problem in the subcritical case. Moreover, we also demonstrate that solutions exhibit radial symmetry, and establish the regularity properties.</description>

      <title>Normalized Solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger Equations with General Nonlinearities in Bounded Domains via a Global Bifurcation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the existence, nonexistence and multiplicity of positive solutions with prescribed mass for nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations in bounded domains via a global bifurcation approach. The nonlinearities in this paper can be mass supercritical, critical, subcritical or some mixes of these cases, and the equation can be autonomous or non-autonomous. This generalizes a result in Noris, Tavares and Verzini [\emph{Anal. PDE}, 7 (8) (2014) 1807-1838], where the equation is autonomous with homogeneous nonlinearities. Besides, we have proven some orbital stability or instability results.</description>

      <title>Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision-avoidance and micro-to-macro mean-field limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler-alignment system with nonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$-Euler-alignment system. This model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a density-weighted fractional $p$-Laplacian when the singularity parameter $\alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish the existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($\alpha \ge d$) and compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as mean-field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the $p$-Euler-alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical measures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity satisfy the $p$-Euler-alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the existence of solutions to this system in multi-dimensional settings without significant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p&gt;2$) and linear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness, and collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under non-collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 \le p \le \alpha + 2$. This analysis supports our mean-field limit argument and contributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.</description>

      <title>The exponential turnpike phenomenon for mean field game systems: weakly monotone drifts and small interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims at quantifying the long time behavior of solutions of mean field PDE systems arising in the theory of Mean Field Games and McKean-Vlasov control. Our main contribution is to show well-posedness of the ergodic problem and the exponential turnpike property of dynamic optimizers, which implies exponential convergence to equilibrium for both optimal states and controls to their ergodic counterparts. In contrast with previous works that require some version of the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, our main assumption is a weak form of asymptotic monotonicity on the drift of the controlled dynamics and some basic regularity and smallness conditions on the interaction terms. Our proof strategy is probabilistic and based on the construction of contractive couplings between controlled processes and forward-backward stochastic differential equations. The flexibility of the coupling approach allows us to cover several interesting situations. For example, we do not need to restrict ourselves to compact domains and can work on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$, we can cover the case of non-constant diffusion coefficients and we can sometimes show turnpike estimates for the hessians of solutions to the backward equation.</description>

      <title>Existence of 5 minimal tori in 3-spheres of positive Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1989, B. White conjectured that every Riemannian 3-sphere has at least 5 embedded minimal tori. We confirm this conjecture for 3-spheres of positive Ricci curvature. While our proof uses min-max theory, the underlying heuristics are largely inspired by mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Observability inequalities for heat equations with potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is mainly concerned with the observability inequalities for heat equations with time-dependent Lipschtiz potentials. The observability inequality for heat equations asserts that the total energy of a solution is bounded above by the energy localized in a subdomain with an observability constant. For a bounded measurable potential $V = V(x,t)$, the factor in the observability constant arising from the Carleman estimate is best known to be $\exp(C\|V\|_{\infty}^{2/3})$ (even for time-independent potentials). In this paper, we show that, for Lipschtiz potentials, this factor can be replaced by $\exp(C(\|\nabla V\|_{\infty}^{1/2} +\|\partial_tV\|_{\infty}^{1/3} ))$, which improves the previous bound $\exp(C\|V\|_{\infty}^{2/3})$ in some typical scenarios. As a consequence, with such a Lipschitz potential, we obtain a quantitative regular control in a null controllability problem. In addition, for the one-dimensional heat equation with some time-independent bounded measurable potential $V = V(x)$, we obtain the optimal observability constant.</description>

      <title>Space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting for multidimensional detonation waves simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting was used for simulation of multidimensional reacting flows with detonation waves. The presented numerical method does not use any ideas of splitting or fractional time steps methods. The modification of the LST-DG predictor has been developed, based on a local partition of the time step in cells in which strong reactivity of the medium is observed. This approach made it possible to obtain solutions to classical problems of flows with detonation waves and strong stiffness, without significantly decreasing the time step. The results obtained show the very high applicability and efficiency of using the ADER-DG-PN method with a posteriori sub-cell limiting for simulating reactive flows with detonation waves. The numerical solution shows the correct formation and propagation of ZND detonation waves. The structure of detonation waves is resolved by this numerical method with subcell resolution even on coarse spatial meshes. The smooth components of the numerical solution are correctly and very accurately reproduced by the numerical method. Non-physical artifacts of the numerical solution, typical for problems with detonation waves, such as the propagation of non-physical shock waves and weak detonation fronts ahead of the main detonation front, did not arise in the results obtained. The results of simulating rather complex problems associated with the propagation of detonation waves in significantly inhomogeneous domains are presented, which show that all the main features of detonation flows are correctly reproduced by this numerical method. It can be concluded that the space-time adaptive ADER-DG-PN method with a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting is perfectly applicable to simulating complex reacting flows with detonation waves.</description>

      <title>Space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell WENO finite-volume limiting for simulation of non-stationary compressible multicomponent reactive flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-time adaptive ADER finite element DG method with a posteriori correction technique of solutions on subcells by the finite-volume ADER-WENO limiter was used to simulate non-stationary compressible multicomponent reactive flows. The multicomponent composition of the reacting medium and the reactions occurring in it were described by expanding the original system of Euler equations by a system of non-stationary convection-reaction equations. The use of this method to simulate high stiff problems associated with reactions occurring in a multicomponent medium requires the use of the adaptive change in the time step. The solution of the classical problem related to the formation and propagation of a ZND detonation wave is carried out. It was shown that the space-time adaptive ADER finite element DG method with a posteriori correction technique of solutions on subcells by the finite-volume ADER-WENO limiter can be used to simulate flows without using of splitting in directions and fractional step methods.</description>

      <title>Aggregation-diffusion in heterogeneous environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aggregation-diffusion equations are foundational tools for modelling biological aggregations. Their principal use is to link the collective movement mechanisms of organisms to their emergent space use patterns in a rigorous, non-speculative way. However, most existing studies implicitly assume that organism movement is not affected by the underlying environment. In reality, the environment is a key determinant of emergent space use patterns, albeit in combination with collective aspects of motion. This work studies aggregation-diffusion equations in a heterogeneous environment in one spatial dimension. Under certain assumptions, it is possible to find exact analytic expressions for the steady-state solutions to the equation when diffusion is quadratic. Minimising the associated energy functional across these solutions provides a rapid way of determining the likely emergent space use pattern, which can be verified via numerics. This energy-minimisation procedure is applied to a simple test case, where the environment consists of a single clump of attractive resources. Here, self-attraction and resource-attraction combine to shape the emergent aggregation. Two counter-intuitive results emerge from the analytic results: (a) a non-monotonic dependence of clump width on the aggregation width, (b) a positive correlation between self-attraction strength and aggregation width when the resource attraction is strong. These are verified through numerical simulations. Overall, the study shows rigorously how environment and collective behaviour combine to shape organism space use, sometimes in counter-intuitive ways.</description>

Abstract: This review surveys previous and recent results on null controllability and inverse problems for parabolic systems with dynamic boundary conditions. We aim to demonstrate how classical methods such as Carleman estimates can be extended to prove null controllability for parabolic systems and Lipschitz stability estimates for inverse problems with dynamic boundary conditions of surface diffusion type. We mainly focus on the substantial difficulties compared to static boundary conditions. Finally, some conclusions and open problems will be mentioned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an original method, we find the algebra of generalized symmetries of a remarkable (1+2)-dimensional ultraparabolic Fokker-Planck equation, which is also called the Kolmogorov equation and is singled out within the entire class of ultraparabolic linear second-order partial differential equations with three independent variables by its wonderful symmetry properties. It turns out that the essential part of this algebra is generated by the recursion operators associated with the nilradical of the essential Lie invariance algebra of the Kolmogorov equation, and the Casimir operator of the Levi factor of the latter algebra unexpectedly arises in the consideration.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we remove the assumption on the gradient of the Ricci curvature in Hamilton's matrix Harnack estimate for the heat equation on all closed manifolds, answering a question which has been around since the 1990s. New ingredients include a recent sharp Li-Yau estimate, construction of a suitable vector field and various use of integral arguments, iteration and a little tensor algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.04860v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be an open set whose boundary may be composed of pieces of different dimensions. Assume that $\Omega$ satisfies the quantitative openness and connectedness, and there exist doubling measures $m$ on $\Omega$ and $\mu$ on $\partial \Omega$ with appropriate size conditions. Let $Lu=-\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u)$ be a real (not necessarily symmetric) degenerate elliptic operator in $\Omega$. Write $\omega_L$ for the associated degenerate elliptic measure. We establish the equivalence between the following properties: (i) $\omega_L \in A_{\infty}(\mu)$, (ii) the Dirichlet problem for $L$ is solvable in $L^p(\mu)$ for some $p \in (1, \infty)$, (iii) every bounded null solution of $L$ satisfies Carleson measure estimates with respect to $\mu$, (iv) the conical square function is controlled by the non-tangential maximal function in $L^q(\mu)$ for all $q \in (0, \infty)$ for any null solution of $L$, and (v) the Dirichlet problem for $L$ is solvable in $\mathrm{BMO}(\mu)$. On the other hand, we obtain a qualitative analogy of the previous equivalence. Indeed, we characterize the absolute continuity of $\omega_L$ with respect to $\mu$ in terms of local $L^2(\mu)$ estimates of the truncated conical square function for any bounded null solution of $L$. This is also equivalent to the finiteness $\mu$-almost everywhere of the truncated conical square function for any bounded null solution of $L$.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates for Beam equations with potentials in dimension three</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying time decay estimates of the solution for Beam equation (higher order type wave equation) with a potential
  $$u_{t t}+\big(\Delta^2+V\big)u=0, \,\ u(0, x)=f(x),\ u_{t}(0, x)=g(x)$$ in dimension three, where $V$ is a real-valued and decaying potential on $\R^3$. Assume that zero is a regular point of $H:= \Delta^2+V $, we first prove the following optimal time decay estimates of the solution operators \begin{equation*}
  \big\|\cos (t\sqrt{H})P_{ac}(H)\big\|_{L^{1} \rightarrow L^{\infty}} \lesssim|t|^{-\frac{3}{2}}\ \ \hbox{and} \ \
  \Big\|\frac{\sin(t\sqrt{H})}{\sqrt{H}} P_{a c}(H)\Big\|_{L^{1} \rightarrow L^{\infty}} \lesssim|t|^{-\frac{1}{2}}. \end{equation*} Moreover, if zero is a resonance of $H$, then time decay of the solution operators above also are considered. It is noticed that the first kind resonance does not effect the decay rates for the propagator operators $\cos(t\sqrt{H})$ and $\frac{\sin(t\sqrt{H})}{\sqrt{H}}$, but their decay will be dramatically changed for the second and third resonance types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure (with order $\alpha &gt; 1$) and the dynamical problem of its canonical stochastic quantization: the three-dimensional stochastic damped fractional nonlinear wave equation with a cubic nonlinearity, also called the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model. We first construct the fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure via the variational approach by Barashkov-Gubinelli (2020). When $\alpha \leq \frac{9}{8}$, this fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure turns out to be mutually singular with respect to the base Gaussian measure. We then prove almost sure global well-posedness of the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model and invariance of the fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure for all $\alpha &gt; 1$ by further developing the globalization framework due to Oh-Okamoto-Tolomeo (2021) on the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model. Furthermore, when $\alpha &gt; \frac{9}{8}$ , we prove weak universality of the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model via both measure convergence and dynamical convergence.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples and weak (1,1) estimates of wave operators for fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators in dimension three</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to investigating the $L^p$-bounds of wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ associated with fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators $H=\Delta^2+V$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$. We consider that real potentials satisfy $|V(x)|\lesssim \langle x\rangle^{-\mu}$ for some $\mu&gt;0$. A recent work by Goldberg and Green \cite{GoGr21} has demonstrated that wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ under the condition that $\mu&gt;9$, and zero is a regular point of $H$. In this paper, we aim to further establish endpoint estimates for $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ in two significant ways. First, we provide counterexamples that illustrate the unboundedness of $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ on the endpoint spaces $L^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ and $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)$, even for non-zero compactly supported potentials $V$. Second, we establish weak (1,1) estimates for the wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ and their dual operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)^*$ in the case where zero is a regular point and $\mu&gt;11$. These estimates depend critically on the singular integral theory of Calder\'on-Zygmund on a homogeneous space $(X,d\omega)$ with a doubling measure $d\omega$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for bounded, divergence-free vector fields in $L^1_{loc}((0,+\infty);BV_{loc}(R^d;R^d))$, regularisation by convolution of the vector field selects a single solution of the transport equation for any integrable initial datum. We recall the vector field constructed by Depauw in [10], which lies in the above class of vector fields. We show that the transport equation along this vector field has at least two bounded weak solutions for any bounded initial datum.</description>

Abstract: We have developed a three-dimensional manifold that facilitates finding solutions of Riemann initial value problems. In this paper, we apply this tool to a system of two conservation laws with quadratic flux functions. As this manifold contains points representing potential shock waves, it is named the wave manifold. We calculate and display graphically important curves and surfaces within the wave manifold. Characteristic and sonic surfaces subdivide it into regions according to shock wave admissibility. Admissible regions are further subdivided according to shock curves being local or non-local. Rarefaction, shock, and composite curves, which are untangled within the wave manifold, combine to form wave curves. To solve a Riemann problem, we form and intersect the novel intermediate surface of one wave curve with the other wave curve. Solutions of Riemann problems for several illustrative cases are presented.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of nonlocal interaction kernels in nonlinear gradient flow equations via partial inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the inverse problem of identifying nonlocal interaction potentials in nonlinear aggregation-diffusion equations from noisy discrete trajectory data. Our approach involves formulating and solving a regularized variational problem, which requires minimizing a quadratic error functional across a set of hypothesis functions, further augmented by a sparsity-enhancing regularizer. We employ a partial inversion algorithm, akin to the CoSaMP [57] and subspace pursuit algorithms [31], to solve the Basis Pursuit problem. A key theoretical contribution is our novel stability estimate for the PDEs, validating the error functional ability in controlling the 2-Wasserstein distance between solutions generated using the true and estimated interaction potentials. Our work also includes an error analysis of estimators caused by discretization and observational errors in practical implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods through various 1D and 2D examples showcasing collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>Horizontal semiconcavity for the square of Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance on step 2 Carnot groups and applications to Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the square of Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance from the origin, in step 2 Carnot groups, enjoys the horizontal semiconcavity (h-semiconcavity) everywhere in the group including the origin. We first give a proof in the case of ideal Carnot groups, based on the simple group structure as well as estimates for the Euclidean semiconcavity. Our proof of the general result involves more geometric properties of step 2 Carnot groups. We further apply our h-semiconcavity result to show h-semiconcavity of the viscosity solutions to a class of non-coercive evolutive Hamilton-Jacobi equations by using the Hopf-Lax formula associated to the Carnot-Carath\'eodory metric.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the unknown boundary values of a solution of an elliptic equation outside a bounded open set $B$ from the knowledge of the values of this solution on a boundary of an arbitrary Lipschitz bounded domain surrounding $B$. We obtain for this inverse problem Lipschitz stability for an admissible class of unknown boundary functions. Our analysis applies as well to an interior problem. We also give an extension to the parabolic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the cubic Schr\"odinger equation posed on product spaces subject to a generic Diophantine condition. Our analysis shows that the small-amplitude solutions undergo modified scattering to an effective dynamics governed by some interactions that do not amplify the Sobolev norms. This is in sharp contrast with the infinite energy cascade scenario observed by Hani--Pausader--Tzvetkov--Visciglia in the absence of Diophantine conditions.</description>

      <title>The Second Picard iteration of NLS on the $2d$ sphere does not regularize Gaussian random initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Wick ordered cubic Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) posed on the two-dimensional sphere, with initial data distributed according to a Gaussian measure. We show that the second Picard iteration does not improve the regularity of the initial data in the scale of the classical Sobolev spaces. This is in sharp contrast with the Wick ordered NLS on the two-dimensional tori, a model for which we know from the work of Bourgain that the second Picard iteration gains one half derivative. Our proof relies on identifying a singular part of the nonlinearity. We show that this singular part is responsible for a concentration phenomenon on a large circle (i.e. a stable closed geodesic), which prevents any regularization in the second Picard iteration.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the no-flux initial-boundary value problem for the doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system \begin{align} \begin{cases}\tag{$\star$}\label{eq 0.1} u_t=\nabla \cdot(u v \nabla u)-\chi \nabla \cdot\left(u^{2} v \nabla v\right)+\ell u v, &amp; x \in \Omega, t&gt;0, \\ v_t=\Delta v-u v, &amp; x \in \Omega, t&gt;0 \end{cases} \end{align} in a smoothly bounded convex domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, where $\chi&gt;0$ and $\ell \geq 0$. In this paper, we present that for all reasonably regular initial data, the model \eqref{eq 0.1} possesses a global bounded weak solution which is continuous in its first and essentially smooth in its second component. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>Monge-Amp\`ere equation with Guillemin boundary condition in high dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Guillemin boundary condition naturally appears in the study of K\"ahler geometry of toric manifolds. In the present paper, the following Guillemin boundary value problem is investigated \begin{align} \label{eq1} &amp;\det D^2 u=\frac{h(x)}{\prod_{i=1}^N l_i(x)},\quad\text{in}\quad\quad P\subset\mathbb R^n, \quad\quad \quad \quad\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad (1)\\ \label{bdy1} &amp;u(x)-\sum_{i=1}^N l_i(x)\ln l_i(x)\in C^\infty(\overline{P}). \quad\quad\quad\quad \quad \quad\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad\quad (2)
  \end{align}
  Here
  \begin{equation*}
  0&lt;h(x)\in C^\infty(\overline{P}),\quad P=\cap_{i=1}^N \{l_i(x)&gt;0\}
  \end{equation*} is a simple convex polytope in $\mathbb R^n$. The solvability of (1)-(2) is given under the necessary and sufficient condition. The key issue in the proof is to obtain the boundary regularity of $u(x)-\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N l_i(x)\ln l_i(x)$. Due to the difficulty caused by the structure of the equation itself and the singularity of $\partial P$, special attention is required to understand the influence of different singularity types at various positions on $\partial P$ and how these impact the behavior of $u$ in its vicinity.</description>

      <title>Sharp isoanisotropic estimates for fundamental frequencies of membranes and connections with shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18683v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The underlying motivation of the present work lies on a cornerstone question in spectral optimization that consists of determining sharp lower and upper uniform estimates for fundamental frequencies of a set of uniformly elliptic operators on a fixed membrane. We solve completely the problem in the plane for the general class of anisotropic operators in divergence form generated by arbitrary norms, which also includes the computation of optimal constants and the characterization of corresponding anisotropic extremizers (if they exist). Our approach is based on an isoanisotropic optimization formulation which, in turn, demands to be addressed within the broader environment of nonnegative, convex and 1-homogeneous anisotropies. A fine and detailed analysis of least energy levels associated to anisotropies with maximum degeneracy leads to a central connection between shapes and fundamental frequencies of rather degenerate elliptic operators. Such a linking also permits to establish that the supremum of anisotropic fundamental frequencies over all fixed-area membranes is infinite for any nonzero anisotropy. As a by-product, the well-known maximization conjecture for fundamental frequencies of the p-Laplace operator is proved for any p other than 2.</description>

      <title>Exponential Stability and Design of Sensor Feedback Amplifiers for Fast Stabilization of Magnetizable Piezoelectric Beam Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamic partial differential equation (PDE) model governing longitudinal oscillations in magnetizable piezoelectric beams exhibits exponentially stable solutions when subjected to two boundary state feedback controllers. An analytically established exponential decay rate by the Lyapunov approach ensures stabilization of the system to equilibrium, though the actual decay rate could potentially be improved. The decay rate of the closed-loop system is highly sensitive to the choice of material parameters and the design of the state feedback amplifiers. This paper focuses on investigating the design of state feedback amplifiers to achieve a maximal exponential decay rate, which is essential for effectively suppressing oscillations in these beams. Through this design process, we explicitly determine the safe intervals of feedback amplifiers that ensure the theoretically found maximal decay rate, with the potential for even better rates. Our numerical results reaffirm the robustness of the decay rate within the chosen range of feedback amplifiers, while deviations from this range significantly impact the decay rate. To underscore the validity of our results, we present various numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates instances of Sobolev embeddings characterized by local compactness at every point within their domain, except for a single point. We obtain the sharp conditions that distinguish compactness from non-compactness and observe that in the context of Sobolev embeddings, non-compactness occurring at only one point within the domain could give rise to an infinite-dimensional subspace where the embedding is invertible (i.e., not strictly singular). Furthermore, we establish lower bounds for the Bernstein numbers, entropy numbers, and the measure of non-compactness.</description>

      <title>Event-triggered Boundary Control of Mixed-autonomy Traffic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control problems of mixed-autonomy traffic systems that consist of both human-driven vehicles (HV) and autonomous vehicles (AV), have gained increasing attention. This paper focuses on suppressing traffic oscillations in the mixed-autonomy traffic system using boundary control design. The mixed traffic dynamics are described by 4 x 4 hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), governing the propagation of four waves of traffic, including the density of HV, the density of AV, the friction between the two vehicle classes from driving interactions and the averaged velocity. We propose an event-triggered boundary control design since control signals of the traffic light on ramp or the varying speed limit cannot be continuously updated. We apply the event-triggered mechanism for a PDE backstepping controller and obtain a dynamic triggering condition. Lyapunov analysis is performed to prove the exponential stability of the closed-loop system with the event-triggered controller. Numerical simulation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed event-trigger control design. We analyzed how the car-following spacing of AV affects the event-triggering mechanism of the control input in mixed-autonomy traffic.</description>
