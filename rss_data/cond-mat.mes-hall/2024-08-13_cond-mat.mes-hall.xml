      <title>Electronic Structure and Kohn-Luttinger Superconductivity of Heavily-Doped Single-Layer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of superconductivity (SC) in graphene appears to be established in both twisted and non-twisted multilayers. However, whether their building block, single-layer graphene (SLG), can also host SC remains an open question. Earlier theoretical works predicted that SLG could become a chiral d-wave superconductor driven by electronic interactions when doped to its van Hove singularity, but questions such as whether the d-wave SC survives the strong band renormalizations seen in experiments, its robustness against the source of doping, or if it will occur at any reasonable critical temperature (Tc) have remained difficult to answer, in part due to uncertainties in model parameters. In this study, we adopt a random-phase approximation framework based on a Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism to investigate SC in heavily-doped SLG. We predict that robust d+id topological SC could arise in SLG doped by Tb, with a Tc up to 600 mK. We also investigate the possibility of realizing d-wave SC by employing other dopants, such as Li or Cs. The structural models have been derived from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on Tb-doped graphene and first-principles calculations for Cs and Li doping. We find that dopants that change the lattice symmetry of SLG are detrimental to the d-wave state. The stability of the d-wave SC predicted here in Tb-doped SLG could provide a valuable insight for guiding future experimental efforts aimed at exploring topological superconductivity in monolayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Designing Band Structures by Patterned Dielectric Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of graphene monolayers subjected to patterned dielectric superlattices. Through a quantum capacitance model approach, we simulate realistic devices capable of imposing periodic potentials on graphene. By means of both tight-binding and continuum models, we analyze the electronic structure across varied patterning geometries, including triangular, kagome, and square configurations. We explicitly explore the influence of device parameters such as the superlattice potential strength, geometry, and periodicity on the electronic properties of graphene. By introducing a long-range Coulomb interaction, we found an emergent periodic potential strong enough to open a mass gap, thereby generating a Chern band. Our study highlights the robustness and versatility of patterned dielectric superlattices for band engineering in graphene systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum correction to the orbital Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital Hall effect (OHE) typically is evaluated using an intuitive approach based on semiclassical considerations. Here we provide a full quantum mechanical evaluation of the orbital current, including all matrix elements of the position operator. We recover previous results and find an additional quantum correction due to the non-commutativity of the position and velocity operators. We evaluate the full OHE for the topological antiferromagnet CuMnAs showing that the quantum correction dominates the response and changes its sign. We discuss implications for experiment.</description>

      <title>Impact of Majorana fermions on the Kondo state in the carbon nanotube quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the quantum conductance of the Kondo state in the carbon nanotube quantum dot (CNTQD) with side-attached multi-Majorana fermion states in topological superconductors (TSCs). The zero-energy Majorana fermions interfere with the fourfold degenerate states of the CNTQD in the spin-orbital Kondo regime. Using the extended Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave-boson mean-field approach, we have analyzed the symmetry reduction of the SU(4) Kondo effect to the SU$^{\star}$(3) Kondo state with a fractional charge in the system by increasing the tunneling strength to a single Majorana fermion (TSC). We observed the fractional quantum conductance, the residual impurity entropy, the enhancement of the thermoelectric power with two compensation points, the fractional linear and nonlinear Fano factor ($F_{K}$) and the spin polarization of the conductance. Two Majoranas (2TSC) in conjunction with the CNTQD have reduced the spin-orbital Kondo effect to the SU$^{\star}$(2) Kondo state with 2e in the system. $F_{K}$ contains information about the effective charge and the interaction between the quasiparticles, two- and three-body correlators and identifies the broken symmetry of the Kondo state. We discussed the local quadratic Casimir operator separately for the states associated with the Kondo effect and the Majorana fermion state to show the difference between the fluctuations of the pseudospin in both quantum channels. We have shown that the device coupled with three Majorana fermions (3TSC) achieves a quantized conductance $5/2(e^{2}/h)$, conserves the U$^{\star}$(1) charge symmetry at the electron-hole symmetry point and manifests the increase in nonlinear current and shot noise due to the entanglement in octuplets with opposite charge-leaking states. Furthermore, we have investigated the influence of the spin-orbit interaction in the CNTQD-TSC device on the quantum transport properties.</description>

      <title>Role of additional microwave voltage on phase locking in voltage-controlled parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A demonstration of parametric oscillation of magnetization in nanostructured ferromagnets via voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect provided an alternative approach to spintronic oscillator applications with low-energy consumption. However, the phase of this voltage-controlled parametric oscillator was unable to be locked uniquely by microwave VCMA effect. The oscillation phase is locked in one of two possible states, which originates from the fact that the frequency of the microwave voltage is twice that of the magnetization oscillation. In this work, we investigate the phase locking by additional microwave voltage through analytical and numerical studies of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. An analytical study suggests that the additional voltage makes one of two phases more stable than the other by having asymmetric potential for the phase. The simulation results indicate a trigonometric-function-like dependence of the locked rate on the phase of the additional voltage, which qualitatively agrees with the analytical theory and also suggests a possibility to manipulate the phase by the additional voltage.</description>

      <title>Tunable atomically enhanced moir\'e Berry curvatures in twisted triple bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a twisted triple bilayer graphene platform consisting of three units of Bernal bilayer graphene (BLG) consecutively twisted at 1.49{\deg} and 1.68{\deg}. We observe inter-moir\'e Hofstadter butterflies from two co-existing moir\'e superlattices and a Hofstadter butterfly from reconstructed moir\'e-of-moir\'e lattice, and show that their Brown-Zak (BZ) oscillations quantitatively agree with each other, both evidencing strong atomic reconstruction with a lattice constant of 18.1 nm. We further demonstrate such atomic reconstruction strongly enhances the Berry curvature of each moir\'e and moir\'e-of-moir\'e band-insulator state, characterized by measured strong non-local valley Hall effect (VHE) that sensitively depends on the inter-moir\'e competition strength, tunable by manipulating the out-of-the-plane carrier distribution which controls the magnitude of the valley currents. Our study sheds new light on the microscopic mechanism of atomic and electronic reconstruction in twisted-multilayer systems, by investigating novel emergent quantum phenomena of reconstructed quasi-crystalline moir\'e-of-moir\'e superlattice, including a new type of moir\'e-of-moir\'e band-insulator states and atomically enhanced moir\'e Berry curvature. We show that the reconstructed electronic band can be versatilely tuned by electrostatics, providing an approach towards engineering the band structure and its topology for a novel quantum material platform with designer electrical and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Frequency modulation on magnons in synthetic dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons are promising candidates for next-generation computing architectures, offering the ability to manipulate their amplitude and phase for information encoding. However, the frequency degree of freedom remains largely unexploited due to the complexity of nonlinear process. In this work, we introduce the concept of synthetic frequency dimension into magnonics, treating the eigenfrequency of inherent modes as an additional degree of freedom. This approach enables the effective description of the temporal evolution of a magnon state using an effective tight-binding model, analogous to a charged particle hopping in a modulated lattice. A magnonic ring resonator is investigated as an example, and several intriguing phenomena are predicted, including Bloch oscillations and a leverage effect during unidirectional frequency shifts, all of which are verified through micromagnetic simulations. Notably, our strategy operates in the linear spin-wave regime, excluding the involvement of multi-magnon scattering and high-power generation. This work expands the toolkit for designing magnonic devices based on frequency modulation and paves the way for a new paradigm called magnonics in synthetic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Interaction- and phonon-induced topological phase transitions in double helical liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helical liquids, formed by time-reversal pairs of interacting electrons in topological edge channels, provide a platform for stabilizing topological superconductivity upon introducing local and nonlocal pairings through the proximity effect. Here, we investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions and phonons on the topological superconductivity in two parallel channels of such helical liquids. Interactions between electrons in different channels tend to reduce nonlocal pairing, suppressing the topological regime. Additionally, electron-phonon coupling breaks the self duality in the electronic subsystem and renormalizes the pairing strengths. Notably, while earlier perturbative calculations suggested that longitudinal phonons have no effect on helical liquids themselves to the leading order, our nonperturbative analysis shows that phonons can induce transitions between topological and trivial superconductivity, thereby weakening the stability of topological zero modes. Our findings highlight practical limitations in realizing topological zero modes in various systems hosting helical channels, including quantum spin Hall insulators, higher-order topological insulators, and their fractional counterparts recently observed in twisted bilayer systems.</description>

      <title>A seamless graphene spin valve based on proximity to van der Waals magnet Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pristine graphene is potentially an ideal medium to transport spin information. Proximity effects, where a neighbouring material is used to alter the properties of a material in adjacent (or proximitized) regions, can also be used in graphene to generate and detect spins by acquiring spin-orbit coupling or magnetic exchange coupling. However, the development of seamless spintronic devices that are based uniquely on proximity effects remains challenging. Here, we report a two-dimensional graphene spin valve that is enabled by proximity to the van der Waals magnet Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$. Spin precession measurements show that graphene acquires both spin-orbit coupling and magnetic exchange coupling when interfaced with the Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$. This leads to spin generation by both electrical spin injection and the spin Hall effect, while retaining long-distance spin transport. The simultaneous presence of spin-orbit coupling and magnetic exchange coupling also leads to a sizeable anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-induced tunnel ionization drives coherent Raman-active phonon in Bismuth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving coherent lattice motion with THz pulses has emerged as a novel pathway for achieving dynamic stabilization of exotic phases that are inaccessible in equilibrium quantum materials. In this work, we present a previously unexplored mechanism for THz excitation of Raman-active phonons in semimetals. We show that intense THz pulses centered at 1 THz can excite the Raman-active $A_{1g}$ phonon mode at 2.9 THz in a bismuth film. We rule out the possibilities of the phonon being excited through conventional anharmonic coupling to other modes or via a THz sum frequency process. Instead, we demonstrate that the THz-driven tunnel ionization provides a plausible means of creating a displacive driving force to initiate the phonon oscillations. Our work highlights a new mechanism for exciting coherent phonons, offering potential for dynamic control over the electronic and structural properties of semimetals and narrow-band semiconductors on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Role of the Casimir force in micro- and nanoelectromechanical pressure sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir force caused by the electromagnetic fluctuations is computed in the configurations of micro- and nanoelectromechanical pressuresensors using Si membranes and either Si or Au-coated Si substrates. It is shown that if, under the influence of external pressure, the membrane-substrate separation drops to below 100 nm, the Casimir force makes a profound effect onthe sensor functioning. There exists the maximum value of external pressure depending on the sensor parameters such that it finds itself in a state of unstable equilibrium. For this and larger pressures, the Casimir force leads to a collapse of the sensor, which loses its functionality. For any smaller external pressures, there exist two equilibrium positions, one of which is unstable and another one is stable, at smaller and larger membrane-substrate separations, respectively. The latter can be safely used for the pressure measurements. Possible applications of the {obtained} results in the design of micro- and nanoelectromechanical pressure sensors of next generations with further decreased dimensions are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to electronic phase transitions, structural phase transitions of crystals are challenging to control due to the energy cost of breaking dense solid bonds. Recently, however, electric field switching of stacking configuration between honeycomb layers, held together by relatively weak van der Waals (vdW) attractions, was demonstrated. In response to the external fields, the layers slide between commensurate meta-stable configurations with discrete symmetries and distinct lattice orientations. These 2D vdW polytypes host diverse electronic orders such as ferroelectricity and magnetism, providing multiferroic switching via lubricant sliding of incommensurate boundary strips. Ahead, we address recent observations in honeycomb polytypes and identify remaining challenges for extending this conceptual "SlideTronics" mechanism into rapid, local, and practical multiferroic devices. The stacking energies, symmetries, and orbital overlaps that underlie the band structures and internal charge distributions are discussed, along with poly-properties like interfacial-ferroelectricity, ladder-like cumulative polarization, superconductivity, and orbital magnetic orders. Distinct from conventional 3D multiferroic crystals, the 2D vdW assembly and the sliding switching mechanism open poly-opportunities for novel device concepts.</description>

      <title>Period-doubling in the phase dynamics of a shunted HgTe quantum well Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional AC Josephson effect is a discerning property of topological superconductivity in hybrid Josephson junctions. Recent experimental observations of missing odd Shapiro steps and half Josephson frequency emission in various materials have sparked significant debate regarding their potential origin in the effect. In this study, we present microwave emission measurements on a resistively shunted Josephson junction based on a HgTe quantum well. We demonstrate that, with significant spurious inductance in the shunt wiring, the experiment operates in a nonlinear dynamic regime characterized by period-doubling. This leads to additional microwave emission peaks at half of the Josephson frequency, $f_J/2$, which can mimic the $4\pi$-periodicity of topological Andreev states. The observed current-voltage characteristics and emission spectra are well-described by a simple RCLSJ model. Furthermore, we show that the nonlinear dynamics of the junction can be controlled using gate voltage, magnetic field, and temperature, with our model accurately reproducing these effects without incorporating any topological attributes. Our observations urge caution in interpreting emission at $f_J/2$ as evidence for gapless Andreev bound states in topological junctions and suggest the appropriate parameter range for future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of nanoscale matter has the potential to revolutionize a variety of fields across nanoscience and technology. Here, we demonstrate experimentally and characterize numerically a device that combines the benefits of dielectrophoresis (DEP) - long-range and strong trapping forces - with those of plasmonic tweezers - high sensitivities - to achieve a remarkable efficiency in the trapping and sensing of metallic nanoparticles and biomolecules. In particular, we show the DEP trapping and surface enhanced Raman scattering characterization of bovine serum albumin and Rhodamine B, thus extending the applications of tweezing devices to molecules having masses of only a few hundreds of Da. This range covers virtually any molecule relevant for life, from tiny oligopeptides to large proteins. This pushes our manipulation capabilities deep into the realms of efficient single-molecule biosensing and quantum science, providing a powerful platform to probe matter at the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First principles real-time time dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) calculations reveal the existence of ballistic photocurrents generated by Coulomb scattering, a form of photocurrent that has not previously been considered as a mechanism for the bulk photovoltaic effect. With monolayer GeS as an example, it is predicted that ballistic currents can exceed shift currents under experimentally accessible conditions. Moreover, these simulations reveal recombination pathways that work to modify shift current magnitudes beyond perturbation theory predictions.</description>

      <title>Topological transitions in quantum jump dynamics: Hidden exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex spectra of dissipative quantum systems may exhibit degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs). At these points the systems' dynamics may undergo a drastic change. Phenomena associated with EPs and their applications have been extensively studied in relation to various experimental platforms, including, i.a., the superconducting circuits. While most of the studies focus on EPs appearing due to the variation of the system's parameters, we focus on EPs emerging in the full counting statistics of the system. We consider a monitored three level system and find multiple EPs in the Lindbladian eigenvalues considered as functions of a counting field. We demonstrate that these EPs signify transitions between different topological classes which are rigorously characterized in terms of the braid theory. Furthermore, we identify dynamical observables affected by these transitions and demonstrate how the underlying topology can be recovered from experimentally measured quantum jump distributions. Additionally, we establish a duality between certain EPs in the Lindbladian with regard to the counting field. This allows for an experimental observation of the EP transitions, normally hidden by the Liouvillian dynamics of the system, at arbitrary times without applying postselection schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry and geometric entanglement entropy of one-dimensional Floquet topological matter</title>

Abstract: The geometry of quantum states could offer indispensable insights for characterizing the topological properties, phase transitions and entanglement nature of many-body systems. In this work, we reveal the quantum geometry and the associated entanglement entropy (EE) of Floquet topological states in one-dimensional periodically driven systems. The quantum metric tensors of Floquet states are found to show non-analytic signatures at topological phase transition points. Away from the transition points, the bipartite geometric EE of Floquet states exhibits an area-law scaling vs the system size, which holds for a Floquet band at any filling fractions. For a uniformly filled Floquet band, the EE further becomes purely quantum geometric. At phase transition points, the geometric EE scales logarithmically with the system size and displays cusps in the nearby parameter ranges. These discoveries are demonstrated by investigating typical Floquet models including periodically driven spin chains, Floquet topological insulators and superconductors. Our findings uncover the rich quantum geometries of Floquet states, unveiling the geometric origin of EE for gapped Floquet topological phases, and introducing information-theoretic means of depicting topological transitions in Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Emission Spectrum of Doped Graphene Quantum Dots: A high-throughput TDDFT Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of fluorescence emission energies for 284 distinct graphene quantum dots (GQDs) of varying shapes (square, hexagonal, and amorphous) and sizes ($\sim$1-2 nm). These GQDs are doped with one or two elements from B, N, O, S, and P at dopant percentages of 1.5%, 3%, 5%, and 7%. Our study systematically investigates the trends and patterns in emission energies as a function of shape, size, dopant type and dopant percentage. Twelve structures are identified to have emission wavelengths in the visible spectrum. The emission energies derived from our calculations can guide the formulation of specific GQD mixtures to achieve desired emission spectra within and beyond the visible range for industrial applications. Furthermore, the extensive dataset, including emission energies along with molecular structures generated in this work, creates a DFT dateset for further machine learning studies.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Meron Kekul\'e lattices in twisted N\'eel antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Kekul\'e lattice is an exotic, distorted lattice structure distinguished by alternating bond lengths in contrast to naturally formed atomic crystals. While this structure has been explored through atomic crystals and metamaterials, the possibility of forming a Kekul\'e lattice from topological solitons in magnetic systems has remained elusive. Here, we propose twisted bilayer easy-plane N\'eel antiferromagnets as a promising platform for achieving a "Meron Kekul\'e lattice" -- a distorted topological soliton lattice comprised of antiferromagnetic merons as its lattice elements. Using atomistic spin simulations on these magnets, we demonstrate that due to the moir\'e-induced intricate pattern of interlayer exchange coupling, the cores of these merons are stabilized into the Kekul\'e-O pattern with different intracell and intercell bond lengths across moir\'e supercells, hence forming a Meron Kekul\'e lattice. Furthermore, we showcase that the two bond lengths of the Meron Kekul\'e lattice can be fine-tuned by adjusting the twist angle and specifics of the interlayer exchange coupling, suggesting extensive control over the meron lattice configuration in contrast to conventional magnetic systems. These discoveries pave the way for exploring topological solitons with distinctive Kekul\'e attributes, offering intriguing opportunities at the intersection of topological solitons and Kekul\'e physics.</description>

      <title>Unitary control of multiport wave transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling wave transmission is crucial for various applications. In this work, we apply the concept of unitary control to manipulate multiport wave transmission. Unitary control aims to control the behaviors of a set of orthogonal waves simultaneously. The approach fully harnesses the capability of wavefront shaping techniques, with promising applications in communication, imaging, and photonic integrated circuits. Here we present a detailed theory of unitary control of wave transmission, focusing on two key characteristics: total (power) transmittance and direct (field) transmission. The total transmittance for an input port represents the fraction of total transmitted power with respect to the input power for wave incident from an input port. The direct transmission for an input port denotes the complex transmission amplitude from that input port to its corresponding output port. We address two main questions: (i) the achievable total transmittance and direct transmission for each port, and (ii) the configuration of unitary control to attain desired transmission values for each port. Our theory illustrates that unitary control enables uniform total transmittance and direct transmission across any medium. Furthermore, we show that reciprocity and energy conservation enforce direct symmetry constraints on wave transmission in both forward and backward directions under unitary control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherent control of wave absorption has important applications in areas such as energy harvesting, imaging, and sensing. However, most practical scenarios involve the absorption of partially coherent rather than fully coherent waves. Here we present a systematic theory of unitary control over the absorption of partially coherent waves by linear systems. Given an absorbing system and incident partially coherent wave, we provide analytical expressions for the range of attainable absorptivity under arbitrary unitary transformations of the incident field. We also present an explicit algorithm to construct the unitary control scheme that achieves any desired absorptivity within that attainable range. As applications of our theory, we derive the conditions required for achieving two new phenomena - partially coherent perfect absorption and partially coherent zero absorption. Furthermore, we prove a theorem relating the coherence properties of the incident field, as quantified by majorization, to the resulting absorption intervals. Our results provide both fundamental insights and practical prescriptions for exploiting unitary control to shape the absorption of partially coherent waves. The theory applies across the electromagnetic spectrum as well as to other classical wave systems such as acoustic waves.</description>

Abstract: Coherent control of wave transmission and reflection is crucial for applications in communication, imaging, and sensing. However, many practical scenarios involve partially coherent waves rather than fully coherent ones. We present a systematic theory for the unitary control of partially coherent wave transmission and reflection. For a linear time-invariant system with an incident partially coherent wave, we derive analytical expressions for the range of attainable total transmittance and reflectance under arbitrary unitary transformations. We also introduce an explicit algorithm to construct a unitary control scheme that achieves any desired transmission or reflection within the attainable range. As applications of our theory, we establish conditions for four novel phenomena: partially coherent perfect transmission, partially coherent perfect reflection, partially coherent zero transmission, and partially coherent zero reflection. We also prove a theorem that relates the degree of coherence of the incident field, quantified by the majorization order, to the resulting transmission and reflection intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that reciprocity (or energy conservation) imposes direct symmetry constraints on bilateral transmission (or transmission and reflection) of partially coherent waves under unitary control. Our results provide fundamental insights and practical guidelines for using unitary control to manipulate the transmission and reflection of partially coherent waves. This theory applies to various wave systems, including electromagnetic and acoustic waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals (TBGQC) obtained by stacking two monolayer graphene sheets with a $30^\circ$ relative twisting. The electronic energy spectrum of TBGQC contains periodic energy ranges (PER) and quasiperiodic energy ranges (QER), where the underlying local density of states (LDOS) exhibits periodic and quasiperiodic distribution, respectively. We found that superconductivity in the PER is a simple superposition of two monolayer superconductors. This is because, particularly near the charge neutrality point of TBGQC, the two layers are weekly coupled, leading to pairing instabilities with uniform distribution in real space. On the other hand, within QER, the inhomogeneous distribution of the LDOS enhances the superconducting instability with a non-uniform distribution of pairing amplitudes, leading to quasiperiodic superconductivity. Our study can qualitatively explain the superconductivity in recently discovered moir\'e quasicrystals, which show superconductivity in its QER.</description>

      <title>Exciton diffusion in two-dimensional chiral perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites emerged as a versatile platform for light-emitting and photovol-taic applications due to their unique structural design and chemical flexibility. Their properties depend heavily on both the choice of the inorganic lead halide framework and the surrounding organic layers. Recently, the introduction of chiral cations into 2D perovskites has attracted major interest due to their potential for introducing chirality and tuning the chiro-optical response. Importantly, the optical properties in these materials are dominated by tightly bound excitons that also serve as primary carriers for the energy transport. The mobility of photoinjected excitons is thus important from the perspectives of fundamental material properties and optoelectronic applications, yet remains an open question. Here, we demonstrate exciton propagation in a 2D chiral perovskite methylbenzylammonium lead iodide (MBA2PbI4) using transient photoluminescence microscopy and reveal density-dependent transport over more than 100 nanometers at room temperature with diffusion coeffi-cients as high as 2 cm2/s. We observe two distinct regimes of initially rapid diffusive propagation and subsequent localiza-tion. Moreover, perovskites with enantiomer pure cations are found to exhibit faster exciton diffusion compared to the race-mic mixture, correlated with the impact of the material composition on disorder. Altogether, the observations of efficient exciton diffusion at room temperature highlight the potential of 2D chiral perovskites to merge chiro-optical properties with strong light-matter interaction and efficient energy transport.</description>

Abstract: Topological superconductivity is a state of matter that can host Majorana modes, the building blocks of a topological quantum computer. Many experimental platforms predicted to show such a topological state rely on proximity-induced superconductivity. However, accessing the topological properties requires an induced hard superconducting gap, which is challenging to achieve for most material systems. We have systematically studied how the interface between an InSb semiconductor nanowire and a NbTiN superconductor affects the induced superconducting properties. Step by step, we improve the homogeneity of the interface while ensuring a barrier-free electrical contact to the superconductor, and obtain a hard gap in the InSb nanowire. The magnetic field stability of NbTiN allows the InSb nanowire to maintain a hard gap and a supercurrent in the presence of magnetic fields (~ 0.5 Tesla), a requirement for topological superconductivity in one-dimensional systems. Our study provides a guideline to induce superconductivity in various experimental platforms such as semiconductor nanowires, two dimensional electron gases and topological insulators, and holds relevance for topological superconductivity and quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the core of the success of semiconducting spin qubits is the ability to manipulate them electrically, enabled by the spin-orbit interactions. However, most implementations require external magnetic fields to define the spin qubit, which in turn activate various charge-noise mechanisms. Here we study spin qubits confined in quantum dots at zero magnetic fields that are driven periodically by electrical fields and are coupled to a microwave resonator. Using Floquet theory, we identify a well-defined Floquet spin-qubit originating from the lowest degenerate spin states in the absence of driving. We find both transverse and longitudinal couplings between the Floquet spin qubit and the resonator, which can be selectively activated by modifying the driving frequency. We show how these couplings can facilitate fast qubit readout and the implementation of a two-qubit CPHASE gate. Finally, we use adiabatic perturbation theory to demonstrate that the spin-photon couplings originate from the non-Abelian geometry of states endowed by the spin-orbit interactions, rendering these findings general and applicable to a wide range of solid-state spin qubits.</description>

Abstract: Combining the synthetic tunability of molecular compounds with the optical selection rules of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) that derive from spin-valley coupling could provide interesting opportunities for the readout of quantum information. However, little is known about the electronic and spin interactions at such interfaces and the influence on spin-valley relaxation. In this work, vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) molecular layers are thermally evaporated on WSe$_2$ to explore the effect of molecular layer thickness on excited-state spin-valley polarization. The thinnest molecular layer supports an interfacial state which destroys the spin-valley polarization almost instantaneously, whereas a thicker molecular layer results in longer-lived spin-valley polarization than the WSe$_2$ monolayer alone. The mechanism appears to involve a tightly-bound species at the molecule/TMDC interface that strengthens exchange interactions and is largely avoided in thicker VOPc layers that isolate electrons from WSe$_2$ holes.</description>

Abstract: Majorana zero modes have gained significant interest due to their potential applications in topological quantum computing and in the realization of exotic quantum phases. These zero-energy quasiparticle excitations localize at the vortex cores of two-dimensional topological superconductors or at the ends of one-dimensional topological superconductors. Here we describe an alternative platform: a two-dimensional topological superconductor with inhomogeneous superconductivity, where Majorana modes localize at the ends of topologically nontrivial one-dimensional stripes induced by the spatial variations of the order parameter phase. In certain regimes, these Majorana modes hybridize into a single highly nonlocal state delocalized over spatially separated points, with exactly zero energy at finite system sizes and with emergent quantum-mechanical supersymmetry. We then present detailed descriptions of braiding and fusion protocols and showcase the versatility of our proposal by suggesting possible setups that can potentially lead to the realization of Yang-Lee anyons and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>

Abstract: We describe the mean-field model of a one-dimensional topological superconductor with two orbitals per unit cell. Time-reversal symmetry is absent, but a nonsymmorphic symmetry, involving a translation by a fraction of the unit cell, mimics the role of time-reversal symmetry. As a result, the topological superconductor has $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological phases, two which support Majorana bound states and two which do not, in agreement with a prediction based on K-theory classification [K. Shiozaki et al., Phys. Rev. B 93, 195413 (2016)]. As with the Kitaev chain, the presence of Majorana bound states gives rise to the $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect. A random matrix with nonsymmorphic time-reversal symmetry may be block diagonalized, and every individual block has time-reversal symmetry described by one of the Gaussian orthogonal, unitary or symplectic ensembles. We show how this is manifested in the energy level statistics of a random system in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ class as the spatial period of the nonsymmorphic symmetry is varied from much less than to of the order of the system size.</description>

Abstract: Contemporary quantum materials research is guided by themes of topology and of electronic correlations. A confluence of these two themes is engineered in "moir\'e materials", an emerging class of highly tunable, strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) materials designed by the rotational or lattice misalignment of atomically thin crystals. In moir\'e materials, dominant Coulomb interactions among electrons give rise to collective electronic phases, often with robust topological properties. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for these exotic phases is fundamental to our understanding of strongly interacting quantum systems, and to our ability to engineer new material properties for potential future technological applications. In this Review, we highlight the contributions of local spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and electromagnetic probes to the budding field of moir\'e materials research. These techniques have not only identified many of the underlying mechanisms of the correlated insulators, generalized Wigner crystals, unconventional superconductors, moir\'e ferroelectrics, and topological orbital ferromagnets found in moir\'e materials, but they have also uncovered fragile quantum phases that have evaded spatially averaged global probes. Furthermore, we highlight recently developed local probe techniques, including local charge sensing and quantum interference probes, that have uncovered new physical observables in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit locking of magnons with localized microwave fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the photonic spin-orbit coupling known from nano-optics and plasmonics in the microwave regime. The spin $\mathbf{S}$ and momentum $\mathbf{q}$ of microwaves emitted by an excited magnetic particle are locked by $\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{S}=0$ with a fixed chirality $\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot(\hat{\bf S}\times\hat{\bf q})=1$ when evanescent along $\hat{\mathbf{n}}\perp {\bf q}$. This field excites magnons in a nearby magnetic film in the form of directional beams that rotate with the magnetization direction. The exchange of these magnons between two distant nanomagnets leads to a highly tunable strong coupling and entangles their excited states.</description>

      <title>Cooling and heating nuclear spins by strongly localized electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of nuclear spin temperature has been a cornerstone of the theory of dynamic nuclear spin polarization by electrons in various semiconductor structures for decades. Still, it is not always applicable to strongly localized electrons due to their long spin correlation times. This motivated the use of the oversimplified central spin model for the description of the nuclear spin dynamics in quantum dots. Here, we present a microscopic theory that bridges the gap between these two approaches by describing the nuclear spin thermodynamics for systems with long electron spin correlation times. Importantly, our theory predicts that efficient nuclear spin cooling by strongly localized electrons requires an external magnetic field by far exceeding the local field of nuclear spin-spin interaction, and that the time of the nuclear spin heating by unpolarized electrons may change by several orders of magnitude depending on the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Exchange control in a MOS double quantum dot made using a 300 mm wafer process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging the advanced manufacturing capabilities of the semiconductor industry promises to help scale up silicon-based quantum processors by increasing yield, uniformity and integration. Recent studies of quantum dots fabricated on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes have shown control and readout of individual spin qubits, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm wafer MOS process customized for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the spin-spin exchange interaction, forming the basis of an entangling gate such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We observe gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns and a gate quality factor of 10. We further extend the coherence by up to an order of magnitude using an echo sequence. For readout, we introduce a dispersive readout technique, the radiofrequency electron cascade, that amplifies the signal while retaining the spin-projective nature of dispersive measurements. Our results demonstrate an industrial grade platform for two-qubit operations, alongside integration with dispersive sensing techniques.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Weyl nodal-line semimetal and antihelical edge states in a modified Kane-Mele model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kane-Mele model has been modified to achieve versatile topological phases. Previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 156402 (2018)] introduced a staggered intrinsic spin-orbit coupling effect to generate pseudohelical edge states, with Rashba spin-orbit coupling facilitating spin flips in alternating sublattices. Our study demonstrates that, in the absence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling, the modified Kane-Mele model with staggered intrinsic spin-orbit coupling evolves into a $Z_{2}$ class topological metal, specifically a two-dimensional Weyl nodal-line semimetal. In a nanoribbon geometry, we predict the emergence of antihelical edge states, which support spin-polarized currents flowing in the same direction along parallel boundaries. Unlike pseudohelical edge states, antihelical edge states can be viewed as a superposition of two antichiral edge states related by time-reversal symmetry. However, the spin Hall conductance from antihelical edge states is not quantized due to the presence of gapless bulk states. Additionally, we examine the robustness of helical, pseudohelical, and antihelical edge states in the presence of nonmagnetic disorders, highlighting the particular fragility of antihelical edge states. Our findings enhance the understanding of the modified Kane-Mele model, providing new insights into its topological properties.</description>

      <title>Observable signatures of Hall viscosity in lowest Landau level superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hall viscosity is a nondissipative viscosity occurring in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry, such as quantum Hall phases and $p+ip$ superfluids. Despite Hall viscosity's expected ubiquity and past observations in: classical soft matter, optical, and graphene systems, it has yet to be measured experimentally in any macroscopic quantum state of matter. Toward this end, we describe the observable effects of Hall viscosity in a simple family of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates of electrically neutral bosons, in which all of the bosons condense into a single lowest Landau level (LLL) orbital. Such phases are accessible to current cold atom experiments, and we dub them LLL superfluids. We demonstrate that LLL superfluids possess a nonuniversal Hall viscosity, leading to a range of observable consequences such as rotation of vortex-antivortex dipoles and wave-vector dependent corrections to the speed of sound. Furthermore, using a coherent state path integral approach, we present a microscopic derivation of the Landau-Ginzburg equations of a LLL superfluid, showing explicitly how Hall viscosity enters.</description>

      <title>Light-matter interactions in the vacuum of ultra-strongly coupled systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study how the peculiar properties of the vacuum state of an ultra-strongly coupled system can affect basic light-matter interaction processes. In this unconventional electromagnetic environment, an additional emitter no longer couples to the bare cavity photons, but rather to the polariton modes emerging from the ultra-strong coupling. As such, the effective light-matter interaction strength is sensitive to the properties of the distorted vacuum state. Different interpretations of our predictions in terms of modified quantum fluctuations in the vacuum state and of radiative reaction in classical electromagnetism are critically discussed. Whereas our discussion is focused on the experimentally most relevant case of intersubband polaritons in semiconductor devices, our framework is fully general and applies to generic material systems.</description>

      <title>Topological signatures of a p-wave superconducting wire through light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological index of a one-dimensional topological p-wave superconductor can be revealed when driving with a classical vector potential i.e. an electromagnetic wave, through the light-induced transition probabilities and the profile of the induced quasiparticles population. As a function of driving frequency $\omega$, it is possible to obtain a measure of this topological invariant from the resonance envelope classifying the two distinct topological phases of the short-range Kitaev wire. We propose to probe the topological phase transition in the model through the responses of the global capacitance in the presence of the light field and through the Josephson current between the wire and the proximity coupled bulk superconductor. The system may also be implemented on the Bloch sphere allowing alternative ways to measure the $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants through circuit or cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Control of topological edge modes is desirable for encoding quantum information resiliently against external noise. Their implementation on quantum hardware, however, remains a long-standing problem due to current limitations of circuit depth and noise, which grows with the number of time steps. By utilizing recently developed constant-depth quantum circuits in which the circuit depth is independent of time, we demonstrate successful long-time dynamics simulation of bulk and surface modes in topological insulators on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, which exhibits robust signatures of localized topological modes. We further identify a class of one-dimensional topological Hamiltonians that can be readily simulated with NISQ hardware. Our results provide a pathway towards stable long-time implementation of topological quantum spin systems on present day quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Controlling Markovianity with Chiral Giant Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Giant artificial atoms are promising and flexible building blocks for the implementation of analog quantum simulators. They are realized via a multi-local pattern of couplings of two-level systems to a waveguide, or to a two-dimensional photonic bath. A hallmark of giant-atom physics is their non-Markovian character in the form of self-coherent feedback, leading, e.g., to non-exponential atomic decay. The timescale of their non-Markovianity is essentially given by the time delay proportional to the distance between the various coupling points. In parallel, with the state-of-the-art experimental setups, it is possible to engineer complex phases in the atom-light couplings. Such phases simulate an artificial magnetic field, yielding a chiral behavior of the atom-light system. Here, we report a surprising connection between these two seemingly unrelated features of giant atoms, showing that the chirality of a giant atom controls its Markovianity. In particular, by adjusting the couplings' phases, a giant atom can, counterintuitively, enter an exact Markovian regime irrespectively of any inherent time delay. We illustrate this mechanism as an interference process and via a collision model picture. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of giant atom physics, and open new avenues for the control of quantum nanophotonic networks.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Quantum Dots: Insights from Dynamic Susceptibility and Quantum Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the entanglement properties of quantum dots (QDs) under a universal Hamiltonian where the Coulomb interaction between particles (electrons or holes) decouples into a charging energy and an exchange coupling term. While this formalism typically decouples the charge and spin components, the confinement-induced energy splitting can induce unexpected entanglement in the system. By analyzing the dynamic susceptibility and quantum Fisher information (QFI), we uncover intriguing behaviors influenced by exchange constants, temperature variations, and confinement effects. In Ising QDs, far below the Stoner instability point where the QD is in a disordered paramagnetic phase, temperature reductions unexpectedly lead to decreased entanglement, challenging conventional expectations. Conversely, anisotropic Heisenberg models exhibit enhanced entanglement near isotropic points. Our findings highlight the intricate interplay between exchange interactions and entanglement in QDs, laying the groundwork for future studies on topological entanglement and the influence of entanglement on material properties. Overall, this work contributes to advancing our understanding of entanglement in QDs and its potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Kondo Screening and Indirect Magnetic Exchange through a Conventional Superconductor Studied by the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between the Kondo screening and indirect magnetic exchange in systems with two magnetic impurities coupled to a conventional s-wave superconductor gives rise to a nontrivial ground-state phase diagram. Here, we utilize the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method and exploit the non-abelian spin-SU(2) symmetry to study the phase diagram for two quantum-spin-$\frac12$ impurities locally exchange coupled to large one-dimensional chains. The nonlocal inter-impurity exchange is treated as an emergent Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling. We find qualitatively different phase diagrams for impurity spins coupled to sites with odd or even distances $d$ on the chain and a partial-Kondo-screened spin-doublet phase that extends over the whole range of local exchange couplings $J$ in the limit of weak superconducting pairing strength $\Delta$. Our numerical studies are complemented by exact diagonalization of small (quantum-box) systems and by perturbative-in-$J$ computations of the $d$ and $\Delta$ dependent RKKY interaction. It is thereby demonstrated that the specific system geometry is essential for our understanding of magnetic impurity interactions in superconducting hosts, and thus for insights into the control of quantum-state properties in nanoparticle systems and topological superconductivity.</description>
