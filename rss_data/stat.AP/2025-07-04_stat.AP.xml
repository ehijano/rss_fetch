      <title>BACTA-GPT: An AI-Based Bayesian Adaptive Clinical Trial Architect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian adaptive clinical trials offer a flexible and efficient alternative to traditional fixed-design trials, but their implementation is often hindered by the complexity of Bayesian computations and the need for advanced statistical programming expertise. The authors introduce a custom fine-tuned LLM designed to assist with this and lower barriers to adoption of Bayesian methods for adaptive clinical trials. This paper describes the development and fine-tuning of BACTA-GPT, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based tool designed to assist in the implementation of Bayesian Adaptive Clinical Trials. This engine uses GPT-3.5 as the underlying model and takes in Natural Language input from the Statistician or the Trialist. The fine-tuned model demonstrates a viable proof-of-concept in its objectives. Test case evaluations show that the model is capable of generating a fit-for-purpose Bayesian model for an adaptive trial and evaluate its operating characteristics via simulations using R and JAGS. The integration of AI code generation has significant potential to lower technical barriers for the design and implementation of Bayesian Adaptive trials. But they also require attention to important considerations regarding validation and quality control.</description>

      <title>A Variance Decomposition Approach to Inconclusives in Forensic Black Box Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the US, `black box' studies are increasingly being used to estimate the error rate of forensic disciplines. A sample of forensic examiner participants are asked to evaluate a set of items whose source is known to the researchers but not to the participants. Participants are asked to make a source determination (typically an identification, exclusion, or some kind of inconclusive). We study inconclusives in two black box studies, one on fingerprints and one on bullets. Rather than treating all inconclusive responses as functionally correct (as is the practice in reported error rates in the two studies we address), irrelevant to reported error rates (as some would do), or treating them all as potential errors (as others would do), we propose that the overall pattern of inconclusives in a particular black box study can shed light on the proportion of inconclusives that are due to examiner variability. Raw item and examiner variances are computed, and compared with the results of a logistic regression model that takes account of which items were addressed by which examiner. The error rates reported in black box studies are substantially smaller than ``failure rate" analyses that take inconclusives into account. The magnitude of this difference is highly dependent on the particular study at hand.</description>

      <title>Strategies and statistical evaluation of Italy's regional model for COVID-19 restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive assessment of the Italian risk model used during the COVID-19 pandemic to guide regional mobility restrictions through a colour-coded classification system. The research focuses on evaluating the variables selected by the Italian Ministry of Health for this purpose and their effectiveness in supporting public health decision-making. The analysis adopts a statistical framework which combines data reduction and regression modelling techniques to enhance interpretability and predictive accuracy. Dimensionality reduction is applied to address multicollinearity and simplify complex variable structures, while an ordinal regression model is employed to investigate the relationship between the reduced set of variables and the colour regional classifications. Model performance is evaluated using classification error metrics, providing insights into the adequacy of the selected variables in explaining the decision-making process. Results reveal significant redundancy within the variables chosen by the Italian Ministry of Health, suggesting that excessive predictors may compromise information. To address this, the study proposes refined and robust predictive models for regional classification, offering a reliable tool of the proposed framework and to support public health decision-makers. This study contributes to the ongoing development of quantitative methodologies aimed at improving the effectiveness of statistical models in guiding public health policies. The findings offer valuable insights for refining data-driven decision-making processes during health crises and improving the quality of information available to policymakers.</description>

      <title>Causal Representation Learning with Generative Artificial Intelligence: Application to Texts as Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how to enhance the validity of causal inference with unstructured high-dimensional treatments like texts, by leveraging the power of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Specifically, we propose to use a deep generative model such as large language models (LLMs) to efficiently generate treatments and use their internal representation for subsequent causal effect estimation. We show that the knowledge of this true internal representation helps disentangle the treatment features of interest, such as specific sentiments and certain topics, from other possibly unknown confounding features. Unlike existing methods, the proposed GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI) methodology eliminates the need to learn causal representation from the data, and hence produces more accurate and efficient estimates. We formally establish the conditions required for the nonparametric identification of the average treatment effect, propose an estimation strategy that avoids the violation of the overlap assumption, and derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator through the application of double machine learning. Finally, using an instrumental variables approach, we extend the proposed methodology to the settings in which the treatment feature is based on human perception. The proposed GPI methodology is also applicable to text reuse where an LLM is used to regenerate existing texts. We conduct simulation and empirical studies, using the generated text data from an open-source LLM, Llama 3, to illustrate the advantages of our estimator over state-of-the-art causal representation learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Ridge Regression for Manifold-valued Time-Series with Application to Meteorological Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a natural intrinsic extension of the ridge regression from Euclidean spaces to general manifolds, which relies on Riemannian least-squares fitting, empirical covariance, and Mahalanobis distance. We utilize it for time-series prediction and apply the approach to forecast hurricane tracks and their wind speeds.</description>

      <title>Generalized coarsened confounding for causal effects: a large-sample framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been widespread use of causal inference methods for the rigorous analysis of observational studies and to identify policy evaluations. In this article, we consider a class of generalized coarsened procedures for confounding. At a high level, these procedures can be viewed as performing a clustering of confounding variables, followed by treatment effect and attendant variance estimation using the confounder strata. In addition, we propose two new algorithms for generalized coarsened confounding. While Iacus et al. (2011) developed some statistical properties for one special case in our class of procedures, we instead develop a general asymptotic framework. We provide asymptotic results for the average causal effect estimator as well as providing conditions for consistency. In addition, we provide an asymptotic justification for the variance formulae in Iacus et al. (2011). A bias correction technique is proposed, and we apply the proposed methodology to data from two well-known observational studies.</description>

      <title>Generating Hypotheses of Dynamic Causal Graphs in Neuroscience: Leveraging Generative Factor Models of Observed Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reduced Efficiency in the Attentional Network During Distractor Suppression in Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a critical transitional stage between normal cognitive aging and dementia, making its early detection essential. This study investigates the neural mechanisms of distractor suppression in MCI patients using EEG and behavioral data during an attention-cueing Eriksen flanker task. A cohort of 56 MCIs and 26 healthy controls (HCs) performed tasks with congruent and incongruent stimuli of varying saliency levels. During these tasks, EEG data were analyzed for alpha band coherence's functional connectivity, focusing on Global Efficiency (GE), while Reaction Time (RT) and Hit Rate (HR) were also collected.
  Our findings reveal significant interactions between congruency, saliency, and cognitive status on GE, RT, and HR. In HCs, congruent conditions resulted in higher GE (p = 0.0114, multivariate t-distribution correction, MVT), faster RTs (p &lt; 0.0001, MVT), and higher HRs (p &lt; 0.0001, MVT) compared to incongruent conditions. HCs also showed increased GE in salient conditions for incongruent trials (p = 0.0406, MVT). MCIs exhibited benefits from congruent conditions with shorter RTs and higher HRs (both p &lt; 0.0001, MVT) compared to incongruent conditions but showed reduced adaptability in GE, with no significant GE differences between conditions.
  These results highlight the potential of alpha band coherence and GE as early markers for cognitive impairment. By integrating GE, RT, and HR, this study provides insights into the interplay between neural efficiency, processing speed, and task accuracy. This approach offers valuable insights into cognitive load management and interference effects, indicating benefits for interventions aimed at improving attentional control and processing speed in MCIs.</description>
