      <title>Borel Complexity of the Isomorphism Relation of Archimedean Orders in Finitely Generated Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2020, Calderoni, Marker, Motto Ros and Shani asked what the Borel complexity of the isomorphism relation of Archimedean orders on $\mathbb{Q}^n$ is. We answer this question by proving that the isomorphism relation of Archimedean orders on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is not hyperfinite when $n \geq 3$ and not treeable when $n \geq 4$. As a corollary, we get that the isomorphism relation of Archimedean orders on $\mathbb{Q}^n$ is not hyperfinite when $n \geq 3$ and not treeable when $n \geq 4$.</description>

      <title>The $\kappa$-Strongly Proper Forcing Axiom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.02130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study methods to obtain the consistency of forcing axioms, and particularly higher forcing axioms. We first force over a model with a supercompact cardinal $\theta&gt;\kappa$ to get the consistency of the forcing axiom for $\kappa$-strongly proper forcing notions which are also $\kappa$-lattice, and then eliminate the need for large cardinals. The proof goes through a natural reflection property for $\kappa$-strongly proper forcings. We also produce a model of this forcing axiom with $2^\kappa$ arbitrarily large, and prove the inconsistency of certain natural strengthenings of the axiom.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of ZF with an elementary embedding from $V_{\lambda+2}$ into $V_{\lambda+2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.01077v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to a theorem due to Kenneth Kunen, under ZFC, there is no ordinal $\lambda$ and non-trivial elementary embedding $j:V_{\lambda+2}\to V_{\lambda+2}$. His proof relied on the Axiom of Choice (AC), and no proof from ZF alone has been discovered.
  $I_{0,\lambda}$ is the assertion, introduced by W. Hugh Woodin, that $\lambda$ is an ordinal and there is an elementary embedding $j:L(V_{\lambda+1})\to L(V_{\lambda+1})$ with critical point ${&lt;\lambda}$. And $I_0$ asserts that $I_{0,\lambda}$ holds for some $\lambda$. The axiom $I_0$ is one of the strongest large cardinals not known to be inconsistent with AC. It is usually studied assuming ZFC in the full universe $V$ (in which case $\lambda$ must be a limit ordinal), but we assume only ZF.
  We prove, assuming ZF + $I_{0,\lambda}$ + "$\lambda$ is an even ordinal", that there is a proper class transitive inner model $M$ containing $V_{\lambda+1}$ and satisfying ZF + $I_{0,\lambda}$ + "there is an elementary embedding $k:V_{\lambda+2}\to V_{\lambda+2}$"; in fact we will have $k\subseteq j$, where $j$ witnesses $I_{0,\lambda}$ in $M$. This result was first proved by the author under the added assumption that $V_{\lambda+1}^\#$ exists; Gabe Goldberg noticed that this extra assumption was unnecessary. If also $\lambda$ is a limit ordinal and $\lambda$-DC holds in $V$, then the model $M$ will also satisfy $\lambda$-DC.
  We show that ZFC + "$\lambda$ is even" + $I_{0,\lambda}$ implies $A^\#$ exists for every $A\in V_{\lambda+1}$, but if consistent, this theory does not imply $V_{\lambda+1}^\#$ exists.</description>

      <title>Full normalization for transfinite stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.03359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the extension of normal iteration strategies with appropriate condensation properties to strategies for stacks of normal trees, with full normalization. Given a regular uncountable cardinal $\Omega$ and an $(m,\Omega+1)$-iteration strategy $\Sigma$ for a premouse $M$, such that $\Sigma$ and $M$ both have appropriate condensation properties, we extend $\Sigma$ to a strategy $\Sigma^*$ for the optimal-$(m,\Omega,\Omega+1)^*$-iteration game such that for all $\lambda&lt;\Omega$ and all stacks $\vec{\mathcal{T}}=\left&lt;\mathcal{T}_\alpha\right&gt;_{\alpha&lt;\lambda}$ via $\Sigma^*$, consisting of normal trees $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$, each of length ${&lt;\Omega}$, there is a corresponding normal tree $\mathcal{X}$ via $\Sigma$ with $M^{\vec{\mathcal{T}}}_\infty=M^{\mathcal{X}}_\infty$. Moreover, if there are no drops in model or degree along the main branches of these trees then the overall iteration maps $i^{\vec{\mathcal{T}}}:M\to M^{\vec{\mathcal{T}}}_\infty$ and $i^{\mathcal{X}}:M\to M^{\mathcal{X}}_\infty$ agree. The construction is the result of a combination of work of John Steel and of the author.
  We also establish some further useful properties of $\Sigma^*$, and use the methods to analyze the comparison of multiple iterates via a common such strategy.</description>

      <title>Categorifying computable reducibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents categorical formulations of Turing, Medvedev, Muchnik, and Weihrauch reducibilities in Computability Theory, utilizing Lawvere doctrines. While the first notions lend themselves to a smooth categorical presentation, essentially dualizing the traditional notion of realizability doctrines, Weihrauch reducibility and its extensions for represented and multi-represented spaces require a thorough investigation and the formulation of a new appropriate extension of the category of assemblies as a foundation for the respective doctrine.
  Our abstract analysis of these concepts highlights a shared characteristic among all these reducibilities. Specifically, we demonstrate that all these doctrines stemming from computability concepts can be proven to be instances of completions of quantifiers for doctrines, analogous to what occurs for doctrines for realizability.
  As a corollary of these results, we will be formally able to compare Weihrauch reducibility with the dialectica doctrine constructed from a doctrine representing Turing degrees.</description>

      <title>Non-distributive description logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define LE-ALC, a generalization of the description logic ALC based on the propositional logic of general (i.e. not necessarily distributive) lattices, and semantically interpreted on relational structures based on formal contexts from Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The description logic LE-ALC allows us to formally describe databases with objects, features, and formal concepts, represented according to FCA as Galois-stable sets of objects and features. We describe ABoxes and TBoxes in LE-ALC, provide a tableaux algorithm for checking the consistency of LE-ALC knowledge bases with acyclic TBoxes, and show its termination, soundness and completeness. Interestingly, consistency checking for LE-ALC with acyclic TBoxes is in PTIME, while the complexity of the consistency checking of classical ALC with acyclic TBoxes is PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Wand/set theories: A realization of Conway's mathematicians' liberation movement, with an application to Church's set theory with a universal set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here is a template for introducing mathematical objects: "Objects are found in stages. For every stage S: (1) for any things found before S, you find at S the bland set whose members are exactly those things; (2) for anything, $x$, which was found before S, you find at S the result of tapping $x$ with any magic wand (provided that the result is not itself a bland set); you find nothing else at S."
  This Template has rich applications; it realizes John Conway's (1976) Mathematicians' Liberation Movement; and it generalizes a lovely idea due to Alonzo Church (1974). Some parts of this Template are familiar: the bit about bland sets is just the ordinary story we tell about the cumulative iterative conception of set. But the talk of "magic wands" is new and different. Moreover, parts of the story are left unspecified.
  This under-specification is deliberate: we want to be able to flesh out the Template in umpteen different ways. The Main Theorem of the paper is that any loosely constructive way of fleshing out the Template is synonymous with a ZF-like theory.</description>

      <title>Game semantics for lattice-based modal {\mu}-calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize modal $\mu$-calculus to the non-distributive (lattice-based) modal $\mu$-calculus and formalize some scenarios regarding categorization using it. We also provide a game semantics for the developed logic. The proof of adequacy of this game semantics proceeds by generalizing the unfolding games on the power-set algebras to the arbitrary lattices and showing that these games can be used to determine the least and the greatest fixed points of a monotone operator on a lattice. Finally, we define a notion of bisimulations on the polarities and show invariance of non-distributive modal $\mu$-calculus under them.</description>

      <title>P-measures in models without P-points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We answer in negative the problem if the existence of a P-measure implies the existence of a P-point. Namely, we show that if we add random reals to a certain unique P-point model, then in the resulting model we will have a P-measure but not P-points. Also, we investigate the question if there is a P-measure in the Silver model. We show that rapid filters cannot be extended to a P-measure in the extension by $\omega$ product of Silver forcings and that in the model obtained by the product of $\omega_2$ many Silver forcings there are no P-measures of countable Maharam type</description>

      <title>Decomposition of P{\l}onka sums into direct systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The P{\l}onka sum is an algebra determined using a structure called a direct system. By a direct system, we mean an indexed family of algebras with disjoint universes whose indexes form a join-semilattice s.t. if two indexes are in a partial order relation, then there is a homomorphism from the algebra of the first index to the algebra of the second index. The sum of the sets of the direct system determines the universe of the P{\l}onka sum. Therefore, to speak about a P{\l}onka sum, there must be a direct system on which this algebra is based. However, we can look at a P{\l}onka sum the other way around, considering it as some given algebra, and ask whether it is possible to determine all direct systems of it systematically.
  In our paper, we will decompose the P{\l}onka sum in such a way as to give a solution to the indicated problem. Moreover, our method works for any algebra of the kind considered in the article, and thus, we can determine if a given algebra is a P{\l}onka sum. The proposed method is based on two concepts introduced in the paper: isolated algebra and P{\l}onka homomorphism.</description>
