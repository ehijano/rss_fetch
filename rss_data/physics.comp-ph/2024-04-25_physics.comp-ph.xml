      <title>Extended Thermodynamic and Mechanical Evolution Criterion for Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Glansdorff and Prigogine General Evolution Criterion (GEC) is an inequality that holds for macroscopic physical systems obeying local equilibrium and that are constrained under timeindependent boundary conditions. The latter, however, may prove overly restrictive for many applications involving fluid flow in physics, chemistry and biology. We therefore analyze in detail a physically more-encompassing evolution criterion for time-dependent convective viscous flow with time-dependent boundary conditions. The result is an inequality involving the sum of a bulk volume and a surface contribution, and reduces to the GEC if and only if the surface term is zero. We use the closed-form analytical solution of the starting flow problem in straight cylindrical pipes to confirm this extended general evolution criterion. We next validate the starting flow problem and evolution criterion numerically. Numerical methods are used to validate the extended evolution criterion in non-fully developed flows inside complex geometries with curvature and torsion, such as encountered in sections of helical pipes. Knowledge of only the algebraic sign of the surface contribution is sufficient for predicting how the volume thermodynamic forces evolve in time and how the system approaches its non-equilibrium stationary state consistent with the boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Geant4 Neutron-HP package: Unresolved Resonance Region description with Probability Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether for shielding applications or for criticality safety studies, solving the neutron transport equation with good accuracy requires to take into account the resonant structure of cross sections in part of the Unresolved Resonance Region (URR). In this energy range even if the resonances can no longer be resolved experimentally, neglecting them can lead to significant numerical biases, namely in flux-based quantities. In Geant4, low energy neutrons are transported using evaluated nuclear data libraries handled by the Neutron High-Precision (Neutron-HP) package. In the version 11.01.p02 of the code, the URR can only be described by average smooth cross sections that do not take into account the statistical resonant structure of the cross sections. To overcome this shortcoming, the treatment of the URR with the use of the probability table method has been implemented in Geant4 and successfully validated with the reference Monte Carlo neutron transport codes MCNP6 (version 6.2) and Tripoli-4 (version 12). These developments will be taken into account in the next release of Geant4. All the validations of Geant4 have been performed with probability tables generated from both the NJOY and CALENDF pre-processing tools. Therefore Geant4 now has this unique feature to study the relative impact of the strategies involved during the production of probability table by the two pre-processing codes. This has been used to show that self-shielding is important also for inelastic cross sections in the example of 238U. The tool to generate probability tables usable by Geant4 either from NJOY or from CALENDF is made available on a dedicated GitLab repository and will be included in Geant4.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Generators and the New Frontier of Computational Sampling in Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper by No\'e et al. [F. No\'e, S. Olsson, J. K\"ohler and H. Wu, Science, 365:6457 (2019)] introduced the concept of Boltzmann Generators (BGs), a deep generative model that can produce unbiased independent samples of many-body systems. They can generate equilibrium configurations from different metastable states, compute relative stabilities between different structures of proteins or other organic molecules, and discover new states. In this commentary, we motivate the necessity for a new generation of sampling methods beyond molecular dynamics, explain the methodology, and give our perspective on the future role of BGs.</description>

      <title>Identifying the ground state phases by spin-patterns in the Shastry-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the influence of frustration on the phases and related phase transitions in condensed matter physics is of fundamental importance in uncovering the role played by frustration. In the two-dimensional square lattice, a minimal frustration has been formulated in 1981 as the Shastry-Sutherland (SS) model described by competitions between the nearest-neighbor bond ($J_1$) and the next-nearest-neighbor one ($J_2$). In the two limits of $\alpha=J_2/J_1$, i.e. $\alpha \ll 1$ and $\alpha \gg 1$, the corresponding phases are the N{\'e}el antiferromagnet (AFM) and the dimer-singlet(DS). Unfortunately, the intermediate regime remains controversial, and the nature of transition from the N{\'e}el AFM to the intermediate state is also unclear. Here we provide a pattern language to explore the SS model and take the lattice size $L=4 \times4$ with periodic boundary condition. We firstly diagonalize the Hamiltonian in an operator space to obtain all fundamental spin-patterns and then analyze their energy and occupancy evolutions with the frustration parameter $\kappa=\alpha / (1+\alpha)$. Our results indicate that the intermediate regime is characterized by diagonal two-domain spin-pattern while the N{\'e}el AFM state has a diagonal single-domain and the DS has mixings of diagonal single- and four-domain. While the transition from the DS to the intermediate phase occurred around $\alpha_c = 1.5$ is the first-order in nature, consistent with that in literature, the one from the intermediate phase to the AFM is clearly seen around $\alpha_c = 1.277$, where it has a reversal of the contributions from the single- and two-domain patterns to the ground state. The result indicates that the pattern language is powerful in identifying the possible phases in frustrated models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the apparent horizon finding problem with multigrid methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Apparent horizon plays an important role in numerical relativity as it provides a tool to characterize the existence and properties of black holes on three-dimensional spatial slices in 3+1 numerical spacetimes. Apparent horizon finders based on different techniques have been developed. In this paper, we revisit the apparent horizon finding problem in numerical relativity using multigrid-based algorithms. We formulate the nonlinear elliptic apparent horizon equation as a linear Poisson-type equation with a nonlinear source, and solve it using a multigrid algorithm with Gauss-Seidel line relaxation. A fourth order compact finite difference scheme in spherical coordinates is derived and employed to reduce the complexity of the line relaxation operator to a tri-diagonal matrix inversion. The multigrid-based apparent horizon finder developed in this work is capable of locating apparent horizons in generic spatial hypersurfaces without any symmetries. The finder is tested with both analytic data, such as Brill-Lindquist multiple black hole data, and numerical data, including off-centered Kerr-Schild data and dynamical inspiraling binary black hole data. The obtained results are compared with those generated by the current fastest finder AHFinderDirect (Thornburg, Class. Quantum Grav. 21, 743, 2003), which is the default finder in the open source code Einstein Toolkit. Our finder performs comparatively in terms of accuracy, and starts to outperform AHFinderDirect at high angular resolutions (\sim 1^\circ) in terms of speed. Our finder is also more flexible to initial guess, as opposed to the Newton's method used in AHFinderDirect. This suggests that the multigrid algorithm provides an alternative option for studying apparent horizons, especially when high resolutions are needed.</description>

      <title>An efficient approach for searching three-body periodic orbits passing through Eulerian configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new efficient approach for searching three-body periodic equal-mass collisionless orbits passing through Eulerian configuration is presented. The approach is based on a symmetry property of the solutions at the half period. Depending on two previously established symmetry types on the shape sphere, each solution is presented by one or two distinct initial conditions (one or two points in the search domain). A numerical search based on Newton's method on a relatively coarse search grid for solutions with relatively small scale-invariant periods $T^{*}&lt;70$ is conducted. The linear systems at each Newton's iteration are computed by high order high precision Taylor series method. The search produced 12,431 initial conditions (i.c.s) corresponding to 6,333 distinct solutions. In addition to passing through the Eulerian configuration, 35 of the solutions are also free-fall ones. Although most of the found solutions are new, all linearly stable solutions among them (only 7) are old ones. Particular attention is paid to the details of the high precision computations and the analysis of accuracy. All i.c.s are given with 100 correct digits.</description>

      <title>AMEP: The Active Matter Evaluation Package for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Active Matter Evaluation Package (AMEP) is a Python library for analyzing simulation data of particle-based and continuum simulations. It provides a powerful and simple interface for handling large data sets and for calculating and visualizing a broad variety of observables that are relevant to active matter systems. Examples range from the mean-square displacement and the structure factor to cluster-size distributions, binder cumulants, and growth exponents. AMEP is written in pure Python and is based on powerful libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-image. Computationally expensive methods are parallelized and optimized to run efficiently on workstations, laptops, and high-performance computing architectures, and an HDF5-based data format is used in the backend to store and handle simulation data as well as analysis results. AMEP provides the first comprehensive framework for analyzing simulation results of both particle-based and continuum simulations (as well as experimental data) of active matter systems. In particular, AMEP also allows it to analyze simulations that combine particle-based and continuum techniques such as used to study the motion of bacteria in chemical fields or for modeling particle motion in a flow field. AMEP is available at https://amepproject.de and can be installed via conda and pip.</description>

      <title>Reduced density matrix formulation of quantum linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of spectral properties via linear response (LR) theory is an important tool in quantum chemistry for understanding photo-induced processes in molecular systems. With the advances of quantum computing, we recently adapted this method for near-term quantum hardware using a truncated active space approximation with orbital rotation, named quantum linear response (qLR). In an effort to reduce the classic cost of this hybrid approach, we here derive and implement a reduced density matrix (RDM) driven approach of qLR. This allows for the calculation of spectral properties of moderately sized molecules with much larger basis sets than so far possible. We report qLR results for benzene and $R$-methyloxirane with a cc-pVTZ basis set and study the effect of shot noise on the valence and oxygen K-edge absorption spectra of H$_2$O in the cc-pVTZ basis.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned flow as a solution to the hierarchical growth problem in the generalized Lefschetz thimble method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized Lefschetz thimble method is a promising approach that attempts to solve the sign problem in Monte Carlo methods by deforming the integration contour using the flow equation. Here we point out a general problem that occurs due to the property of the flow equation, which extends a region on the original contour exponentially to a region on the deformed contour. Since the growth rate for each eigenmode is governed by the singular values of the Hessian of the action, a huge hierarchy in the singular value spectrum, which typically appears for large systems, leads to various technical problems in numerical simulations. We solve this hierarchical growth problem by preconditioning the flow so that the growth rate becomes identical for every eigenmode. As an example, we show that the preconditioned flow enables us to investigate the real-time quantum evolution of an anharmonic oscillator with the system size that can hardly be achieved by using the original flow.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes for Ideal MHD Equations: Locally Divergence-Free and Positivity-Preserving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops structure-preserving, oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (OEDG) schemes for ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), as a sequel to our recent work [Peng, Sun, and Wu, OEDG: Oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin method for hyperbolic conservation laws, 2023]. The schemes are based on a locally divergence-free (LDF) oscillation-eliminating (OE) procedure to suppress spurious oscillations while maintaining many of the good properties of original DG schemes, such as conservation, local compactness, and optimal convergence rates. The OE procedure is built on the solution operator of a novel damping equation -- a simple linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) whose exact solution can be exactly formulated. Because this OE procedure does not interfere with DG spatial discretization and RK stage update, it can be easily incorporated to existing DG codes as an independent module. These features make the proposed LDF OEDG schemes highly efficient and easy to implement.In addition, we present a positivity-preserving (PP) analysis of the LDF OEDG schemes on Cartesian meshes via the optimal convex decomposition technique and the geometric quasi-linearization (GQL) approach. Efficient PP LDF OEDG schemes are obtained with the HLL flux under a condition accessible by the simple local scaling PP limiter.Several one- and two-dimensional MHD tests confirm the accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed structure-preserving OEDG schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a test problem for Navier-Stokes solvers based on the flow around a cylinder. We choose a range of Reynolds numbers for which the flow is time-dependent but can be characterized as essentially two-dimensional. The test problem requires accurate resolution of chaotic dynamics over a long time interval. It also requires the use of a relatively large computational domain, part of which is curved, and it requires evaluation of derivatives of the solution and pressure on the curved boundary. We review the performance of different finite element methods for the proposed range of Reynolds numbers. These tests indicate that some of the most established methods do not capture the correct behavior.</description>

      <title>Fast Exact Algorithm for Neutrino Oscillation in Constant Matter Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06900v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recently published method for solving the neutrino evolution equation with constant matter density is further refined and used to lay out an exact algorithm for computing oscillation probabilities, which is moderately faster than previous methods when looping through neutrinos of different energies. In particular, the three examples of $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ survival, $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_\mu$ survival and $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ appearance probabilities are written in terms of mixing angles, mass differences and matter electron density. A program based on this new method is found to be roughly twice as fast as, and in agreement with, the leading GLoBES package. Furthermore, the behaviour of all relevant effective parameters is sketched out in terms of a range of neutrino energies, or matter electron densities. For instance, the $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ survival probability in constant matter density is found to have no dependence on the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ or the CP-violating phase $\delta_{13}$.</description>

Abstract: The program AutoEFT is described. It allows one to generate Effective Field Theories (EFTs) from a given set of fields and symmetries. Allowed fields include scalars, spinors, gauge bosons, and gravitons. The symmetries can be local or global Lie groups based on U(1) and SU(N). The mass dimension of the EFT is limited only by the available computing resources. The operators are stored in a compact, human and machine-readable format. Aside from the program itself, we provide input files for EFTs based on the Standard Model and a number of its extensions. These include additional particles and symmetries, EFTs with minimal flavor violation, and gravitons.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear interaction of two cross-propagating plane waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ideal contrast-enhanced ultrasound image should display microbubble-induced nonlinearities while avoiding wave propagation nonlinearities. One of the most successful ultrasound pulse sequences to disentangle these nonlinear effects relies on the transmission of cross-propagating plane waves. However, theory describing the noncollinear nonlinear interaction of two finite plane waves has not been fully developed and a better understanding of these effects would improve contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging further. Here, local nonlinear interactions at the intersection of two plane-waves are investigated by extending the Westervelt equation with a term including the Lagrangian density. The Iterative Nonlinear Contrast Source (INCS) method is employed to numerically solve this full nonlinear wave equation for two 3D finite cross-propagating pulsed plane waves. In addition, analytical expressions for the cross-propagation of two infinite continuous plane waves are derived. Numerical results obtained with INCS show good agreement with the analytical expressions. Overall, the generated results show that the pressure associated with local nonlinear effects is two orders of magnitude lower than the pressure associated with global nonlinear effects. Local nonlinear effects are therefore expected to be negligible in the context of single-shot ultrasound imaging, but they may influence approaches that subtract pressure fields such as amplitude modulation or pulse inversion.</description>

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play an important role in understanding and engineering heat transport properties of complex materials. An essential requirement for reliably predicting heat transport properties is the use of accurate and efficient interatomic potentials. Recently, machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have shown great promise in providing the required accuracy for a broad range of materials. In this mini review and tutorial, we delve into the fundamentals of heat transport, explore pertinent MD simulation methods, and survey the applications of MLPs in MD simulations of heat transport. Furthermore, we provide a step-by-step tutorial on developing MLPs for highly efficient and predictive heat transport simulations, utilizing the neuroevolution potentials (NEPs) as implemented in the GPUMD package. Our aim with this mini review and tutorial is to empower researchers with valuable insights into cutting-edge methodologies that can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of MD simulations for heat transport studies.</description>

      <title>Universal stress correlations in crystalline and amorphous packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08738</link>

Abstract: We present a universal characterization of stress correlations in athermal systems, across crystalline to amorphous packings. Via numerical analysis of static configurations of particles interacting through harmonic as well as Lennard-Jones potentials, for a variety of preparation protocols and ranges of microscopic disorder, we show that the properties of the stress correlations at large lengthscales are surprisingly universal across all situations, independent of structural correlations, or the correlations in orientational order. In the near-crystalline limit, we present exact results for the stress correlations for both models, which work surprisingly well at large lengthscales, even in the amorphous phase. Finally, we study the differences in stress fluctuations across the amorphization transition, where stress correlations reveal the loss of periodicity in the structure at short lengthscales with increasing disorder.</description>

      <title>TorchMD-Net 2.0: Fast Neural Network Potentials for Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving a balance between computational speed, prediction accuracy, and universal applicability in molecular simulations has been a persistent challenge. This paper presents substantial advancements in the TorchMD-Net software, a pivotal step forward in the shift from conventional force fields to neural network-based potentials. The evolution of TorchMD-Net into a more comprehensive and versatile framework is highlighted, incorporating cutting-edge architectures such as TensorNet. This transformation is achieved through a modular design approach, encouraging customized applications within the scientific community. The most notable enhancement is a significant improvement in computational efficiency, achieving a very remarkable acceleration in the computation of energy and forces for TensorNet models, with performance gains ranging from 2-fold to 10-fold over previous iterations. Other enhancements include highly optimized neighbor search algorithms that support periodic boundary conditions and the smooth integration with existing molecular dynamics frameworks. Additionally, the updated version introduces the capability to integrate physical priors, further enriching its application spectrum and utility in research.
