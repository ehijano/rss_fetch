      <title>Renormalization of States and Quasiparticles in Many-body Downfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the principles of many-body Hamiltonian complexity reduction via downfolding on an effective low-dimensional representation. We present a unique measure of fidelity between the effective (reduced-rank) description and the full many-body treatment for arbitrary (i.e., ground and excited) states. When the entire problem is mapped on a system of interacting quasiparticles [npj Computational Materials 9 (1), 126, 2023], the effective Hamiltonians can faithfully reproduce the physics only when a clear energy scale separation exists between the subsystems and its environment. We also demonstrate that it is necessary to include quasiparticle renormalization at distinct energy scales, capturing the distinct interaction between subsystems and their surrounding environments. Numerical results from simple, exactly solvable models highlight the limitations and strengths of this approach, particularly for ground and low-lying excited states. This work lays the groundwork for applying dynamical downfolding techniques to problems concerned with (quantum) interfaces.</description>

      <title>ALKPU: an active learning method for the DeePMD model with Kalman filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network force field models such as DeePMD have enabled highly efficient large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with ab initio accuracy. However, building such models heavily depends on the training data obtained by costly electronic structure calculations, thereby it is crucial to carefully select and label the most representative configurations during model training to improve both extrapolation capability and training efficiency. To address this challenge, based on the Kalman filter theory we propose the Kalman Prediction Uncertainty (KPU) to quantify uncertainty of the model's prediction. With KPU we design the Active Learning by KPU (ALKPU) method, which can efficiently select representative configurations that should be labelled during model training. We prove that ALKPU locally leads to the fastest reduction of model's uncertainty, which reveals its rationality as a general active learning method. We test the ALKPU method using various physical system simulations and demonstrate that it can efficiently coverage the system's configuration space. Our work demonstrates the benefits of ALKPU as a novel active learning method, enhancing training efficiency and reducing computational resource demands.</description>

      <title>Predicting rigidity and connectivity percolation in disordered particulate networks using graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks can accurately predict the chemical properties of many molecular systems, but their suitability for large, macromolecular assemblies such as gels is unknown. Here, graph neural networks were trained and optimised for two large-scale classification problems: the rigidity of a molecular network, and the connectivity percolation status which is non-trivial to determine for systems with periodic boundaries. Models trained on lattice systems were found to achieve accuracies &gt;95% for rigidity classification, with slightly lower scores for connectivity percolation due to the inherent class imbalance in the data. Dynamically generated off-lattice networks achieved consistently lower accuracies overall due to the correlated nature of the network geometry that was absent in the lattices. An open source tool is provided allowing usage of the highest-scoring trained models, and directions for future improved tools to surmount the challenges limiting accuracy in certain situations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Conditional t-independent spectral gap for random quantum circuits and implications for t-design depths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question is understanding the rate at which random quantum circuits converge to the Haar measure. One quantity which is important in establishing this rate is the spectral gap of a random quantum ensemble. In this work we establish a new bound on the spectral gap of the t-th moment of a one-dimensional brickwork architecture on N qudits. This bound is independent of both t and N, provided t does not exceed the qudit dimension q. We also show that the bound is nearly optimal. The improved spectral gaps gives large improvements to the constant factors in known results on the approximate t-design depths of the 1D brickwork, of generic circuit architectures, and of specially-constructed architectures which scramble in depth O(log N). We moreover show that the spectral gap gives the dominant epsilon-dependence of the t-design depth at small epsilon. Our spectral gap bound is obtained by bounding the N-site 1D brickwork architecture by the spectra of 3-site operators. We then exploit a block-triangular hierarchy and a global symmetry in these operators in order to efficiently bound them. The technical methods used are a qualitatively different approach for bounding spectral gaps and and have little in common with previous techniques.</description>

      <title>A Characteristic Mapping Method with Source Terms: Applications to Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a generalized characteristic mapping method designed to handle non-linear advection with source terms. The semi-Lagrangian approach advances the flow map, incorporating the source term via the Duhamel integral. We derive a recursive formula for the time decomposition of the map and the source term integral, enhancing computational efficiency. Benchmark computations are presented for a test case with an exact solution and for two-dimensional ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Results demonstrate third-order accuracy in both space and time. The submap decomposition method achieves exceptionally high resolution, as illustrated by zooming into fine-scale current sheets. An error estimate is performed and suggests third order convergence in space and time.</description>

      <title>An accurate solar axions ray-tracing response of BabyIAXO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BabyIAXO is the intermediate stage of the International Axion Observatory (IAXO) to be hosted at DESY. Its primary goal is the detection of solar axions following the axion helioscope technique. Axions are converted into photons in a large magnet that is pointing to the sun. The resulting X-rays are focused by appropriate X-ray optics and detected by sensitive low-background detectors placed at the focal spot. The aim of this article is to provide an accurate quantitative description of the different components (such as the magnet, optics, and X-ray detectors) involved in the detection of axions. Our efforts have focused on developing robust and integrated software tools to model these helioscope components, enabling future assessments of modifications or upgrades to any part of the IAXO axion helioscope and evaluating the potential impact on the experiment's sensitivity. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the application of these tools by presenting a precise signal calculation and response analysis of BabyIAXO's sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling. Though focusing on the Primakoff solar flux component, our virtual helioscope model can be used to test different production mechanisms, allowing for direct comparisons within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Self-passivation Causes the Different Fermi Level Pinning between Metal-Si and Metal-Ge Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-Ge contacts possess much stronger Fermi level pinning (FLP) than metal-Si contacts, which is commonly believed to be due to Ge having a narrower bandgap and higher permittivity in the context of FLP caused by metal-induced gap states. Here, we show that both Ge and Si have a similar FLP strength if they adopt an identical interface chemical bonding configuration at the contact interface by performing first-principles calculations: Si and Ge have FLP factors of 0.16 and 0.11, respectively, if they adopt the same reconstructed bonding configuration and have FLP factors of 0.05 and 0, respectively, if they adopt the same non-reconstructed bonding configuration. We illustrate that Ge prefers the latter configuration at the contact interface, which has denser dangling-bond-induced surface states, and Si prefers the latter one, which has a self-passivation effect for reducing the dangling bond-induced interface states, to reproduce the experimental data. By revealing the significance of dangling bond-induced interface gap states on FLP, these findings shed new light on lowering the contact resistance for developing future Si CMOS technology.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Construction of Non-Intrusive Nonlinear Structural Dynamics Reduced Order Models through Hyperreduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique to significantly reduce the offline cost associated to non-intrusive nonlinear tensors identification in reduced order models (ROMs) of geometrically nonlinear, finite elements (FE)-discretized structural dynamics problems. The ROM is obtained by Galerkin-projection of the governing equations on a reduction basis (RB) of Vibration Modes (VMs) and Static Modal Derivatives (SMDs), resulting in reduced internal forces that are cubic polynomial in the reduced coordinates. The unknown coefficients of the nonlinear tensors associated with this polynomial representation are identified using a modified version of Enhanced Enforced Displacement (EED) method which leverages Energy Conserving Sampling and Weighting (ECSW) as hyperreduction technique for efficiency improvement. Specifically, ECSW is employed to accelerate the evaluations of the nonlinear reduced tangent stiffness matrix that are required within EED. Simulation-free training sets of forces for ECSW are obtained from displacements corresponding to quasi-random samples of a nonlinear second order static displacement manifold. The proposed approach is beneficial for the investigation of the dynamic response of structures subjected to acoustic loading, where multiple VMs must be added in the RB, resulting in expensive nonlinear tensor identification. Superiority of the novel method over standard EED is demonstrated on FE models of a shallow curved clamped panel and of a nine-bay aeronautical reinforced panel modelled, using the commercial finite element program Abaqus.</description>

      <title>Do deep neural networks behave like structural glasses?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with exponent $\approx -0.5$, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.</description>

      <title>Rapid Forecast and Optimization of Geological CO2 Storage in Deep Saline Aquifers: A Data-driven Dynamic Mode Decomposition Model Order Reduction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven and non-intrusive DMDc and DMDspc models successfully expedite the reconstruction and forecasting of CO2 fluid flow with acceptable accuracy margins, aiding in the rapid optimization of geological CO2 storage forecast and optimization. DMDc and DMDspc models were trained with weekly, monthly, and yearly simulation pressure and CO2 saturation fields using a commercial simulator. The domain of interest is a large-scale, offshore, highly heterogeneous reservoir model with over 100,000 cells. DMD snapshot reconstruction significantly reduced simulation times from several hours to mere minutes. DMDspc reduced the number of DMD modes for pressure without losing accuracy while sometimes even improving accuracy. Two operation cases were considered: 1. CO2 injection, 2. CO2 injection and water production for pressure maintenance. For pressure, DMDspc achieved a slightly higher than DMDc average error by removing several modes. On the other hand, DMDspc showed limited success in reducing modes for CO2 saturation. The forecast performance of DMD models was evaluated using percent change error, mean absolute error and Pearsons R correlation coefficient metrics. Almost all DMD pressure models managed to successfully forecast pressure fields, while a smaller number of DMD models managed to forecast CO2 saturation. While forecast errors have a considerable range, only DMD models with errors below 5% PCE for pressure or 0.01 MAE for saturation were considered acceptable for geological CO2 storage optimization. Optimized CO2 injection and water production amounts were consistent across selected DMD models and all time scales. The DMDspc-monitored cells approach, which only reconstructs the monitored-during-optimization cells, reduced even further optimization time while providing consistent results with the optimization that used full snapshot reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Integration of Active Learning and MCMC Sampling for Efficient Bayesian Calibration of Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and surrogate modelling have significantly enhanced the feasibility of Bayesian analysis across engineering fields. However, the selection and integration of surrogate models and cutting-edge MCMC algorithms, often depend on ad-hoc decisions. A systematic assessment of their combined influence on analytical accuracy and efficiency is notably lacking. The present work offers a comprehensive comparative study, employing a scalable case study in computational mechanics focused on the inference of spatially varying material parameters, that sheds light on the impact of methodological choices for surrogate modelling and sampling. We show that a priori training of the surrogate model introduces large errors in the posterior estimation even in low to moderate dimensions. We introduce a simple active learning strategy based on the path of the MCMC algorithm that is superior to all a priori trained models, and determine its training data requirements. We demonstrate that the choice of the MCMC algorithm has only a small influence on the amount of training data but no significant influence on the accuracy of the resulting surrogate model. Further, we show that the accuracy of the posterior estimation largely depends on the surrogate model, but not even a tailored surrogate guarantees convergence of the MCMC.Finally, we identify the forward model as the bottleneck in the inference process, not the MCMC algorithm. While related works focus on employing advanced MCMC algorithms, we demonstrate that the training data requirements render the surrogate modelling approach infeasible before the benefits of these gradient-based MCMC algorithms on cheap models can be reaped.</description>

      <title>DiscoTEX 1.0: Discontinuous collocation and implicit-turned-explicit (IMTEX) integration symplectic, symmetric numerical algorithms with higher order jumps for differential equations I: numerical black hole perturbation theory applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dirac $\delta-$ distributionally sourced differential equations emerge in many dynamical physical systems from machine learning, finance, neuroscience, and seismology to black hole perturbation theory. These systems lack exact analytical solutions and are thus best tackled numerically. We describe a generic numerical algorithm which constructs discontinuous spatial and temporal discretisations by operating on discontinuous Lagrange and Hermite interpolation formulae, respectively. By solving the distributionally sourced wave equation, possessing analytical solutions, we demonstrate that numerical weak-form solutions can be recovered to high-order accuracy by solving a first-order reduced system of ODEs. The method-of-lines framework is applied to the \texttt{DiscoTEX} algorithm i.e. through \underline{dis}continuous \underline{co}llocation with implicit\underline{-turned-explicit} integration methods which are symmetric and conserve symplectic structure. Furthermore, the main application of the algorithm is proved by calculating the amplitude at any desired location within the numerical grid, including at the position (and at its right and left limit) where the wave- (or wave-like) equation is discontinuous via interpolation using \texttt{DiscoTEX}. This is demonstrated, firstly by solving the wave- (or wave-like) equation and comparing the numerical weak-form solution to the exact solution. We further demonstrate how to reconstruct the gravitational metric perturbations from weak-form numerical solutions of a non-rotating black hole, which do not have known exact analytical solutions, and compare them against state-of-the-art frequency domain results. We conclude by motivating how \texttt{DiscoTEX}, and related numerical algorithms, both open a promising new alternative waveform generation route for modelling highly asymmetric binaries and complement current frequency domain methods.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent advancements in theoretical and experimental studies of the high-energy excitations on an antiferromagnetic trimer chain, we numerically investigate the quantum phase transition and composite dynamics in this system by applying a magnetic field. The numerical methods we used include the exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, time-dependent variational principle, and cluster perturbation theory. From calculating the entanglement entropy, we have revealed the phase diagram which includes the XY-I, $1/3$ magnetization plateau, XY-II, and ferromagnetic phases. Both the critical XY-I and XY-II phases are characterized by the conformal field theory with a central charge $c \simeq 1$. By analyzing the dynamic spin structure factor, we elucidate the distinct features of spin dynamics across different phases. In the regime with weak intertrimer interaction, we identify the intermediate-energy and high-energy modes in the XY-I and $1/3$ magnetization plateau phases as internal trimer excitations, corresponding to the propagating of doublons and quartons, respectively. Notably, applying a magnetic field splits the high-energy spectrum into two branches, labeled as the upper quarton and lower quarton. Furthermore, we explore the spin dynamics of a frustrated trimerized model closely related to the quantum magnet \ce{Na_2Cu_3Ge_4O_12}. In the end, we extend our discuss on the possibility of the quarton Bose-Einstein condensation in the trimer systems. Our results are expected to be further verified through the inelastic neutron scattering and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and also provide valuable insights for exploring high-energy exotic excitations.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robust Detection of Quantum Phase Transitions</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing allows for the manipulation of highly correlated states whose properties quickly go beyond the capacity of any classical method to calculate. Thus one natural problem which could lend itself to quantum advantage is the study of ground-states of condensed matter models, and the transitions between them. However, current levels of hardware noise can require extensive application of error-mitigation techniques to achieve reliable computations. In this work, we use several IBM devices to explore a finite-size spin model with multiple `phase-like' regions characterized by distinct ground-state configurations. Using pre-optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) solutions, we demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be used to identify level crossings in a simple, noise-robust manner which is agnostic to the method of ground state preparation. This work shows promising potential for near-term application to identifying quantum phase transitions, including avoided crossings and non-adiabatic conical intersections in electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions of correlated systems from graph neural networks with quantum embedding techniques</title>

Abstract: Correlated systems represent a class of materials that are difficult to describe through traditional electronic structure methods. The computational demand to simulate the structural dynamics of such systems, with correlation effects considered, is substantial. Here, we investigate the structural dynamics of $f$- and $d$-electron correlated systems by integrating quantum embedding techniques with interatomic potentials derived from graph neural networks. For Cerium, a prototypical correlated $f$-electron system, we use Density Functional Theory with the Gutzwiller approximation to generate training data due to efficiency with which correlations effects are included for large multi-orbital systems. For Nickel Oxide, a prototypical correlated $d$-electron system, advancements in computational capabilities now permit the use of full Dynamical Mean Field Theory to obtain energies and forces. We train neural networks on this data to create a model of the potential energy surface, enabling rapid and effective exploration of structural dynamics. Utilizing these potentials, we delineate transition pathways between the $\alpha$, $\alpha'$, and $\alpha''$ phases of Cerium and predict the melting curve of Nickel Oxide. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning potentials to accelerate the study of strongly correlated systems, offering a scalable approach to explore and understand the complex physics governing these materials.</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio Approach to Many-Body Quantum Spin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13190</link>

Abstract: A fundamental longstanding problem in studying spin models is the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of the long-time behavior of larger systems. The exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the entanglement accumulation at long times pose major challenges for current methods. To address these issues, we employ the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) framework to simulate the many-body spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model in various settings, including the Ising and XYZ limits with different interaction ranges and random couplings. Benchmarks with analytical and exact numerical approaches show that ML-MCTDH accurately captures the time evolution of one- and two-body observables in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. A comparison of ML-MCTDH with the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) demonstrates that our approach excels in handling anisotropic models and consistently provides better results for two-point observables in all simulation instances. Our results indicate that the multilayer structure of ML-MCTDH is a promising numerical framework for handling the dynamics of generic many-body spin systems.</description>
