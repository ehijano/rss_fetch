      <title>Anomalous increasing super reflectance in chiral matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic and anomalous Hall conductivities induce anomalous transport features and novel optical phenomena in chiral systems. Here, we investigate reflection properties on the surface of a medium ruled by axion electrodynamics, which effectively describes optical aspects of Weyl semimetals. We show that these chiral media can manifest anomalous reflectance (R greater than unity) for some frequency windows, depending on the signs of the two involved conductivities. Such a reflectance can increase with the frequency, being always greater than 1 in certain frequency bands. We also examine the complex Kerr angles at normal incidence on the chiral medium. Giant Kerr angle is observed within the absorption window, while the Kerr ellipticity may be used to determine the relative sign of the magnetic conductivity.</description>

      <title>Emergent-gravity Hall effect from quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a Hall effect driven by effective gravitational fields arising from quantum geometry. We develop four mechanisms for this ''emergent-gravity Hall effect" : real-space gravity, momentum-space gravity, gravitional anomalous velocity, and gravitational Lorentz force which are described by the Christoffel symbols in real, momentum, and time spaces. We construct a unified theoretical framework to systematically investigate the effects of emergent gravity in these spaces on transport phenomena based on the semiclassical theory. We demonstrate these effects by model calculations and clarify the conditions under which a finite Hall response can arise. Our findings open a new avenue for exploring gravitational effects in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Proximity-induced flat bands and topological properties in a decorated diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, we propose a unique scheme to generate and control multiple flat bands in a decorated diamond chain by using a strain-induced proximity effect between the diagonal sites of each diamond plaquette. This is in complete contrast to the conventional diamond chain, in which the interplay between the lattice topology and an external magnetic flux leads to an extreme localization of the single-particle states, producing the flat bands in the energy spectrum. Such a strain-induced proximity effect will enable us to systematically control one of the diagonal hoppings in the decorated diamond chain, which will lead to the formation of both gapless and gapped flat bands in the energy spectrum. These gapless or gapped flat bands have been corroborated by the computation of the compact localized states amplitude distribution as well as the density of states of the system using a real space calculation. We have also shown that these flat bands are robust against the introduction of small amounts of random onsite disorder in the system. In addition to this, we have also classified the nontrivial topological properties of the system by calculating the winding numbers and edge states for the gapped energy spectrum. These findings could be easily realized experimentally using the laser-induced photonic lattice platforms.</description>

      <title>Phononic frictional losses of a particle crossing a crystal: linear-response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address weak-coupling frictional sliding with phononic dissipation by means of analytic many-body techniques.
  Our model consists of a particle (the "slider") moving through a two- or three-dimensional crystal and interacting weakly with its atoms, and therefore exciting phonons.
  By means of linear-response theory we obtain explicit expressions for the friction force slowing down the slider as a function of its speed, and compare them to the friction obtained by simulations, demonstrating a remarkable accord.</description>

      <title>Crystal tensor properties of magnetic materials with and without spin-orbit coupling. Application of spin point groups as approximate symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin space groups, formed by operations where the rotation of the spins is independent of the accompanying operation acting on the crystal structure, are appropriate groups to describe the symmetry of magnetic structures with null spin-orbit coupling. Their corresponding spin point groups are the symmetry groups to be considered for deriving the symmetry constraints on the form of the crystal tensor properties of such idealized structures. These groups can also be taken as approximate symmetries (with some restrictions) of real magnetic structures, where spin-orbit and magnetic anisotropy are however present. Here we formalize the invariance transformation properties that must satisfy the most important crystal tensors under a spin point group. This is done using modified Jahn symbols, which generalize those applicable to ordinary magnetic point groups [Gallego et al., Acta Cryst. (2019) A75, 438-447]. The analysis includes not only equilibrium tensors, but also transport, optical and non-linear optical susceptibility tensors. The constraints imposed by spin collinearity and coplanarity within the spin group formalism on a series of representative tensors are discussed and compiled. As illustrative examples, the defined tensor invariance equations have been applied to some known magnetic structures, showing the differences of the symmetry-adapted form of some relevant tensors, when considered under the constraints of its spin point group or its magnetic point group. This comparison, with the spin point group implying additional constraints in the tensor form, can allow one to distinguish those magnetic-related properties that can be solely attributed to spin-orbit coupling from those that are expected even when spin-orbit coupling is negligible.</description>

      <title>Role of Nonstabilizerness in Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum optimization has emerged as a promising approach for tackling complicated classical optimization problems using quantum devices. However, the extent to which such algorithms harness genuine quantum resources and the role of these resources in their success remain open questions. In this work, we investigate the resource requirements of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) through the lens of the resource theory of nonstabilizerness. We demonstrate that the nonstabilizerness in QAOA increases with circuit depth before it reaches a maximum, to fall again during the approach to the final solution state -- creating a barrier that limits the algorithm's capability for shallow circuits. We find curves corresponding to different depths to collapse under a simple rescaling, and we reveal a nontrivial relationship between the final nonstabilizerness and the success probability. Finally, we identify a similar nonstabilizerness barrier also in adiabatic quantum annealing. Our results provide deeper insights into how quantum resources influence quantum optimization.</description>

      <title>Computational Study of the Spectral Behaviour of Different Isospectrally Patterned Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a computational spectral analysis of different isospectrally patterned lattices (IPL). Having been introduced very recently, the lattice Hamiltonian of IPL consist of coupled cells which possess all the same set of eigenvalues. The latter is achieved in a controllable manner by parametrizing the cells via the phases of the involved orthogonal (or unitary) transformations. This opens the doorway of systematically designing lattice Hamiltonians with unique properties by choosing correspondingly varying phases across the lattice. Here we focus on two-dimensional cells and explore symmetric as well as asymmetric IPL w.r.t. a given center. A tunable fraction of localized vs. delocalized eigenstates belonging to the three subdomains of the corresponding energy bands is demonstrated and analyzed with different measures of localization. In the asymmetric case the center of localization can be shifted arbitrarily by shifting the underlying phase grid. Introducing a complete phase revolution leads for low and high energies to two well-separated branches of localized states which finally merge with increasing energy into the branch of delocalized states. Remarkably, the localized states appear in near-degenerate pairs and this near-degeneracy is lifted upon entering the delocalization regime. A corresponding generalization to several phase revolutions is provided showing a characteristic nodal pattern among the near-degenerate eigenstates.</description>
