      <title>Bonding and the dynamics of glassy network liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Random First Order Transition (RFOT) theory of glasses provides a unified framework for explaining the observed correlations of the kinetic and thermodynamic behaviors of glass-forming liquids having a wide variety of chemical compositions and interactions. The theory also provides a solid starting point for calculating glassy dynamics starting from the microscopic forces. Network liquids, which interact via long-lived, geometrically constraining interactions, such as covalent bonding, have competing energy scales for bond breaking events and for collective particle rearrangement events. In this paper, we show microscopic calculations via the RFOT theory can predict how glassy dynamics depends on the degree of bonding, focusing on mixtures of network-forming particles with non-bonding impurities as in familiar window glass. By introducing soft-core nonbonding interactions, we show the viscosity and fragility of the network liquid model can be computed as a function of composition, temperature, and density or pressure. We find that the fragility in the strong-bond limit depends only on composition and not on the bond breaking energy and describes well corresponding measurements in sodium or potassium silicates. The model predicts that materials with weaker bonds may show a non-monotonic trend in the fragility as a function of composition.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis and lifetime prediction of adhesive lap joints in contact with aggressive environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a multiscale model of adhesive layers undergoing impurity-dependent cohesive fracture. The model contemplates three scales: i) at the atomic scale, fracture is controlled by interatomic separation and the thermodynamics of separation depends on temperature and impurity concentration; ii) the mesoscale is characterized by the collective response of a large number of interatomic planes across the adhesive layer, resulting in a thickness-dependence strength; in addition, impurities are uptaken from the environment and diffuse through the adhesive layer; and iii) at the macroscale, we focus on lap joints under the action of static loads and aggressive environments. Within this scenario, we obtain closed form analytical solutions for: the dependence of the adhesive layer strength on thickness; the length of the edge cracks, if any, as a function of time; the lifetime of the joint; and the dependence of the strength of the joint on time of preexposure to the environment. Overall, the theory is found to capture well the experimentally observed trends. Finally, we discuss how the model can be characterized on the basis of atomistic calculations, which opens the way for the systematic exploration of new material specifications.</description>

      <title>Synchronized Circular Motion of Optically Confined Marangoni Microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the collective actuation of microscopic structures driven by external fields can lead to the development of next-generation autonomous machines. With this goal in mind, we investigated light-induced collective motion of thermocapillary microswimmers at the air-water interface. We found that Marangoni forces, which lead to long-ranged repulsive interparticle interactions, can cause microswimmers to synchronize their circular motion in a collective chase mode that resembles predator-prey behavior often observed in nature. We examined different degrees of confinement in small systems containing 2-6 particles of different individual swimming velocities and shapes. Thanks to the strong repulsive interactions between particles, a sustained chasing mode was observed for particle packing fractions above a critical value of 0.25. At lower packing fractions, swimmers transition between chasing, bouncing, and intermittent pausing, likely due to time-varying activity levels. Additionally, we report that a new synchronized mode can be introduced by incorporating chirality in particle shapes, where the microswimmers collectively reverse the direction of their circular motion periodically. Our results point to a simple but powerful mechanism of obtaining collective synchronization in synthetic confined systems where particles are designed with different shapes and activity levels.</description>

      <title>Magnetically controlled double-twist director configuration of lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals in cylinders: Energetics, topological defects, and instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study experimentally how the double-twist (DT) configuration of cylindrically confined lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) responds to axial magnetic fields. Our director field model unveils the energetics behind the magnetic field-induced transition in the twist profile of the DT configuration. Additionally, we catalog three different types of topological defects -- residing between the DT domains of opposite handedness -- before and after the field application, and propose a new director field model for the defect with a ring disclination. Lastly, we report a symmetry-breaking instability occurring when the field strength exceeds a critical value, suggesting an eccentric DT director field model that reproduces a helix-like optical texture. Our systematic investigation not only enhances our understanding of LCLC energetics but also provides potential for precise control over DT configurations.</description>

      <title>Influence of Dispersity on the Relaxation of Entangled Polymers from Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the deformation behavior of disperse polymer melts by tracking test chains of length N = Mw, the weight average molecular weight, in melts of varying dispersity. At high strain rates, stress decreases with increasing dispersity up to the critical stretch ratio. After flow cessation, relaxation is anisotropic: the parallel component of the radius of gyration decreases monotonically with dispersity, but the perpendicular component exhibits non-monotonic behavior, with fast relaxation at low to intermediate stretching ratios, and slower relaxation at higher stretching ratios as dispersity increases. Single-chain structure factor shows a similar trend in the perpendicular direction, with fast relaxation at intermediate length scales in disperse systems, while the parallel component remains unaffected by dispersity. These findings reveal the complex, dispersity-dependent anisotropic relaxation mechanisms in moderately entangled polymer melts far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Collective filament wrapping and nested spiral formation in active polydisperse systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a two-dimensional polydisperse suspension of self-propelled semiflexible filaments and reveal a collective wrapping mechanism that is absent in monodisperse systems. At intermediate activity levels, long filaments coil around shorter ones, forming nested spiral structures stabilized by filament length disparity. These assemblies generalize the single-filament spiraling seen in active systems into cooperative, multi-filament configurations. As activity increases, the nested spirals undergo structural transitions: medium-length filaments unwind, longer filaments encapsulate shorter ones, and eventually all spiral structures dissolve. This reorganization is reflected in the dynamics, where van Hove distributions uncover coexisting confined and motile filament populations. Our findings identify filament length as a key control parameter for nonequilibrium self-assembly and establish inter-filament wrapping as a minimal mechanism for hierarchical organization in active matter. This mechanism provides a simple model for the cooperative confinement and structural hierarchy observed in both biological and synthetic active systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Irreversible Particle Adsorption to Fluid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic adsorption of colloidal particles at fluid interfaces is essential for applications ranging from emulsion stabilization to interfacial assembly of functional materials. Adsorption dynamics is often described through diffusion-limited models (such as the Ward-Tordai framework) along with assuming dynamic equilibrium between the adsorbed and dispersed particles. However, most experiments show that particle adsorption is irreversible, and diffusion-limited models fail as the surface coverage goes beyond the dilute limit where particle crowding limits further adsorption. Here, we present a unified model that captures the transition from diffusion-limited to kinetic-limited regimes by coupling diffusion with a Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA)-based boundary condition that accounts for irreversible adsorption and particle blocking for a spherical droplet. Using both a microtensiometer and pendant drop tensiometry, we measure dynamic interfacial tension changes for 3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TPM) particles at the toluene/water interface across a range of bulk concentrations, drop sizes, and particle functionalization. Our analysis shows that the adsorption flux becomes increasingly hindered as the surface area fills, in agreement with RSA predictions. Furthermore, we calculate the Thiele modulus as a dimensionless number that quantifies the relative importance of adsorption kinetics to diffusion. We find that above a critical surface coverage, adsorption becomes reaction-limited, marking a transition to kinetically controlled dynamics. This approach provides a predictive framework for particle adsorption at fluid interfaces and highlights the necessity of moving beyond equilibrium diffusion-limited models.</description>

      <title>Density-dependent transport coefficients in two-dimensional cellular aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale collective behavior of biological systems can be characterized by macroscopic transport, which arises from the non-equilibrium microscopic interactions among individual constituents. A prominent example is the formation of dynamic aggregates by motile eukaryotic cells or bacteria mediated by active contractile forces. In this work, we develop the two-dimensional fluctuating hydrodynamics theory based on the microscopic dynamics of a model system of aggregation by \textit{Neisseria gonorrhoeae} bacteria. The derivation of two macroscopic transport coefficients of bulk diffusivity and conductivity which determine hydrodynamic current of cells is the central result of this work. By showing how transport coefficients depend on cell density and microscopic parameters of the system we predict transport slowdown during the colony formation process. This study provides valuable analytical tools for quantifying hydrodynamic transport in experimental systems involving cellular aggregation occurring due to intermittent contractile dipole forces.</description>

      <title>Two fluctuating interfaces with sticking interactions: Invariant measures and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a non-equilibrium stochastic model of two fluctuating interfaces which interact through short-range attractive interactions at their points of contact. Beginning from an entangled state, the system exhibits diverse dynamics -- ranging from fast transients with small lifetimes to ultraslow evolution through quasi-stationary states -- and reaches stuck, entangled, or detached steady states. Near the stuck-detached transition, two distinct dynamical modes of evolution co-occur. When the two surfaces evolve through similar dynamics (both Edwards-Wilkinson or both Kardar-Parisi-Zhang), the invariant measure is determined and found to have an inhomogeneous product form. This exact steady state is shown to be the measure of the equilibrium Poland-Scheraga model of DNA denaturation.</description>

      <title>When does hyperuniformity lead to uniformity across length scales?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform systems are distinguished by an unusually strong suppression of large-scale density fluctuations and, consequently, display a high degree of uniformity at the largest length scales. In some cases, however, enhanced uniformity is expected to be present even at intermediate and possibly small length scales. There exist three different classes of hyperuniform systems, where class I and class III are the strongest and weakest forms, respectively. We utilize the local number variance $\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a window of radius $R$ as a diagnostic to quantify the approach to the asymptotic large-$R$ hyperuniform scaling of a variety of class I, II, and III systems. We find, for all class I systems we analyzed, including crystals, quasicrystals, disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems, and the one-component plasma, a faster approach to the asymptotic scaling of $\sigma_N^2(R)$, governed by corrections with integer powers of $1/R$. Thus, we conclude this represents the highest degree of effective uniformity from small to large length scales. Class II systems, such as Fermi-sphere point processes, are characterized by logarithmic $1/\ln(R)$ corrections and, consequently, a lower degree of local uniformity. Class III systems, such as perturbed lattice patterns, present an asymptotic scaling of $1/R^{\alpha}$, $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, implying, curiously, an intermediate degree of local uniformity. In addition, our study provides insight into when experimental and numerical finite systems are representative of large-scale behavior. Our findings may thereby facilitate the design of hyperuniform systems with enhanced physical properties arising from local uniformity.</description>

      <title>Target-density formation in swarms with stochastic sensing and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important goal for swarming research is to create methods for predicting, controlling and designing swarms, which produce collective dynamics that solve a problem through emergent and stable pattern formation, without the need for constant intervention, and with a minimal number of parameters and controls. One such problem involves a swarm collectively producing a desired (target) density through local sensing, motion, and interactions in a domain. Here, we take a statistical physics perspective and develop and analyze a model wherein agents move in a stochastic walk over a networked domain, so as to reduce the error between the swarm density and the target, based on local, random, and uncertain measurements of the current density by the swarming agents. Using a combination of mean-field, small-fluctuation, and finite-number analysis, we are able to quantify how close and how fast a swarm comes to producing a target as a function of sensing uncertainty, stochastic collision rates, numbers of agents, and spatial variation of the target.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Boundary-Sensitive Phase in Hyperbolic Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical systems defined on hyperbolic lattices may exhibit phases of matter that only emerge due to negative curvature. We focus on the case of the Ising model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and (low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation.</description>

      <title>Liquid Droplet as Adaptive Material while Levitating via Coupling between Plasma and Kelvin Force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fascinating in art and science, the ability to float is also captivating and relevant in practical applications, such as Penning and ion traps that are fundamental to quantum computing. In this work, we first reproduce the classic water bridge by glycerol and, as it breaks down due to thermal agitation, observe that a lump of glycerol with mass~2.5 g can float and exhibit near-periodic oscillations. Through experiments, finite element analysis, and simulations, we discover that the stability of the floating droplet is made possible by the interaction between three mechanisms: Deformation, Plasma, and Kelvin force. Note that glycerol cluster (GC) falls in the class of adaptive materials that can change their properties or behavior in response to varying environmental conditions, i.e., stimuli-responsive. Furthermore, the stimuli, modified by the deformation of GC, collaborate with it to create this unique simple, yet stable, floating system. Backed up by simulations, this process, operated by only a single pair of electrodes, holds the potential to develop a simple yet powerful railgun.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense particle-fluid mixtures, or \emph{pastes}, are encountered in the production of various materials, including animal feed, human food, pharmaceuticals, and biomass for bioenergy. The flow behavior of such dense deformable particulate media is poorly understood, as the interplay between applied stresses, particle deformability and interstitial fluids can be very complex. One challenging context is high pressure pipe flow, encountered in extrusion. Despite its widespread use, many questions remain about how during high pressure flow of the paste, the particle-fluid mixture behaves and interacts with boundaries. We show how high pressure paste extrusion induces the formation of a fluid boundary thinner than the particle size. The induced fluid layer emerges from a pressure-induced phase segregation process. The fluid layer is sufficiently thin to affect particle-wall contacts, making the paste friction coefficient tunable. Our results so offer potential pathways for reducing energy consumption and even extrusion product composition and failure.</description>

Abstract: The translation and shape deformations of a passive viscous Newtonian droplet immersed in an active nematic liquid crystal under circular confinement are analyzed using a linear stability analysis. We focus on the case of a sharply aligned active nematic in the limit of strong elastic relaxation in two dimensions. Using an active liquid crystal model, we employ the Lorentz reciprocal theorem for Stokes flow to study the growth of interfacial perturbations as a result of both active and elastic stresses. Instabilities are uncovered in both extensile and contractile systems, for which growth rates are calculated and presented in terms of the dimensionless ratios of active, elastic, and capillary stresses, as well as the viscosity ratio between the two fluids. We also extend our theory to analyze the inverse scenario, namely, the stability of an active nematic droplet surrounded by a passive viscous layer. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of capillary, active, elastic, and viscous stresses in governing droplet stability. The instabilities uncovered here may be relevant to a plethora of biological active systems, from the dynamics of passive droplets in bacterial suspensions to the organization of subcellular compartments inside the cell and cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>Chemo-mechanical motility modes of partially wetting liquid droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a simple thermodynamically consistent model that captures the self-organized chemo-mechanical coupling resulting from the interplay between autocatalytically reacting surfactants, the Marangoni effect and wetting dynamics. An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring chemo-mechanical motility modes and show how the observed dynamic states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase-separating mixtures.</description>

      <title>A temperature dependent framework to predict and control physical pellet quality in biomass extrusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pellet manufacturing of biomass (food, feed, bioenergy) presses powders or particles into dense pellets with improved nutritional, calorific, and handling properties. This process upgrades industrial co-products from agriculture, forestry, and bioenergy into higher-value products. However, processing particulate streams raises the scientific question: Under which conditions do loose particles bind to form rigid, durable pellets?
  This work answers this question for biomass extrusion. Systematic experiments reveal how steam conditioning temperature, production rate, and die geometry interact to determine pellet quality. We propose an overarching framework introducing the stickiness temperature ($T^*$), marking the onset of enthalpic reactions required for particle agglomeration. $T^*$ serves as the boundary for inter-particle bond formation and is reached through a combination of steam conditioning and friction, both controllable via process parameters.
  Results highlight the combined role of pellet temperature and die residence time in optimizing pellet durability while lowering specific energy use (J/kg). Validation with experiments and literature confirms that this framework offers practical guidance to enhance efficiency and sustainability of pelleting.
  By providing operational parameters to control bonding and energy input, this work supports a more circular economy through efficient conversion of diverse biomass streams into valuable products while reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</description>

      <title>Inferring activity from the flow field around active colloidal particles using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active colloidal particles create flow around them due to non-equilibrium process on their surfaces. In this paper, we infer the activity of such colloidal particles from the flow field created by them via deep learning. We first explain our method for one active particle, inferring the $2s$ mode (or the stresslet) and the $3t$ mode (or the source dipole) from the flow field data, along with the position and orientation of the particle. We then apply the method to a system of many active particles. We find excellent agreements between the predictions and the true values of activity. Our method presents a principled way to predict arbitrary activity from the flow field created by active particles.</description>

      <title>Role of interaction anisotropy in polymer cononsolvency: insights from the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cononsolvency occurs when mixing two good solvents creates poor-solvent conditions for polymers over specific composition ranges, causing macroscopic phase separation or microscopic chain collapse. Despite its technological and biophysical relevance, the connection between macroscopic and microscopic manifestations of cononsolvency remains unclear. A key challenge is identifying which interactions govern cononsolvency: coarse-grained analyses like standard Flory--Huggins models assume purely isotropic interactions, while atomistic simulations contain complex anisotropic interactions that cannot be precisely controlled or isolated. Here, we address the role of interaction anisotropy using the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework, which treats $\chi$ as a thermodynamic average over molecular orientations. This enables controlled comparison between systems with isotropic versus anisotropic interactions that share identical effective $\chi$ parameters, either driving cononsolvency by strong solvent-cosolvent affinity or preferential polymer-cosolvent affinity. While pairs of systems exhibit equivalent macroscopic phase behavior, lattice Monte Carlo simulations reveal that those featuring anisotropic interactions generate distinct collapse signatures, particularly in reentrant coil-globule transitions or characteristics of the solvation structure. These results demonstrate how microscopic interaction anisotropy influences cononsolvency behavior beyond what effective $\chi$ parameters alone predict.</description>

      <title>Defect Interactions Through Periodic Boundaries in Two-Dimensional $p$-atics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic boundary conditions are a common theoretical and computational tool used to emulate effectively infinite domains. However, two-dimensional periodic domains are topologically distinct from the infinite plane, eliciting the question: How do periodic boundaries affect systems with topological properties themselves? In this work, I derive an analytical expression for the orientation fields of two-dimensional $p$-atic liquid crystals, systems with $p$-fold rotational symmetry, with topological defects in a flat domain subject to periodic boundary conditions. I show that this orientation field leads to an anomalous interaction between defects that deviates from the usual Coulomb interaction, which is confirmed through continuum simulations of nematic liquid crystals ($p = 2$). The interaction is understood as being mediated by non-singular topological solitons in the director field which are stabilized by the periodic boundary conditions. The results show the importance of considering domain topology, not only geometry, when analyzing interactions between topological defects.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Theory of Two-dimensional Chiral Malthusian Flocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic behavior of two-dimensional chiral dry Malthusian flocks; that is, chiral polar-ordered active matter with neither number nor momentum conservation. We show that, in the absence of fluctuations, such systems generically form a ``time cholesteric", in which the velocity of the entire system rotates uniformly at a fixed frequency b. Fluctuations about this state belong to the universality class of (2+1)-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which implies short-ranged orientational order in the hydrodynamic limit. We then show that, in the limit of weak chirality, the hydrodynamics of a system with reasonable size is expected to governed by the linear regime of the KPZ equation, exhibiting quasi-long-ranged orientational order. Our predictions for the velocity and number density correlations are testable in both simulations and experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Entanglement-Induced Time-Dependent Solidification of Polymeric Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of polymers at solid interfaces evolves over time, but the corresponding changes in their rheological properties remain poorly understood. Here, using a home-built quartz tuning fork atomic force microscope-based nano-rheometer, we directly measure the time-dependent viscoelasticity of the interfacial fluid. The bottommost layer, closest to the substrate, undergoes solidification over 10 hours, exhibiting an approximately five-fold increase in storage modulus and a two-fold increase in loss modulus. This arises from interfacial entanglement due to the strong binding of polymers to the solid surface driven by solid-wall attractive interactions. In contrast, within the second and third layers, the storage modulus remains nearly constant over time, while the loss modulus shows approximately two-fold increase. In this region, unlike the strongly bound first layer, entropic repulsion dominates, allowing the material to behave fluid-like while becoming increasingly viscous. Notably, as the first layer, where interfacial entanglement occurs, undergoes solidification, the flow boundary for interfacial fluid flow shifts upward away from the substrate, resulting in a negative slip length. This highlights the critical role of nanoscale interfacial structure and properties in governing macroscopic flow behavior.</description>

      <title>Time-energy tradeoff in stochastic resetting using optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting is a driving mechanism that is known to minimize the first passage time to reach a target, at the cost of energy expenditure. The choice of the physical implementation of each resetting event determines the tradeoff between the acceleration of the search process and its energetic cost. Here, we present an optimal transport protocol that balances the duration and the energetic cost of each resetting event. This protocol drives a harmonically trapped Brownian particle between two equilibrium states within a finite time and with minimal energetic cost. An explicit comparison with other types of finite-time protocols further shows its specific thermodynamic properties. Its cost is both a lower bound on the cost of unoptimized shortcut protocols and an upper bound on the cost of optimal protocols which do not ensure final equilibrium. When applying the optimal transport protocol to implement stochastic resetting, a single lower time-energy bound is reached: this protocol allows to reach the best tradeoff between energetic cost and search time.</description>
