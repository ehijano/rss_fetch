      <title>Dependent Directed Wiring Diagrams for Composing Instantaneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed wiring diagrams can be used as a composition pattern for composing input/output systems such as Moore machines. In a Moore machine, the input parametrizes an internal state and the internal state defines the output. Because the value of the output is shielded from the input by the internal state, Moore machines can compose by connecting the output of any machine to the input of any other machine. These connections are defined by the trace wires in a directed wiring diagram. Unlike Moore machines, Mealy machines allow the output to be directly and instantaneously affected by the input. In order to compose such machines via directed wiring diagrams, it is necessary to avoid cycles between trace wires in the wiring digram and dependencies of outputs on inputs. To capture these patterns of composition, we introduce an operad of dependent directed wiring diagrams. We then define an algebra of Mealy machines on this operad and an algebra of stock and flow diagrams in which the values of auxiliary variables are parameterized by inputs. Finally, we give a semantics for this algebra of stock and flow diagrams by giving a morphism of algebras from stock and flow diagrams into Mealy machines.</description>

      <title>Galois measurings for noncommutative base change of entwined contramodule and entwined comodule categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the noncommutative base change of an entwining structure $(A,C,\psi)$ by a Grothendieck category $\mathfrak S$, using two module like categories. These are the categories of entwined comodule objects and entwined contramodule objects in $\mathfrak S$ over the entwining structure $(A,C,\psi)$. We consider criteria for maps between these noncommutative spaces, induced by generalized maps between entwining structures, known as measurings, to behave like Galois extensions. We also study conditions for extensions of these noncommutative spaces, understood as functors between module like categories, to have separability, Frobenius or Maschke type properties.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck topos with a left adjoint to a left adjoint to a left adjoint to the global sections functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of complete connectedness of a Grothendieck topos, defined as the existence of a left adjoint to a left adjoint to a left adjoint to the global sections functor, and provides many examples. Typical examples include presheaf topoi over a category with an initial object, such as the topos of sets, the Sierpi\'nski topos, the topos of trees, the object classifier, the topos of augmented simplicial sets, and the classifying topos of many algebraic theories, such as groups, rings, and vector spaces.
  We first develop a general theory on the length of adjunctions between a Grothendieck topos and the topos of sets. We provide a site characterisation of complete connectedness, which turns out to be dual to that of local topoi. We also prove that every Grothendieck topos is a closed subtopos of a completely connected Grothendieck topos.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to systematically characterize gapped phases in 2+1 dimensions with categorical symmetries. The SymTFTs that we consider are (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups $G$, whose gapped boundaries realize all so-called ``All Bosonic type" fusion 2-category symmetries. In arXiv:2408.05266 we provided the general framework and studied the case where $G$ is an abelian group. In this work we focus on the case of non-Abelian $G$. Gapped boundary conditions play a central role in the SymTFT construction of symmetric gapped phases. These fall into two broad families: minimal and non-minimal boundary conditions, respectively. The first kind corresponds to boundaries on which all line operators are obtainable as boundary projections of bulk line operators. The symmetries on such boundaries include (anomalous) 2-groups and 2-representation categories of 2-groups. Conversely non-minimal boundaries contain line operators that are intrinsic to the boundaries. The symmetries on such boundaries correspond to fusion 2-categories where modular tensor categories intertwine non-trivially with the above symmetry types. We discuss in detail the generalized charges of these symmetries and their condensation patterns that give rise to a zoo of rich beyond-Landau gapped phases. Among these are phases that exhibit novel patterns of symmetry breaking wherein the symmetry broken vacua carry distinct kinds of topological order. We exemplify this framework for the case where $G$ is a dihedral group.</description>
