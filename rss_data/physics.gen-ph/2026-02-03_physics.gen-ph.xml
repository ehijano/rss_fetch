      <title>Compressing Complexity: A Critical Synthesis of Structural, Analytical, and Data-Driven Dimensionality Reduction in Dynamical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contemporary scientific landscape is characterized by a "curse of dimensionality," where our capacity to collect high-dimensional network data frequently outstrips our ability to computationally simulate or intuitively comprehend the underlying dynamics. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the methodologies developed to resolve this paradox by extracting low-dimensional "macroscopic theories" from complex systems. We classify these approaches into three distinct methodological lineages: Structural Coarse-Graining, which utilizes spectral and topological renormalization to physically contract the network graph; Analytical-Based Reduction, which employs rigorous ansatzes (such as Watanabe-Strogatz and Ott-Antonsen) and moment closures to derive reduced differential equations ; and Data-Driven Reduction, which leverages manifold learning and operator-theoretic frameworks (e.g., Koopman analysis) to infer latent dynamics from observational trajectories. We posit that the selection of a reduction strategy is governed by a fundamental "No Free Lunch" theorem, establishing a Pareto frontier between computational tractability and physical fidelity. Furthermore, we identify a growing epistemological schism between equation-based derivations that preserve causal mechanisms and black-box inference that prioritizes prediction. We conclude by discussing emerging frontiers, specifically the necessity of Higher-Order Laplacian Renormalization for simplicial complexes and the development of hybrid "Scientific Machine Learning" architectures-such as Neural ODEs-that fuse analytical priors with deep learning to solve the closure problem.</description>

      <title>Minimal Proper-time in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of quantum field theory within Schr\"odinger's functional representation, inspired by Nambu's proper-time formulation of quantum mechanics. The key motivation for this generalization is to incorporate a fundamental, Lorentz-invariant minimum scale, which in this formulation is played by a minimal proper time $\tau_{\min}$. The introduction of $\tau_{\min}$ leads to several significant effects at very high energies: it modifies the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, induces a controlled violation of unitarity, and suppresses high-energy modes. This minimal scale renders the theory asymptotically safe through a mechanism akin to dimensional reduction, while reproducing all the standard results at low energies, where quantum field theory emerges. Remarkably, the same framework can accommodate a deterministic regime at energies approaching the Planck scale. These features suggest that a minimal proper-time formulation renders quantum field theory an effective but finite theory, superseded at trans-Planckian energies.</description>

      <title>Traction Constraints and the Physics of Faster-Than-the-Wind Travel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22081v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a well-documented yet counterintuitive fact that wind-driven vehicles (with no onboard power source) can travel directly downwind faster than the wind itself. This effect is not paradoxical once one recognizes that the vehicle is not pushed by the air alone but acts as a coupled mechanical system that taps the relative motion of two media -- moving air and stationary ground (or, for watercraft, water taken as quiescent in the far field, neglecting currents) -- and, through its drivetrain, can transform a modest velocity difference into a larger vehicle speed. The essential ingredient is a rigid constraint: the wheel-ground contact enforces a no-slip rolling (traction) constraint and supplies tangential reaction forces. In the ideal limit this contact does no work in the ground frame because the instantaneous contact-point velocity is zero; dissipation enters only through aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, bearing losses, and slip. The drivetrain (wheels, gears, propeller) then acts as a mechanical transformer, trading force against speed in the usual way so that power is conserved in the lossless limit. Using the analogies of a gearbox, a lever, and a sliding-boat thought experiment, this work gives an explicitly Newtonian description of how faster-than-the-wind travel arises from coupling two media through traction constraints and a transmission.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanics provides the physical basis of teleological evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07849v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the quantum computational speedup is due to the teleological character of quantum algorithms, their being evolutions toward a goal (the solution of the problem) with an attractor in the very goal they will produce in the future (the solution of the problem again). We also show that, under the quantum cosmological assumption and for the Fine-tuned Universe version of the Anthropic Principle, the physical basis of the teleological character of quantum algorithms applies as well to the evolutions of the living for which the teleological notion was originally conceived.</description>
