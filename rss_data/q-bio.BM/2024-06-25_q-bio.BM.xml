      <title>CARE: a Benchmark Suite for the Classification and Retrieval of Enzymes</title>

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1) classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and (2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task. CARE is available at https://github.com/jsunn-y/CARE/.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review of Emerging Approaches in Machine Learning for De Novo PROTAC Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is a rapidly growing field in modern drug discovery that aims to regulate the intracellular levels of proteins by harnessing the cell's innate degradation pathways to selectively target and degrade disease-related proteins. This strategy creates new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in cases where occupancy-based inhibitors have not been successful. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are at the heart of TPD strategies, which leverage the ubiquitin-proteasome system for the selective targeting and proteasomal degradation of pathogenic proteins. As the field evolves, it becomes increasingly apparent that the traditional methodologies for designing such complex molecules have limitations. This has led to the use of machine learning (ML) and generative modeling to improve and accelerate the development process. In this review, we explore the impact of ML on de novo PROTAC design $-$ an aspect of molecular design that has not been comprehensively reviewed despite its significance. We delve into the distinct characteristics of PROTAC linker design, underscoring the complexities required to create effective bifunctional molecules capable of TPD. We then examine how ML in the context of fragment-based drug design (FBDD), honed in the realm of small-molecule drug discovery, is paving the way for PROTAC linker design. Our review provides a critical evaluation of the limitations inherent in applying this method to the complex field of PROTAC development. Moreover, we review existing ML works applied to PROTAC design, highlighting pioneering efforts and, importantly, the limitations these studies face. By offering insights into the current state of PROTAC development and the integral role of ML in PROTAC design, we aim to provide valuable perspectives for researchers in their pursuit of better design strategies for this new modality.</description>

      <title>A synthetic T-cell receptor-like protein behaves as a Janus particle in solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein engineering enables the creation of tailor-made proteins for an array of applications. ImmTACs stand out as promising therapeutics for cancer and other treatments, while also presenting unique challenges for stability, formulation and delivery. We have shown that ImmTACs behave as Janus particles in solution, leading to self-association at low concentrations, even when the averaged protein-protein interactions suggest that the molecule should be stable. The formation of small but stable oligomers has been confirmed by static and dynamic light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation. Modelling of the structure using Alphafold leads to a rational explanation for this behaviour, consistent with the Janus particle assembly observed for inverse patchy particles.</description>

      <title>General Binding Affinity Guidance for Diffusion Models in Structure-Based Drug Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) focuses on generating valid ligands that strongly and specifically bind to a designated protein pocket. Several methods use machine learning for SBDD to generate these ligands in 3D space, conditioned on the structure of a desired protein pocket. Recently, diffusion models have shown success here by modeling the underlying distributions of atomic positions and types. While these methods are effective in considering the structural details of the protein pocket, they often fail to explicitly consider the binding affinity. Binding affinity characterizes how tightly the ligand binds to the protein pocket, and is measured by the change in free energy associated with the binding process. It is one of the most crucial metrics for benchmarking the effectiveness of the interaction between a ligand and protein pocket. To address this, we propose BADGER: Binding Affinity Diffusion Guidance with Enhanced Refinement. BADGER is a general guidance method to steer the diffusion sampling process towards improved protein-ligand binding, allowing us to adjust the distribution of the binding affinity between ligands and proteins. Our method is enabled by using a neural network (NN) to model the energy function, which is commonly approximated by AutoDock Vina (ADV). ADV's energy function is non-differentiable, and estimates the affinity based on the interactions between a ligand and target protein receptor. By using a NN as a differentiable energy function proxy, we utilize the gradient of our learned energy function as a guidance method on top of any trained diffusion model. We show that our method improves the binding affinity of generated ligands to their protein receptors by up to 60\%, significantly surpassing previous machine learning methods. We also show that our guidance method is flexible and can be easily applied to other diffusion-based SBDD frameworks.</description>

      <title>GeoMFormer: A General Architecture for Geometric Molecular Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular modeling, a central topic in quantum mechanics, aims to accurately calculate the properties and simulate the behaviors of molecular systems. The molecular model is governed by physical laws, which impose geometric constraints such as invariance and equivariance to coordinate rotation and translation. While numerous deep learning approaches have been developed to learn molecular representations under these constraints, most of them are built upon heuristic and costly modules. We argue that there is a strong need for a general and flexible framework for learning both invariant and equivariant features. In this work, we introduce a novel Transformer-based molecular model called GeoMFormer to achieve this goal. Using the standard Transformer modules, two separate streams are developed to maintain and learn invariant and equivariant representations. Carefully designed cross-attention modules bridge the two streams, allowing information fusion and enhancing geometric modeling in each stream. As a general and flexible architecture, we show that many previous architectures can be viewed as special instantiations of GeoMFormer. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the power of GeoMFormer. All empirical results show that GeoMFormer achieves strong performance on both invariant and equivariant tasks of different types and scales. Code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/c-tl/GeoMFormer.</description>

      <title>Modular DNA origami-based electrochemical detection of DNA and proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06554</link>

Abstract: The diversity and heterogeneity of biomarkers has made the development of general methods for single-step quantification of analytes difficult. For individual biomarkers, electrochemical methods that detect a conformational change in an affinity binder upon analyte binding have shown promise. However, because the conformational change must operate within a nanometer-scale working distance, an entirely new sensor, with a unique conformational change, must be developed for each analyte. Here, we demonstrate a modular electrochemical biosensor, built from DNA origami, which is easily adapted to diverse molecules by merely replacing its analyte binding domains. Instead of relying on a unique nanometer-scale movement of a single redox reporter, all sensor variants rely on the same 100-nanometer scale conformational change, which brings dozens of reporters close enough to a gold electrode surface that a signal can be measured via square wave voltammetry, a standard electrochemical technique. To validate our sensor's mechanism, we used single-stranded DNA as an analyte, and optimized the number of redox reporters and various linker lengths. Adaptation of the sensor to streptavidin and PDGF-BB analytes was achieved by simply adding biotin or anti-PDGF aptamers to appropriate DNA linkers. Geometrically-optimized streptavidin sensors exhibited signal gain and limit of detection markedly better than comparable reagentless electrochemical sensors. After use, the same sensors could be regenerated under mild conditions: performance was largely maintained over four cycles of DNA strand displacement and rehybridization. By leveraging the modularity of DNA nanostructures, our work provides a straightforward route to the single-step quantification of arbitrary nucleic acids and proteins.</description>

      <title>Predicting heteropolymer interactions: demixing and hypermixing of disordered protein sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cells contain multiple condensates which spontaneously form due to the heterotypic interactions between their components. Although the proteins and disordered region sequences that are responsible for condensate formation have been extensively studied, the rule of interactions between the components that allow demixing, i.e., the coexistence of multiple condensates, is yet to be elucidated. Here we construct an effective theory of the interaction between heteropolymers by fitting it to the molecular dynamics simulation results obtained for more than 200 sequences sampled from the disordered regions of human proteins. We find that the sum of amino acid pair interactions across two heteropolymers predicts the Boyle temperature qualitatively well, which can be quantitatively improved by the dimer pair approximation, where we incorporate the effect of neighboring amino acids in the sequences. The improved theory, combined with the finding of a metric that captures the effective interaction strength between distinct sequences, allowed the selection of up to three disordered region sequences that demix with each other in multicomponent simulations, as well as the generation of artificial sequences that demix with a given sequence.The theory points to a generic sequence design strategy to demix or hypermix thanks to the low dimensional nature of the space of the interactions that we identify. As a consequence of the geometric arguments in the space of interactions, we find that the number of distinct sequences that can demix with each other is strongly constrained, irrespective of the choice of the coarse-grained model. Altogether, we construct a theoretical basis for methods to estimate the effective interaction between heteropolymers, which can be utilized in predicting phase separation properties as well as rules of assignment in the localization and functions of disordered proteins.</description>
