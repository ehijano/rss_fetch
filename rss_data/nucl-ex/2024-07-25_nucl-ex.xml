      <title>SU(3) Gauge Symmetry: An Experimental Review of Diffractive Physics in e+p, p+p, p+A, and A+A Collision Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review focuses on diffractive physics, which involves the long-range interactions of the strong nuclear force at high energies described by SU(3) gauge symmetry. It is expected that diffractive processes account for nearly 40% of the total cross-section at LHC energies. These processes consist of soft-scale physics where perturbation theory cannot be applied. Although highly successful and often described as a perfect theory, quantum chromodynamics relies heavily on perturbation theory, a model best suited for hard-scale physics. The study of pomerons could help bridge the soft and hard processes and provide a complete description of the theory of the strong interaction across the full momentum spectrum. Here, we will discuss some of the features of diffractive physics, experimental results from SPS, HERA, and the LHC, and where the field could potentially lead. With the recent publication of the odderon discovery in 2021 by the D0 and TOTEM collaborations and the new horizon of physics that lies ahead with the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, interest is seemingly piquing in high energy diffractive physics.</description>

      <title>Fine-structure constant sensitivity of the Th-229 nuclear clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-resolved laser spectroscopy at the 10$^{-12}$ precision level recently reported in $arXiv$:2406.18719 determined the fractional change in nuclear quadrupole moment between the ground and isomeric state of $^{229}\rm{Th}$, $\Delta Q_0/Q_0$=1.791(2) %. Assuming a prolate spheroid nucleus, this allows to quantify the sensitivity of the nuclear transition frequency to variations of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ to $K=5900(2300)$, with the uncertainty dominated by the experimentally measured charge radius difference $\Delta \langle r^2 \rangle$ between the ground and isomeric state. This result indicates a three orders of magnitude enhancement over atomic clock schemes based on electron shell transitions. We find that $\Delta Q_0$ is highly sensitive to tiny changes in the nuclear volume, thus the constant volume approximation cannot be used to accurately relate changes in $\langle r^2 \rangle$ and $Q_0$. The difference between the experimental and estimated values in $\Delta Q_0/Q_0$ raises a further question on the octupole contribution to the alpha-sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Impact parameter dependence of anisotropic flow: Bayesian reconstruction in ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peculiar phenomena have been observed in analyses of anisotropic flow ($v_n$) fluctuations in ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions: The fourth-order cumulant of the elliptic flow ($v_2$) distribution changes sign. In addition, the ATLAS collaboration has shown that cumulants of $v_n$ fluctuations of all orders depend significantly on the centrality estimator. We show that these peculiarities are due to the fact that the impact parameter $b$ always spans a finite range for a fixed value of the centrality estimator. We provide a quantitative determination of this range through a simple Bayesian analysis. We obtain excellent fits of STAR and ATLAS data, with a few parameters, by assuming that the probability distribution of $v_n$ solely depends on $b$ at a given centrality. This probability distribution is almost Gaussian, and its parameters depend smoothly on $b$, in a way that is constrained by symmetry and scaling laws. We reconstruct, thus, the impact parameter dependence of the mean elliptic flow in the reaction plane in a model-independent manner, and assess the robustness of the extraction using Monte Carlo simulations of the collisions where the impact parameter is known. We argue that the non-Gaussianity of $v_n$ fluctuations gives direct information on the hydrodynamic response to initial anisotropies, ATLAS data being consistent with a smaller response for $n=4$ than for $n=2$ and $n=3$, in agreement with hydrodynamic calculations.</description>

      <title>Probing collectivity in heavy-ion collisions with fluctuations of the $p_T$ spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event-by-event fluctuations in the initial stages of ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions depend little on rapidity. The hydrodynamic expansion which occurs in later stages then gives rise to correlations among outgoing particles which depend weakly on their relative rapidity. Azimuthal correlations, through which anisotropic flow ($v_n(p_T)$) is defined, have been the most studied. Here we study a new observable introduced in 2020 by Schenke, Shen and Teaney and dubbed $v_0(p_T)$, which quantifies the relative change in the $p_T$ spectrum induced by a fluctuation. We describe how it can be measured. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we make quantitative predictions for $v_0(p_T)$ of charged and identified hadrons. We then discuss how $v_0(p_T)$ relates to two phenomena which have been measured: The increase of the mean transverse momentum in ultracentral collisions, and the event-by-event fluctuations of the transverse momentum per particle $[ p_T]$. We show that $v_0(p_T)$ determines the dependence of these quantities on the $p_T$ cuts implemented in the analysis. We quantitatively explain the rise of $\sigma_{p_T}$ observed by ATLAS as the upper $p_T$-cut is increased from $2$ to $5$~GeV/$c$.</description>

      <title>First Detailed Study of the Quantum Decoherence of Entangled Gamma Photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraints on the quantum decoherence of entangled $\gamma$ quanta at the mega-electron-volt scale, such as those produced following positron annihilation, have remained elusive for many decades. We present the first statistically and kinematically precise experimental data for triple Compton scattering of such entangled $\gamma$. An entanglement witness ($R$), relating to the enhancement of the azimuthal correlation between the final scattering planes, is obtained where one of the $\gamma$ underwent intermediate Compton scattering. The measured $R$, deconvolved from multiple scattering backgrounds, are found to exceed the classical limit for intermediate scatter angles up to $\sim$60$^{\circ}$ and diminish at larger angles. The data are consistent with predictions from a first quantum theory of entangled triple Compton scattering as well as a simple model based approach. The results are crucial to future study and utilisation of entangled mega-electron-volt $\gamma$ in fundamental physics and PET imaging.</description>

      <title>Investigating Resource-efficient Neutron/Gamma Classification ML Models Targeting eFPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been considerable interest and resulting progress in implementing machine learning (ML) models in hardware over the last several years from the particle and nuclear physics communities. A big driver has been the release of the Python package, hls4ml, which has enabled porting models specified and trained using Python ML libraries to register transfer level (RTL) code. So far, the primary end targets have been commercial FPGAs or synthesized custom blocks on ASICs. However, recent developments in open-source embedded FPGA (eFPGA) frameworks now provide an alternate, more flexible pathway for implementing ML models in hardware. These customized eFPGA fabrics can be integrated as part of an overall chip design. In general, the decision between a fully custom, eFPGA, or commercial FPGA ML implementation will depend on the details of the end-use application. In this work, we explored the parameter space for eFPGA implementations of fully-connected neural network (fcNN) and boosted decision tree (BDT) models using the task of neutron/gamma classification with a specific focus on resource efficiency. We used data collected using an AmBe sealed source incident on Stilbene, which was optically coupled to an OnSemi J-series SiPM to generate training and test data for this study. We investigated relevant input features and the effects of bit-resolution and sampling rate as well as trade-offs in hyperparameters for both ML architectures while tracking total resource usage. The performance metric used to track model performance was the calculated neutron efficiency at a gamma leakage of 10$^{-3}$. The results of the study will be used to aid the specification of an eFPGA fabric, which will be integrated as part of a test chip.</description>

      <title>Tentative estimates of $\mathcal{B}(X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0\chi_{c1})$ and $\mathcal{B}(X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1})$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rates of the $X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0\chi_{c1}$ and $X(3872)\to \pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1}$ decays are estimated in the model of the triangle loop diagrams with charmed $D^*\bar DD$ and $\bar D^*D\bar D$ mesons in the loops. There are the triangle logarithmic singularities in the physical region of the $X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0 \chi_{c1}$ decay which manifest themselves as narrow peaks in the $\pi^0\chi_{c1}$ mass spectrum near the $D^0\bar D^0$ threshold. The model predicts approximately the same branching fractions of the $X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0 \chi_{c1}$ and $X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1}$ decays at the level of about (0.8-1.7)$\times10^{-4}$. A distinct prediction of the model is the value of the ratio $\mathcal{R}= \mathcal{B}(X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1})/\mathcal{B}(X(3872) \to\pi^0\pi^0\chi_{c1})\approx1.1$. It weakly depends on the $X(3872)$ resonance parameters and indicates a significant violation of the isotopic symmetry according to which one would expect $\mathcal{R}=2$.</description>

      <title>Development of large-volume $^{130}$TeO$_2$ bolometers for the CROSS $2\beta$ decay search experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of thermal detectors based on large-size tellurium dioxide crystals (45x45x45 mm), containing tellurium enriched in $^{130}$Te to about 91%, for the CROSS double-beta decay experiment. A powder used for the crystals growth was additionally purified by the directional solidification method, resulting in the reduction of the concentration of impurities by a factor 10, to a few ppm of the total concentration of residual elements (the main impurity is Fe). The purest part of the ingot (the first ~200 mm, about 80% of the total length of the cylindrical part of the ingot) was determined by scanning segregation profiles of impurities and used for the $^{130}$TeO$_2$ powder production with no evidence of re-contamination. The crystal growth was verified with precursors produced from powder with natural Te isotopic composition, and two small-size (20x20x10 mm) samples were tested at a sea-level laboratory showing high bolometric and spectrometric performance together with acceptable $^{210}$Po content (below 10 mBq/kg). This growth method was then applied for the production of six large cubic $^{130}$TeO$_2$ crystals and 4 of them were taken randomly to be characterized at the Canfranc underground laboratory, in the CROSS-dedicated low-background cryogenic facility. Two $^{130}$TeO$_2$ samples were coated with a thin, $O$(100 nm), metal film in form of Al layer (on 4 sides) or AlPd grid (on a single side) to investigate the possibility to tag surface events by pulse-shape discrimination. Similarly to the small natural precursors, large-volume $^{130}$TeO$_2$ bolometers show high performance and even better internal purity ($^{210}$Po activity $\sim$ 1 mBq/kg, while activities of $^{228}$Th and $^{226}$Ra are below 0.01 mBq/kg), satisfying requirements for the CROSS and, potentially, next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Triply charm and bottom tetraquarks in a constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singly, doubly and fully charmed tetraquark candidates, \emph{e.g.}, $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$, $T^+_{cc}(3875)$ and $X(6900)$ have been recently reported by the LHCb collaboration. Therefore, it is timely to implement a theoretical investigation on triply heavy tetraquark systems; herein, the S-wave triply charm and bottom tetraquarks, $\bar{Q}Q\bar{q}Q$ $(q=u,\,d,\,s;\,Q=c,\,b)$, with spin-parity $J^P=0^+$, $1^+$ and $2^+$, isospin $I=0$ and $\frac{1}{2}$, are systematically studied in a constituent quark model. Besides, all tetraquark configurations, \emph{i.e.} meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark and K-type arrangements, along with any allowed color structure, are comprehensively considered. The Gaussian expansion method (GEM), in combination with the complex-scaling method (CSM), which is quite ingenious in dealing with either bound or resonances, is the approach adopted in solving the complex scaled Schr\"odinger equation. This theoretical framework has already been applied in various tetra- and penta-quark systems. In a fully coupled-channel calculation within the GEM$+$CSM, narrow resonances are found in each $I(J^P)$ channel of the charm and bottom sector. In particular, triply charm and bottom tetraquark resonances are obtained in $5.6-5.9$ GeV and $15.3-15.7$ GeV, respectively. We provide also some insights of the compositeness of these exotic states, such as the inner quark distance, magnetic moment and dominant wave function component. All this may help to distinguish them in future high energy nuclear and particle experiments.</description>

      <title>Equation of state of nuclear matter from collective flows and stopping in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state of nuclear matter, momentum dependence of the effective interaction and in-medium modification of elastic nucleon-nucleon cross-sections are studied by comparing theoretical predictions for stopping, directed and elliptic flows of protons and light clusters in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions of beam energy between 150 and 800 MeV/nucleon to experimental data gathered by the FOPI Collaboration. A multivariate analysis that takes into account systematic uncertainties induced on model predictions by the coalescence afterburner leads to the following constraint for the equation of state at 68 percent confidence level: compressibility modulus of isospin symmetric matter $K_0=230^{+9}_{-11}$ MeV and slope of the symmetry energy $L=63^{+10}_{-13}$ MeV. The momentum dependence of the isoscalar potential is found to be similar to that of the empirical optical potential, with an effective isoscalar mass $m^*=0.695^{+0.014}_{-0.018}$. The isovector potential displays a momentum dependence corresponding to a positive neutron-proton effective mass difference $\Delta m^*_{np}=(0.17^{+0.10}_{-0.09})\delta$, close to the world average for this quantity. A suppression of elastic nucleon-nucleon cross-sections in symmetric nuclear matter at saturation by about 60$\%$ relative to vacuum values is deduced, in qualitative agreement with microscopical results. A strong dependence of the suppression factor on isospin asymmetry is evidenced, experimental data for isospin symmetric systems proving crucial for this last conclusion.</description>
