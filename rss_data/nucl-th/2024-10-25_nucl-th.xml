      <title>Effects of incompressibility on the neutron-proton equilibration in $^{70}$Zn + $^{70}$Zn collisions at 35 MeV/nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The primary goal of studying isospin dynamics via heavy-ion reactions is to explore the isospin dependence of effective interactions within the nuclear equation of state (EOS). Purpose: This work aims to investigate the effects of nuclear incompressibility ($ K_0 $) on neutron-proton equilibration in projectile-like fragments (PLFs). Method: We simulate $^{70}$Zn + $^{70}$Zn collisions at 35 MeV/nucleon using the isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics (IQMD) model, coupled with the statistical decay code GEMINI. Results: The IQMD simulations not only reproduce experimental data patterns but also reveal the dynamic mechanisms underlying the binary breakup of PLFs. The rotation of PLFs is influenced by the transformation of angular momentum, which is connected to the isoscalar component of the EOS. This connection explains why shifts in $ K_0 $ affect the description of neutron-proton equilibration as measured by PLF rotation. The simulations demonstrate that a model with a smaller $ K_0 $ paired with a softer symmetry energy, or a larger $ K_0 $ with a slightly stiffer symmetry energy, both offer better indications of neutron-proton equilibration. Conclusion: Considering the uncertainty in $ K_0 $, the slope of the symmetry energy is constrained within the range of $ L = 20 \sim 40 $ MeV, providing valuable insights into the nuclear equation of state.</description>

      <title>Impact of ground-state properties and collective excitations on the Skyrme ansatz: a Bayesian study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art models based on nuclear Density Functional Theory are successful in the description of nuclei throughout the whole nuclear chart. Among them, some differences arise regarding their accuracy. For a given nuclear model, this depends on the procedure adopted to determine the parameters, and, at the same time, new experimental findings constantly challenge theory. In the present work, we present a Bayesian inference study aimed at assessing the performance of the Skyrme Energy Density Functional. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, we restrict to spherical, double-magic nuclei, giving equal emphasis to ground-state and dynamical properties. Our basic constraints are: i) masses and charge radii, which are known to be very sensitive to the saturation energy and density; ii) spin-orbit splittings, which are associated with the spin-orbit parameter(s); iii) the electric dipole polarizability and parity-violating asymmetry, which are associated with the density dependence of the symmetry energy; iv) the excitation energy of the Isoscalar Giant Monopole Resonance, to constrain the nuclear matter incompressibility; v) the energy-weighted sum rule of the Isovector Giant Dipole Resonance, to account for the isovector effective mass; and vi) the excitation energy of the Isoscalar Quadrupole Resonance, that is related to the isoscalar effective mass. In this way, we test the Skyrme ansatz in a statistically meaningful way, by determining the posterior distributions of the parameters as well as their correlation, and discussing a possible strategy for future developments.</description>

      <title>$2+1$ dimensional Floquet systems and lattice fermions: Exact bulk spectral equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A connection has recently been proposed between periodically driven systems known as Floquet insulators in continuous time and static fermion theories in discrete time. This connection has been established in a $(1+1)$-dimensional free theory, where an explicit mapping between the spectra of a Floquet insulator and a discrete-time Dirac fermion theory has been formulated. Here we investigate the potential of static discrete-time theories to capture Floquet physics in higher dimensions, where so-called anomalous Floquet topological insulators can emerge that feature chiral edge states despite having bulk bands with zero Chern number. Starting from a particular model of an anomalous Floquet system, we provide an example of a static discrete-time theory whose bulk spectrum is an exact analytic match for the Floquet spectrum. The spectra with open boundary conditions in a particular strip geometry also match up to finite-size corrections. However, the models differ in several important respects. The discrete-time theory is spatially anisotropic, so that the spectra do not agree for all lattice terminations, e.g. other strip geometries or on half spaces. This difference can be attributed to the fact that the static discrete-time model is quasi-one-dimensional in nature and therefore has a different bulk-boundary correspondence than the Floquet model.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338: A potential hybrid star candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent analysis on the properties of XTE J18014-338 yielded a surprising radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the expected values for the radius of neutron stars, which are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations. In this letter, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J18014-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J18014-338 are only stable for a 'stiff' low density phase. For a 'soft' hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations indicates their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered.</description>

      <title>Far-from-equilibrium attractors in kinetic theory with two different relaxation times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve a Boltzmann equation for massless quark and gluon fluids in a transversally homogeneous, longitudinally boost-invariant expansion. Quarks can be out of chemical equilibrium and the relaxation times of the two species are assumed to be connected by Casimir scaling. We numerically calculate moments of the distribution functions, identifying their early- and late-time attractors and reconstructing also the full distributions. These attractors appear when the system is still far from local thermalization, before hydrodynamics traditionally would be expected to apply. We also analyze the evolution of entropy production for different initial momentum anisotropies and quark abundances.</description>

      <title>Mixing mechanism for the $J^{P}=0^{+}$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are three scalar nonets in the Particle Data Group (PDG), one of which includes [$a_0(980), K_0^*(700)$], another includes [$a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430)$], and the third includes [$a_0(1710), K_0^*(1950)$]. Motivated by Ref.[1], we examine an alternative mixing mechanism that could potentially explain the small mass difference between the $a_0 (1450)$ and $K_0^* (1430)$. According to the tetraquark mixing model, two types, distinguished by their color-spin structures, are necessary to describe the tetraquark structure of the two nonets containing [$a_0(980), K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430)$]. Considering the color-spin structures, we argue that the mixing mechanism generating $a_0(1450)$ and $K_0^* (1430)$ on the one hand, and $a_0(1710)$ and $K_0^* (1950)$ on the other hand might be relevant for resolving the small mass difference. We also discuss the limitations of other mixing mechanisms that generate the two nonets involving [$a_0(980),K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$] or [$a_0(980),K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1710)$, $K_0^* (1950)$]</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of quarkonium master equation beyond the dipole approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QTRAJ is a computer code that simulates the propagation of quarkonium in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) based on the quantum-trajectory algorithm. This algorithm solves a master equation in which the quarkonium is treated as an open quantum system (OQS). A major advantage of this approach is that it turns a 3D spatial evolution for a density matrix into a 1D Schr\"odinger equation for a wavefunction with a non-hermitian Hamiltonian, drastically reducing the computational cost. So far, the interaction implemented in the master equation was obtained within the framework of potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD), and restricted to the regime $rT \ll 1$, where $r$ is the size of the color dipole and $T$ is the temperature. In the environment produced in heavy-ion collisions (HIC's) this limit is accurate for $\Upsilon(1S)$, but the applicability to other quarkonium states is dubious. In the present study we generalize the above approach, extending it to the regime $rT\!\sim\! 1$ in the one-gluon exchange approximation, with proper Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) resummation of medium effects. This is done by implementing new jump operators connecting different color states of the $Q\bar Q$ pair and expanding them in plane waves, giving rise to a variation of the algorithm present in QTRAJ 1.0. Here we provide an overview of this approach comparing the $rT \ll 1$ and $rT\sim 1$ cases, and we discuss prospects for phenomenological application to excited states of bottomonium.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of chiral fluid dynamics using low-energy effective models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the first-order transport coefficients of a fluid made of quasiparticles with a temperature-dependent mass extracted from chiral models. We describe this system using an effective kinetic theory, given by the relativistic Boltzmann equation coupled to a temperature-dependent background field determined from the thermal masses. We then simplify the collision term using the relaxation time approximation and implement a Chapman-Enskog expansion to calculate all first-order transport coefficients. In particular, we compute the bulk and shear viscosities using thermal masses extracted from the linear sigma model coupled with constituent quarks and the NJL model.</description>

      <title>A comparison of two possible nuclear effective field theory expansions around the one- and two-pion exchange potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.02076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the effective field theory formalism nuclear forces are organized as a low energy expansion. Usually the lowest order in this expansion corresponds to the non-perturbative iteration of the one-pion exchange potential and a few contact-range operators as to ensure renormalization group invariance. Here we consider an alternative expansion in which two-pion exchange becomes the lowest order finite range interaction and as such is expected to be iterated. A comparison of this new expansion with the standard one shows a better convergence pattern for a few selected partial waves ($^1S_0$, $^3P_0$ and $^3S_1$-$^3D_1$) in two-nucleon scattering, in particular for the $^1S_0$ channel (though both expansions converge well). We briefly comment on the possible theoretical grounds for the expansion around two-pion exchange from the point of view of effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Split of the pseudo-critical temperatures of chiral and confine/deconfine transitions by temperature gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searching of the critical endpoint of the phase transition of Quantum Chromodynamics~(QCD) matter in experiments is of great interest. The temperature in the fireball of a collider is location dependent, however, most theoretical studies address the scenario of uniform temperature. In this work, the effect of temperature gradients is investigated using lattice QCD approach. We find that the temperature gradient catalyzes chiral symmetry breaking, meanwhile the temperature gradient increases the Polyakov loop in the confined phase but suppresses the Polyakov loop in the deconfined phase. Furthermore, the temperature gradient decreases the pseudo-critical temperature of chiral transition but increases the pseudo-critical temperature of the confine/deconfine transition.</description>

      <title>Vetting quark-star models with gravitational waves in the hierarchical Bayesian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new avenue for investigating the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in compact stars, which is an outstanding problem in astronomy and nuclear physics. In the future, next-generation (XG) GW detectors will be constructed, deemed to provide a large number of high-precision observations. We investigate the potential of constraining the EOS of quark stars (QSs) with high-precision measurements of mass $m$ and tidal deformability $\Lambda$ from the XG GW observatories. We adopt the widely-used bag model for QSs, consisting of four microscopic parameters: the effective bag constant $B_{\rm eff}$, the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter $a_4$, the strange quark mass $m_s$, and the pairing energy gap $\Delta$. With the help of hierarchical Bayesian inference, for the first time we are able to infer the EOS of QSs combining multiple GW observations. Using the top 25 loudest GW events in our simulation, we find that, the constraints on $B_{\rm eff}$ and $\Delta$ are tightened by several times, while $a_4$ and $m_s$ are still poorly constrained. We also study a simplified 2-dimensional (2-d) EOS model which was recently proposed in literature. The 2-d model is found to exhibit significant parameter-estimation biases as more GW events are analyzed, while the predicted $m$-$\Lambda$ relation remains consistent with the full model.</description>

      <title>A New-Old Approach to Composite Scalars with Chiral Fermion Constituents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a dynamical, Lorentz invariant theory of composite scalars in configuration space consisting of chiral fermions, interacting by the perturbative exchange of a massive "gluon" of coupling $g_0$ and mass $M_0^2$ (the coloron model). The formalism is inspired by, but goes beyond, old ideas of Yukawa and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. It yields a non-pointlike internal wave-function of the bound state, $\phi(r)$, which satisfies a Schr\"odinger-Klein-Gordon (SKG) equation with eigenvalue $\mu^2$. For super-critical coupling, $g_0 &gt;g_{0c}$, we have $\mu^2&lt; 0$ leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking. The binding of chiral fermions is semiclassical, and not loop-level as in NJL. The mass scale is determined by the interaction as in NJL. We mainly focus on the short-distance, large $M_0^2$ limit, yielding an NJL pointlike interaction, but the bound state internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$, remains spatially extended and dilutes $\phi(0)$. This leads to power-law suppression of the induced Yukawa and quartic couplings and requires radically less fine-tuning of a hierarchy than does the NJL model. We include a discussion of loop corrections of the theory. A realistic top--condensation model appears possible.</description>
