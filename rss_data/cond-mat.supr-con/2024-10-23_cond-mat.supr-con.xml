      <title>Unraveling the interplay of electron-phonon coupling, pseudogap, and superconductivity in CsCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasiparticle relaxation dynamics of the iron-based superconductor CsCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ ($T_c$ $\sim$ 29 K) were investigated using ultrafast optical spectroscopy. A pseudogap ($\Delta_{PG}$ $\approx$ 3.3 meV) was observed to open below $T^{\ast}$ $\approx$ 60 K, prior to the emergence of a superconducting gap ($\Delta$ $\approx$ 6.6 meV). At high excitation fluence, a coherent $A_{1g}$ phonon mode at 5.49 THz was identified, exhibiting deviations from anharmonic behavior below $T_c$. The electron-phonon coupling constant for this mode was estimated to be $\lambda_{A_{1g}}$ $\approx$ 0.225 $\pm$ 0.02. These results provide insights into the interplay between the electron-phonon interactions, pseudogap, and the superconducting pairing mechanism in CsCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$.</description>

      <title>Doping dependence of the nonlinear Hall resistivity in electron-doped Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4 \pm \delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a systematic study of the field dependence of the Hall resistivity $\rho _{yx} (B)$ as a function of doping in thin films of electron-doped superconducting cuprate Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4 \pm \delta}$ (PCCO). Across the studied doping range from $x = 0.125$ to $x = 0.20$, we observe a nonlinear dependence of $\rho_{yx}$ with $B$. The leading $B^{3}$ nonlinear term is negative, increases with decreasing temperature and peaks around optimal doping ($x = 0.15$). The observed nonlinear contribution is consistent with the presence of two different types of free carriers (electron-like and hole-like) even for doping with only an apparent hole Fermi surface as observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Based on an analysis using the two-carrier model, this negative nonlinear contribution to $\rho _{yx} (B)$ implies that the density of the charge carriers behaving like electrons is larger than the density of those behaving like holes for all the doping values explored. Combined with the Hall coefficient reaching $R_{H} = 0$ at specific temperatures for selected doping levels, we also conclude that the mobility of hole-like carriers is larger than that of electron-like carriers for doping around $x^{*} \approx 0.165$.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Hexagonal Zr6CoAl2-Type Zr6RuBi2 and Zr6FeBi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis and electronic properties of polycrystalline samples of Zr6MBi2 (M = Ru and Fe) crystallizing in the hexagonal Zr6CoAl2-type structure. Based on their electrical resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity data, Zr6RuBi2 and Zr6FeBi2 are found to exhibit bulk superconductivity below Tc = 4.9 and 1.4 K, respectively. Although Zr6RuBi2 is most likely a conventional superconductor, the considerably higher Tc for M = Ru than that for M = Fe differs from the trend in Tc for Zr6CoAl2-type superconductors reported thus far. The superconductivity of an amorphous solid-solution phase, which may hinder elucidation of the superconducting properties of Zr6MBi2, is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase effects in dipole superfluids: vortex lattices and singular domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the response of dipole superfluids to an applied electromagnetic field, drawing parallels to the Meissner effect in conventional superconductors. While superconductors, consisting of electric monopoles, interact with magnetic fields via the Aharonov-Bohm phase, magnetic-dipole superfluids -- composed of charge-neutral particles with magnetic dipole moments -- interact with electric fields through the Aharonov-Casher phase, where spatially modulating electric fields act as pseudo-magnetic fields. This leads to a distinct response compared to conventional superconductors. We develop a phenomenological theory to describe this behavior, revealing that the magnetic-dipole superfluid under a pseudo-magnetic field forms a vortex lattice, separated by singular domain walls where the pseudo-magnetic field and the charge density diverge. A similar effect is predicted in electric-dipole superfluids, where electric and magnetic roles are reversed, establishing the singular domain wall formation as a fundamental property of dipole condensates.</description>

      <title>Majorana-metal transition in a disordered superconductor: percolation in a landscape of topological domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most superconductors are thermal insulators. A disordered chiral \textit{p}-wave superconductor, however, can make a transition to a thermal metal phase. Because heat is then transported by Majorana fermions, this phase is referred to as a Majorana metal. Here we present numerical evidence that the mechanism for the phase transition with increasing electrostatic disorder is the percolation of boundaries separating domains of different Chern number. We construct the network of domain walls using the spectral localizer as a ``topological landscape function'', and obtain the thermal metal--insulator phase diagram from the percolation transition.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Exotic Spin Texture in Supramolecular Metal Complexes on a 2D Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designer heterostructures, where the desired physics emerges from the controlled interactions between different components, represent one of the most powerful strategies to realize unconventional electronic states. This approach has been particularly fruitful in combining magnetism and superconductivity to create exotic superconducting states. In this work, we use a heterostructure platform combining supramolecular metal complexes (SMCs) with a quasi-2D van der Waals (vdW) superconductor NbSe$_2$. Our scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements demonstrate the emergence of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bands arising from the interaction between the SMC magnetism and the NbSe$_2$ superconductivity. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements, we show the presence of antiferromagnetic coupling between the SMC units. These result in the emergence of an unconventional $3\times3$ reconstruction in the magnetic ground state that is directly reflected in real space modulation of the YSR bands. The combination of flexible molecular building blocks, frustrated magnetic textures, and superconductivity in heterostructures establishes a fertile starting point to fabricating tunable quantum materials, including unconventional superconductors and quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of topological defects in the pair-density-wave superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pair density Waves (PDW) are a inhomogeneous superconducting states whose Cooper pairs posses a finite momentum resulting in a oscillatory gap in space, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. There is growing evidence for the existence of PDW superconducting order in many strongly correlated materials particularly in the cuprate superconductios and in several other different types of systems. A feature of the PDW state is that inherently it has a CDW as a composite order associated with it. Here we study the structure of the electronic topological defects of the PDW, paying special attention to the half-vortex and its electronic structure that can be detected in STM experiments. We discuss tell-tale signatures of the defects in violations of inversion symmetry, in the excitation spectrum and their spectral functions in the presence of topological defects. We discuss the "Fermi surface" topology of Bogoliubov quasi-particle of the PDW phases and we briefly discuss the role of quasi-particle-interference.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Superconducting Niobium Nitride Thin Films via High-Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a systematic comparison of niobium nitride thin films deposited on oxidized silicon substrates by reactive DC magnetron sputtering and reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). After determining the nitrogen gas concentration that produces the highest superconducting critical temperature for each process, we characterize the dependence of the critical temperature on film thickness. The optimal nitrogen concentration is higher for HiPIMS than for DC sputtering, and HiPIMS produces higher critical temperatures for all thicknesses studied. We attribute this to the HiPIMS process enabling the films to get closer to optimal stoichiometry before beginning to form a hexagonal crystal phase that reduces the critical temperature, along with the extra kinetic energy in the HiPIMS process improving crystallinity. We also study the ability to increase the critical temperature of the HiPIMS films through the use of an aluminum nitride buffer layer and substrate heating.</description>

      <title>Intertwined charge and spin density wave state of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on nickel-based superconductors has progressed from infinite-layer LaNiO$_2$ to finite-layer La$_{6}$Ni$_{5}$O$_{12}$, and most recently to the Ruddlesden-Popper-phase La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ discovered under pressure $\sim$16\,GPa, the system exhibits the onset of superconductivity at approximately $\sim$80\,K. Unlike the $d$-wave superconductivity driven by the nearly half-filled $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in finite- and infinite-layers nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and coulomb interactions, we delve into the pressure dependent electronic structure of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster. We find that several possible charge and spin ordering states are nearly degenerate at ambient pressure but become strongly mixed leading to a more homogeneous phase at high pressure. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals, the apical bridging O $2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We note that the energy difference between the charge (CDW)/spin (SDW) density wave states and the uniform high pressure phase is about 10 meV in concordance with phase transition temperatures found experimentally at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>A Novel Perspective on Ideal Chern Bands with Strong Short-Range Repulsion: Applications to Correlated Metals, Superconductivity, and Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on correlated van der Waals materials, including twisted and rhombohedral graphene and twisted WSe$_2$, we perform an analytical and numerical study of the effects of strong on-site and short-range interactions in fractionally filled ideal Chern bands. We uncover an extensive non-trivial ground state manifold within the band filling range $0 &lt; \nu &lt; 1$ and introduce a general principle, the ''three-rule'', for combining flatband wave functions, which governs their zero-energy property on the torus geometry. Based on the structure of these wave functions, we develop a variational approach that reveals distinct phases under different perturbations: metallic behavior emerges from a finite dispersion, and superconductivity is induced by attractive Cooper channel interactions. Our approach, not reliant on the commonly applied mean-field approximations, provides an analytical expression for the macroscopic wave function of the off-diagonal long-range order correlator, attributing pairing susceptibility to the set of non-trivial zero-energy ground state wave functions. Extending to finite screening lengths and beyond the ideal limit using exact diagonalization simulations, we demonstrate the peculiar structure in the many-body wave function's coefficients to be imprinted in the low-energy spectrum of the topologically ordered Halperin spin-singlet state. Our findings also make connections to frustration-free models of non-commuting projector Hamiltonians, potentially aiding the future construction of exact ground states for various fractional fillings.</description>

      <title>Method for reconstructing the self-energy from the spectral function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07682v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question about the nature of quantum materials such as High-T$_c$ systems remain open to date -- it is unclear whether they are (some variety of) Fermi liquids, or (some variety of) non Fermi liquids. A direct avenue to determine their nature is to study the (imaginary part of the) self-energy at low energies. Here we present a novel method to extract this low $\omega$ self-energy from experimentally derived spectral functions. The method seems suited for implementation with high quality angle resolved photoemission data. It is based on a helpful Theorem proposed here, which assures us that the method has minimal (or vanishing) error at the lowest energies. We provide numerical examples showing that a few popular model systems yield distinguishably different low energy self-energies.</description>

      <title>Poor-man's Majorana edge mode enabled by specular Andreev reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator (3D TI) supports a chiral Majorana edge mode at the interface between a superconductor and a magnetic insulator. The complexity of the materials combination is such that this state has not yet been observed. Here we show that a helical Majorana edge mode appears even in the absence of the magnetic insulator, if the Fermi level of the massless surface electrons is at the Dirac point. Specular Andreev reflection of Dirac fermions is at the origin of the effect. The simplified geometry may favor experimental observation of the helical Majorana mode, although it lacks the topological protection of its chiral counterpart.</description>
