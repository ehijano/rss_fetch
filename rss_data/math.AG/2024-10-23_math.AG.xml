      <title>Roots of unity and projective equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing results of Fu show that, if two finite sets of roots of unity are projectively equivalent by a projective automorphism that does not act bijectively on the set of all roots of unity, then these sets consist of at most 14 points. Moreover, Fu constructs the two possible maximal sets, which are unique up to projective equivalence. In this article, we given an elementary proof that the cardinality of two such sets is at most 18 using the methods of Beukers and Smyth. Moreover, we show precisely how their method fails to give the tightest bound in the maximal cases of Fu.</description>

      <title>Schemes of Associative Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a definition of associative schemes, schemes of associative rings, over a field $k,$ using the definition of completion of an associative $k$-algebra in a finite set of simple modules. We start by giving a weaker but sufficient definition of ordinary schemes of commutative rings which can be generalized to associative rings.</description>

      <title>Blowing-ups of primitive multiple schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primitive multiple scheme is a Cohen-Macaulay scheme $\bf X$ such that the associated reduced scheme $X={\bf X}_{red}$ is smooth, irreducible, and that $\bf X$ can be locally embedded in a smooth variety of dimension $\dim(X)+1$. If ${\bf I}_X$ is the ideal sheaf of $X$, $L={\bf I}_X/{\bf I}_X^2$ is a line bundle on $X$, called the associated line bundle of $\bf X$. The simplest example is the trivial primitive multiple scheme of multiplicity $n$ associated to a line bundle $L$ on $X$: it is the $n$-th infinitesimal neighborhood of $X$, embedded in the line bundle $L^*$ by the zero section.
  A subscheme $Z$ of ${\bf X}$ is called good if $Z_{red}$ is smooth and connected, and if $d={\rm codim}(Z)$ and ${\bf I}_{Z,{\bf X}}$ is the ideal sheaf of $Z$, then for every closed point $z\in Z$, ${\bf I}_{Z,{\bf X},z}$ can be generated by $d$ elements.
  Two kinds of subschemes $Z$ of ${\bf X}$ will be considered: the closed smooth subschemes of $X$, seen as subschemes of $\bf X$, and the good subschemes. In the two cases, the blowing-up ${\bf B}_{Z,{\bf X}}$ of ${\bf X}$ along $Z$ is a primitive multiple scheme of multiplicity $n$, and its underlying smooth scheme is the blowing-up ${\bf B}_{Z_{red},X}$ of $X$ along $Z_{red}$. Additional results are obtained in the case of hypersurfaces or points of $X$.
  We treat the case of $X={\rm P}_2$, with $Z$ a single point $P$. Let $p:\widetilde{{\rm P}}_2\to{\rm P}_2$ be the blowing-up of ${\rm P}_2$ along $P$. We find all primitive double schemes $\bf X$, $\bf Y$, with ${\bf Y}_{red}=\widetilde{{\rm P}}_2$, ${\bf X}_{red}={\rm P}_2$, such that there is a morphism ${\rm Y}\to{\rm X}$ inducing $p$ and an isomorphism ${\bf Y}\backslash p^{-1}(P)\to{\bf X} \backslash\{P\}$. We obtain in this way the list of all K3-carpets with underlying smooth variety $\widetilde{{\rm P}}_2$.</description>

      <title>Permutation-Equivariant Quantum K-Theory of the Quintic Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the genus-0 permutation-equivariant quantum K-theory of the singularity of the quintic polynomial, parallel to Givental--Lee's quantum K-theory of the quintic threefold. We obtain a generating function which recovers the entire 25-dimensional space of solutions to the $q$-difference equation satisfied by the permutation-equivariant K-theoretic $I$-function of the quintic.</description>

      <title>On Special Subvarieties of the Universal Semi-abelian Scheme and Pink Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universal Poincar\'e torsor, or more generally the universal semi-abelian scheme, can be viewed as a mixed Shimura variety. We give a classification of special subvarieties of the universal semi-abelian scheme of arbitrary toric rank.
  Given this classification, we show that the Zilber-Pink conjecture implies both the Pink-Mordell-Lang conjecture and the Pink-Manin-Mumford conjecture, correcting an error in an unpublished manuscript of Pink. Moreover, we give a more reasonable reformulation of the Relative Manin-Mumford Conjecture for semi-abelian schemes.</description>

      <title>Kleinian singularities: some geometry, combinatorics and representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the relationship between discrete groups of symmetries of Euclidean three-space, constructions in algebraic geometry around Kleinian singularities including versions of Hilbert and Quot schemes, and their relationship to finite-dimensional and affine Lie algebras via the McKay correspondence. We focus on combinatorial aspects, such as the enumeration of certain types of partition-like objects, reviewing in particular a recently developed root-of-unity-substitution calculus. While the most complete results are in type A, we also develop aspects of the theory in type D, and end with some questions about the exceptional type E cases.</description>

      <title>On the algebraic structure of differentially homogeneous polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper describes the algebraic structure of the graded algebra of differentially homogeneous polynomials of fixed finite order. We show that it is a finitely generated algebra, and we exhibit a minimal set of generators. Along the way, we provide a simpler proof of the so-called Schmidt--Kolchin conjecture (proved in a previous paper) .
  From the algebraic point of view, this provides natural compactifications of jet bundles of projective spaces. From the invariant theoretic point of view, this provides new examples, not covered (to our knowledge) by known conjectures in the subject, of unipotent sub-groups of general linear groups, whose algebras of invariants are finitely generated (and more precisely gives a First Fundamental Theorem for such groups, following the terminology in Invariant Theory).</description>

      <title>Birational geometry of blowups via Weyl chamber decompositions and actions on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the birational geometry of $X$, a projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$ blown up at $s$ general points. We obtain a characterization of a special class of subvarieties, which we call Weyl $r$-planes, each of them being swept out by one $(n-r)$-moving curve class.
  For Mori dream spaces $X$, we unify different previous approaches, by reinterpreting the description of the Mori chamber decomposition of the effective cone in terms of these curve classes; in this case all relevant orbits are finite.
  For general $s$, we prove that Weyl $r$-planes are infinite and continue to appear as stable base locus. This yields the definition of the Weyl chamber decomposition of the pseudoeffective cone of divisors, that is a coarsening of its Mori chamber decomposition, when the latter can be defined. We prove that the combinatorics of such chamber decomposition obeys the Weyl group action on curves. We conjecture that for $s=n+4$ the Weyl and the Mori chamber decompositions coincide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute several types of dimension for the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves of orbifold curves. This completes the calculation of these dimensions for derived categories of noncommutative curves in the sense of Reiten-van den Bergh. Along the way we construct stability conditions for orbifold curves. We also obtain a characterisation of orbifold curves with hereditary tilting bundle in terms of diagonal dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct symmetric monoidal higher categories of iterated Calabi-Yau cospans, that are noncommutative analogs of iterated lagrangian correspondences. We actually give a general (and functorial) procedure that applies to iterated nondegenerate cospans on certain comma categories. This allows us to factor the AKSZ fully extended TFT associated with the moduli of objects of a Calabi-Yau category (taking values in iterated lagrangian correspondences) through a fully extended TFT taking values in iterated Calabi-Yau cospans.</description>

      <title>Recursive properties of Cohen--Macaulay flag simplicial complexes and Lefschetz decompositions from $f$-vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most applications of the hard Lefschetz theorem related to combinatorial properties of simplicial complexes involve their $h$-vectors. In the context of positivity properties involving $h$-vectors of flag spheres, $f$-vectors with a Lefschetz-type ``Boolean'' decomposition have been studied. In this note, we explore families of flag simplicial complexes where we can see this Boolean decomposition explicitly in terms of transformations connecting different simplicial complexes in this family. Note that we will take complexes in a given dimension to be PL homeomorphic to each other. In particular, the existence of a Boolean decomposition patched from local parts can be phrased in terms of a certain map formally satisfying an analogue of the hard Lefschetz theorem. The map is given by the composition of a double suspension with a ``net single edge subdivision''. Here, the former contributes to the Boolean part and the latter contributes to the disjoint non-Boolean part. The fact that the simplicial complex with the given $f$-vector can be taken to be balanced suggests algebraic versions of maps connected to these decompositions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a version of the arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) function for arbitrary finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$, and study the resulting AGM graph with points $(a,b) \in \mathbb{F}_q \times \mathbb{F}_q$ and directed edges between points $(a,b)$, $(\frac{a+b}{2},\sqrt{ab})$ and $(a,b)$, $(\frac{a+b}{2},-\sqrt{ab})$. The points in this graph are naturally associated to elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q$ in Legendre normal form, with the AGM function defining a 2-isogeny between the associated curves. We use this correspondence to prove several results on the structure, size, and multiplicity of the connected components in the AGM graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth projective toric variety $X$ of Picard rank 2, we resolve the diagonal sheaf on $X \times X$ by a linear complex of length $\dim{X}$ consisting of finite direct sums of line bundles. As applications, we prove a new case of a conjecture of Berkesch-Erman-Smith that predicts a version of Hilbert's Syzygy Theorem for virtual resolutions, and we obtain a Horrocks-type splitting criterion for vector bundles over smooth projective toric varieties of Picard rank 2, extending a result of Eisenbud-Erman-Schreyer. We also apply our results to give a new proof, in the case of smooth projective toric varieties of Picard rank 2, of a conjecture of Orlov concerning the Rouquier dimension of derived categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X\subseteq{\mathbb P}^{n+1}$ be an integral hypersurface of degree $d$. We show that each locally Cohen-Macaulay instanton sheaf $\mathcal E$ on $X$ with respect to $\mathcal O_X\otimes\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^{n+1}}(1)$ in the sense of Definition 1.3 in arXiv:2205.04767 [math.AG] yields the existence of Steiner bundles $\mathcal G$ and $\mathcal F$ on $\mathbb P^{n+1}$ of the same rank $r$ and a morphism $\varphi\colon \mathcal G(-1)\to\mathcal F^\vee$ such that the form defining $X$ to the power $\mathrm{rk}(\mathcal E)$ is exactly $\det(\varphi)$. We inspect several examples for low values of $d$, $n$ and $\mathrm{rk}(\mathcal E)$. In particular, we show that the form defining a smooth integral surface in $\mathbb P^3$ is the pfaffian of some skew-symmetric morphism $\varphi\colon \mathcal F(-1)\to\mathcal F^\vee$, where $\mathcal F$ is a suitable Steiner bundle on $\mathbb P^3$ of sufficiently large even rank.</description>

      <title>GAGA for Henselian schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global analogue of a Henselian local ring is a Henselian pair-a ring R and an ideal I which satisfy a condition resembling Hensel's lemma regarding lifting coprime factorizations of monic polynomials over R/I to factorizations over R. The geometric counterpart is the notion of a Henselian scheme, which can serve as a substitute for formal schemes in applications such as deformation theory. In this paper we prove a GAGA-style cohomology comparison result for Henselian schemes in positive characteristic, making use of a "Henselian \'etale" topology defined in previous work in order to leverage exactness of finite pushforward for abelian sheaves in the \'etale topology of schemes. We will also discuss algebraizability of coherent sheaves on the Henselization of a proper scheme, proving (without a positive characteristic restriction) algebraizability for coherent subsheaves. We can then deduce a Henselian version of Chow's theorem on algebraization and the algebraizability of maps between Henselizations of proper schemes.</description>

      <title>On the Lau group scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06194v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a 2013 article, Eike Lau constructed a canonical morphism from the stack of $n$-truncated Barsotti-Tate groups over $F_p$ to the stack of n-truncated displays. He also proved that this morphism is a gerbe banded by a commutative group scheme. In this e-print we describe the group scheme explicitly.
  The stack of $n$-truncated Barsotti-Tate groups over $F_p$ has a generalization related to any pair $(G,\mu)$, where $G$ is a smooth group scheme over $Z/p^n$ and $\mu$ is a 1-bounded cocharacter of $G$. The same is true for the stack of $n$-truncated displays. We conjecture that in this more general situation the first stack is a gerbe over the second one banded by a commutative group scheme, and we give a conjectural description of this group scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an alternative proof of Suslin's equi-dimensionalization moving lemma using a different geometric construction. The new construction provides better control of the degrees of the polynomials describing the geometric procedure.
  The new degree bound can be used to improve an earlier result of Hiroyasu Miyazaki and the present author on algebraic cycles with modulus: the isomorphism in question is now valid for any fixed divisor, without the need to take the limit over thickenings.</description>

      <title>Six-dimensional supermultiplets from bundles on projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The projective variety of square-zero elements in the six-dimensional minimal supersymmetry algebra is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^3$. We use this fact, together with the pure spinor superfield formalism, to study supermultiplets in six dimensions, starting from vector bundles on projective spaces. We classify all multiplets whose derived invariants for the supertranslation algebra form a line bundle over the nilpotence variety; one can think of such multiplets as being those whose holomorphic twists have rank one over Dolbeault forms on spacetime. In addition, we explicitly construct multiplets associated to natural higher-rank equivariant vector bundles, including the tangent and normal bundles as well as their duals. Among the multiplets constructed are the vector multiplet and hypermultiplet, the family of $\mathcal{O}(n)$-multiplets, and the supergravity and gravitino multiplets. Along the way, we tackle various theoretical problems within the pure spinor superfield formalism. In particular, we give some general discussion about the relation of the projective nilpotence variety to multiplets and prove general results on short exact sequences and dualities of sheaves in the context of the pure spinor superfield formalism.</description>

      <title>Non-isogenous superelliptic jacobians II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01365v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\ell$ be an odd prime and $K$ a field of characteristic different from $\ell$. Let $\bar{K}$ be an algebraic closure of $K$. Assume that $K$ contains a primitive $\ell$th root of unity. Let $n \ne \ell$ be another odd prime. Let $f(x)$ and $h(x)$ be degree $n$ polynomials with coefficients in $K$ and without repeated roots.
  Let us consider superelliptic curves $C_{f,\ell}: y^{\ell}=f(x)$ and $C_{h,\ell}: y^{\ell}=h(x)$ of genus $(n-1)(\ell-1)/2$, and their jacobians $J^{(f,\ell)}$ and $J^{(h,\ell)}$, which are $(n-1)(\ell-1)/2$-dimensional abelian varieties over $\bar{K}$.
  Suppose that one of the polynomials is irreducible and the other reducible over $K$. We prove that if $J^{(f,\ell)}$ and $J^{(h,\ell)}$ are isogenous over $\bar{K}$ then both endomorphism algebras $\mathrm{End}^{0}(J^{(f,\ell)})$ and $\mathrm{End}^{0}(J^{(h,\ell)})$ contain an invertible element of multiplicative order $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero, let $A_1=K[x][\partial ]$ be the first Weyl algebra. In this paper we prove that the Dixmier conjecture for the first Weyl algebra is true, i.e. each algebra endomorphism of the algebra $A_1$ is an automorphism.</description>
