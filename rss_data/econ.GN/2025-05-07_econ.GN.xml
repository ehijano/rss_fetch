      <title>Ethical Appetite: Consumer Preferences and Price Premiums for Animal Welfare-Friendly Food Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how consumer attitudes toward animal welfare influence food selection and pricing using real-world market data from a Swiss supermarket. Our findings indicate that higher animal welfare standards are consistently associated with higher prices, suggesting that ethical considerations play a significant role in generating price premiums based on consumer preferences. On average, a one-point increase in the animal welfare score (ranging from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest) corresponds to a 16.4% price increase, with the effect being most pronounced in Dairy &amp; Eggs (25.3%), compared to Meat &amp; Fish (14.3%). These results highlight the psychological and behavioral factors underlying consumer preferences for ethically produced foods. Additionally, we find limited evidence of a price premium for climate-friendly food products, observed only in Yogurts &amp; Desserts, a subcategory within Dairy &amp; Eggs. Our findings contribute to the understanding of how ethical food attributes influence consumer decision-making and pricing in retail settings.</description>

      <title>Exit Incentives for Carbon Emissive Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a continuous-time model of incentives for carbon emissive firms to exit the market based on a compensation payment identical to all firms. In our model, firms enjoy profits from production modeled as a simple geometric Brownian motion and do not bear any environmental damage from production. A regulator maximises the expected discounted value of firms profits from production minus environmental damages caused by production and proposes a compensation payment whose dynamics is known to the firms. We provide in both situations closed-form expressions for the compensation payment process and the exit thresholds of each firms. We apply our model to the crude oil market. We show that market concentration both reduces the total expected discounted payment to firms and the expected closing time of polluting assets. We extend this framework to the case of two countries each regulating its own market. The presence of a second mover advantage leads to the possibility of multiple equilibria. Applying this result to large producing countries, we find that they are unlikely to agree on the timing to exit market.</description>

      <title>Who Bears the Cost? High-Frequency Evidence on Minimum Wage Effects and Amenity Pass-Through in Spot Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides causal evidence on the short-run effects of minimum wage hikes in a spot labor market using confidential contract-level data from a Japanese job-matching platform. Leveraging high-frequency variation and a bin-level difference-in-differences design, we find a 2 percentage point decline in employment within affected wage bins, with losses concentrated below the new threshold. Transportation reimbursement-a flexible nonwage amenity -remains largely unchanged, indicating limited pass-through. These findings suggest that spot labor markets adjust rapidly through wage compliance, with the cost burden borne by establishments rather than offset through reductions in job amenities.</description>

      <title>DeFi versus TradFi: Valuation Using Multiples and Discounted Cash Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As of August 2022, blockchain-based assets boast a combined market capitalisation exceeding one trillion USD, among which the most prominent are the decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) tokens associated with decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols. In this work, we seek to value DeFi tokens using the canonical multiples and discount cash flow (DCF) approaches. We examine a subset of DeFi services including decentralised exchanges (DEXs), protocol for loanable funds (PLFs), and yield aggregators. We apply the same analysis to some publicly traded firms and compare them with DeFi tokens of the analogous category. Interestingly, despite the crypto bear market lasting for more than one year as of August 2022, both approaches evidence overvaluation in DeFi.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Skills on LinkedIn Profiles: Measuring Human Capital and the Gender Skill Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure human capital using the self-reported skill sets of nearly 9 million U.S. college graduates from professional profiles on LinkedIn. We aggregate skill strings into 48 clusters of general, occupation-specific, and managerial skills. Multidimensional skills can account for several important labor-market patterns. First, the number and composition of skills are systematically related to measures of human-capital investment such as education and work experience. The number of skills increases with experience, and the average age-skill profile closely resembles the well-established concave age-earnings profile. Second, workers who report more skills, especially specific and managerial ones, hold higher-paid jobs. Skill differences account for more earnings variation than detailed measures of education and experience. Third, we document a sizable gender gap in skills. While women and men report nearly equal numbers of skills shortly after college graduation, women's skill count increases more slowly with age subsequently. A simple quantitative exercise shows that women's slower skill accumulation can be fully accounted for by reduced work hours associated with motherhood. The resulting gender differences in skills rationalize a substantial proportion of the gender gap in job-based earnings.</description>

      <title>Beyond Baby Blues: The Child Penalty in Mental Health in Switzerland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the mental health penalty for women after childbirth in Switzerland. Leveraging insurance data, we employ a staggered difference-in-difference research design. The findings reveal a substantial mental health penalty for women following the birth of their first child. Approximately four years after childbirth, there is a one percentage point (p.p.) increase in antidepressant prescriptions, representing a 50% increase compared to pre-birth levels. This increase rises to 1.7 p.p. (a 75% increase) six years postpartum. The mental health penalty is likely not only a direct consequence of giving birth but also a consequence of the changed life circumstances and time constraints that accompany it, as the penalty is rising over time and is higher for women who are employed.</description>

      <title>Learning by exporting with a dose-response function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the causal effect of export intensity on productivity and other firm-level outcomes with a dose-response function. After positing that export intensity acts as a continuous treatment, we investigate counterfactual productivity levels in a quasi-experimental setting. For our purpose, we exploit a control group of non-temporary exporters that have already sustained the fixed costs of reaching foreign markets, thus controlling for self-selection into exporting. Our findings reveal a non-linear relationship between export intensity and productivity, with small albeit statistically significant benefits ranging from 0.1% to 0.6% per year only after exports reach 60% of total revenues. After we look at sales, variable costs, capital intensity, and the propensity to filing patents, we show that, before the 60% threshold, economies of scale and capital adjustment offset each other and induce, on average, a minimal albeit statistically significant loss in productivity of about 0.01% per year. Crucially, we find that heterogeneous export intensity is associated with the firm's position on the technological frontier, as the propensity to file a patent increases when export intensity ranges in 8%-60% with a peak at 40%. The latest finding further highlights that learning-by-exporting is linked to the building of absorptive capacity.</description>
