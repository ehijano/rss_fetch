      <title>Quantum Artificial Intelligence for Secure Autonomous Vehicle Navigation: An Architectural Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation is a very crucial aspect of autonomous vehicle ecosystem which heavily relies on collecting and processing large amounts of data in various states and taking a confident and safe decision to define the next vehicle maneuver. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on Quantum Artificial Intelligence by enabling quantum and AI at various levels of navigation decision making and communication process in Autonomous vehicles : Quantum Neural Networks for multimodal sensor fusion, Nav-Q for Quantum reinforcement learning for navigation policy optimization and finally post-quantum cryptographic protocols for secure communication. Quantum neural networks uses quantum amplitude encoding to fuse data from various sensors like LiDAR, radar, camera, GPS and weather etc., This approach gives a unified quantum state representation between heterogeneous sensor modalities. Nav-Q module processes the fused quantum states through variational quantum circuits to learn optimal navigation policies under swift dynamic and complex conditions. Finally, post quantum cryptographic protocols are used to secure communication channels for both within vehicle communication and V2X (Vehicle to Everything) communications and thus secures the autonomous vehicle communication from both classical and quantum security threats. Thus, the proposed framework addresses fundamental challenges in autonomous vehicles navigation by providing quantum performance and future proof security.

      <title>A System Level Compiler for Massively-Parallel, Spatial, Dataflow Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a novel compiler called the Multiple-Architecture Compiler for Advanced Computing Hardware (MACH) designed specifically for massively-parallel, spatial, dataflow architectures like the Wafer Scale Engine. Additionally, MACH can execute code on traditional unified-memory devices. MACH addresses the complexities in compiling for spatial architectures through a conceptual Virtual Machine, a flexible domain-specific language, and a compiler that can lower high-level languages to machine-specific code in compliance with the Virtual Machine concept. While MACH is designed to be operable on several architectures and provide the flexibility for several standard and user-defined data mappings, we introduce the concept with dense tensor examples from NumPy and show lowering to the Wafer Scale Engine by targeting Cerebras' hardware specific languages.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Signal Quantum Circuit Design for Option Pricing Using Design Compiler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior studies have largely focused on quantum algorithms, often reducing parallel computing designs to abstract models or overly simplified circuits. This has contributed to the misconception that most applications are feasible only through VLSI circuits and cannot be implemented using quantum circuits. To challenge this view, we present a mixed-signal quantum circuit framework incorporating three novel methods that reduce circuit complexity and improve noise tolerance. In a 12 qubit case study comparing our design with JP Morgan's option pricing circuit, we reduced the gate count from 4095 to 392, depth from 2048 to 6, and error rate from 25.86\% to 1.64\%. Our design combines analog simplicity with digital flexibility and synthesizability, demonstrating that quantum circuits can effectively leverage classical VLSI techniques, such as those enabled by Synopsys Design Compiler to address current quantum design limitations.</description>

      <title>BIDA: A Bi-level Interaction Decision-making Algorithm for Autonomous Vehicles in Dynamic Traffic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex real-world traffic environments, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to interact with other traffic participants while making real-time and safety-critical decisions accordingly. The unpredictability of human behaviors poses significant challenges, particularly in dynamic scenarios, such as multi-lane highways and unsignalized T-intersections. To address this gap, we design a bi-level interaction decision-making algorithm (BIDA) that integrates interactive Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), aiming to enhance interaction rationality, efficiency and safety of AVs in dynamic key traffic scenarios. Specifically, we adopt three types of DRL algorithms to construct a reliable value network and policy network, which guide the online deduction process of interactive MCTS by assisting in value update and node selection. Then, a dynamic trajectory planner and a trajectory tracking controller are designed and implemented in CARLA to ensure smooth execution of planned maneuvers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our BIDA not only enhances interactive deduction and reduces computational costs, but also outperforms other latest benchmarks, which exhibits superior safety, efficiency and interaction rationality under varying traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Black-Box Optimization for Dynamic Discrete Environments Using Embedded Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-time systems require the optimization of discrete variables. Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms and multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms perform optimization by repeatedly taking actions and observing the corresponding instant rewards without any prior knowledge. Recently, a BBO method using an Ising machine has been proposed to find the best action that is represented by a combination of discrete values and maximizes the instant reward in static environments. In contrast, dynamic environments, where real-time systems operate, necessitate MAB algorithms that maximize the average reward over multiple trials. However, due to the enormous number of actions resulting from the combinatorial nature of discrete optimization, conventional MAB algorithms cannot effectively optimize dynamic, discrete environments. Here, we show a heuristic MAB method for dynamic, discrete environments by extending the BBO method, in which an Ising machine effectively explores the actions while considering interactions between variables and changes in dynamic environments. We demonstrate the dynamic adaptability of the proposed method in a wireless communication system with moving users.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Expressivity of Quantum Neural Networks Based on the SWAP test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits represent promising architectures for machine learning applications, yet many lack clear connections to classical models, potentially limiting their ability to translate the wide success of classical neural networks to the quantum realm. We examine a specific type of quantum neural network (QNN) built exclusively from SWAP test circuits, and discuss its mathematical equivalence to a classical two-layer feedforward network with quadratic activation functions under amplitude encoding. Our analysis across classical real-world and synthetic datasets reveals that while this architecture can successfully learn many practical tasks, it exhibits fundamental expressivity limitations due to violating the universal approximation theorem, particularly failing on harder problems like the parity check function. To address this limitation, we introduce a circuit modification using generalized SWAP test circuits that effectively implements classical neural networks with product layers. This enhancement enables successful learning of parity check functions in arbitrary dimensions which we analytically argue to be impossible for the original architecture beyond two dimensions regardless of network size. Our results establish a framework for enhancing QNN expressivity through classical task analysis and demonstrate that our SWAP test-based architecture offers broad representational capacity, suggesting potential promise also for quantum learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Epileptic Signal Harmonization: Frequency Domain Mapping Quantization for Pre-training a Unified Neurophysiological Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) are vital for epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. Their unified analysis offers the potential to harness the complementary strengths of each modality but is challenging due to variations in recording montages, amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and frequency components. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper introduces EpiNT, a novel Transformer-based pre-trained model for unified EEG and iEEG analysis. EpiNT employs channel-independent modeling with masked autoencoders (MAE) and vector quantization (VQ), along with a frequency domain mapping quantizer to capture crucial frequency features. Pre-trained on over 2,700 hours of multi-modal clinical neurophysiological data from 1,199 patients, EpiNT outperformed both randomly initialized models and other pre-trained methods on six downstream classification tasks, demonstrating robust representation learning capabilities. This work presents a promising approach for unified epilepsy neurophysiology analysis.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Molecular Communication with Local and Global Degradation: Modeling and ISI Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel physics-based model for signal propagation in closed-loop molecular communication (MC) systems, which are particularly relevant for many envisioned biomedical applications, such as health monitoring or drug delivery within the closed-loop human cardiovascular system (CVS). Compared to open-loop systems, which are mostly considered in MC, closed-loop systems exhibit different characteristic effects influencing signaling molecule (SM) propagation. One key phenomenon are the periodic SM arrivals at the receiver (RX), leading to various types of inter-symbol interference (ISI) inherent to closed-loop system. To capture these characteristic effects, we propose an analytical model for the SM propagation inside closed-loop systems. The model accounts for arbitrary spatio-temporal SM release patterns at the transmitter (TX), and incorporates several environmental effects such as fluid flow, SM diffusion, and SM degradation. Moreover, to capture a wide range of practically relevant degradation and clearance mechanisms, the model includes both local removal (e.g., due to SM absorption into organs) and global removal (e.g., due to chemical degradation) of SMs. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated with three-dimensional (3-D) particle-based simulations (PBSs). Moreover, we utilize the proposed model to develop a rigorous characterization of the various types of ISI encountered in closed-loop MC systems.</description>

      <title>No Scratch Quantum Computing by Reducing Qubit Overhead for Efficient Arithmetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum arithmetic computation requires a substantial number of scratch qubits to stay reversible. These operations necessitate qubit and gate resources equivalent to those needed for the larger of the input or output registers due to state encoding. Quantum Hamiltonian Computing (QHC) introduces a novel approach by encoding input for logic operations within a single rotating quantum gate. This innovation reduces the required qubit register $ N $ to the size of the output states $ O $, where $ N = \log_2 O $. Leveraging QHC principles, we present reversible half-adder and full-adder circuits that compress the standard Toffoli + CNOT layout [Vedral et al., PRA, 54, 11, (1996)] from three-qubit and four-qubit formats for the Quantum half-adder circuit and five sequential Fredkin gates using five qubits [Moutinho et al., PRX Energy 2, 033002 (2023)] for full-adder circuit; into a two-qubit, 4$\times $4 Hilbert space. This scheme, presented here, is optimized for classical logic evaluated on quantum hardware, which due to unitary evolution can bypass classical CMOS energy limitations to certain degree. Although we avoid superposition of input and output states in this manuscript, this remains feasible in principle. We see the best application for QHC in finding the minimal qubit and gate resources needed to evaluate any truth table, advancing FPGA capabilities using integrated quantum circuits or photonics.</description>

      <title>A Fully Digital Relaxation-Aware Analog Programming Technique for HfOx RRAM Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For neuromorphic engineering to emulate the human brain, improving memory density with low power consumption is an indispensable but challenging goal. In this regard, emerging RRAMs have attracted considerable interest for their unique qualities like low power consumption, high integration potential, durability, and CMOS compatibility. Using RRAMs to imitate the more analog storage behavior of brain synapses is also a promising strategy for further improving memory density and power efficiency. However, RRAM devices display strong stochastic behavior, together with relaxation effects, making it more challenging to precisely control their multi-level storage capability. To address this, researchers have reported different multi-level programming strategies, mostly involving the precise control of analog parameters like compliance current during write operations and/or programming voltage amplitudes. Here, we present a new fully digital relaxation-aware method for tuning the conductance of analog RRAMs. The method is based on modulating digital pulse widths during erase operations while keeping other parameters fixed, and therefore requires no precise alterations to analog parameters like compliance currents or programming voltage amplitudes. Experimental results, with and without relaxation effect awareness, on a 64 RRAM 1T1R HfOx memory array of cells, fabricated in 130nm CMOS technology, indicate that it is possible to obtain 2-bit memory per cell multi-value storage at the array level, verified 1000 seconds after programming.</description>

      <title>All-in-One Analog AI Hardware: On-Chip Training and Inference with Conductive-Metal-Oxide/HfOx ReRAM Devices</title>

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing is an emerging paradigm designed to efficiently accelerate deep neural network workloads. Recent advancements have focused on either inference or training acceleration. However, a unified analog in-memory technology platform-capable of on-chip training, weight retention, and long-term inference acceleration-has yet to be reported. This work presents an all-in-one analog AI accelerator, combining these capabilities to enable energy-efficient, continuously adaptable AI systems. The platform leverages an array of analog filamentary conductive-metal-oxide (CMO)/HfOx resistive switching memory cells (ReRAM) integrated into the back-end-of-line (BEOL). The array demonstrates reliable resistive switching with voltage amplitudes below 1.5V, compatible with advanced technology nodes. The array multi-bit capability (over 32 stable states) and low programming noise (down to 10nS) enable a nearly ideal weight transfer process, more than an order of magnitude better than other memristive technologies. Inference performance is validated through matrix-vector multiplication simulations on a 64x64 array, achieving a root-mean-square error improvement by a factor of 20 at 1 second and 3 at 10 years after programming, compared to state-of-the-art. Training accuracy closely matching the software equivalent is achieved across different datasets. The CMO/HfOx ReRAM technology lays the foundation for efficient analog systems accelerating both inference and training in deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Principles and Metrics of Extreme Learning Machines Using a Highly Nonlinear Fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical computing offers potential for ultra high-speed and low latency computation by leveraging the intrinsic properties of light. Here, we explore the use of highly nonlinear optical fibers (HNLFs) as platforms for optical computing based on the concept of Extreme Learning Machines. Task-independent evaluations are introduced to the field for the first time and focus on the fundamental metrics of effective dimensionality and consistency, which we experimentally characterize for different nonlinear and dispersive conditions. We show that input power and fiber characteristics significantly influence the dimensionality of the computational system, with longer fibers and higher dispersion producing up to 100 principal components (PCs) at input power levels of 30 mW, where the PC correspond to the linearly independent dimensions of the system. The spectral distribution of the PC's eigenvectors reveals that the high-dimensional dynamics facilitating computing through dimensionality expansion are located within 40~nm of the pump wavelength at 1560~nm, providing general insight for computing with nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation systems. Task-dependent results demonstrate the effectiveness of HNLFs in classifying MNIST dataset images. Using input data compression through PC analysis, we inject MNIST images of various input dimensionality into the system and study the impact of input power upon classification accuracy. At optimized power levels we achieve a classification test accuracy of 88\%, significantly surpassing the baseline of 83.7\% from linear systems. Noteworthy, we find that best performance is not obtained at maximal input power, i.e. maximal system dimensionality, but at more than one order of magnitude lower. The same is confirmed regarding the MNIST image's compression, where accuracy is substantially improved when strongly compressing the image to less than 50 PCs.</description>

Abstract: The Bhatt Conjectures framework introduces rigorous, hierarchical benchmarks for evaluating AI reasoning and understanding, moving beyond pattern matching to assess representation invariance, robustness, and metacognitive self-awareness. The agentreasoning-sdk demonstrates practical implementation, revealing that current AI models struggle with complex reasoning tasks and highlighting the need for advanced evaluation protocols to distinguish genuine cognitive abilities from statistical inference.

      <title>Model Context Protocol (MCP) at First Glance: Studying the Security and Maintainability of MCP Servers</title>

Abstract: Although Foundation Models (FMs), such as GPT-4, are increasingly used in domains like finance and software engineering, reliance on textual interfaces limits these models' real-world interaction. To address this, FM providers introduced tool calling-triggering a proliferation of frameworks with distinct tool interfaces. In late 2024, Anthropic introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to standardize this tool ecosystem, which has become the de facto standard with over eight million weekly SDK downloads. Despite its adoption, MCP's AI-driven, non-deterministic control flow introduces new risks to sustainability, security, and maintainability, warranting closer examination.
  Towards this end, we present the first large-scale empirical study of MCP servers. Using state-of-the-art health metrics and a hybrid analysis pipeline, combining a general-purpose static analysis tool with an MCP-specific scanner, we evaluate 1,899 open-source MCP servers to assess their health, security, and maintainability. Despite MCP servers demonstrating strong health metrics, we identify eight distinct vulnerabilities - only three overlapping with traditional software vulnerabilities. Additionally, 7.2% of servers contain general vulnerabilities and 5.5% exhibit MCP-specific tool poisoning. Regarding maintainability, while 66% exhibit code smells, 14.4% contain nine bug patterns overlapping with traditional open-source software projects. These findings highlight the need for MCP-specific vulnerability detection techniques while reaffirming the value of traditional analysis and refactoring practices.</description>
