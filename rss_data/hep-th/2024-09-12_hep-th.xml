      <title>Cutting rule for in-in correlators and cosmological collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a cutting rule for equal-time in-in correlators including cosmological correlators based on Keldysh $r/a$ basis, which decomposes diagrams into fully retarded functions and cut-propagators consisting of Wightman functions. Our derivation relies only on basic assumptions such as unitarity, locality, and the causal structure of the in-in formalism, and therefore holds for theories with arbitrary particle contents and local interactions at any loop order. As an application, we show that non-local cosmological collider signals arise solely from cut-propagators under the assumption of microcausality. Since the cut-propagators do not contain (anti-)time-ordering theta functions, the conformal time integrals are factorized, simplifying practical calculations.</description>

      <title>Unmixing sub-leading Regge trajectories of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super-Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conformal field theory data (CFT-data) of planar 4D $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory in the strong 't Hooft coupling limit. This regime explores the physics of massive short strings in the flat-space limit of the dual AdS. We focus on the CFT-data of the massive short strings exchanged in the operator product expansion (OPE) of the four-point function dual to the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude. This CFT-data arranges itself into Regge trajectories in the flat-space limit. Using inputs from recent advances in the computation of the AdS Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude, integrability, and a stipulation based on analyticity of the CFT-data in spin, we are able to fix all the CFT-data on the four unique sub-leading Regge trajectories, at leading non-trivial order, as a function of the string-mass level. One of our predictions is that one of the four unique sub-leading Regge trajectories decouples from the OPE in the flat-space limit. This hints at an emergent selection rule in the flat-space limit, similar to our previous results in arXiv:2310.06041. Our procedure should be applicable in a variety of similar setups like for the AdS Veneziano amplitude or in ABJM.</description>

      <title>Identifying sea and valence quarks in a magnetically driven catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we introduce a holographic prescription to independently describe sea and valence quarks in the context of the gauge/gravity correspondence. We use such prescription to perform an initial calculation that permits us to compare our results with those obtained through lattice techniques when studding magnetic catalysis and its inverse. We find, in agreement with previous studies, that the elaborated behavior of the condensate is mostly attributable to the sea quarks, rather than the valence which show a quite featureless participation.</description>

      <title>Poincare Invariance in Discrete Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A formulation of discrete gravity was recently proposed based on defining a lattice and a shift operator connecting the cells. Spinors on such a space will have rotational SO(d) invariance which is taken as the fundamental symmetry. Inspired by lattice QCD, discrete analogues of curvature and torsion were defined that go smoothly to the corresponding tensors in the continuous limit. In this paper, we show that the absence of diffeomorphism invariance could be replaced by requiring translational invariance in the tangent space by enlarging the tangent space from SO(d) to the inhomogeneous Lorentz group ISO(d) to include translations. We obtain the ISO(d) symmetry by taking instead the Lie group SO(d + 1) and to perform on it Inonu-Wigner contraction. We show that, just as for continuous spaces, the zero torsion constraint converts the translational parameter to a diffeomorphism parameter, thus explaining the effectiveness of this formulation.</description>

      <title>Dyonic bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study (multi) fermion - monopole bound states, many of which are the states that dyons adiabatically transition into as fermions become light. The properties of these bound states depend critically on the UV symmetries preserved by the fermion mass terms, their relative size, and the value of $\theta$. Depending on the relative size of the mass terms and the value of $\theta$, the bound states can undergo phase transitions as well as transition from being stable to unstable. In some simple situations, the bound state solution can be related to the Witten effect of another theory with fewer fermions and larger gauge coupling. These bound states are a result of mass terms and symmetry breaking boundary conditions at the monopole core and, consequently, these bound states do not necessarily have definite quantum numbers under accidental IR symmetries. Additionally, they have binding energies that are $\mathcal{O}(1)$ times the fermion mass and bound state radii of order their inverse mass. As the massless limit is approached, the bound state radii approach infinity, and they become new asymptotic states with odd quantum numbers giving a dynamical understanding to the origin of semitons.</description>

      <title>Flat space gravity at finite cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of Einstein gravity with vanishing cosmological constant subjected to conformal boundary conditions. Our focus is on comparing the series of subextensive terms to predictions from thermal effective field theory, with which we find agreement for the boundary theory on a spatial sphere, hyperbolic space, and flat space. We calculate the leading Wilson coefficients and observe that the first subextensive correction to the free energy is negative. This violates a conjectured bound on this coefficient in quantum field theory, which we interpret as a signal that gravity does not fully decouple in the putative boundary dual.</description>

      <title>Gravastars as Nontopological Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a coupled system consisting of a complex scalar field, a U(1) gauge field, a complex Higgs scalar field, and Einstein gravity. We present nontopological soliton star solutions in which the interior geometry is described by the de Sitter metric, the exterior by the Schwarzschild metric, and these two regions are attached by a spherical surface layer with a finite thickness. This structure is the same as the so-called gravastars, so we refer to these solutions as \lq solitonic gravastars\rq . We demonstrate that compact solitonic gravastars that possessing photon spheres can appear. Additionally, we study the mass and compactness of solitonic gravastars for various sets of parameters that characterize the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note expands on the details of the relationship between 4d kination solutions in string cosmology and Kasner solutions of 10d general relativity. It extends previous analyses of this relationship in IIB string theory to other string theories and also to 11d M-theory, while also providing extensive detail on the relationship between perturbations of the 10d Kasner metric and the presence of radiation and matter backgrounds in the dimensionally reduced 4d kination theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate $ \mathcal{O}\left( r^N \right) $ asymptotic symmetries for a two-form gauge field in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. By employing symplectic renormalization, we identify $ N $ independent asymptotic charges, with each charge being parametrised by an arbitrary function of the angular variables. Working in Lorenz gauge, the gauge parameters require a radial expansion involving logarithmic (subleading) terms to ensure nontrivial angular dependence at leading order. At the same time, we adopt a setup where the field strength admits a power expansion, allowing logarithms in the gauge field expansions within pure gauge sectors. The same setup is studied for electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>The holographic $T\bar{T}$ deformation of the entanglement entropy in (A)dS$_3$/CFT$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the holographic duality between $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theory (CFT) and Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space with finite radial truncation has received significant attention. The study of $T\bar{T}$ deformation within the framework of de Sitter (dS)/CFT duality has also progressed. This paper shows that the trace flow equation in dS spacetime can be analytically extended from its AdS counterpart through double Wick rotations. Additionally, we generalize the replica sphere method in both AdS and dS holography to derive a general expression for the entanglement entropy of arbitrary single spatial intervals. For both finite size and finite temperature systems, we obtain the entanglement entropy corrections due to $T\bar{T}$ deformation. Finally, using strong subadditivity and boosted strong subadditivity, we show that the dual field theory on the timelike boundary is non-local in dS holography.</description>

      <title>Higher-genus Fay-like identities from meromorphic generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A possible way of constructing polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of higher genera facilitates integration kernels, which can be derived from generating functions incorporating the geometry of the surface. Functional relations between polylogarithms rely on identities for those integration kernels. In this article, we derive identities for Enriquez' meromorphic generating function and investigate the implications for the associated integration kernels. The resulting identities are shown to be exhaustive and therefore reproduce all identities for Enriquez' kernels conjectured in arXiv:2407.11476 recently.</description>

      <title>Note on explicit construction of conformal generators on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lowest Landau level on the sphere was recently proposed as a continuum regularization of the three-dimensional conformal field theories, the so-called fuzzy sphere regularization. In this note, we propose an explicit construction of the conformal generators on the fuzzy sphere in terms of the microscopic Hamiltonian. Specifically, we construct the generators for the translation and special conformal transformation, which are used in defining the conformal primary states and thus are of special interest. We apply our method to a concrete example, the fuzzy sphere regularized three-dimensional Ising conformal field theory. We show that it can help capture all primaries with spin $\ell &lt; 4$ and scaling dimension $\Delta &lt; 7$. In particular, our method can clearly separate the primary from other states that differ in scaling dimension by $1\%$, making it hard otherwise based solely on using the conformal tower associated with the primaries.</description>

      <title>On the space of $2d$ integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study infinite dimensional Lie algebras, whose infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras correspond with the symmetry algebra of $2d$ integrable models. These Lie algebras are defined by the set of infinitesimal, nonlinear, and higher derivative symmetry transformations present in theories with a left(right)-moving or (anti)-holomorphic current. We study a large class of such Lagrangian theories. We classify the commuting subalgebras of the $2d$ free massless scalar, and find the symmetries of the known integrable models such as sine-Gordon, Liouville, Bullough-Dodd, and Korteweg-de Vries. Along the way, we find several new sequences of commuting charges, which we conjecture are charges of integrable models which are new deformations of a single scalar. After quantizing, the Lie algebra is deformed, and so are their commuting subalgebras.</description>

      <title>A test of the conjectured critical black-hole formation -- null geodesic correspondence: The case of self-gravitating scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been conjectured [A. Ianniccari {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 133}, 081401 (2024)] that there exists a correspondence between the critical threshold of black-hole formation and the stability properties of null circular geodesics in the curved spacetime of the collapsing matter configuration. In the present compact paper we provide a non-trivial test of this intriguing conjecture. In particular, using analytical techniques we study the physical and mathematical properties of self-gravitating scalar field configurations that possess marginally-stable (degenerate) null circular geodesics. We reveal the interesting fact that the {\it analytically} calculated critical compactness parameter ${\cal C}^{\text{analytical}}\equiv{\text{max}_r}\{m(r)/r\}=6/25$, which signals the appearance of the first (marginally-stable) null circular geodesic in the curved spacetime of the self-gravitating scalar fields, agrees quite well (to within $\sim10\%$) with the exact compactness parameter ${\cal C}^{\text{numerical}}\equiv\text{max}_t\{\text{max}_r\{m(r)/r\}\}\simeq0.265$ which is computed {\it numerically} using fully non-linear numerical simulations of the gravitational collapse of scalar fields at the threshold of black-hole formation [here $m(r)$ is the gravitational mass contained within a sphere of radius $r$].</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the critical behavior of multi-matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a matrix model, by combining the Schwinger-Dyson equations with positivity constraints on its solutions, in the large $N$ limit one is able to obtain explicit and numerical bounds on its moments. This technique is known as bootstrapping with positivity. In this paper we use this technique to estimate the critical points and exponents of several matrix multi-models. As a proof of concept, we first show it can be used to find the well-studied quartic single matrix model's critical phenomena. We then apply the method to several similar ``unsolved" 2-matrix models with various quartic interactions. We conjecture and present strong evidence for the string susceptibility exponent for some of these models to be $\gamma = 1/2$, which heuristically indicates that the continuum limit will likely be the Continuum Random Tree. For the other 2-matrix models, we find estimates of new string susceptibility exponents that may indicate a new continuum limit. We then study an unsolved 3-matrix model that generalizes the 3-colour model with cubic interactions. Additionally, for all of these models, we are able to derive explicitly the first several terms of the free energy in the large $N$ limit as a power series expansion in the coupling constants at zero by exploiting the structure of the Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions for Maxwell-scalar system on radially symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Maxwell-scalar models on radially symmetric spacetimes in which the gauge and scalar fields are coupled via the electric permittivity. We find the conditions that allow for the presence of minimum energy configurations. In this formalism, the charge density must be written exclusively in terms of the components of the metric tensor and the scalar field is governed by first-order equations. We also find a manner to map the aforementioned equation into the corresponding one associated to kinks in $(1,1)$ spacetime dimensions, so we get analytical solutions for three specific spacetimes. We then calculate the energy density and show that the energy is finite. The stability of the solutions against contractions and dilations, following Derrick's argument, and around small fluctuations in the fields is also investigated. In this direction, we show that the solutions obeying the first-order framework are stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the first-order perturbative Taub-NUT black hole solutions in Einstein gravity extended with a cubic curvature invariant. The corrected thermodynamic quantities are then obtained by the standard method and the first law and Smarr relation are satisfied. We also study the perturbative correction to thermodynamics using the Reall-Santos (RS) method and verify that the method is still applicable even though the metrics are no longer asymptotic to Minkowski spacetime. We then apply the RS method to obtain the leading correction to the thermodynamics of the complicated Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the first and second order cosmological perturbation equations in f(R) modified gravity theory and provide the equation of motion of second order scalar induced gravitational waves. We find that the effects of modified gravity not only change the form of the equation of motion of second order scalar induced gravitational waves but also contribute an additional anisotropic stress tensor, composed of first order scalar perturbations, to the source term of the gravitational waves. We calculate the energy density spectrum of second order scalar induced gravitational waves in the HS model. Utilizing current pulsar timing array observational data, we perform a rigorous Bayesian analysis of the parameter space of the HS model.</description>

Abstract: We examine the framework of relativistic spin-hydrodynamics in the context of electron hydrodynamics in graphene. We develop a spin-hydrodynamic model for a (2 + 1)-dimensional system of fermions under the condition of small spin polarization. Our analysis confirms that thermal vorticity, which satisfies the global equilibrium condition, is also a solution to the spin-hydrodynamic equations. Additionally, we calculate the magnetization of the system in global equilibrium and introduce a novel phenomenon - thermovortical magnetization - resulting from thermal vorticity, which can be experimentally observed in graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a magnetic domain wall in the ferromagnetic phase in chiral magnets in two dimensions with an in-plane easy-axis anisotropy and an out-of-plane Zeeman magnetic field, and find a chiral soliton lattice (spiral) phase beside a ferromegnetic phase inside the domain line, where the former represents a domain-wall skyrmion crystal from the bulk point of view. We first determine the phase diagram on the domain wall by numerically constructing domain wall solutions. We then analytically reproduce the phase diagram in a domain-wall theory (a chiral double sine-Gordon model) that we construct within the moduli approximation by treating the Zeeman magnetic field perturbatively. While we find good agreements between the phase diagrams of the numerical and effective theory methods, the numerical solution exhibits a decomposition of the topological charge into a bimeron which cannot be captured by the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Evaporation Process and Tangherlini-Reissner-Nordstr\"om Black Holes Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the black hole evaporation process and shadow property of the Tangherlini-Reissner-Nordstr\"om (TRN) black holes. The TRN black holes are the higher-dimensional extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes and are characterized by their mass $M$, charge $q$, and spacetime dimensions $D$. In higher-dimensional spacetime, the black hole evaporation occurs rapidly, causing the black hole's horizon to shrink. We derive the rate of mass loss for the higher-dimensional charged black hole and investigate the effect of higher-dimensional spacetime on charged black hole shadow. We derive the complete geodesic equations of motion with the effect of spacetime dimensions $D$. We determine impact parameters by maximizing the black hole's effective potential and estimate the critical radius of photon orbits. The photon orbits around the black hole shrink with the effect of the increasing number of spacetime dimensions. To visualize the shadows of the black hole, we derive the celestial coordinates in terms of the black hole parameters. We use the observed results of M87 and Sgr A$^{*}$ black hole from the Event Horizon Telescope and estimate the angular diameter of the charge black hole shadow in the higher-dimensional spacetime. We also estimate the energy emission rate of the black hole. Our finding shows that the angular diameter of the black hole shadow decreases with the increasing number of spacetime dimensions $D$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Primordial Black Hole Abundance through Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Advanced LIGO and Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a promising dark matter candidate, primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ are supposed to have evaporated by today through Hawking radiation. This scenario is challenged by the memory burden effect, which suggests that the evaporation of black holes may slow down significantly after they have emitted about half of their initial mass. We explore the astrophysical implications of the memory burden effect on the PBH abundance by today and the possibility for PBHs lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ to persist as dark matter. Our analysis utilizes current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data to constrain the primordial power spectrum and infers the PBH abundance. We find a null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves that accompanied the formation of the PBHs. Then we place an upper limit on the primordial power spectrum and the PBH abundance to be $f_{\mathrm{pbh}}\simeq0.3$ for PBHs with masses $\sim10^{-24}M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, we expect that next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer, will provide even more stringent constraints. Our results indicate that future detectors can reach sensitivities that could rule out PBH as dark matter within $\sim[10^{-29}M_{\odot},10^{-19}M_{\odot}]$ in the null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Mass hierarchies in gauge theory with two index symmetric representation matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories, the running of the anomalous dimension of a fermion bilinear operator is believed to lead to chiral symmetry breaking when gamma=1. Naively using perturbative results to judge when gamma=1 leads to the possibility of large dynamically generated mass hierarchies in models with both two index symmetric representation and fundamental representation fermions. In this paper we study a holographic model of this physics to predict the separation in scales in the meson spectrum. We study SU(Nc) theories at different Nc with one flavour of two index symmetric representation as a function of the number of fundamental fermion flavours NfF. The largest hierarchy we find is for Nc=7 and NfF=22 where the rho mesons made of the two different representations are separated in scale by a factor of 13. For general Nc the hierarchy can be made greater than 7 by tuning NfF. We display the hierarchy as a function of NfF and investigate the quark mass dependence. These predictions do depend on the extrapolation of gamma from the perturbative regime - even in a pessimistic scenario a distinct gap can be achieved.</description>

      <title>A Procedure g5anchor to Anchor $\gamma_5$ in Feynman Diagrams for the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a procedure g5anchor to anchor $\gamma_5$ in the definition of a Dirac trace with $\gamma_5$ in Dimensional Regularization (DR) in Feynman diagrams for the Standard Model, based on a recent revision of the works by Kreimer, Gottlieb and Donohue. For each closed fermion chain with an odd number of primitive (i.e.~not-yet-clearly-defined) $\gamma_5$ in a given Feynman diagram, g5anchor returns a definite set of anchor points for $\gamma_5$, in terms of pairs of ordered fermion propagators; at each of these $\gamma_5$ anchor points a fixed expression in terms of the Levi-Civita tensor and elementary Dirac matrices will be inserted together with a sign determined by anticommutatively shifting all $\gamma_5$ from their original places (dictated by the Feynman rules) to this anchor point. The defining expressions for the cyclic $\gamma_5$-odd Dirac traces in DR associated with closed fermion chains in amplitudes, or more generally squared amplitudes, thus follow from this procedure, where the Levi-Civita tensors are not necessarily treated strictly in 4-dimensions. We propose utilizing this definition in practical perturbative calculations in the Standard Model at least to three-loop orders with the current implementation, and maybe to higher loop orders in absence of Yukawa couplings to Higgs fields. Certain limitations and modifications of the KKS and/or the Kreimer scheme are addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of loop quantum gravity (LQG) on extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), and the results indicate that LQG effects cause the orbital decay to occur faster compared to the Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, we use the augmented analytic kludge approach to generate EMRI waveforms and study the LISA's capability to detect the LQG effect with faithfulness. Additionally, employing the Fisher information matrix method for parameter estimation, we estimate that after one year of observation, the uncertainty in $r_0$ reduces to approximately $6.59\times 10^{-4}$ with a signal-to-noise ratio of $49$.</description>

      <title>Black Holes, Complex Curves, and Graph Theory: Revising a Conjecture by Kasner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ratios $\sqrt{8/9}=2\sqrt{2}/3\approx 0.9428$ and $\sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866$ appear in various contexts of black hole physics, as values of the charge-to-mass ratio $Q/M$ or the rotation parameter $a/M$ for Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes, respectively. In this work, in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, I relate these ratios with the quantization of the horizon area, or equivalently of the entropy. Furthermore, these ratios are related to a century-old work of Kasner, in which he conjectured that certain sequences arising from complex analysis may have a quantum interpretation. These numbers also appear in the case of Kerr black holes, but the explanation is not as straightforward. The Kasner ratio may also be relevant for understanding the random matrix and random graph approaches to black hole physics, such as fast scrambling of quantum information, via a bound related to Ramanujan graph. Intriguingly, some other pure mathematical problems in complex analysis, notably complex interpolation in the unit disk, appear to share some mathematical expressions with the black hole problem and thus also involve the Kasner ratio.</description>

      <title>Generalized Komar charges and Smarr formulas for black holes and boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard Komar charge is a $(d-2)$-form that can be defined in spacetimes admitting a Killing vector and which is closed when the vacuum Einstein equations are satisfied. Its integral at spatial infinity (the Komar integral) gives the conserved charge associated to the Killing vector, and, due to its on-shell closedness, the same value (expressed in terms of other physical variables) is obtained integrating over the event horizon (if any). This equality is the basis of the Smarr formula. This charge can be generalized so that it still is closed on-shell in presence of matter and its integrals give generalizations of the Smarr formula. We show how the Komar charge and other closed $(d-2)$-form charges can be used to prove non-existence theorems for gravitational solitons and boson stars. In particular, we show how one can deal with generalized symmetric fields (invariant under a combination of isometries and other global symmetries) and how the geralized symmetric ansatz permits to evade the non-existence theorems.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this review is to provide a pedagogical development of the Unruh effect and the thermofield double state. In Section 2, we construct Rindler spacetime and analyze the perspective of an observer undergoing constant acceleration in Minkowski spacetime, which motivates the establishment of the relationship between the Fourier modes in both geometries using the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation. In Section 3, we explore the underlying physics leading to the Unruh effect and draw an analogy to the thermal radiation observed around a Schwarzschild black hole. Finally, in Section 4, we derive the thermofield double state by conducting a Euclidean analysis of the field and geometry.</description>

Abstract: This paper examines the holographic computation of bulk and shear viscosity ratios in strongly coupled thermal plasmas using the AdS/BCFT correspondence within Horndeski gravity. We demonstrate that this framework leads to non-zero viscosity-to-entropy ratios ($\zeta/S$ and $\eta/S$) at low temperatures, indicating a break in conformal symmetry. At high temperatures, these ratios approach zero, recovering the expected conformal behavior of quark-gluon plasma. Our findings provide new insights into the hydrodynamic properties of strongly coupled plasmas and offer a more nuanced understanding of QCD-like theories in holographic models.</description>

Abstract: We propose the Symmetry TFT for theories with a $U(1)$ symmetry in arbitrary dimension. The Symmetry TFT describes the structure of the symmetry, its anomalies, and the possible topological manipulations. It is constructed as a BF theory of gauge fields for groups $U(1)$ and $\mathbb{R}$, and contains a continuum of topological operators. We also propose an operation that produces the Symmetry TFT for the theory obtained by dynamically gauging the $U(1)$ symmetry. We discuss many examples. As an interesting outcome, we obtain the Symmetry TFT for the non-invertible $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ chiral symmetry in four dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the existence of monotonic quantities along renormalization group flows using only the Null Energy Condition and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the entanglement entropy of field theories with anti-de Sitter gravity duals. In particular, we consider flows within the same dimension and holographically reprove the $c$-, $F$-, and $a$-theorems in dimensions two, three, and four. We focus on the family of maximally spherical entangling surfaces, define a quasi-constant of motion corresponding to the breaking of conformal invariance, and use a properly defined distance between minimal surfaces to construct a holographic $c$-function that is monotonic along the flow. We then apply our method to the case of flows across dimensions: There, we reprove the monotonicity of flows from $\mathrm{AdS}_{D+1}$ to $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ and prove the novel case of flows from $\mathrm{AdS}_5$ to $\mathrm{AdS}_4$.</description>

      <title>Towards field theory of multiple D0-branes. Hamiltonian mechanics and quantization of simplest 3D prototype of multiple D0-brane system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently we have constructed a completely supersymmetric nonlinear action possessing the properties expected from multiple D0-brane system. Its quantization should result in an interesting supersymmetric field theory in the (super)space with additional matrix coordinates which can provide an important insights in the study of String Theory. As a first stage toward this aim, in this paper we construct the Hamiltonian mechanics and perform covariant quantization of the simplest three dimensional counterpart of the ten dimensional multiple D0-brane model. We obtain a supersymmetric system of equations in super-spacetime enlarged by bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates which appears as a result of such quantization and discuss some of its properties.</description>

      <title>Flux vacua in type IIB compactifications on orbifolds: their finiteness and minimal string coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of (supersymmetric) moduli stabilisation in type IIB toroidal orientifolds with fluxes. We provide strong evidence towards exhaustion of the finite number of inequivalent vacua for a given total 3-form flux charge $N_{\rm flux}$. We also find that the minimal value of the string coupling $g_s$ is given in terms of $N_{\rm flux}$ and present strong evidence for the asymptotic relation $g_{s,\,\rm{min}}\sim c/N_{\rm flux}^\alpha$, with $\alpha=1,2$, valid for not too small $N_{\rm flux}$, where $c$ is an order 1 coefficient and $\alpha$ depends on the orbifold. Imposing tadpole cancellation, $N_{\rm flux}$ is bounded from the number of orientifold O3-planes. Combined with the flux quantisation, this forbids orientifold vacua without anti-brane charge. On the other hand, the presence of negative D3-brane charge induced by magnetised D7-branes breaks supersymmetry and relaxes the bound, allowing significantly smaller values for $g_s$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05617v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve black hole information paradox within semiclassical gravity, in a manner that does not depend on details of unknown quantum gravity. Our crucial insight is that outgoing Hawking particles are physical only far from the black hole horizon, so they are created far from the horizon and entangled with degrees of freedom closer to the horizon. The latter degrees of freedom can be understood as quasi-classical coherent states, implying that Hawking radiation is accompanied with additional radiation similar to classical radiation by which the black hole loses hair during the classical gravitational collapse. The two kinds of radiation are entangled, which resolves black hole information paradox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the new identity in homotopy algebras which directly corresponds to the Schwinger-Dyson equations in quantum field theory. As an application, we derive the Ward-Takahashi identities. We demonstrate that the Ward-Takahashi identities are reproduced in several examples. In general, our formula contains divergence. We mediate this problem by introducing stubs known in the context of string field theory. With the regularization, we can calculate the anomaly such as axial U(1) anomaly in vector-like U(1) gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a semi-standard Young tableau (SSYT) approach to construct a basis of non-factorizable superamplitudes in N = 1 massless supersymmetry. This amplitude basis can be directly translated to a basis for higher dimensional supersymmetric operators, yielding both the number of independent operators and their form. We deal with distinguishable (massless) chiral/vector superfields at first, then generalize the result to the indistinguishable case. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this method compared to the previously studied Hilbert series approach.</description>

      <title>Infinite and finite consistent truncations on deformed generalised parallelisations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a manifold $\mathbb{M}$ admitting a maximally supersymmetric consistent truncation, we show how to formulate new consistent truncations by restricting to a set of Kaluza-Klein modes on $\mathbb{M}$ invariant under some subgroup of the group of isometries of $\mathbb{M}$. These truncations may involve either finite or infinite sets of modes. We provide their global description using exceptional generalised geometry to construct a `deformed' generalised parallelisation starting with that on $\mathbb{M}$. This allows us to explicitly embed known consistent truncations directly into exceptional generalised geometry/exceptional field theory, and to obtain the equations governing situations where the consistent truncation retains an infinite tower of modes.</description>

      <title>Learning Group Invariant Calabi-Yau Metrics by Fundamental Domain Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new invariant machine learning models that approximate the Ricci-flat metric on Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds with discrete symmetries. We accomplish this by combining the $\phi$-model of the cymetric package with non-trainable, $G$-invariant, canonicalization layers that project the $\phi$-model's input data (i.e. points sampled from the CY geometry) to the fundamental domain of a given symmetry group $G$. These $G$-invariant layers are easy to concatenate, provided one compatibility condition is fulfilled, and combine well with spectral $\phi$-models. Through experiments on different CY geometries, we find that, for fixed point sample size and training time, canonicalized models give slightly more accurate metric approximations than the standard $\phi$-model. The method may also be used to compute Ricci-flat metric on smooth CY quotients. We demonstrate this aspect by experiments on a smooth $\mathbb{Z}^2_5$ quotient of a 5-parameter quintic CY manifold.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and chaos in deformed SYK models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently been proposed as a quantum probe of chaos. The Krylov exponent characterising the exponential growth of Krylov complexity is conjectured to upper-bound the Lyapunov exponent. We compute the Krylov and the Lyapunov exponents in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and in some of its deformations. We do this analysis both at infinite and finite temperatures, in models where the number of fermionic interactions is both finite and infinite. We consider deformations that interpolate between two regions of near-maximal chaos and deformations that become nearly-integrable at low temperatures. In all cases, we find that the Krylov exponent upper-bounds the Lyapunov one. However, we find that while the Lyapunov exponent can have non-monotonic behaviour as a function of temperature, in all studied examples the Krylov exponent behaves monotonically. For instance, we find models where the Lyapunov exponent goes to zero at low temperatures, while the Krylov exponent saturates to its maximal bound. We speculate on the possibility that this monotonicity might be a generic feature of the Krylov exponent in quantum systems evolving under unitary evolution.</description>

Abstract: We study the Krylov state complexity of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model for $N \le 28$ Majorana fermions with $q$-body fermion interaction with $q=4,6,8$ for a range of sparse parameter $k$. Using the peak of the Krylov complexity as a probe, we find change in behavior as we vary $k$ for various $q$. We argue that this captures the change from holographic to non-holographic behavior in the sparse SYK-type models such that model is holographic for all $k \ge k_{\text{min}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study half-BPS flows in gauged minimal 7d supergravity featured by an AdS$_3\times S^3$ slicing of the metric, supported by a dyonic three-form field. We first present a novel strategy for analytic integration of the BPS equations, which makes use of the integrals of motion. Subsequently, we discuss the suitable choice of integration constants that gives rise to smooth geometries. These flows are asymptotically locally AdS$_7$ in their UV limit, while their IR geometry is AdS$_3\times \mathbb{R}^4$. We then discuss their uplifts to 11d and massive IIA supergravity and observe that they describe one-parameter deformations of their AdS$_7\times S^4$ and AdS$_7\times S^3$ vacua, respectively, their holographic interpretation being as conformal defect CFT$_2$'s within the corresponding dual SCFT$_6$'s. We conclude with the computation of the holographic central charge, by focussing on the M-theory interpretation.</description>

Abstract: We study the two families of AdS$_3\times S^3\times S^2\times \Sigma_2$ solutions to massive Type IIA supergravity with small and large $(0,4)$ supersymmetries constructed recently in the literature, in connection with the AdS$_7\times S^2\times I$ solutions to massive Type IIA, to which they asymptote locally. Based on our analysis of various observables, that we study holographically, we propose an interpretation of the first class of solutions as dual to deconstructed 6d (1,0) CFTs dual to AdS$_7$, and of the second class as dual to surface defects in the same 6d theories. Among the observables that we study are baryon vertices and giant graviton configurations in quiver-like constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational dual of a fermionic field theory at finite temperature and charge density in two spatial dimensions, subject to a deformation by a relevant scalar operator. This makes a $(3+1)$-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell system coupled to a free fermion fluid, known as an electron cloud, undergo a holographic renormalization group flow. The inner (Cauchy) horizon is destroyed and the near-singularity metric instead adopts the form of a positive-$p_t$ Kasner cosmology, signaling the collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge. Previous studies have suggested that this collapse hinders direct probing of the singularity. Nonetheless, we propose and compute several CFT observables that characterize the interior and near-singularity geometries. These include the thermal $a$-function, which decays with a specific power of $p_t$ as nearly all CFT degrees of freedom are integrated out, and two-point correlators for neutral and charged operators, with the latter directly probing the singularity despite the positive-$p_t$. We also calculate characteristic velocities related to entanglement and complexity growth in the time-evolved thermofield double state, as well as the butterfly effect indicative of operator spreading. Notably, the deformed electron cloud features a Lifshitz IR fixed point and an additional Kasner trans-IR fixed point, absent in neutral RG flows.</description>

      <title>Kasner eons with matter: holographic excursions to the black hole singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that introducing higher-curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action causes the approach to a space-like singularity to unfold as a sequence of Kasner eons. Each eon is dominated by emergent physics at an energy scale controlled by higher-curvature terms of a given order, transitioning to higher-order eons as the singularity is approached. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we demonstrate that the inclusion of matter dramatically modifies the physics of eons compared to the vacuum case. We illustrate this by considering a family of quasi-topological gravities of arbitrary order minimally coupled to a scalar field. Second, we investigate Kasner eons in the interior of black holes with field theory duals and analyze their imprints on holographic observables. We show that the behavior of the thermal $a$-function, two-point functions of heavy operators, and holographic complexity can capture distinct signatures of the eons, making them promising tools for diagnosing stringy effects near black hole singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the most generic Carrollian higher derivative free scalar field theory intrinsically on a Carrollian manifold. The solutions to these theories are massless free particles propagating with speeds depending on the coupling constants in the Lagrangian, thus, allowing interference solutions which are not allowed on a Lorentzian manifold. This demonstrates that the set of solutions to the Carrollian theories is much larger than that of their Lorentzian counterparts. We also show that Carrollian higher derivative theories are more resistant to Ostrogradsky's instabilities. These instabilities can be resolved by choosing the coupling constants appropriately in the Carrollian Lagrangian, something that was proven to be impossible in Lorentzian theories.</description>

Abstract: We give a microscopic derivation of the semi-classical entropy of static black holes in 3d Lovelock gravities, which are certain 3d Horndeski theories that were recently discovered from higher-dimensional Lovelock gravities via various methods and admit novel black hole solutions analogous to higher-dimensional ones. Assuming the ground state is described by the soliton obtained from the black hole solution by performing a double Wick rotation, we reproduce the semi-classical entropy from Cardy formula without central charges for the asymptotic growth of the number of states. We explain in detail how the mass of the soliton, which is needed in the Cardy formula, can be computed in the mini-superspace formalism.</description>

      <title>On effective models of regular black holes inspired by higher-derivative and nonlocal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study static spherically symmetric solutions of effective field equations related to local and nonlocal higher-derivative gravity models, based on their associated effective delta sources. This procedure has been applied to generate modifications of the Schwarzschild geometry in several contexts (e.g., modified gravity, string theory, noncommutative geometry, generalized uncertainty principle scenarios), but a general analysis of the possible equations of state and their influence on the solutions was still lacking. Here, we aim to fill this gap in the literature and investigate whether these metrics might be able to reproduce features of the solutions of higher-derivative gravity models. In particular, we present an equation of state such that the solution matches the Newtonian-limit one in both regimes of large and small $r$. A significant part of the work is dedicated to studying the curvature regularity of the solutions and the comparison with the linearized solutions. Explicit metrics are presented for effective sources originating from local and nonlocal models. The results obtained here might be regarded as possible links between the previous research on linearized higher-derivative gravity and the solutions of the nonlinear complete field equations, which remain unknown at the moment.</description>

      <title>Derived deformation theory of crepant curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper determines the full derived deformation theory of certain smooth rational curves C in Calabi-Yau 3-folds, by determining all higher A_\infty-products in its controlling DG-algebra. This geometric setup includes very general cases where C does not contract, cases where the curve neighbourhood is not rational, all known simple smooth 3-fold flops, and all known divisorial contractions to curves. As a corollary, it is shown that the noncommutative deformation theory of C can be described as a superpotential algebra derived from what we call free necklace polynomials, which are elements in the free algebra obtained via a closed formula from combinatorial gluing data. The description of these polynomials, together with the above results, establishes a suitably interpreted string theory prediction due to Ferrari, Aspinwall-Katz and Curto-Morrison. Perhaps most significantly, the main results give both the language and evidence to finally formulate new contractibility conjectures for rational curves in CY 3-folds, which lift Artin's celebrated results from surfaces.</description>

      <title>Self-interactions can (also) destabilize bosonic stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical stability of Proca-Higgs stars, in spherical symmetry. These are solutions of the Einstein-Proca-Higgs model, which features a Higgs-like field coupled to a Proca field, both of which minimally coupled to the gravitational field. The corresponding stars can be regarded as Proca stars with self-interactions, while avoiding the hyperbolicity issues of self-interacting Einstein-Proca models. We report that these configurations are stable near the Proca limit in the candidate stable branches, but exhibit instabilities in certain parts of the parameter space, even in the candidate stable branches, regaining their stability for very strong self-interactions. This shows that for these models, unlike various examples of scalar boson stars, self-interactions can deteriorate, rather than improve, the dynamical robustness of bosonic stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of two dimensional gravity models using ideas motivated by the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. This leads to a rather natural formulation of a theory that has close links with Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. After introducing the theory and discussing its vacuum solutions, we present the Hamiltonian analysis. This implies the presence of a single dynamical degree of freedom, which is in sharp contrast to General Relativity, where there are no degrees of freedom in two spacetime dimensions. Our approach can be extended to various other lower-dimensional gravity theories and thus could be of wider interest.</description>

      <title>Phantom matter: a challenging solution to the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy density (associated with the cosmological term $\Lambda$) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, denoted X. Here we deal with model $w$XCDM, a simplified version of the old $\Lambda$XCDM model (Grande et al., 2006), and exploit the possibility that X behaves as `phantom matter' (PM), which appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, the PM fluid satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory `phantom vacuum' tunneled into the late universe before it heads towards a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using SNIa, cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO (BAO 2D), LSS data and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the $H_0$ and growth tensions virtually disappear, provided that BAO 2D are the only source of BAO data used in the fit. In contrast, our preliminary analysis using exclusively anisotropic BAO (BAO 3D) indicates that the ability to ease the $H_0$ tension is significantly reduced as compared to the scenario with BAO 2D, despite the fact that the overall fit to the cosmological data is still better than in the $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, our approach with BAO 2D favors quintessence-like behavior of the DE below $z\simeq 1.5$ at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ CL, which is compatible with the recent DESI measurements.</description>

      <title>Strain effects on the electronic properties of a graphene wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the strain and curvature effects on the electronic properties of a curved graphene structure, called the graphene wormhole. The electron dynamics is described by a massless Dirac fermion containing position--dependent Fermi velocity. In addition, the strain produces a pseudo--magnetic vector potential to the geometric coupling. For an isotropic strain tensor, the decoupled components of the spinor field exhibit a supersymmetric (SUSY) potential, depending on the centrifugal term and the external magnetic field only. In the absence of a external magnetic field, the strain yields to an exponential damped amplitude, whereas the curvature leads to a power--law damping of the wave function. The spin--curvature coupling breaks the chiral symmetry between the upper and the lower spinor component, which leads to the increasing of the wave function on either upper or lower region of the wormhole, i.e., depending on the spin number. By adding an uniform magnetic field, the effective potential exhibits an asymptotic quadratic profile and a spin--curvature barrier near the throat. As a result, the bound states (Landau levels) are confined around the wormhole throat showing an asymmetric and spin--dependent profile.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of a Non-Inflationary Universe from Massive Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit models of classical primordial standard clocks in an alternative to inflation, namely the slowly contracting ekpyrotic scenario. We study the phenomenology of massive spectator fields added to a state-of-the-art ekpyrotic model, with coupling functions that allow for these heavy fields to be classically excited while the background is slowly contracting. We perform numerical computations of the corrections to the scalar primordial power spectrum and compare with analytical estimates. Our full numerical results reveal so-called clock signals, sharp feature signals, as well as signals that link the two together. The models are found to predict oscillatory features that are resolutely different from what is calculated in inflation, and thus, such features represent unique fingerprints of a slowly contracting universe. This confirms the capability of primordial standard clocks to model-independently discriminate among very early universe scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fractionalization of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetry and Exotic Hall Conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate fractionalization of non-invertible symmetry in (2+1)D topological orders. We focus on coset non-invertible symmetries obtained by gauging non-normal subgroups of invertible $0$-form symmetries. These symmetries can arise as global symmetries in quantum spin liquids, given by the quotient of the projective symmetry group by a non-normal subgroup as invariant gauge group. We point out that such coset non-invertible symmetries in topological orders can exhibit symmetry fractionalization: each anyon can carry a "fractional charge" under the coset non-invertible symmetry given by a gauge invariant superposition of fractional quantum numbers. We present various examples using field theories and quantum double lattice models, such as fractional quantum Hall systems with charge conjugation symmetry gauged and finite group gauge theory from gauging a non-normal subgroup. They include symmetry enriched $S_3$ and $O(2)$ gauge theories. We show that such systems have a fractionalized continuous non-invertible coset symmetry and a well-defined electric Hall conductance. The coset symmetry enforces a gapless edge state if the boundary preserves the continuous non-invertible symmetry. We propose a general approach for constructing coset symmetry defects using a "sandwich" construction: non-invertible symmetry defects can generally be constructed from an invertible defect sandwiched by condensation defects. The anomaly free condition for finite coset symmetry is also identified.</description>

      <title>Can recent DESI BAO measurements accommodate a negative cosmological constant?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anti-de Sitter vacuum, which correspond to a negative cosmological constant (CC), is theoretically important and well-motivated. However, whether it exists in reality or not has always been a controversial issue. In this paper, we perform the search for the negative CC using recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation measurements combined with Planck cosmic microwave background and Pantheon Plus supernova data. Though we did not find the evidence for negative CC, we observed the indication for it, the negative CC is preferred at $&gt;68\%$ significance level, while such a negative CC can make the state equation of evolving dark energy component (coexisting with negative CC) $w\geqslant -1$. Our work highlights the potential of upcoming cosmological surveys to search for the negative CC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum information science, Clifford operators and stabilizer codes play a central role for systems of qubits (or qudits). In this paper, we study the analogous objects for systems of Majorana fermions. A crucial role is played by fermion parity symmetry, which is an unbreakable symmetry present in any system in which the fundamental degrees of freedom are fermionic. We prove that the subgroup of parity-preserving fermionic Cliffords can be represented by the orthogonal group over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$, and we show how it can be generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity) Majorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this so-called p-Clifford group, proving that it is equivalent to the frame potential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on a fixed-parity sector of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Parametrized-Post-Newtonian Test of Black Hole Spacetime for Galactic Center Massive Black Hole Sgr A*: Formulation and $\chi^2$ Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have performed a parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) test of a black hole spacetime using observational data of the star S0-2/S2 orbiting the massive black hole at our galactic center Sgr A*. After introducing our PPN model of black hole spacetime, we report the result of $\chi^2$ fitting of the PPN model with the observational data. A new finding through our PPN model is a detectability of the gravitational lens effect on the null geodesics connecting S0-2 and observer under the present observational uncertainties, if a PPN parameter is about one order larger than the value for general relativity case. On the other hand, the effect of black hole spin on the S0-2's motion is not detectable. Thus our present PPN test is performed with spherically symmetric vacuum black hole spacetime. The resultant value of the PPN parameter, which corresponds to the minimum $\chi^2$, implies that the gravitational field of Sgr A* is not of Schwarzschild metric or that there exists a sufficient amount of dark matters around Sgr A* to be detected by present telescopes. However, the difference between the minimum $\chi^2$ and the $\chi^2$ of Schwarzschild case is not large enough to ensure a statistical significance of non-Schwarzschild result. A more precise statistical analysis than $\chi^2$ statistics is necessary to extract a statistically significant information of the gravitational field of Sgr A* from present observational data. We will report a result by a Bayesian analysis in next paper.</description>
