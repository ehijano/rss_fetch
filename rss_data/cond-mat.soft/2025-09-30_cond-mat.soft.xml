      <title>Anti-hyperuniform Critical States of Active Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects are fundamental to the collective dynamics of non-equilibrium systems and in active matter, mediating spontaneous flows, dynamic self-organization, and emergent pattern formation. Here, we reveal critical states in active nematics, marked by slowed defect density relaxation, amplified fluctuations, and heightened sensitivity to activity. Near criticality, defect interactions become long-ranged, scaling with system size, and the system enters an anti-hyperuniform regime with giant number fluctuations of topological defects and defect clustering. This transition reflects a dual scaling behavior: fluctuations are uniform at small scales but become anti-hyperuniform at larger scales, \tm{as supported by experimental measurements on large-field-of-view endothelial monolayers. We find that these anti-hyperuniform states with multiscale defect density fluctuations are robust to varying parameters, introducing frictional damping, and changing boundary conditions.} Finally, we show that the observed anti-hyperuniformity originates from defect clustering, distinguishing this transition from defect-unbinding or phase separation processes. Beyond fundamental implications for non-equilibrium systems, these results may inform biological contexts where topological defects are integral to processes such as morphogenesis and collective cellular self-organization.</description>

      <title>Why and when merging surface nanobubbles jump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas bubble accumulation on substrates reduces the efficiency of many physicochemical processes, such as water electrolysis. For microbubbles, where buoyancy is negligible, coalescence-induced jumping driven by the release of surface energy provides an efficient pathway for their early detachment. At the nanoscale, however, gas compressibility breaks volume conservation during coalescence, suppressing surface energy release and seemingly disabling this detachment route. Using molecular dynamics simulations, continuum numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis, we show that surface nanobubbles with sufficiently large contact angles can nevertheless detach after coalescence. In this regime, detachment is powered by the release of pressure energy associated with nanobubble volume expansion. This finding thus establishes a unified driving mechanism for coalescence-induced bubble detachment across all length scales.</description>

      <title>Augmenting knee biomechanics through programmable knitted ExoSkin orthoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large subset of the population suffers injury or disease that causes knee pain and difficulty navigating day-to-day tasks. Off-the-shelf knee orthoses that are commonly used to treat these ailments overlook user-specific joint geometry and/or biomechanical needs. They can often be made with materials that lead to discomfort. We explore how the rich programmability of knitted fabrics can be harnessed to augment human biomechanics while promoting comfort. In this pursuit, we define \emph{ExoSkins}, a class of unpowered exoskeletons that are lightweight, comfortable, garment-like devices, and are designed based on user- and joint-specific needs. Although we foresee an expansive space for ExoSkin design (e.g., containing active materials, with sensing capabilities), in this study we focus on the interplay between knit geometry and programmable elasticity in passive orthoses as a means to augment the knee's rotational stiffness. We design geometrically-programmed ExoSkins, abbreviated \emph{G-PExos}, that capitalize on the anisotropies of four types of knitted fabric to provide high stiffness for joint torque without the need for rigid materials. Our findings indicate that G-PExos can achieve rotational stiffness of similar magnitude to off-the-shelf orthoses and can also be tuned to achieve a much broader range of rotational stiffness without sacrificing comfort to the user.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal interactions induce persistent active clusters in binary colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study binary colloids under AC electric fields, where electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flows generate nonreciprocal interactions. Mixing particles of different sizes produces self-propelled pairs that fragment and reassemble into persistent active clusters, unlike the static crystallization of single-sized systems. Agent-based and continuum models reproduce these dynamics and identify two key mechanisms: asymmetric pair propulsion and spray-like fission from excluded-volume polarity. These results establish a minimal, controllable platform for exploring nonreciprocal active matter and highlight nonreciprocity as a general route to engineer reconfigurable colloidal assemblies.</description>

      <title>Geometric Frustration Directs the Self-Assembly of Nanoparticles with Crystallized Ligand Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer-grafted nanoparticles are versatile building blocks that self-assemble into a rich diversity of mesostructures. Coarse-grained molecular simulations have commonly accompanied experiments by resolving structure formation pathways and predicting phase behavior. Past simulations represented nanoparticles as spheres and the ligands as flexible chains of beads, isotropically tethered to the nanoparticles. Here, we investigate a different minimal coarse-grained model. The model consists of an attractive rod tethered to a repulsive sphere. The motivation of this rod-sphere model is to describe nanospheres with a partially crystallized, stretched polymeric bundle, as well as other complex building blocks such as rigid surfactants and end-tethered nanorods. Varying the ratio of sphere size to rod radius stabilizes self-limited clusters and other mesostructures of reduced dimensionality. The complex phase behavior we observe is a consequence of geometric frustration.</description>

      <title>Passive polymers in active turbulence undergo a collapse-stretch transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active processes in living systems generate nonequilibrium forces that deform embedded passive macromolecules. To understand how such dynamics influence polymer conformation, we study a flexible passive chain in an active nematic fluid. Using hybrid simulations, we uncover a length-dependent transition in polymer behavior: long chains align with and stretch along defect-driven flows, while short chains bend and collapse due to localized stresses. These responses are controlled by a competition between the polymer size and the emergent length scale of the active turbulence. Our results reveal a defect-mediated mechanism for conformational control and point toward general physical principles for designing responsive soft materials that couple passive structure to active dynamics.</description>

      <title>A DNA-encoded recipe to direct multi-stage colloidal assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In equilibrium self-assembly, microscopic building blocks spontaneously self-organize into stable structures as dictated by their interaction potentials, which limits the accessible structural features to those that correspond to global minima in free energy landscapes; they are often ordered and periodic on length scales comparable to the building block size. Coupling the assembly process to an exergonic reaction drives the system out of equilibrium so that an assembly pathway can be engineered to target a specific kinetically stabilized state, which in principle opens up a vast design space with access to diverse complex structures with features on multiple length scales. However, the question of how such features might be specifically targeted remains unanswered. Here, we explore this design space using a DNA-encoded recipe consisting of multiple biomolecular reactions that dictate the time-dependent binding strength and specificity of each type of subunit in the sample independently, which makes it possible to program an assembly pathway that leads to a kinetically trapped final state. With this kinetic control, we show that the same set of building blocks can form clusters with different final structures. These structures, with tunable core-shell compositions, have feature sizes much larger than the building block size and are governed by the DNA-encoded assembly kinetics. Contrasting global kinetic control strategies such as thermal annealing, tuning the timing of individual biomolecular reactions offers the opportunity to regulate how the activity of each separate co-assembling component of a large set varies over time, opening up the potential for morphogenesis-like assembly processes involving engineered species.</description>

      <title>Chiral Analogues of Knit Stitches Designed Using Chiral Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabrics are flexible thin structures made of entangled yarn or fibers, yet the topological bases of their mechanics remain poorly understood. For weft knitted fabrics, we describe how the entanglement of adjacent stitches contributes to the flexibility of the fabric. Interpreting heterogeneous stitch pairs as domain boundaries reveals that the step between pairs of neighboring stitches is responsible for direction-specific flexibility. In typical knitted fabrics, anisotropic flexibility can be attributed to latticed domain boundaries. The intersections between domain boundaries result in point defects that induce frustration that resembles the impossible Penrose stairs. We identify these by a chiral characteristic, defined summing the ascending or descending steps in a cycle surrounding the defect. Remarkably, seed fabric, a knit with high flexibility in both course and wale directions, is characterized as a racemic crystal of these chiral point defects.</description>

      <title>Twist-Free Enhancement of Strength and Modulus in Electrospun Yarns via Liquid-Assisted Capillary Densification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrospun yarns often fall short of the strength and stiffness of their constituent nanofibers because of loose packing and inter-fiber slip. We report a simple, twist-free route to close this gap by liquid-assisted rolling: yarns are briefly wetted (water or ethanol) and subjected to gentle rolling action (mechanical strokes perpendicular and parallel to the yarn axis), then dried under controlled conditions so that meniscus forces compact the assembly into tightly bound bundles. The treatment yields large gains in tensile strength and modulus, and as yarn diameter decreases the properties of liquid-treated yarns approach single-fiber limits, indicating more efficient load transfer. Dry-rolling controls produce negligible changes compared to as-spun yarns, confirming that capillarity-driven consolidation, rather than mechanical pressing, dominates the improvement. Water consistently outperforms ethanol, reflecting its larger elastocapillary driving term gamma*(1 + cos theta) on PAN and thus stronger capillary compaction; a short post-treatment anneal near Tg further increases stiffness with a corresponding reduction in ductility. To rationalize these trends, we quantify microstructure via SEM-derived alignment and packing density and show that these complementary descriptors jointly explain variability in mechanical response. A compact constitutive framework, grounded in distributed fiber recruitment and adhesion/frictional contact, captures the observed strengthening-ductility trade-off across processing routes. The results establish capillarity-driven consolidation as a scalable pathway to engineer processing-structure-property relationships in hierarchical polymer fiber assemblies and provide practical guidance for upgrading electrospun yarns, alone or as precursors to twisted and composite architectures.</description>

      <title>Design of model Boger fluids with systematically controlled viscoelastic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subject of viscoelastic flow phenomena is crucial to many areas of engineering and the physical sciences. Although much of our understanding of viscoelastic flow features stem from carefully designed experiments, preparation of model viscoelastic fluids remains an outstanding challenge; for example, fabricating a series of fluids with varied fluid shear moduli $G_0$, but with an identical relaxation time $\tau$, is nontrivial. In this work, we harness the non-ideality of nearly constant-viscosity elastic fluids (commonly known as `Boger fluids') made with polyisobutylene to develop an experimental methodology that produces a set of fluids with desired viscoelastic properties, specifically, $G_0$, $\tau$, and the first normal stress difference coefficient $\psi_1$. Through a simple linear algebraic manipulation between the rheological properties of interest ($G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$) and the fluid compositions in terms of polymer concentration $c$, molecular weight $M_w$, and solvent viscosity $\eta_s$, we developed a `design equation' that takes $G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$ as inputs and calculates values for $c$, $M_w$, $\eta_s$ as outputs. Using this method, fabrication of sample viscoelastic fluids whose rheological properties are \textit{a priori} known can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Cation accumulation drives the preferential partitioning of DNA in an aqueous two-phase system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixtures of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran (Dex) represent a widely used class of aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS), with applications ranging from the purification of various biomolecules such as nucleic acids to the synthesis of protocells. A key feature underlying these applications is the selective accumulation of biomolecules within Dex-rich droplets in an aqueous PEG phase, but the physical origin of this partitioning remains unclear. Depletion interactions were long assumed to be the primary driving force; however, our systematic experiments using DNA of different lengths indicate that depletion alone cannot fully explain the observed behavior. We identify an additional and previously underappreciated contribution from electrostatic interactions: Dex carries a slightly more negative charge than PEG, which drives preferential cation accumulation in the Dex-rich phase. These counterions facilitate the selective partitioning of DNA inside the Dex-rich droplets. This mechanism explains the dependency of DNA uptake in Dex-rich droplets on polymer length and salt concentration. Our findings establish Donnan-type ion partitioning as a central principle of nucleic acid localization in Dex-rich droplets, offering a unified explanation for this long-standing phenomenon. They lay the foundation for designing ATPS-based systems and help elucidate the physicochemical principles of biomolecular partition upon phase separation in cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the autonomous assembly of hard nanoparticles with different shapes has been studied extensively both in experiment and simulations, little is known about systems where particle shape can be dynamically altered. DNA origami nanostructures offer an alternative route to synthesize nanoparticles that can change their shape on demand. Motivated by recent experiments, here we study the structure and dynamics of suspensions of hard squares in response to an elongation into a rectangle. Performing extensive hard-particle Monte Carlo simulations at constant volume and employing two protocols, we numerically analyze the collective diffusion and ordering during quenching and the subsequent relaxation to the new equilibrium state. We find that the cascading protocol, which mimics experimentally realized DNA origami, can become dynamically arrested due to the increase in effective packing fraction.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation of Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Organic and Polymeric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have surged in popularity due to their promise of expanding the spatiotemporal scales possible for simulating molecules with high fidelity. The accuracy of any MLIP is dependent on the data used for its training; thus, for large molecules, like polymers, where accurate training data is prohibitively difficult to obtain, it becomes necessary to pursue non-traditional methods to construct MLIPs, many of which are based on constructing MLIPs using smaller, analogous chemical systems. However, we have yet to understand the limits to which smaller molecules can be used as a proxy for extrapolating macromolecular energetics. Here, we provide a ``control study'' for such experiments, exploring the ability of MLIP approaches to extrapolate between n=1-8 n-polyalkanes at identical conditions. Through Principal Covariates Classification, we quantitatively demonstrate how convergence in chemical environments between training and testing datasets coincides with an MLIP's transferability. Additionally, we show how careful attention to the construction of an MLIP's neighbor list can promote greater transferability when considering various levels of the energetic hierarchy. Our results establish a roadmap for how one can create transferable MLIPs for macromolecular systems without the prohibitive cost of constructing system-specific training data.</description>

      <title>Collective transport efficiency of microswimmer swarms optimized by tactic run-tumble dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective motion of microorganisms and microrobots can be used for particle delivery, especially when guided by external magnetic fields, phototaxis, or chemotaxis. This cargo transport is enhanced significantly by hydrodynamic entrainment, where the surrounding fluid and any dissolved molecules or suspended cargo particles are dragged along with a collectively moving swarm. However, it remains unclear how this directed entrainment is affected by stochastic run-tumble motion, and how such motility patterns couple to particle dispersion. Here, we combine theory and simulations to compute the entrainment velocity and diffusivity for different degrees of swimmer directedness. Surprisingly, we find that the transport efficiency P\'{e}clet number, the ratio of advective to diffusive transport, is optimal for intermediate directedness values, so perfectly guided active suspensions perform worse than those with stochastic reorientations. These results could have implications for microrobotic drug delivery and nutrient transport in microbial environments.</description>

Abstract: Glass materials, as quintessential non-equilibrium systems, exhibit properties such as energy dissipation that are highly sensitive to their preparation histories. A key challenge has been identifying a unified order parameter to rationalize these properties. Here, we demonstrate that a configurational distance metric can effectively collapse energy dissipation data across diverse preparation histories and testing protocols, including varying cooling rates, aging processes, probing times, and the amplitudes of mechanical excitation, as long as the temperature remains above the so-called ideal glass transition (where the extrapolated structural relaxation time diverges). Our results provide a unified description for the non-equilibrium dissipation and suggest that the putative concept of the ideal glass transition is imprinted in material characteristics</description>

      <title>Experimental study of diffusiophoresis in a cellular flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study experimentally the dispersion of colloids in a two-dimensional, time independent, Rayleigh-B\'enard flow in the presence of salt gradients. Due to the additional scalar, the colloids do not follow exactly the Eulerian flow-field, but have a (small) extra-velocity $\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{dp}} = D_{\mathrm{dp}} \nabla \log C_s$, where $D_\mathrm{dp}$ is the phoretic constant and $C_s$ the salt concentration. Such a configuration is motivated by the theoretical work by Volk \textit{et al.} (JFM, 2022), which predicted enhanced transport or blockage in a stationary cellular flow depending on the value of a blockage coefficient. By means of High Dynamical Range Light Induced Fluorescence, we study the evolution of the colloids concentration field at large P\'eclet number. We find a good agreement with the theoretical work although a number of hypotheses are not satisfied, as the experiment is non homogeneous in space and intrinsically transient. In particular we observe enhanced transport when salt and colloids are injected at both ends of the Rayleigh-B\'enard chamber, and blockage when colloids and salt are injected together and phoretic effects are strong enough.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Cost-Effective In situ Fabrication of Nanoporous Membranes in Microfluidic Devices for Biomedical and Environmental Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro/nanoporous membranes have been used extensively in biological and medical applications associated with filtration, particle sorting, cell separation, and real-time sensing. Expanding its applications to microfluidics offers several advantages, such as precise control over fluid flow rates, regulated reaction times, and efficient product extraction. This study demonstrates a simple, cost-effective, rapid, single-step method for the synthesis of nanoporous membranes within a microfluidic device. The membrane is prepared by filling up the microchamber with cellulose acetate dissolved in N, N-dimethylformamide, and 1-hexanol, followed by the continuous flow of water as an antisolvent. Mixing CA-DMF with antisolvent water leads to an in-situ synthesis of cellulose acetate nanoparticles (CANPs) at the Water-DMF interface. The continuous flow of water ensures the coagulation of CANPs, forming nanoporous membranes. The thickness, porosity, and wettability of the membrane are dependent on the flow rate of water and the concentration of CA dissolved in DMF. Apart from its wide application in cell and biomolecule separation, this membrane can be used to detect biomarkers or pathogens in clinical samples. Additionally, these nanoporous membranes can be used to detect and filter environmental contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and emulsified oil from water. In summary, the synthesis of CANP nanoporous membranes within microfluidic channels with adjustable porosity enhances the potential uses of micro/nanomembranes in both healthcare and environmental contexts.</description>

      <title>TopoSPAM: Topology grounded Simulation Platform for morphogenesis and biological Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a topology grounded, multiscale simulation platform for morphogenesis and biological active matter. Morphogenesis and biological active matter represent keystone problems in biology with additional, far-reaching implications across the biomedical sciences. Addressing these problems will require flexible, cross-scale models of tissue shape, development, and dysfunction that can be tuned to understand, model, and predict relevant individual cases. Current approaches to simulating anatomical or cellular subsystems tend to rely on static, assumed shapes. Meanwhile, the potential for topology to provide natural dimensionality reduction and organization of shape and dynamical outcomes is not fully exploited. TopoSPAM combines ease of use with powerful simulation algorithms and methodological advances, including active nematic gels, topological-defect-driven shape dynamics, and an active 3D vertex model of tissues. It is capable of determining emergent flows and shapes across scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center Recognition potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally study the heterogeneity of strain in a granular medium subjected to oscillatory shear in a rotating drum. Two complementary methods are used. The first method relies on optical imaging and grain tracking, allowing us to compute some components of the strain tensor and their variance. The second method, Diffusive Acoustic Wave Spectroscopy (DAWS), provides the quadratic strain within the bulk. Our results show that strain is spatially heterogeneous, with fluctuations about ten times larger than the mean, primarily dominated by variability at the grain scale. We then analyze in detail the strain fluctuations occurring during the forward and backward branches of the shear stress cycles, along with the intra-cycle plastic strain resulting from of each cycle. Both methods reveal that each shear cycle consists of two consecutive diffusive-like branches, and that the resulting plastic strain fluctuations scales with the mean plastic shear strain. We propose that plastic strain fluctuations result from irreversible strain heterogeneity that increases with applied shear -- reflected in forward--backward strain anticorrelations -- but is constrained by load-controlled induced memory.</description>

      <title>An adaptive, data-driven multiscale approach for dense granular flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accuracy of coarse-grained continuum models of dense granular flows is limited by the lack of high-fidelity closure models for granular rheology. One approach to addressing this issue, referred to as the hierarchical multiscale method, is to use a high-fidelity fine-grained model to compute the closure terms needed by the coarse-grained model. The difficulty with this approach is that the overall model can become computationally intractable due to the high computational cost of the high-fidelity model. In this work, we describe a multiscale modeling approach for dense granular flows that utilizes neural networks trained using high-fidelity discrete element method (DEM) simulations to approximate the constitutive granular rheology for a continuum incompressible flow model. Our approach leverages an ensemble of neural networks to estimate predictive uncertainty that allows us to determine whether the rheology at a given point is accurately represented by the neural network model. Additional DEM simulations are only performed when needed, minimizing the number of additional DEM simulations required when updating the rheology. This adaptive coupling significantly reduces the overall computational cost of the approach while controlling the error. In addition, the neural networks are customized to learn regularized rheological behavior to ensure well-posedness of the continuum solution. We first validate the approach using two-dimensional steady-state and decelerating inclined flows. We then demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by modeling three-dimensional sub-aerial granular column collapse for varying initial column aspect ratios, where our multiscale method compares well with the computationally expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-DEM simulation.</description>

      <title>Role of interaction anisotropy in polymer cononsolvency: insights from the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cononsolvency occurs when mixing two good solvents creates poor-solvent conditions for polymers over specific composition ranges, causing macroscopic phase separation or microscopic chain collapse. Despite its technological and biophysical relevance, the connection between macroscopic and microscopic manifestations of cononsolvency remains unclear. A key challenge is identifying which interactions govern cononsolvency: coarse-grained analyses like standard Flory--Huggins models assume purely isotropic interactions, while atomistic simulations contain complex anisotropic interactions that cannot be precisely controlled or isolated. Here, we address the role of interaction anisotropy using the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework, which yields $\chi$ as a thermodynamic average over both configurational and internal-state coarse-grained degrees of freedom. This enables controlled comparison between systems with isotropic versus orientation-dependent interactions that share identical effective $\chi$ parameters, either driving cononsolvency by strong solvent-cosolvent affinity or preferential polymer-cosolvent affinity. While pairs of systems exhibit equivalent macroscopic phase behavior, lattice Monte Carlo simulations reveal that those featuring orientation-dependent interactions generate distinct collapse signatures, particularly in reentrant coil-globule transitions or characteristics of the solvation structure. These results demonstrate how microscopic interactions influences cononsolvency behavior beyond what effective $\chi$ parameters alone predict.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part I: equilibrium multifarious self-assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.</description>

Abstract: In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies towards disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.</description>

Abstract: For equilibrium hard spheres the stochastic geometry of the insertion space, the room to accommodate another sphere, relates exactly to the equation of state. We begin to extend this idea to active matter, analyzing insertion space for repulsive active particles in one and two dimensions using both on- and off-lattice models. In 1D we derive closed-form expressions for the mean insertion cavity size, cavity number, and total insertion volume, all in excellent agreement with simulations. Strikingly, activity increases the total insertion volume and tends to keep the insertion space more connected. These results provide the first quantitative foundation for the stochastic geometry of active matter, and opens up a new route to building a thermodynamics of active systems.</description>

Abstract: Platinum-coated polystyrene Janus particles exhibit a combination of stochastic and deterministic motion in hydrogen peroxide solutions, making them promising candidates for applications in micro-scale cargo transport, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. The dynamics of Janus particles very near a boundary are dictated by conservative and non-conservative interactions that depend on particle, substrate, and solution properties. This study investigated the influence of orientational quenching by measuring the effect of changes in cap thickness and hydrogen peroxide concentration on particle velocity and maximum displacement. Janus particles with cap thicknesses of 3 nm, 7 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm, and 35 nm were analyzed in 1 wt./vol.% and 3 wt./vol.% hydrogen peroxide solutions near the bottom and top boundaries of the fluid cell. Results indicated that particles with lower cap thicknesses exhibit higher velocities, with faster particles in 3 wt./vol.% peroxide as compared to 1 wt./vol.% peroxide. Furthermore, results suggest a combined influence of activity and gravitational effects influenced whether particles moved along the top boundary i.e. ceiling or bottom boundary i.e. flooring. Heavier cap particles in lower peroxide concentration solution show less ceiling than lighter cap particles in higher peroxide concentration. We also find a global reduction in velocity for when a single surface of the two is plasma cleaned surface. These findings highlight the important interplay between cap weight, hydrodynamic interactions, and propulsion force in determining the dynamics of Janus particles.</description>

      <title>White-box machine learning for uncovering physically interpretable dimensionless governing equations for granular materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Granular material has significant implications for industrial and geophysical processes. A long-lasting challenge, however, is seeking a unified rheology for its solid- and liquid-like behaviors under quasi-static, inertial, and even unsteady shear conditions. Here, we present a data-driven framework to discover the hidden governing equation of sheared granular materials. The framework, PINNSR-DA, addresses noisy discrete particle data via physics-informed neural networks with sparse regression (PINNSR) and ensures dimensional consistency via machine learning-based dimensional analysis (DA). Applying PINNSR-DA to our discrete element method simulations of oscillatory shear flow, a general differential equation is found to govern the effective friction across steady and transient states. The equation consists of three interpretable terms, accounting respectively for linear response, nonlinear response and energy dissipation of the granular system, and the coefficients depends primarily on a dimensionless relaxation time, which is shorter for stiffer particles and thicker flow layers. This work pioneers a pathway for discovering physically interpretable governing laws in granular systems and can be readily extended to more complex scenarios involving jamming, segregation, and fluid-particle interactions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the shrinkage induced breakup of thin layers of heterogeneous materials attached to a substrate, a ubiquitous natural phenomenon with a wide range of potential applications. Focusing on the evolution of the fragment ensemble, we demonstrate that the system has two distinct phases: damage phase, where the layer is cracked, however, a dominant piece persists retaining the structural integrity of the layer, and a fragmentation phase, where the layer disintegrates into numerous small pieces. Based on finite size scaling we show that the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical damage analogous to continuous phase transitions. At the critical point a fully connected crack network emerges whose structure is controlled by the strength of adhesion to the substrate. In the strong adhesion limit, damage arises from random microcrack nucleation, resembling bond percolation, while weak adhesion facilitates stress concentration and the growth of cracks to large extensions. The critical exponents of the damage to fragmentation transition agree to a reasonable accuracy with those of two-dimensional bond percolation. Our findings provide a novel insight into the mechanism of shrinkage-induced cracking revealing generic scaling laws of the phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is known that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the vapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the cooling wall. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on an approximate quasi-continuum approach. This work examines this effect rigorously by studying evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates by coupling the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum treatments in both liquid films. Numerical results show that the vapor phase temperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall temperature at the condensing surface, reaffirming the evaporative refrigeration effect. The present work further reveals that this effect is caused by two mechanisms. While the dominant mechanism is the asymmetry in the molecular distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules at the interface, additional cooling occurs within the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion, similar to the Joule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial expansion is not an isenthalpic process. The impacts of key parameters, including liquid thickness, Knudsen number, and accommodation coefficient, are investigated. The numerical simulation shows that with a thicker vapor, a thinner liquid film, and a larger accommodation coefficient, leads to stronger evaporative refrigeration effect. This work will motivate future experiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential applications in air-conditioning, refrigeration, and membrane distillation.</description>
