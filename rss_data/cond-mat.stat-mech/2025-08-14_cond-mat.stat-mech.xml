      <title>A microscopically reversible kinetic theory of flocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a kinetic theory of two species of hard spheres which can undergo collisions converting chemical energy into kinetic energy. As the two species represent birds and air, this reactive collision mimics birds flapping their wings, allowing for their propulsion. We demand microscopic reversibility of the reactive collisions. We then introduce a chemostat to drive the system out of equilibrium. When the chemostat is sufficiently turned on and one restricts to grazing interspecies collisions, the momentum damping term can turn into a momentum growth term, hinting at a flocking transition.</description>

      <title>Ratchet effect and jamming in dense mixtures of active and passive colloids in narrow pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the framework of generalized exclusion processes we study mixtures of passive and active particles interacting by steric repulsion. The particles move in a pore with periodically modulated aperture, which is modeled by a quasi-one-dimensional channel with periodic tooth-shaped profile. Internal driving of the active particles induces a ratchet current of these particles. In the current-density diagram, we observe three main regimes: of free flow; of thermally activated processes; of spinodal decomposition. When the density of particles is increased, we observe a transition to jammed state, where the ratchet current is substantially reduced. In time evolution, the transition to jammed state is seen as sudden drop of current at certain time. The probability distribution of these jamming times follows an exponential law. The average jamming time depends itself exponentially on the density of active particles. The coefficient in this exponential is nearly independent of the switching rate of the active particles as well as on the presence or absence of passive particles. Due to the interaction, the current of active particles imposes a drag on the passive particles. In the limit of both large systems and long times, the current of passive particles has always the same direction as the ratchet current of active particles. However, during the evolution of the system we observe very slow (logarithmic in time) approach to the asymptotic value, sometimes accompanied by current reversal, i.e. current of active and passive particles may go in opposite direction.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic approximations for driven dense colloidal mixtures in narrow pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The system of driven dense colloid mixtures is studied in one-, two- and three-dimensional geometries. We calculate the diffusion coefficients and mobilities for each particle type, including cross-terms, in a hydrodynamic limit, using a mean-field-type approximation. The set of non-linear diffusion equations are then solved. In one dimension, analytical results are possible. We show that in mixtures, the ``Brazil nut'' phenomenon, or depletion of larger particles by force of smaller ones, appears quite generically. We calculate the ratchet current and quantify the capability of sorting particles according to their size. We also indicate that the ``Brazil nut'' effect lies behind the possibility of perfect separation, where large and big particles travel in strictly opposite direction.</description>

      <title>Short-range and long-range correlations in driven dense colloidal mixtures in narrow pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The system of driven dense colloid mixture in a tube with diameter comparable with particle size is modeled by a generalization of asymmetric simple exclusion (ASEP) model. The generalization goes in two directions: relaxing the exclusion constraint by allowing several (but few) particles on a site, and by considering two species of particles, which differ by size and transport coefficients. We calculate the nearest-neighbor correlations using a variant of Kirkwood approximation and show by comparison with numerical simulations that the approximation provides quite accurate results. However, for long-range correlations, we show that the Kirkwood approximation is useless, as it predicts exponential decay of the density-density correlation function with distance, while simulation data indicate that the decay is algebraic. For one-component system, we show that the decay is governed by a power law with universal exponent close to 2. In two-component system, the correlation function behaves in more complicated manner; its sign oscillates but the envelope decays again very slowly and the decay is compatible with power-law with exponent somewhat lower than 2. Therefore, our generalization of ASEP belongs to different universality class than the ensemble of generalized ASEP models which are mappable to zero-range processes.</description>

      <title>Efficient predecision scheme for Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation of long-range interacting lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fast and general predecision scheme for Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation of $d$-dimensional long-range interacting lattice models. For potentials of the form $V(r)=r^{-d-\sigma}$, this reduces the computational complexity from $O\left(N^2\right)$ to $O\left(N^{2-\sigma/d}\right)$ for $\sigma &lt; d$ and to $O\left(N \right)$ for $\sigma &gt; d$, respectively. The algorithm is implemented and tested for several $\mathrm{O}(n)$ spin models ranging from the Ising over the XY to the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model. With the same random number sequence it produces exactly the same Markov chain as a simulation with explicit summation of all terms in the Hamiltonian. Due to its generality, its simplicity, and its reduced computational complexity it has the potential to find broad application and thus lead to a deeper understanding of the role of long-range interactions in the physics of lattice models, especially in nonequilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>Directed Cycles as Higher-Order Units of Information Processing in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed cycles form the fundamental motifs in natural, social and artificial networks, yet their distinct computational roles remain under-explored, particularly in the context of higher-order structure and function. In this work, we investigate how two types of directed cycles - feedforward and feedback - can act as higher-order structures to facilitate the flow and integration of information in sparse random networks, and how these roles depend on the environment of the cycles. Using information-theoretic measures, we show that network size, sparsity and relative directionality critically impact the information-processing capacities of directed cycles. In a network with no-preferred global direction, a feedforward cycle enables greater information flow and a feedback cycle allows for increased information integration. The relative direction of a feedforward cycle as well as the structural incoherence it induces, determines its capacity to generate higher-order behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate that introducing feedback loops into otherwise feedforward architectures increases the diversity of network activity patterns. These findings suggest that directed cycles serve as computational motifs with local information processing capabilities that depend on the structure they are embedded. Using directed cycles, we highlight the interdependence between higher-order structures and the higher-order order behaviour they can induce in the network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hydrodynamics in an Exclusion Process with Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the symmetric Dyson exclusion process (SDEP) - a lattice gas with exclusion and long-range, Coulomb-type interactions that emerge both as the maximal-activity limit of the symmetric exclusion process and as a discrete version of Dyson's Brownian motion on the unitary group. Exploiting an exact ground-state (Doob) transform, we map the stochastic generator of the SDEP onto the spin-$1/2$ XX quantum chain, which in turn admits a free-fermion representation. At macroscopic scales we conjecture that the SDEP displays ballistic (Eulerian) scaling and non-local hydrodynamics governed by the equation $\partial_t \rho+\partial_x j[\rho]=0$ with $j[\rho]=(1/\pi)\sin(\pi\rho(x,t))\sinh(\pi\mathcal{H}\rho(x,t))$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is the Hilbert transform, making the current a genuinely non-local functional of the density. This non-local one-field description is equivalent to a local two-field "complex Hopf" system for finite particle density. Closed evolution formulas allow us to solve the melting of single and double block initial states, producing limit shapes and arctic curves that agree with large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The model thus offers a tractable example of emergent non-local hydrodynamics driven by long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Active Particle Diffusion in Convection Roll Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigated the Brownian motion of active Janus particles in a linear array of planar counter-rotating convection rolls at high P\'eclet numbers. Similarly to passive particles, active microswimmers exhibit advection enhanced diffusion, but only for self-propulsion speeds up to a critical value. The diffusion of faster Janus particles is governed by advection along the array's edges, whereby distinct diffusion regimes are observed and characterized. Contrary to passive particles, the relevant spatial distributions of active Janus particles are inhomogeneous. These peculiar properties of active matter are related to the combined action of noise and self-propulsion in a confined geometry and hold regardless of the actual flow boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Solvable Models of Heat Transport in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate solvable models of heat transport between a pair of quantum mechanical systems initialized at two different temperatures. At time $t=0$, a weak interaction is switched on between the systems, and we study the resulting energy transport. Focusing on the heat current as the primary observable, we analyze both the transient dynamics and the long-time behavior of the system. We demonstrate that simple toy models - including Random Matrix Theory like models ({\it RMT models}) and Schwarzian like models ({\it conformal models}) - can capture many generic features of heat transport, such as transient current peaks and the emergence of non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). For these models, we derive a variety of exact results characterizing the short time transients, long time approach to NESS and thermal conductivity. Finally, we show how these features appear in a more realistic solvable model, the Double-Scaled SYK (DSSYK) model. We demonstrate that the DSSYK model interpolates between the seemingly distinct toy models discussed earlier, with the toy models in turn providing a useful lens through which to understand the rich features of DSSYK.</description>

      <title>Entropy Measures for Transition Matrices in Random Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A transition matrix can be constructed through the partial contraction of two given quantum states. We analyze and compare four different definitions of entropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD entropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each entropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB entropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement between the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix. Combining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent non-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged, whereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further apply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several ensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in $PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases considered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror the behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in contrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can be unbounded or fails to scale with system size.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of average subsystem Bures distance in transverse field Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The average subsystem trace distance has been proposed as an indicator of quantum many-body chaos and integrability. In integrable systems, evaluating the trace distance faces two challenges: the computational cost for large systems and ambiguities in defining and ordering eigenstates. In this paper, we calculate the average subsystem Bures distance in the spin-1/2 transverse-field Ising chain. We develop an efficient algorithm to evaluate the Bures distance between two Gaussian states, which allows us to access larger system sizes. To address the degeneracy issue, we consider simultaneous eigenstates of all local conserved charges and use these charges to systematically order degenerate states. The results align with the conjectured linear increase with subsystem size. We demonstrate that the distinct scaling behaviors of the average subsystem trace and Bures distances in chaotic versus integrable systems stem from discontinuities of local conserved charges across the spectrum in integrable systems. Additionally, we investigate the average subsystem distances between random pure Gaussian states but do not observe a linear increase.</description>

      <title>Pressure in active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, the study of pressure in active matter has attracted growing attention due to its fundamental relevance to nonequilibrium statistical physics. Active matter systems are composed of particles that consume energy to sustain persistent motion, which are inherently far from equilibrium. These particles can exhibit complex behaviors, including motility-induced phase separation, density-dependent clustering, and anomalous stress distributions, motivating the introduction of active swim stress and swim pressure. Unlike in passive fluids, pressure in active systems emerges from momentum flux originated from swim force rather than equilibrium conservative interactions, offering a distinct perspective for understanding their mechanical response. Simple models of active Brownian particles (ABPs) have been employed in theoretical and simulation studies across both dilute and dense regimes, revealing that pressure is a state function and exhibits a nontrivial dependence on density. Together with nonequilibrium statistical concepts such as effective temperature and effective adhesion, pressure offers important insight for understanding behaviors in active matter such as sedimentation equilibrium and motility induced phase separation. Extensions of ABPs models beyond their simplest form have underscored the fragility of pressure-based equation of state, which can break down under factors such as density-dependent velocity, torque, complex boundary geometries and interactions. Building on these developments, this review provides a comprehensive survey of theoretical and experimental advances, with particular emphasis on the microscopic origins of active pressure and the mechanisms underlying the breakdown of the equation of state.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Critical Behavior of Driven Disordered Systems Beyond the Overdamped Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of relaxation mechanisms in the driven response of elastic disordered interfaces in finite dimensions, focusing on the interplay between dimensionality and interaction range. Through extensive numerical simulations, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes. In two-dimensional systems with long-range interactions, we observe a regime of coexistence between pinned and flowing states. In contrast, for one-dimensional interfaces with long-range elasticity, as well as for short-range interactions in both 1D and 2D, the coexistence regime is absent. Nevertheless, the avalanche statistics differ significantly from those of overdamped systems: the usual power-law distribution is replaced by a pronounced bump, associated with large, anomalous avalanches that expand ballistically. We interpret these events as failed synchronization attempts and suggest they could be detected in experimental systems.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing boundary time crystals through Non-markovian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Boundary time crystals (BTCs) in the presence of non-Markovian dynamics. In contrast to BTCs observed in earlier works in the Markovian regime, we show that non-Markovian dynamics can be highly beneficial for stabilizing BTCs over a wide range of parameter values, even in the presence of intermediate rates of dissipation. We analyze the effect of non-Markovian dynamics on BTCs using quantum Fisher information, order parameter, a measure of non-Markovianity, and a dynamical phase diagram, all of which show complex behaviours with changing non-Markovianity parameters. Our studies can pave the way for stabilizing time crystals in dissipative systems, as well as lead to studies on varied dissipative dynamics on time translational symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network formulation of QCD in the strong-coupling expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a tensor-network formulation for the strong-coupling expansion of QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential, for arbitrary number of dimensions, colors, and flavors. We integrate out the gauge and quark degrees of freedom and rewrite the partition function as the complete trace of a tensor network. This network consists of local tensors that contain a numerical and a Grassmann part. We truncate the initial tensor at a fixed order in the inverse coupling $\beta$ and compute analytical results for the partition function, the free energy, and the chiral condensate on a $2\times2$ lattice up to order $\beta^4$. In a follow-up paper we will introduce an enhanced tensor-network method, order-separated GHOTRG, to explicitly compute the expansion coefficients of the partition function for larger lattices.</description>

      <title>The quantum Newman-Moore model in a longitudinal field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09235v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.</description>

      <title>Improving noisy free-energy measurements by adding more noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating free-energy differences using nonequilibrium work relations, such as the Jarzynski equality, is hindered by poor convergence when work fluctuations are large. For systems governed by overdamped Langevin dynamics, we propose the counterintuitive approach of adding noise in order to increase the precision of such calculations. By introducing additional stochastic fluctuations to the system and rescaling its potential energy, we leave the thermodynamics of the system unchanged while increasing its relaxation rate. For a given time-dependent protocol this modification reduces dissipated work, leading to more accurate free-energy estimates. We demonstrate this principle using computer simulations applied to two model systems. However, the regime of applicability of this strategy is likely limited, because it requires control of the system's potential energy in a way that is feasible in only a few experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Spin models from nonlinear cellular automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study classical and quantum spin models derived from one-dimensional cellular automata (CA) with nonlinear update rules, focusing on rules 30, 54 and 201. We argue that the classical models, defined such that their ground states correspond to allowed trajectories of the CA, are frustrated and can be described in terms of local defect variables. Including quantum fluctuations through the addition of a transverse field, we study their ground state phase diagram and quantum phase transitions. We show that the nonlinearity of the CA rule leads to a quantum order-by-disorder mechanism, which selects a particular (rule-dependent) spatial structure for small transverse fields, with spontaneous breaking of the translation symmetry in some cases. Using numerical results for larger fields, we also observe a first-order quantum phase transition into a quantum paramagnet, as in previous studies of spin models based on linear CA rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important open problem in nonequilibrium thermodynamics is the quantification and spatiotemporal localization of entropy production in complex nanoscale processes from experimental data. Here we address this issue through a data-driven approach that combines the recently developed short-time thermodynamic uncertainty relation based inference scheme with machine learning techniques. Our approach leverages the flexible function representation provided by deep neural networks to achieve accurate reconstruction of high-dimensional, potentially time-dependent dissipative force fields as well as the localization of entropy production in both space and time along nonequilibrium trajectories. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework through applications to diverse systems of fundamental interest and experimental significance, where it successfully addresses distinct challenges in localizing entropy production.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology-Based Indicator of Orientational Ordering in Two-Dimensional Quasi-Particle Systems Applied to Skyrmion Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) quasi-particle systems, such as magnetic skyrmions, exhibit topological phase transitions between unique 2D phases. However, to identify the phases, an easy and computationally low-cost methodology for capturing the configurational properties of lattice ordering and constructing such an appropriate descriptor that can be easily calculated is, though, not obvious. Here, we propose an indicator for topological phase transitions using persistent homology (PH). PH offers novel insights beyond conventional indicators by capturing topological features derived from the configurational properties of the lattice. The proposed persistent-homology-based topological indicator, which selectively counts stable features in a persistence diagram, effectively traces the lattice's topological changes, as confirmed by comparisons with the conventionally used measure of the ordering (the magnitude of the orientational order parameter $\langle|\Psi_6|\rangle$), typically used to identify lattice phases. We demonstrate the applicability of our indicator to experimental data, showing that it yields results consistent with those of simulations. This experimental validation highlights the robustness of the proposed method for real physical systems beyond idealized simulated systems. While our method is demonstrated in the context of skyrmion lattice systems, the approach is general and can be extended to other two-dimensional systems composed of interacting quasi-particles. As a key advantage, our indicator offers lower computational complexity than the conventionally used measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a set of computer codes designed to test methods for optimizing time-dependent control protocols in fluctuating nonequilibrium systems. Each problem consists of a stochastic model, an optimization objective, and C++ and Python implementations that can be run on Unix-like systems. These benchmark systems are simple enough to run on a laptop, but challenging enough to test the capabilities of modern optimization methods. This release includes five problems and a worked example. The problem set is called NESTbench25, for NonEquilibrium STatistical mechanics benchmarks (2025).</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Boundary-Sensitive Phase in Hyperbolic Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical systems defined on hyperbolic lattices may exhibit phases of matter that only emerge due to negative curvature. We focus on the case of the Ising model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and (low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation. We discuss a holographic correspondence between boundary and bulk behaviors and derive exact expressions for boundary correlation functions on Cayley trees.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of determinants through the expansion of the Moyal star product</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We work out a generalization of the Szeg\"o limit theorems on the determinant of large matrices. We focus on matrices with nonzero leading principal minors and elements that decay to zero exponentially fast with the distance from the main diagonal, but we relax the constraint of the Toeplitz structure. We obtain an expression for the asymptotic behaviour of the determinant written in terms of the factors of a left and right Wiener-Hopf type factorization of an appropriately defined symbol. For matrices with elements varying slowly along the diagonals (e.g., in locally Toeplitz sequences), we propose to apply the analogue of the semiclassical expansion of the Moyal star product in phase-space quantum mechanics. This is a systematic method that provides approximations up to any order in the typical scale of the inhomogeneity and allows us to obtain explicit asymptotic formulas.</description>

      <title>Strong anomalous diffusion for free-ranging birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion and anomalous diffusion are widely observed and used to study movement across organisms, resulting in extensive use of the mean and mean-squared displacement (MSD). However, these measures - corresponding to specific displacement moments - do not capture the full complexity of movement behavior. Using high-resolution data from over 70 million localizations of young and adult free-ranging Barn Owls (\textit{Tyto alba}), we reveal strong anomalous diffusion as nonlinear growth of displacement moments. The moment spectrum function $\lambda_t(q)$ -- defined by $\left&lt;|\bm{x}(t)|^q\right&gt; \sim t^{\lambda_t(q)}$ -- displays piecewise linearity in $q$, with a critical moment marking the crossover between scaling regimes. This highlights the need of a broad spectrum of displacement moments to characterize movement, which we link to age-specific ecological drivers. Furthermore, a characteristic timescale of five minutes marks an unexpected transition from a convex to a concave $\lambda_t(q)$. Using two stochastic models - a bounded L\'evy walk and a multi-mode behavioral model - we account for the observed phenomena, showing good agreement with data, relating age-specific behavioral states to environmentally confined movement, and demonstrating how L\'evy walk-like patterns can arise from underlying behavioral structure. Finally, we discuss the ecological significance of our results, arguing that strong anomalous diffusion may be widespread in animal movement.</description>

      <title>Free-Fermion Dynamics with Measurements: Topological Classification and Adaptive Preparation of Topological States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for classifying fermionic dynamical systems with measurements using symmetry and topology. We discuss two complementary classification schemes based on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way: (1) the many-body evolution operator (mEO) symmetry class, which classifies fermionic dynamics at the many-body level and generalizes to interacting dynamics, and (2) the single-particle transfer matrix (sTM) symmetry class, which classifies free-fermion dynamics at the single-particle level and connects to Anderson localization physics. In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in one-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of area-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical bulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime \textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state ensemble living on its temporal \textit{boundary}. Building on this correspondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical phases using Gaussian adaptive circuits. They are designed to prepare and stabilize free-fermion topological states as their steady states in \textit{any} spatial dimension. While circuits with exponentially local operations can stabilize a single topological steady state, those with finite-range operations can reach a topological steady-state ensemble. As a demonstration, we explicitly construct and simulate 2+1d adaptive circuits that realize mEO-class-A topological dynamics. We show that the finite-range versions converge to an ensemble of Chern insulators in ${\cal O}(1)$ circuit depth. We numerically study the topological phase transitions and dynamical domain-wall modes between different topological dynamical phases in this symmetry class. We also analyze the robustness of our adaptive circuit protocol to coherent noise.</description>
