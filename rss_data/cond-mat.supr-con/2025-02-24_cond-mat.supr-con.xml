      <title>Vertex correction for the linear and nonlinear optical responses in superconductors: multiband effect and topological superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensive research has revealed intriguing optical responses in topological materials. This paper focuses on the optical responses in $s$-wave superconductors with a Rashba spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic field, one of the platforms of topological superconductivity. On the one hand, to satisfy some conservation laws in superconducting responses, it is essential to take into account collective excitation modes. On the other hand, the optical response is a promising phenomenon for detecting hidden collective modes in superconductors. In this paper, we investigate the effect of collective excitation modes on the linear and second-order optical responses based on the self-consistent response approximation, which is formulated using the Kadanoff-Baym method. Our main results reveal that the Higgs mode enhances the optical responses when the Fermi level is close to the Dirac point. The enhancement is due to the multiband effects characterized by interband pairing. We also demonstrate the sign reversal of the photocurrent conductivity around the topological transition with increasing the Zeeman field. This finding supports the prediction in our previous work without considering collective excitation modes [H. Tanaka, et al., Phys. Rev. B 110, 014520 (2024)]. The sign reversal phenomenon is attributed to the magnetic injection current modified by the Higgs mode, and is proposed for a bulk probe of topological superconductors. We also discuss the interplay of quantum geometry and collective modes.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phenomena in systems with unconventional magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets have been reported and here we refer to them as \emph{unconventional magnets} because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where \emph{$d$-wave altermagnets} and \emph{$p$-wave magnets} are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnetism and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$-wave and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.</description>

      <title>A New Type of MPd5 Kagome Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials, which are composed of hexagons tiled with a shared triangle, have inspired enormous interest due to their unique structures and rich physical properties, but exploring superconducting material systems with new kagome structures is still an important research direction. Here, we predict a new type of kagome superconductors, MPd5 (M is a group IIA metal element), and identify that they exhibit coexistence of superconductivity and non-trivial topological properties. We uncover their phonon-mediated superconductivity by the density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT), predicting the superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) of 2.64, 2.03, and 1.50 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively, which can be effectively tuned by external pressure and electron doping. The present results also demonstrate that MPd5 have various topological properties such as, CaPd5 shows topological non-trivial intersection near the Fermi level (EF). Our results indicate that the MPd5 materials can be an emerging material platform with rich exotic physics in their kagome structures, and render themselves excellent candidates for superconducting and advanced functional materials that could be utilized in topological quantum computing and information technology.</description>

      <title>Structural and superconducting parameters of highly compressed sulfur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfur was the first nonmetal element which was transformed to a superconductor by applying megabar pressure. Recent pioneering experimental developments in measuring the superconducting energy gap $\Delta(T)$ in compressed sulfur using tunneling spectroscopy (Du $\textit{et al}$., $\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.}$ $\textbf{133}$, 036002 (2024)) initiated an interest in better understanding real atomic structure and superconducting properties of this element at high pressure. Here, we analyzed available experimental data on highly compressed sulfur, and, from the $\Delta(T)$ data reported by Du $\textit{et al}$. (2024), we extracted the specific heat jump at the transition temperature of ${\Delta}C_{el}/{\gamma}T_{c} = 1.8$. We also developed a model to extract the Debye temperatures ${\Theta}_D$ for sulfur and $H_{3}S$ in two-phases sample from the temperature-dependent resistance $R(T)$. for better understanding of material structure, here we proposed to use a size-strain map for highly compressed samples, and we revealed this size-strain map for laser-heated sulfur in a diamond anvil cell with a mixture of sulfur and $H{_3}S$. Finally, we found that superconducting sulfur exhibits a moderate level of nonadiabaticity $0.04 \leq {\Theta}_{D}/T_{F} \leq 0.15$ (where $T_{F}$ is the Fermi temperature), which is similar to $MgB_2$, pnictides, cuprates, $La_{4}H_{23}$, $ThH_{9}$, $H_{3}S$, $LaBeH_{8}$, and $LaH_{10}$.</description>

      <title>Critical Behavior and Duality in Dimensionally Reduced Planar Chern-Simons Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tha quantum electrodynamics of particles constrained to move on a plane is not a fully dimensionally reduced theory because the gauge fields through which they interact live in higher dimensions. By constraining the gauge field to the surface of the bulk, we obtain a fully reduced planar Abelian Chern-Simons Higgs model that can describe the vortex dynamics and second-order superconducting-normal phase transitions in planar Chern-Simons superconductors. Dual analyses performed before and after dimensional reduction yield the same Lagrangian for describing the vortex dynamics, indicating the self-consistency of our reduced theory. Compared to ordinary (2+1)-dimensional electrodynamics, we obtain anomalous fermion statistical vortices, consistent with results considering boundary effects. An additional electric charge constraint and different Chern-Simons parameter constraints are also found, which may help define a self-dual conformal field theory. Our renormalization group analysis shows that the quantized critical exponent depends on the Chern-Simons parameter. Quench disorder can bring more stable fixed points with different dynamical critical exponents. If we dimensionally reduce to a curved surface, our theory can also be extended to curved spacetimes, where geometric flow will be introduced and compete with vortex flow.</description>

      <title>Revealing Symmetry-Broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00719v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coherent theory for the superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for charge density of electrons and/or holes as revealed by the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The SODTs act as resistance-free superhighways and are correlated to the Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be represented by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC predicted by DFT. The present work highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are embedded within the bulk materials and are easily destroyed by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (T_C). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk materials, maintaining SODTs' stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher T_C. The present approach is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the presently predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor of YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential for spin-triplet superconductivity in molecular beam epitaxy grown PbTe/SnTe semiconductor heterostructures. We present convincing evidence for spin-triplet pairing by soft point-contact spectroscopy, using both spin-polarized and unpolarized electrons and additionally, by detailed analysis of the upper critical field, as inferred from the four probe resistance measurements. The experimental data are described in terms of the Anderson-Brinkman-Morel model of p-wave electron pairing. Our results confirm the predictions on strain-induced topological superconductivity by E.Tang and L. Fu.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Impurity Induced In-gap Bound States In Unconventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study revisits the effects of single impurity scattering in unconventional superconductors, with a specific emphasis on intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. We reveal that in the context of a square lattice near half-filling doping, there exists an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the appearance of mid-gap states. This relationship is determined by the $C_4$ rotational symmetry of both the $d$-wave gap amplitude and the square lattice itself. Furthermore, we identify an intrinsic link between the in-gap states and the sign change of the order parameter. In systems with interlayer pairing, strong resonant peaks are observed, despite the absence of sign-reversal characteristics in the pairing order parameter. By utilizing the $T$-matrix approach, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying these impurity-induced states. Our theoretical framework is pertinent to the analysis of newly discovered nickel-based high-temperature superconductors, providing a powerful tool for distinguishing their pairing properties. The results of this study shed light on the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity effects in unconventional superconductors, paving the way for future investigations into the unique properties of these emerging materials.</description>

      <title>Dual view of the Z$_2$-Gauged XY Model in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $Z_2$ gauged neutral XY model is of long-standing interest both in the context of nematic order, and the study of fractionalization and superconductivity. This paper presents heuristic arguments that no deconfinement of the XY field occurs in this model and presents results of a large-scale Monte Carlo simulations on a cubic lattice which are consistent with this conclusion. The correlation radius determining the confinement is found to be growing rapidly as a function of the parameters in the phase featuring the nematic order. Thus, mesoscopic properties of the system can mimic deconfinement with high accuracy in some part of the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Low temperature phase of AuSn$_{4}$ induced by the van der Waals interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AuSn$_{4}$ is the example of an compound that exhibits topological properties. Recent XRD measurements reveal an ambiguous nature of the crystal structure, as it can be realized with either Aea2 or Ccca symmetry. Motivated by this, we analyze the dynamical stability of the compound. We discuss the role of van der Waals (vdW) corrections within the ab initio calculation. Interestingly, our main result indicates that AuSn$_{4}$ can be unstable with both Aea2 and Ccca symmetries, due to the soft modes in the phonon spectra. From the soft mode analyses we find dynamically stable Pc structure. This structure has always smaller energy than Aea2 or Ccca crystal and it stays independent of the vdW correction. We also show that the comparison of theoretical electronic properties with the experimental ARPES measurements. Our findings may be valuable in the future investigations of AuSn$_{4}$-like compounds.</description>

      <title>Majorana-metal transition in a disordered superconductor: percolation in a landscape of topological domain walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most superconductors are thermal insulators. A disordered chiral $\textit{p}$-wave superconductor, however, can make a transition to a thermal metal phase. Because heat is then transported by Majorana fermions, this phase is referred to as a Majorana metal. Here we present numerical evidence that the mechanism for the phase transition with increasing electrostatic disorder is the percolation of boundaries separating domains of different Chern number. We construct the network of domain walls using the spectral localizer as a ``topological landscape function'', and obtain the thermal metal--insulator phase diagram from the percolation transition.</description>
