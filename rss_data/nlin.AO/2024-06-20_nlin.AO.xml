      <title>Temporal Complexity of a Hopfield-Type Neural Model in Random and Scale-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield network model and its generalizations were introduced as a model of associative, or content-addressable, memory. They were widely investigated both as a unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks are attracting the interest of scientific community since the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behavior in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work we present the preliminary results of a IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels.</description>

      <title>Entropy-statistical approach to phase-locking detection of pulse oscillations: application for the analysis of biosignal synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study a new method for analyzing synchronization in oscillator systems is proposed using the example of modeling the dynamics of a circuit of two resistively coupled pulse oscillators. The dynamic characteristic of synchronization is fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) calculated a time series composed of the ratios of the number of pulse periods (subharmonic ratio, SHR) during phase-locking intervals. Low entropy values indicate strong synchronization, whereas high entropy values suggest weak synchronization between the two oscillators. This method effectively visualizes synchronized modes of the circuit using entropy maps of synchronization states. Additionally, a classification of synchronization states is proposed based on the dependencies of FuzzyEn on the length of embedding vectors of SHR time series. An extension of this method for analyzing non-relaxation (non-spike) type signals is illustrated using the example of phase-phase coupling rhythms of local field potential of rat hippocampus. The entropy-statistical approach using rational fractions and pulse signal forms makes this method promising for analyzing biosignal synchronization and implementing the algorithm in mobile digital platforms.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Environment for the Neuroevolution of Ant Colony Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simulation environment to facilitate research into emergent collective behaviour, with a focus on replicating the dynamics of ant colonies. By leveraging real-world data, the environment simulates a target ant trail that a controllable agent must learn to replicate, using sensory data observed by the target ant. This work aims to contribute to the neuroevolution of models for collective behaviour, focusing on evolving neural architectures that encode domain-specific behaviours in the network topology. By evolving models that can be modified and studied in a controlled environment, we can uncover the necessary conditions required for collective behaviours to emerge. We hope this environment will be useful to those studying the role of interactions in emergent behaviour within collective systems.</description>

      <title>Self-organized transport in noisy dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of multi-commodity transport in a noisy, nonlinear network. The nonlinearity determines the dynamics of the edge capacities, which can be amplified or suppressed depending on the local current flowing across an edge. We consider network self-organization for three different nonlinear functions: For all three we identify parameter regimes where noise leads to self-organization into more robust topologies, that are not found by the sole noiseless dynamics. Moreover, the interplay between noise and specific functional behavior of the nonlinearity gives rise to different features, such as (i) continuous or discontinuous responses to the demand strength and (ii) either single or multi-stable solutions. Our study shows the crucial role of the activation function on noise-assisted phenomena.</description>

      <title>A first-principles geometric model for dynamics of motor-driven centrosomal asters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The centrosomal aster is a mobile cellular organelle that exerts and transmits forces necessary for nuclear migration and spindle positioning. Recent experimental and theoretical studies of nematode and human cells demonstrate that pulling forces on asters by cortical force generators are dominant during such processes. We present a comprehensive investigation of a first-principles model of aster dynamics, the S-model (S for stoichiometry), based solely on such forces. The model evolves the astral centrosome position, a probability field of cell-surface motor occupancy by centrosomal microtubules (under an assumption of stoichiometric binding), and free boundaries of unattached, growing microtubules. We show how cell shape affects the centering stability of the aster, and its transition to oscillations with increasing motor number. Seeking to understand observations in single-cell nematode embryos, we use accurate simulations to examine the nonlinear structures of the bifurcations, and demonstrate the importance of binding domain overlap to interpreting genetic perturbation experiments. We find a rich dynamical landscape, dependent upon cell shape, such as internal equatorial orbits of asters that can be seen as traveling wave solutions. Finally, we study the interactions of multiple asters and demonstrate an effective mutual repulsion due to their competition for cortical force generators. We find, amazingly, that asters can relax onto the vertices of platonic and non-platonic solids, closely mirroring the results of the classical Thomson problem for energy-minimizing configurations of electrons constrained to a sphere and interacting via repulsive Coulomb potentials. Our findings both explain experimental observations, providing insights into the mechanisms governing spindle positioning and cell division dynamics, and show the possibility of new nonlinear phenomena in cell biology.</description>

      <title>ICO learning as a measure of transient chaos in PT-symmetric Li\'enard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the implications of the unsupervised learning rule known as Input-Correlations (ICO) learning in the nonlinear dynamics of two linearly coupled PT-symmetric Li\'enard oscillators. The fixed points of the oscillator have been evaluated analytically and the Jacobian linearization is employed to study their stability. We find that on increasing the amplitude of the external periodic drive, the system exhibits period-doubling cascade to chaos within a specific parametric regime wherein we observe emergent chaotic dynamics. We further notice that the system indicates an intermittency route to chaos in the chaotic regime. Finally, in the period-4 regime of our bifurcation analysis, we predict the emergence of transient chaos which eventually settles down to a period-2 oscillator response which has been further validated by both the maximal Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) using the well-known Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization technique and the Hilbert Transform of the time-series. In the transiently chaotic regime, we deploy the ICO learning to analyze the time-series from which we identify that when the chaotic evolution transforms into periodic dynamics, the synaptic weight associated with the time-series of the loss oscillator exhibits stationary temporal evolution. This signifies that in the periodic regime, there is no overlap between the filtered signals obtained from the time-series of the coupled PT-symmetric oscillators. In addition, the temporal evolution of the weight associated with the stimulus mimics the behaviour of the Hilbert transform of the time-series.</description>

      <title>A nonparametric learning framework for nonlinear robust output regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nonparametric learning solution framework is proposed for the global nonlinear robust output regulation problem. We first extend the assumption that the steady-state generator is linear in the exogenous signal to the more relaxed assumption that it is polynomial in the exogenous signal. Additionally, a nonparametric learning framework is proposed to eliminate the construction of an explicit regressor, as required in the adaptive method, which can potentially simplify the implementation and reduce the computational complexity of existing methods. With the help of the proposed framework, the robust nonlinear output regulation problem can be converted into a robust non-adaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral input-to-state stable (iISS) inverse dynamics. Moreover, a dynamic gain approach can adaptively raise the gain to a sufficiently large constant to achieve stabilization without requiring any a priori knowledge of the uncertainties appearing in the dynamics of the exosystem and the system. Furthermore, we apply the nonparametric learning framework to globally reconstruct and estimate multiple sinusoidal signals with unknown frequencies without the need for adaptive parametric techniques. An explicit nonlinear mapping can directly provide the estimated parameters, which will exponentially converge to the unknown frequencies. Finally, a feedforward control design is proposed to solve the linear output regulation problem using the nonparametric learning framework. Two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>
