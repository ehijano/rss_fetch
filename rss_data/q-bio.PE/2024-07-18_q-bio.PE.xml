      <title>On the Evolution of Virulence in Vector-borne Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence or adaptation of pathogens may lead to epidemics or even pandemics, highlighting the need for a thorough understanding of pathogen evolution. The tradeoff hypothesis suggests that virulence evolves to reach an optimal transmission intensity relative to the mortality caused by the disease. This study introduces a mathematical model that incorporates key factors such as recovery times and mortality rates, focusing on the diminishing effects of parasite growth on transmission, with a focus on vector-borne diseases. The analysis reveals conditions under which heightened virulence occurs in hosts, indicating that these factors can support vector-host transmission of a pathogen, even if the host-only component is insufficient for viability. This insight helps explain the increased prevalence of pathogens with high fatality rates, especially in vector-borne diseases. The findings emphasize an elevated risk in major pandemics involving vector-host diseases. Enhanced surveillance of mortality rates and techniques to monitor pathogen evolution are vital to effectively control future epidemics. This study provides essential insights for pandemic preparedness and highlights the need for ongoing research into pathogen evolution.</description>

      <title>Exact path-integral representation of the Wright-Fisher model with mutation and selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wright-Fisher model describes a biological population containing a finite number of individuals. In this work we consider a Wright-Fisher model for a randomly mating population, where selection and mutation act at an unlinked locus. The selection acting has a general form, and the locus may have two or more alleles. We determine an exact representation of the time dependent transition probability of such a model in terms of a path integral. Path integrals were introduced in physics and mathematics, and have found numerous applications in different fields, where a probability distribution, or closely related object, is represented as a 'sum' of contributions over all paths or trajectories between two points. Path integrals provide alternative calculational routes to problems, and may be a source of new intuition and suggest new approximations. For the case of two alleles, we relate the exact Wright-Fisher path-integral result to the path-integral form of the transition density under the diffusion approximation. We determine properties of the Wright-Fisher transition probability for multiple alleles. We show how, in the absence of mutation, the Wright-Fisher transition probability incorporates phenomena such as fixation and loss.</description>

      <title>Bridging Wright-Fisher and Moran models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wright-Fisher model and the Moran model are both widely used in population genetics. They describe the time evolution of the frequency of an allele in a well-mixed population with fixed size. We propose a simple and tractable model which bridges the Wright-Fisher and the Moran descriptions. We assume that a fixed fraction of the population is updated at each discrete time step. In this model, we determine the fixation probability of a mutant in the diffusion approximation, as well as the effective population size. We generalize our model, first by taking into account fluctuating updated fractions or individual lifetimes, and then by incorporating selection on the lifetime as well as on the reproductive fitness.</description>

      <title>Decoding Dmrt1: Insights into vertebrate sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dmrt1 is pivotal in testis formation and function by interacting with genes crucial for Sertoli cell differentiation, such as Sox9. It represses female-determining pathways and ovarian formation by silencing Foxl2. Across 127 vertebrate species, Dmrt1 exhibits sexually dimorphic expression, prior to and during gonadal sex differentiation and in adult testes, implicating its role in master regulation of sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation. Dmrt1 emerges as a master sex-determining gene in one fish, frog, chicken and reptile. Recent studies suggest epigenetic regulation of Dmrt1 in its promoter methylation and transposable element insertion introducing epigenetic modification to cis-regulatory elements, alongside non-coding RNA involvement, in a wide spectrum of sex-determining mechanisms. Additionally, alternative splicing of Dmrt1 was found in all vertebrate groups except amphibians. Dmrt1 has evolved many lineage-specific isoforms (ranging from 2 to 10) but has no sex-specific splicing variants in any taxa, which is in sharp contrast to the constitutional sex-specific splicing of Dsx in insects. Future research should focus on understanding the molecular basis of environmental sex determination from a broader taxon, and the molecular basis of epigenetic regulation. It is also essential to understand why and how multiple alternative splicing variants of Dmrt1 evolve and the specific roles each isoform plays in sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation, as well as the significant differences in the molecular mechanisms and functions of alternative splicing between Dmrt1 in vertebrates and sex-specific splicing of Dsx in insects. Understanding the differences could provide deeper insights into the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms between vertebrates and insects.</description>

      <title>Estimate Epidemiological Parameters given Partial Observations based on Algebraically Observable PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we considered the problem of estimating epidemiological parameters based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In practice, not all trajectory data corresponding to the population estimated by epidemic models can be obtained, and some observed trajectories are noisy. Learning PINNs to estimate unknown epidemiological parameters using such partial observations is challenging. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of algebraic observability into PINNs. The validity of the proposed PINN, named as an algebraically observable PINNs, in terms of estimation parameters and prediction of unobserved variables, is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Phylotrack: C++ and Python libraries for in silico phylogenetic tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In silico evolution instantiates the processes of heredity, variation, and differential reproductive success (the three "ingredients" for evolution by natural selection) within digital populations of computational agents. Consequently, these populations undergo evolution, and can be used as virtual model systems for studying evolutionary dynamics. This experimental paradigm -- used across biological modeling, artificial life, and evolutionary computation -- complements research done using in vitro and in vivo systems by enabling experiments that would be impossible in the lab or field. One key benefit is complete, exact observability. For example, it is possible to perfectly record all parent-child relationships across simulation history, yielding complete phylogenies (ancestry trees). This information reveals when traits were gained or lost, and also facilitates inference of underlying evolutionary dynamics.
  The Phylotrack project provides libraries for tracking and analyzing phylogenies in in silico evolution. The project is composed of 1) Phylotracklib: a header-only C++ library, developed under the umbrella of the Empirical project, and 2) Phylotrackpy: a Python wrapper around Phylotracklib, created with Pybind11. Both components supply a public-facing API to attach phylogenetic tracking to digital evolution systems, as well as a stand-alone interface for measuring a variety of popular phylogenetic topology metrics. Underlying design and C++ implementation prioritizes efficiency, allowing for fast generational turnover for agent populations numbering in the tens of thousands. Several explicit features (e.g., phylogeny pruning and abstraction, etc.) are provided for reducing the memory footprint of phylogenetic information.</description>

      <title>A novel comparison framework for epidemiological strategies applied to age-based restrictions versus horizontal lockdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During an epidemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, policy-makers are faced with the decision of implementing effective, yet socioeconomically costly intervention strategies, such as school and workplace closure, physical distancing, etc. In this study, we propose a rigorous definition of epidemiological strategies. In addition, we develop a scheme for comparing certain epidemiological strategies, with the goal of providing policy-makers with a tool for their systematic comparison. Then, we put the suggested scheme to the test by employing an age-based epidemiological compartment model introduced in Bitsouni et al. (2024), coupled with data from the literature, in order to compare the effectiveness of age-based and horizontal interventions. In general, our findings suggest that these two are comparable, mainly at a low or medium level of intensity.</description>

      <title>Social learning with complex contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical model that combines the concepts of complex contagion with payoff-biased imitation, to describe how social behaviors spread through a population. Traditional models of social learning by imitation are based on simple contagion -- where an individual may imitate a more successful neighbor following a single interaction. Our framework generalizes this process to incorporate complex contagion, which requires multiple exposures before an individual considers adopting a different behavior. We formulate this as a discrete time and state stochastic process in a finite population, and we derive its continuum limit as an ordinary differential equation that generalizes the replicator equation, the most widely used dynamical model in evolutionary game theory. When applied to linear frequency-dependent games, our social learning with complex contagion produces qualitatively different outcomes than traditional imitation dynamics: it can shift the Prisoner's Dilemma from a unique all-defector equilibrium to either a stable mixture of cooperators and defectors in the population, or a bistable system; it changes the Snowdrift game from a single to a bistable equilibrium; and it can alter the Coordination game from bistability at the boundaries to two internal equilibria. The long-term outcome depends on the balance between the complexity of the contagion process and the strength of selection that biases imitation towards more successful types. Our analysis intercalates the fields of evolutionary game theory with complex contagions, and it provides a synthetic framework that describes more realistic forms of behavioral change in social systems.</description>
