      <title>Value of Information in Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends Blackwell's (1953) comparison of information to a sequential social learning model, where agents make decisions sequentially based on both private signals and the observed actions of others. In this context, we introduce a new binary relation over information structures: An information structure is more socially valuable than another if it yields higher expected payoffs for all agents, regardless of their preferences. First, we establish that this binary relation is strictly stronger than the Blackwell order. Then, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for our binary relation and propose a simpler sufficient condition that is easier to verify.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Subsumption Thesis: A Formal Bridge between Microeconomics and Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a unified theory of sentient behaviour, active inference is formally intertwined with multiple normative theories of optimal behaviour. Specifically, we address what we call the subsumption thesis: The claim that expected utility from economics, as an account of agency, is subsumed by active inference. To investigate this claim, we present multiple examples that challenge the subsumption thesis. To formally compare these two accounts of agency, we analyze the objective functions for MDPs and POMDPs. By imposing information-theoretic rationality bounds (ITBR) on the expected utility agent, we find that the resultant agency is equivalent to that of active inference in MDPs, but slightly different in POMDPs. Rather than being strictly resolved, the subsumption thesis motivates the construction of a formal bridge between active inference and expected utility. This highlights the necessary formal assumptions and frameworks to make these disparate accounts of agency commensurable.</description>

      <title>Construction of Compromise Values for Cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a broad class of values for cooperative games in characteristic function form, known as compromise values. These values efficiently allocate payoffs by linearly combining well-specified upper and lower bounds on payoffs. We identify subclasses of games that admit non-trivial efficient allocations within the considered bounds, which we call bound-balanced games. Subsequently, we define the associated compromise value. We also provide an axiomatisation of this class of compromise values using a combination of the minimal-rights property and a variant of restricted proportionality.
  We construct and axiomatise various well-known and new compromise values based on these methods, including the $\tau$-, the $\chi$-, the Gately, the CIS-, the PANSC-, the EANSC-, and the new KM-values. We conclude that this approach establishes a common foundation for a wide range of different values.</description>

      <title>Using "Failure Costs" to Guarantee Execution Quality in Competitive and Permissionless Order Flow Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of decentralized blockchains, accurately simulating the outcome of order flow auctions (OFAs) off-chain is challenging due to adversarial sequencing, encrypted bids, and frequent state changes. Existing approaches, such as deterministic sorting via consensus layer modifications (e.g., MEV taxes) (Robinson and White 2024) and BRAID (Resnick 2024) or atomic execution of aggregated bids (e.g., Atlas) (Watts et al. 2024), remain vulnerable in permissionless settings where limited throughput allows rational adversaries to submit "spoof" bids that block their competitors' access to execution. We propose a new failure cost penalty that applies only when a solution is executed but does not pay its bid or fulfill the order. Combined with an on-chain escrow system, this mechanism empowers applications to asynchronously issue their users a guaranteed minimum outcome before the execution results are finalized. It implies a direct link between blockchain throughput, censorship resistance, and the capital efficiency of auction participants (e.g., solvers), which intuitively extends to execution quality. At equilibrium, bids fully reflect the potential for price improvement between bid submission and execution, but only partially reflect the potential for price declines. This asymmetry unbounded upside for winning bids, limited downside for failed bids, and no loss for losing bids - ultimately benefits users.</description>

      <title>Cued to Queue: Information in Waiting-Line Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of providing information to agents who queue before a scarce good is distributed at a fixed time. When agents have quasi-linear utility in time spent waiting, they choose entry times as they would bids in a descending auction. An information designer can influence their behavior by providing updates about the length of the queue. Many natural information policies release "sudden bad news," which occurs when agents learn that the queue is longer than previously believed. We show that sudden bad news can cause assortative inefficiency by prompting a mass of agents to simultaneously attempt to join the queue. As a result, if the value distribution has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate, information policies that release sudden bad news increase (decrease) total surplus, relative to releasing no information. When agents face entry costs to join the queue and the value distribution has a decreasing hazard rate, an information designer maximizes total surplus by announcing only when the queue is full.</description>
