      <title>Establishing a pre-logical setting in a quantum model of psycho-analytic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial issue both in cognitive and psychoanalytical theories deals with the origin of mental representations. In order to explore this issue, the paper analyzes a pre-logical setting, by considering a formalized approach to the foundations of psychoanalysis in logic, interpreting and integrating the views by Freud, Matte Blanco, Klein and Bion. The formalized approach derives from a quantum model of spin states. A representation of the spin state of a particle in first order logic is abstracted to get a modality interpretable as an abstract projector. The last can be decomposed into a positive, negative and irreal component. The irreal component cannot emerge and, in logic, is absorbed by the two others, giving rise to logical duality. Due to its treatment of undefiniteness and coherence, the paper is meant to contribute to quantum cognition, in its particular sense of affective quantum cognition.</description>

      <title>A differentiable model of supply-chain shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling how shocks propagate in supply chains is an increasingly important challenge in economics. Its relevance has been highlighted in recent years by events such as Covid-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Agent-based models (ABMs) are a promising approach for this problem. However, calibrating them is hard. We show empirically that it is possible to achieve speed ups of over 3 orders of magnitude when calibrating ABMs of supply networks by running them on GPUs and using automatic differentiation, compared to non-differentiable baselines. This opens the door to scaling ABMs to model the whole global supply network.</description>

      <title>Instant Runoff Voting and the Reinforcement Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the susceptibility of instant runoff voting (IRV) to a lesser-studied paradox known as a \emph{reinforcement paradox}, which occurs when candidate $X$ wins under IRV in two distinct elections but $X$ loses in the combined election formed by merging the ballots from the two elections. For three-candidate IRV elections we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which there exists a partition of the ballot set into two sets of ballots such that a given losing candidate wins each of the sub-elections. Applying these conditions, we use Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the frequency with which such partitions exist under various models of voter behavior. We also analyze the frequency with which the paradox occurs in a large dataset of real-world ranked-choice elections to provide empirical probabilities. Our general finding is that IRV is highly susceptible to this paradox in three-candidate elections.</description>

      <title>Taskmaster Deconstructed: A Quantitative Look at Tension, Volatility, and Viewer Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taskmaster is a British television show that combines comedic performance with a formal scoring system. Despite the appearance of structured competition, it remains unclear whether scoring dynamics contribute meaningfully to audience engagement. We conducted a statistical analysis of 162 episodes across 18 series, using fifteen episode-level metrics to quantify rank volatility, point spread, lead changes, and winner dominance. None of these metrics showed a significant association with IMDb ratings, even after controlling for series effects. Long-term trends suggest that average points have increased over time, while volatility has slightly declined and rank spread has remained stable. These patterns indicate an attempt to enhance competitive visibility without altering the show's structural equilibrium. We also analyzed contestant rank trajectories and identified five recurring archetypes describing performance styles. These patterns suggest that viewer interest is shaped more by contestant behavior than by game mechanics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Estimates of Displacement in Disaster Regions: A Policy-driven framework triangulating data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While traditional data systems remain fundamental to humanitarian response, they often lack the real-time responsiveness and spatial precision needed to capture increasingly complex patterns of displacement. Internal displacement reached an unprecedented 83.4 million people by the end of 2024, underscoring the urgent need for innovative, data driven approaches to monitor and understand population movements. This report examines how integrating traditional data sources with emerging digital trace data, such as mobile phone GPS and social media activity, can enhance the accuracy, responsiveness, and granularity of displacement monitoring. Drawing on lessons from recent crises, including the escalation of the war in Ukraine and the 2022 floods in Pakistan, the report presents a structured pilot effort that tests the triangulation of multiple data streams to produce more robust and reliable displacement estimates. Statistical indicators derived from digital trace data are benchmarked against the International Organisation for Migration, Displacement Tracking Matrix datasets, to assess their validity, transparency, and scalability. The findings demonstrate how triangulated data approaches can deliver real-time, high-resolution insights into population movements, improving humanitarian resource allocation and intervention planning. The report includes a scalable framework for crisis monitoring that leverages digital innovation to strengthen humanitarian data systems and support evidence-based decision-making in complex emergencies.</description>
