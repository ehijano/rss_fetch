      <title>Distribution-Free Normal Modal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article initiates the semantic study of distribution-free normal modal logic systems, laying the semantic foundations and anticipating further research in the area. The article explores roughly the same area, though taking a different approach, with a recent article by Bezhanishvili, de Groot, Dmitrieva and Morachini, who studied a distribution-free version of Dunn's Positive Modal Logic (PML). Unlike PML, we consider logics that may drop distribution and which are equipped with both an implication connective and modal operators. We adopt a uniform relational semantics approach, relying on recent results on representation and duality for normal lattice expansions. We prove canonicity and completeness in the relational semantics of the minimal distribution-free normal modal logic, assuming just the K-axiom, as well as of its axiomatic extensions obtained by adding any of the D, T, B, S4 or S5 axioms. Adding distribution can be easily accommodated and, as a side result, we also obtain a new semantic treatment of Intuitionistic Modal Logic.</description>

      <title>SUBMASSIVE: Resolving Subclass Cycles in Very Large Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large knowledge graphs capture information of a large number of entities and their relations. Among the many relations they capture, class subsumption assertions are usually present and expressed using the \texttt{rdfs:subClassOf} construct. From our examination, publicly available knowledge graphs contain many potentially erroneous cyclic subclass relations, a problem that can be exacerbated when different knowledge graphs are integrated as Linked Open Data. In this paper, we present an automatic approach for resolving such cycles at scale using automated reasoning by encoding the problem of cycle-resolving to a MAXSAT solver. The approach is tested on the LOD-a-lot dataset, and compared against a semi-automatic version of our algorithm. We show how the number of removed triples is a trade-off against the efficiency of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>SAT Solving for Variants of First-Order Subsumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated reasoners, such as SAT/SMT solvers and first-order provers, are becoming the backbones of rigorous systems engineering, being used for example in applications of system verification, program synthesis, and cybersecurity. Automation in these domains crucially depends on the efficiency of the underlying reasoners towards finding proofs and/or counterexamples of the task to be enforced. In order to gain efficiency, automated reasoners use dedicated proof rules to keep proof search tractable. To this end, (variants of) subsumption is one of the most important proof rules used by automated reasoners, ranging from SAT solvers to first-order theorem provers and beyond.
  It is common that millions of subsumption checks are performed during proof search, necessitating efficient implementations. However, in contrast to propositional subsumption as used by SAT solvers and implemented using sophisticated polynomial algorithms, first-order subsumption in first-order theorem provers involves NP-complete search queries, turning the efficient use of first-order subsumption into a huge practical burden.
  In this paper we argue that the integration of a dedicated SAT solver opens up new venues for efficient implementations of first-order subsumption and related rules. We show that, by using a flexible learning approach to choose between various SAT encodings of subsumption variants, we greatly improve the scalability of first-order theorem proving. Our experimental results demonstrate that, by using a tailored SAT solver within first-order reasoning, we gain a large speedup in solving state-of-the-art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Decision algorithms for fragments of real analysis. II. A theory of differentiable functions with convexity and concavity predicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16091v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the decision problem for a fragment of real analysis involving differentiable functions with continuous first derivatives. The proposed theory, besides the operators of Tarski's theory of reals, includes predicates for comparisons, monotonicity, convexity, and derivative of functions over bounded closed intervals or unbounded intervals.
  Our decision algorithm is obtained by showing that satisfiable formulae of our theory admit canonical models in which functional variables are interpreted as piecewise exponential functions. These can be implicitly described within the decidable Tarski's theory of reals.
  Our satisfiability test generalizes previous decidability results not involving derivative operators.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Mechanisms of DAI: A Logic-Based Approach to Stablecoin Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to traditional currencies. Despite their growing prominence, many stablecoins have struggled to consistently meet stability expectations, and their underlying mechanisms often remain opaque and challenging to analyze. This paper focuses on the DAI stablecoin, which combines crypto-collateralization and algorithmic mechanisms. We propose a formal logic-based framework for representing the policies and operations of DAI, implemented in Prolog and released as open-source software. Our framework enables detailed analysis and simulation of DAI's stability mechanisms, providing a foundation for understanding its robustness and identifying potential vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Formal Mathematical Reasoning: A New Frontier in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI for Mathematics (AI4Math) is not only intriguing intellectually but also crucial for AI-driven discovery in science, engineering, and beyond. Extensive efforts on AI4Math have mirrored techniques in NLP, in particular, training large language models on carefully curated math datasets in text form. As a complementary yet less explored avenue, formal mathematical reasoning is grounded in formal systems such as proof assistants, which can verify the correctness of reasoning and provide automatic feedback. In this position paper, we advocate for formal mathematical reasoning and argue that it is indispensable for advancing AI4Math to the next level. In recent years, we have seen steady progress in using AI to perform formal reasoning, including core tasks such as theorem proving and autoformalization, as well as emerging applications such as verifiable generation of code and hardware designs. However, significant challenges remain to be solved for AI to truly master mathematics and achieve broader impact. We summarize existing progress, discuss open challenges, and envision critical milestones to measure future success. At this inflection point for formal mathematical reasoning, we call on the research community to come together to drive transformative advancements in this field.</description>

      <title>Semantic Foundations of Reductive Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of logic has largely been through the 'deductive' paradigm: conclusions are inferred from established premisses. However, the use of logic in the context of both human and machine reasoning is typically through the dual 'reductive' perspective: collections of sufficient premisses are generated from putative conclusions. We call this paradigm, 'reductive logic'. This expression of logic encompass as diverse reasoning activities as proving a formula in a formal system to seeking to meet a friend before noon on Saturday. This paper is a semantical analysis of reductive logic. In particular, we provide mathematical foundations for representing and reasoning about 'reduction operators'. Heuristically, reduction operators may be thought of as `backwards' inference rules. In this paper, we address their mathematical representation, how they are used in the context of reductive reasoning, and, crucially, what makes them 'valid'.</description>

      <title>Proof complexity of positive branching programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the proof complexity of systems based on positive branching programs, i.e. non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs) where, for any 0-transition between two nodes, there is also a 1-transition. Positive NBPs compute monotone Boolean functions, just like negation-free circuits or formulas, but constitute a positive version of (non-uniform) NL, rather than P or NC1, respectively.
  The proof complexity of NBPs was investigated in previous work by Buss, Das and Knop, using extension variables to represent the dag-structure, over a language of (non-deterministic) decision trees, yielding the system eLNDT. Our system eLNDT+ is obtained by restricting their systems to a positive syntax, similarly to how the 'monotone sequent calculus' MLK is obtained from the usual sequent calculus LK by restricting to negation-free formulas.
  Our main result is that eLNDT+ polynomially simulates eLNDT over positive sequents. Our proof method is inspired by a similar result for MLK by Atserias, Galesi and Pudl\'ak, that was recently improved to a bona fide polynomial simulation via works of Je\v{r}\'abek and Buss, Kabanets, Kolokolova and Kouck\'y. Along the way we formalise several properties of counting functions within eLNDT+ by polynomial-size proofs and, as a case study, give explicit polynomial-size poofs of the propositional pigeonhole principle.</description>

      <title>Ajtai's theorem for $T^2_2(R)$ and pebble games with backtracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a pebble game extended by backtracking options for one of the two players (called Prover) and reduce the provability of the pigeonhole principle for a generic predicate $R$ in the bounded arithmetic $T^2_2(R)$ to the existence of a particular kind of winning strategy (called oblivious) for Prover in the game. While the unprovability of the said principle in $T^2_2(R)$ is an immediate consequence of a celebrated theorem of Ajtai (which deals with a stronger theory $T_2(R)$), up-to-date no methods working for $T^2_2(R)$ directly (in particular without switching lemma) are known. Although the full analysis of the introduced pebble game is left open, as a first step towards resolving it, we restrict ourselves to a simplified version of the game. In this case, Prover can use only two pebbles and move in an extremely oblivious way. Besides, a series of backtracks can be made only once during a play. Under these assumptions, we show that no strategy of Prover can be winning.</description>

      <title>LTLf Synthesis on First-Order Agent Programs in Nondeterministic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the synthesis of policies for high-level agent programs expressed in Golog, a language based on situation calculus that incorporates nondeterministic programming constructs. Unlike traditional approaches for program realization that assume full agent control or rely on incremental search, we address scenarios where environmental nondeterminism significantly influences program outcomes. Our synthesis problem involves deriving a policy that successfully realizes a given Golog program while ensuring the satisfaction of a temporal specification, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf), across all possible environmental behaviors. By leveraging an expressive class of first-order action theories, we construct a finite game arena that encapsulates program executions and tracks the satisfaction of the temporal goal. A game-theoretic approach is employed to derive such a policy. Experimental results demonstrate this approach's feasibility in domains with unbounded objects and non-local effects. This work bridges agent programming and temporal logic synthesis, providing a framework for robust agent behavior in nondeterministic environments.</description>

      <title>Constrained LTL Specification Learning from Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal logic specifications play an important role in a wide range of software analysis tasks, such as model checking, automated synthesis, program comprehension, and runtime monitoring. Given a set of positive and negative examples, specified as traces, LTL learning is the problem of synthesizing a specification, in linear temporal logic (LTL), that evaluates to true over the positive traces and false over the negative ones. In this paper, we propose a new type of LTL learning problem called constrained LTL learning, where the user, in addition to positive and negative examples, is given an option to specify one or more constraints over the properties of the LTL formula to be learned. We demonstrate that the ability to specify these additional constraints significantly increases the range of applications for LTL learning, and also allows efficient generation of LTL formulas that satisfy certain desirable properties (such as minimality). We propose an approach for solving the constrained LTL learning problem through an encoding in first-order relational logic and reduction to an instance of the maximal satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that ATLAS, an implementation of our proposed approach, is able to solve new types of learning problems while performing better than or competitively with the state-of-the-art tools in LTL learning.</description>

      <title>Towards Projected and Incremental Pseudo-Boolean Model Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model counting is a fundamental task that involves determining the number of satisfying assignments to a logical formula, typically in conjunctive normal form (CNF). While CNF model counting has received extensive attention over recent decades, interest in Pseudo-Boolean (PB) model counting is just emerging partly due to the greater flexibility of PB formulas. As such, we observed feature gaps in existing PB counters such as a lack of support for projected and incremental settings, which could hinder adoption. In this work, our main contribution is the introduction of the PB model counter PBCount2, the first exact PB model counter with support for projected and incremental model counting. Our counter, PBCount2, uses our Least Occurrence Weighted Min Degree (LOW-MD) computation ordering heuristic to support projected model counting and a cache mechanism to enable incremental model counting. In our evaluations, PBCount2 completed at least 1.40x the number of benchmarks of competing methods for projected model counting and at least 1.18x of competing methods in incremental model counting.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Strategy Logic with Degrees of Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been considerable work on reasoning about the strategic ability of agents under imperfect information. However, existing logics such as Probabilistic Strategy Logic are unable to express properties relating to information transparency. Information transparency concerns the extent to which agents' actions and behaviours are observable by other agents. Reasoning about information transparency is useful in many domains including security, privacy, and decision-making. In this paper, we present a formal framework for reasoning about information transparency properties in stochastic multi-agent systems. We extend Probabilistic Strategy Logic with new observability operators that capture the degree of observability of temporal properties by agents. We show that the model checking problem for the resulting logic is decidable.</description>
