      <title>Study of magnification and angular resolution of a single water droplet placed on a glass surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the magnification and angular resolution of a single water droplet positioned on a glass surface, functioning as an optical imaging system. Through theoretical analysis of the droplet's shape, magnification, and angular resolution, we derive predictions that are subsequently validated through experiments. Our study explores the impact of key parameters, including droplet size, the distance between the droplet and the object, and the contact angle, on the aforementioned optical characteristics. Our findings reveal that smaller droplets exhibit higher magnification at shorter object-to-droplet distances and demonstrate superior resolving capability (i.e., smaller angular resolution).</description>

      <title>Engineering 2D Van der Waals Electrode via MBE Grown Weyl Semimetal 1T-WTe2 for Enhanced Photodetection in InSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving low contact resistance in advanced electronic devices remains a significant challenge. As the demand for faster and more energy-efficient devices grows, 2D contact engineering emerges as a promising solution for next-generation electronics. Beyond graphene, 1T-WTe2 has gained attention due to its outstanding electrical transport properties, quantum phenomena, and Weyl semimetallic characteristics. We demonstrate the direct wafer-scale growth of 1T-WTe2 via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and use it as a 2D contact for layered materials like InSe, which exhibits broad photoresponsivity. The performance of this 2D electrode in InSe-based photodetectors is compared with conventional metal electrodes. Under near-infrared (NIR) to deep ultraviolet (DUV) illumination, the InSe/1T-WTe2 configuration shows a broad photoresponsivity range from 0.14 to 217.58 A/W, with fast rise/fall times of 42/126 ms in the visible region. In contrast, the InSe/Ti-Au configuration exhibits a peak photoresponsivity of 3.64 A/W in the DUV range, with an overall lower responsivity spanning from 0.000865 A/W to 3.64 A/W under NIR and DUV illumination, respectively. Additionally, in the visible regime, it exhibits slower rise and fall times of 150 ms and 144 ms, respectively, compared to InSe/1T-WTe2. These findings indicate that MBE-grown 1T-WTe2 serves as an effective 2D electrode, delivering higher photoresponsivity and faster photodetection compared to traditional metal contacts. This approach offers a simplified, high-performance alternative for layered material-based devices, eliminating the need for complex heterostructure configurations.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Based Optimization of Core-Shell Particles with Discrete Materials for Directional Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing nanophotonic structures traditionally grapples with the complexities of discrete parameters, such as real materials, often resorting to costly global optimization methods. This paper introduces an approach that leverages generative deep learning to map discrete parameter sets into a continuous latent space, enabling direct gradient-based optimization. For scenarios with non-differentiable physics evaluation functions, a neural network is employed as a differentiable surrogate model. The efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated by optimizing the directional scattering properties of core-shell nanoparticles composed of a selection of realistic materials. We derive suggestions for core-shell geometries with strong forward scattering and minimized backscattering. Our findings reveal significant improvements in computational efficiency and performance when compared to global optimization techniques. Beyond nanophotonics design problems, this framework holds promise for broad applications across all types of inverse problems constrained by discrete variables.</description>

      <title>Spiral resonator referenced on-chip low noise microwave generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, miniaturization and integration of photonic microwave oscillators by optical frequency division approach have witnessed rapid progress. In this work, we report on-chip low phase noise photonic microwave generation based on a planar chip design. Dual lasers are co-locked to a silicon nitride spiral resonator and their relative phase noise is measured below the cavity thermal noise limit, resulting in record low on-chip relative optical phase noise. A broadband integrated electro-optic comb up to 3.43 THz (27 nm) bandwidth is utilized to divide down the relative phase noise of the spiral resonator referenced lasers to the microwave domain. All-around record-low phase noise is achieved for planar chip-based photonic microwave oscillators from 10 Hz to 10 kHz offsets. The planar chip design, high technology-readiness level, foundry-ready processing, combined with the exceptional phase noise performance for our work represent a major advance of integrated photonic microwave oscillators.</description>

      <title>DNA Sensing with Whispering Gallery Mode Microlasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleic acid sensing is crucial for advancing diagnostics, therapeutic monitoring and molecu-lar biology research, by enabling the precise identification of DNA and RNA interactions. Here, we present an innovative sensing platform based on DNA-functionalized whispering gallery mode (WGM) microlasers. By correlating spectral shifts in laser emission to changes in refractive index, we demonstrate real-time detection of DNA hybridization and structural changes. The addition of gold nanoparticles to the DNA strands significantly enhances sensi-tivity, and labeling exclusively the sensing strand or a hairpin strand eliminates the need for secondary labeling of the target strand. We further show that ionic strength influences DNA compactness, and we introduce a hairpin-based system as a dual-purpose sensor and con-trolled release mechanism for potential drug delivery. This versatile WGM-based platform of-fers promise for sequence-specific nucleic acid sensing, multiplexed detection, and in vivo ap-plications in diagnostics and cellular research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully three-dimensional kinetic framework for modeling intense short pulse lasers interacting with dielectric materials. Our work modifies the open-source Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code EPOCH to include new models for molecular photoionization and dielectric optical response. We use this framework to model the laser-induced damage of dielectric materials by few-cycle laser pulses. The framework is benchmarked against experimental results for bulk silica targets and then applied to model multi-layer dielectric mirrors with a sequence of simulations with varying laser fluence. This allows us to better understand the laser damage process by providing new insight into energy absorption, excited particle dynamics, and nonthermal excited particle dist</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Polarization Mode Dispersion Mitigation for Fibre-Optic Time and Frequency Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polarization switching pulse interleaver is shown to be effective in reducing timing noise due to polarization mode dispersion in time and frequency transfer based on mode-locked lasers and standard single-mode fibres. In closed-loop time transfer over a 30-km dispersion-compensated fibre link with 300~fs of differential group delay, polarization interleaving reduced the delay variations to &lt;20fs. The results indicate that the remaining drift is caused by polarization-dependent loss and by AM-to-PM noise conversion in the photodiodes, suggesting the need for a "double-balanced" phase detector in the receiver, that is, a phase detector balanced in power and polarization. By mitigating the polarization dependence, this work demonstrates a simple approach that can potentially yield sub-femtosecond-level, long-term time transfer in long-haul fibre links utilizing standard single-mode fibres.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency Electro-Optic Lens for radio frequency beam wavefront modulation for mode mismatch sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active mode mismatch sensing and control can facilitate optimal coupling in optical cavity experiments such as interferometric gravitational wave detectors. In this paper, we demonstrate a radio-frequency (RF) beam wavefront curvature modulation-based mode mismatch sensing scheme inspired by the previously proposed RF beam jitter alignment sensing scheme. The proposed mode mismatch sensing scheme uses an electro-optic lens (EOL) device that is designed to provide the required beam wavefront curvature actuation, as well as a mode converting telescope that rephases the RF second-order modes and generates a non-vanishing mode mismatch sensing signal. We carefully investigate the total second-order mode generation from the wavefront actuation both analytically and numerically, taking the effects of Gaussian beam size evolution and the second-order mode phase mismatch cancellation into consideration. We demonstrate the second-order mode generation as a function of the incident beam waist size and the electro-optic crystal size, which along with a ``trade-off'' consideration of the beam size at the edges of the crystal and the clipping loss, provides us with guidance for designing the beam profile that interacts with the crystal to improve the EOL modulation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Mirrors without spatial boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mirrors are one of the most elementary and ubiquitous components of optical systems. They use a sharp refractive index contrast to provide the basic capability of reflecting light. Motivated by recent developments of photonic time-varying media, here we investigate the fundamental question on whether it is possible to have a mirror without any spatial boundary. In this vein, we first discuss how purely temporal mirrors are in general forbidden by the conservation of Minkowski momentum. However, we show that an exotic class of metamaterials, namely, temporal non-Foster left-handed media, exhibit anti-parallel Minkowski momentum and energy flow, thereby enabling mirrors without spatial boundaries. Upon this ground, we put forward some related photonic functionalities, including temporal cavities, pulse freezing, and frequency comb generators, which can be understood as the precursor of temporal lasers.</description>

      <title>Spatially Encoded Polaritonic Ultra-Strong Coupling in Gradient Metasurfaces with Epsilon-Near-Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-strong coupling (USC) is a light-matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths that substantially exceed the threshold for strong coupling. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single-photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low-threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric nanophotonic platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q-factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here, we demonstrate ultra-strong coupling to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra-thin SiO$_2$ layer. Our approach leverages a dielectric dual-gradient metasurface supporting quasi-bound-states-in-the-continuum (qBIC) consisting of two tapered bars in each unit cell that generate strong out-of-plane electric fields which overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode. Using dual gradients to encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space, we track the anticrossing behaviour of this coupled system with high experimental precision, revealing a mode splitting equivalent to 19% of the ENZ mode energy; a four-to-five-fold increase compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, varying the position of the SiO$_2$ layer allows for deliberate control of the mode overlap and the coupling between the qBIC and either the ENZ mode or the transverse optical (TO) phonon can be selectively tuned. This allows us to experimentally create an USC three-resonator system, opening new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices for sensing and nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Terahertz molecular frequency references: theoretical analysis of optimal instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the instability achievable by using phase modulation spectroscopy to lock a terahertz local oscillator to an absorptive reference consisting of the rotational transition of molecules at room temperature. We find that the signal-to-noise ratio of the THz detector provides the limitation to the instability that can be achieved and analyze a number of viable candidate molecules, identifying several as being of particular interest, including OCS and HI. We find that a one-second instability in the $10^{-13}$ decade is achievable for molecules confined to waveguide, while instability at the $10^{-14}$ level can be reached for molecules in free space. We also present calculations of the intermodulation effect for spectroscopy taking place far outside the quasistatic regime and find that this source of noise presents constraints on which THz local oscillators are appropriate to be used for such frequency references.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised CP-UNet Framework for Denoising DAS Data with Decay Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensor (DAS) technology leverages optical fiber cables to detect acoustic signals, providing cost-effective and dense monitoring capabilities. It offers several advantages including resistance to extreme conditions, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and accurate detection. However, DAS typically exhibits a lower signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) compared to geophones and is susceptible to various noise types, such as random noise, erratic noise, level noise, and long-period noise. This reduced S/N can negatively impact data analyses containing inversion and interpretation. While artificial intelligence has demonstrated excellent denoising capabilities, most existing methods rely on supervised learning with labeled data, which imposes stringent requirements on the quality of the labels. To address this issue, we develop a label-free unsupervised learning (UL) network model based on Context-Pyramid-UNet (CP-UNet) to suppress erratic and random noises in DAS data. The CP-UNet utilizes the Context Pyramid Module in the encoding and decoding process to extract features and reconstruct the DAS data. To enhance the connectivity between shallow and deep features, we add a Connected Module (CM) to both encoding and decoding section. Layer Normalization (LN) is utilized to replace the commonly employed Batch Normalization (BN), accelerating the convergence of the model and preventing gradient explosion during training. Huber-loss is adopted as our loss function whose parameters are experimentally determined. We apply the network to both the 2-D synthetic and filed data. Comparing to traditional denoising methods and the latest UL framework, our proposed method demonstrates superior noise reduction performance.</description>

      <title>Bright hybrid excitons in molecularly tunable bilayer crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayer crystals, built by stacking crystalline monolayers, generate interlayer potentials that govern excitonic phenomena but are constrained by fixed covalent lattices and orientations. Replacing one layer with an atomically thin molecular crystal overcomes this limitation, as diverse functional groups enable tunable molecular lattices and interlayer potentials, tailoring a wide range of excitonic properties. Here, we report hybrid excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), directly synthesized with single-crystalline perylene diimide (PDI) molecular crystal atop WS2 monolayers. These excitons arise from a hybridized bilayer band structure, revealed by lattice-scale first-principles calculations, inheriting properties from both monolayers. They exhibit bright photoluminescence with near-unity polarization above and below the WS2 bandgap, along with spectral signatures of exciton delocalization, supported by theory, while their energies and intensities are tuned by modifying the HBC composition by synthesis. Our work introduces a molecule-based 2D quantum materials platform for bottom-up design and control of optoelectronic properties.</description>

      <title>State- and momentum-dependent nonlinear Stark effect of interlayer excitons in bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interlayer excitons in van der Waals heterostructures offer rich collective phases, prospective optoelectronic applications, and versatile tunability, where control by electronic means is particularly relevant and practical. Here, in the case of bilayer WSe$_2$, we reveal how layer localization of excitons governs their response to an external electric field. Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we calculate the exciton dispersion for different stacking symmetries under applied electric field and/or strain, in order to map the landscape of competing low-energy excitons in four distinct finite-momentum valleys. While intralayer excitons are not affected by the electric field, some interlayer ones exhibit a nonlinear Stark shift that becomes linear after a critical threshold. The degree of nonlinearity is a direct measure of the layer hybridization of the electronic subcomponents of the exciton. Our findings explain the peculiar Stark-shift regimes observed in recent experiments, the nature of (anti)symmetric spectral shifts around zero field, and the sensitivity of dipolar excitons to external perturbations, all highly relevant to their further applications in excitonic condensates, optoelectronics devices and quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable topological lasing through Thouless pumping in bilayer photonic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02843v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a programmable photonic platform that integrates Thouless pumping and reconfigurable lasing in sliding bilayer photonic crystals. By engineering two periodic potentials -- a slowly moving photonic grating atop a stationary one -- we demonstrate how their interplay yields distinct topological phases characterized by either robust light transport (Thouless pumping) or localized spatial oscillation (trapping). A heterojunction between crystals in these two regimes supports an interface mode stemming from the topological phase transition across the boundary. This interface mode can be actively tuned via microelectromechanical systems or switched through the integration of phase-change materials. We further establish the feasibility of lasing action at this interface mode, offering a pathway toward topologically robust and reconfigurable lasers. Our findings provide a framework for exploring topological phase transitions and unify the fields of topological photonics and programmable photonic devices, opening avenues for multidimensionally tunable light sources.</description>

      <title>Large-scale free-space photonic circuits in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic circuits, engineered to couple optical modes according to a specific map, serve as processors for classical and quantum light. The number of components typically scales with that of processed modes, thus correlating system size, circuit complexity, and optical losses. Here we present a photonic-circuit technology implementing large-scale unitary maps in free space, coupling a single input to hundreds of output modes in a two-dimensional compact layout. The map corresponds to a quantum walk of structured photons, realized through light propagation in three liquid-crystal metasurfaces, having their optic axes artificially patterned. Theoretically, the walk length and the number of connected modes can be arbitrary, while keeping losses constant. The patterns can be designed to replicate multiple unitary maps. We also discuss limited reconfigurability by adjusting the overall birefringence and the relative displacement of the optical elements. These results lay the basis for the design of low-loss non-integrated photonic circuits, primarily for manipulating multi-photon states in quantum regimes.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of nonreciprocal optical properties of the defect modes in 1D defective photonic crystals with atomic doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of photonic crystals, lacking parity-time (PT) symmetry, using scattering matrix formalism. We show using the symmetry properties of matrices that a defective photonic crystal, doped with three-level atoms, breaks PT symmetry. For the two defect modes lying in the bandgap region, both the reflection and the absorption become nonreciprocal, while the transmission remains reciprocal. We show that the relevant energy spectra do not exhibit exceptional points, thereby invalidating its necessity to achieve nonreciprocity in reflection and absorption. We further demonstrate how this nonreciprocity can be coherently controlled using the driving field and dissipation rates of the atoms.</description>

      <title>Vortex Interference Enables optimal 3D Interferometric Nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-resolution imaging methods that combine interferometric (z) analysis with single-molecule localization microscopy (iSMLM) have achieved ultra-high 3D precision and contributed to the elucidation of important biological ultrastructures. However, their dependence on imaging multiple phase-shifted output channels necessitates complex instrumentation and operation. To solve this problem, we develop an interferometric super-resolution microscope capable of optimal direct axial nanoscopy, termed VILM (Vortex Interference Localization Microscopy). Using a pair of vortex phase plates with opposite orientation for each dual-opposed objective lenses, the detection point-spread functions (PSFs) adopt a bilobed profile whose rotation encodes the axial position. Thus, direct 3D single-molecule coordinate determination can be achieved with a single output image. By reducing the number of output channels to as few as one and utilizing a simple 50:50 beamsplitter, the imaging system is significantly streamlined, while the optimal iSMLM imaging performance is retained, with axial resolution ~2 times better than the lateral. The capability of VILM is demonstrated by resolving the architecture of microtubules and probing the organization of tyrosine-phosphorylated signalling proteins in integrin-based cell adhesions.</description>

      <title>Two-optical-cycle pulses from nanophotonic two-color soliton compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Few- and single-cycle optical pulses and their associated ultra-broadband spectra have been crucial in the progress of ultrafast science and technology. Moreover, multi-color waveforms composed of independently manipulable ultrashort pulses in distinct spectral bands offer unique advantages in pulse synthesis and attosecond science. However, the generation and control of ultrashort pulses has required bulky and expensive optical systems at the tabletop scale and has so far been beyond the reach of integrated photonics. Here, we break these limitations and demonstrate two-optical-cycle pulse compression using quadratic two-color soliton dynamics in lithium niobate nanophotonics. By leveraging dispersion engineering and operation near phase matching, we achieve extreme compression, energy-efficient operation, and strong conversion of pump to the second harmonic. We experimentally demonstrate generation of $\sim$13-fs pulses at 2 $\mu$m using only $\sim$3 pJ of input energy. We further illustrate how the demonstrated scheme can be readily extended to on-chip single-cycle pulse synthesis with sub-cycle control. Our results provide a path towards realization of single-cycle ultrafast systems in nanophotonic circuits.</description>

Abstract: The next generation of photonic circuits will require programmable, ultrafast, and energy-efficient components on a scalable platform for quantum and neuromorphic computing. Here, we present ultrafast electrical control of highly nonlinear light-matter hybrid quasi-particles, called waveguide exciton-dipolaritons, with extremely low power consumption. Our device performs as an optical transistor with a GHz-rate electrical modulation at a record-low total energy consumption $\sim$3 fJ/bit and a compact active area of down to 25 $\mu$m$^2$. This work establishes waveguide-dipolariton platforms for scalable, electrically reconfigurable, ultra-low power photonic circuits for both classical and quantum computing and communication.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Unpinned Dirac Points in Defected Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unpinned Dirac points (DPs) are nodal point degeneracies that occur at generic momentum points lacking high symmetry, often exhibiting characteristics typically forbidden by symmetry. While this phenomenon has been observed in solid-state materials, the formation of unpinned DPs in photonic crystals has not been extensively studied. This study presents a novel approach to achieving unpinned DPs in two-dimensional ``defected photonic crystals"-photonic superlattices created by modifying the size or refractive index of dielectric disks at specific sites. The defected photonic crystal hosts multiple unpinned DPs through accidental band crossings induced by rotational symmetry breaking across the nodal line degeneracies prevalent in the superlattice. Furthermore, the number of unpinned DPs, along with their positions and anisotropic dispersions, can be manipulated by adjusting the size or refractive index of the dielectric disks. This study pioneers the exploration of defected photonic crystals, proposing them as effective means of achieving unpinned DPs and facilitating the investigation of novel relativistic photonic wave phenomena with significant flexibility and control.</description>

      <title>Automatically setting arbitrary magnitude and phase of Mach-Zehnder interferometers for scalable optical computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports on an automated control strategy to set and stabilize a 2x2 integrated optical gate implemented with a balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The control strategy reliably configures the gate in any desired working point without any prior calibration or complex algorithm for the correction of hardware non-idealities. It has been tested on a multistage silicon photonic chip comprising a coherent input vector generator, the 2x2 gate used as matrix-vector multiplier and a coherent receiver for phase measurement. By leveraging the presence of transparent photodiodes in key positions, precise control of light beams in any point of the circuit is obtained, which translates into a resolution in the computation of the matrix-vector product of 7.2 and 8.5 bits for the output power and phase, respectively. High accuracy, robustness against non-idealities and stability over long-term operation, ensured by the feedback-controlled architecture, provide scalability towards optical processors of any size. Additionally, the possibility of using the MZI both as computing gate and phase validation unit avoids propagation of programming errors, solving a significant issue of coherent optical computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Properties of quantum emitters in different hBN sample types particularly suited for nanophotonic integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single photon emitters in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising solid-state quantum emitters for photonic applications and quantum networks. Despite their favorable properties, much is still unknown about their characteristics and their atomic origin. We focus on two different kinds of hBN samples that particularly lend themselves for integration with nanophotonic devices, multilayer nanoflakes produced by liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) and a layer-engineered sample from hBN grown by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). We investigate their inherent defects and fit their emission properties to computationally simulated optical properties of likely carbon-related defects. Thereby we compare and elucidate the properties in different sample types particularly suited for photonic quantum networks and narrow down the origin of emitters found in these samples. Our work is thus an important step towards harnessing the full potential of single photon emitters in hBN.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of Green's functions in disordered non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization leads to various intriguing phenomena concerning spectrums and wavefunctions. Here, we study the linear response of disordered non-Hermitian systems, which is precisely described by the Green's function. We show that the average maximum value of matrix elements of Green's functions, which quantifies the maximal response against an external perturbation, exhibits different phases characterized by different scaling behaviors with respect to the system size. Whereas the exponential-growth phase is also seen in the translation-invariant systems, the algebraic-growth phase is unique to disordered non-Hermitian systems. We explain the numerical findings using the large deviation theory, which provides analytical insights into the algebraic scaling factors of non-Hermitian disordered Green's functions. Furthermore, we show that these scaling behaviors can be observed in the steady states of disordered open quantum systems, offering a quantum-mechanical avenue for their experimental detection. Our work highlights an unexpected interplay between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner-Smith analysis of resonance perturbations in arbitrary $Q$ non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbing resonant systems causes shifts in their associated scattering poles in the complex plane. In a previous study [arXiv: 2408.11360], we demonstrated that these shifts can be calculated numerically by analyzing the residue of a generalized Wigner-Smith operator associated with the perturbation parameter. In this work, we extend this approach by connecting the Wigner-Smith formalism with results from standard electromagnetic perturbation theory applicable to open systems with resonances of arbitrary quality factors. We further demonstrate the utility of the method through several numerical examples, including the inverse design of a multi-layered nanoresonator sensor and an analysis of the enhanced sensitivity of scattering zeros to perturbations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce wavefront shaping as a tool for optimizing the sensitivity in nano-optomechanical measurement schemes. We perform multimode output analysis of an optomechanical system consisting of a focused laser beam coupled to the transverse motion of a tapered cantilever, and demonstrate that wavefront shaping enables a 350-fold enhancement of the measurement signal-to-noise (+25.5 dB) compared to standard split-detection, close to the quantum precision limit. Our results open new perspectives in terms of sensitivity and control of the optomechanical interaction.</description>
