      <title>Adaptive and Stratified Subsampling Techniques for High Dimensional Non-Standard Data Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of estimating high-dimensional parameters in non-standard data environments, where traditional methods often falter due to issues such as heavy-tailed distributions, data contamination, and dependent observations. We propose robust subsampling techniques, specifically Adaptive Importance Sampling (AIS) and Stratified Subsampling, designed to enhance the reliability and efficiency of parameter estimation. Under some clearly outlined conditions, we establish consistency and asymptotic normality for the proposed estimators, providing non-asymptotic error bounds that quantify their performance. Our theoretical foundations are complemented by controlled experiments demonstrating the superiority of our methods over conventional approaches. By bridging the gap between theory and practice, this work offers significant contributions to robust statistical estimation, paving the way for advancements in various applied domains.</description>

      <title>Improving Numerical Stability of Normalized Mutual Information Estimator on High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual information provides a powerful, general-purpose metric for quantifying the amount of shared information between variables. Estimating normalized mutual information using a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) based approach involves the calculation of the scaling-invariant k-NN radius. Calculation of the radius suffers from numerical overflow when the joint dimensionality of the data becomes high, typically in the range of several hundred dimensions. To address this issue, we propose a logarithmic transformation technique that improves the numerical stability of the radius calculation in high-dimensional spaces. By applying the proposed transformation during the calculation of the radius, numerical overflow is avoided, and precision is maintained. Proposed transformation is validated through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, demonstrating its ability to stabilize the calculation without compromizing the precision of the results.</description>

      <title>A Structural Text-Based Scaling Model for Analyzing Political Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling political actors based on their individual characteristics and behavior helps profiling and grouping them as well as understanding changes in the political landscape. In this paper we introduce the Structural Text-Based Scaling (STBS) model to infer ideological positions of speakers for latent topics from text data. We expand the usual Poisson factorization specification for topic modeling of text data and use flexible shrinkage priors to induce sparsity and enhance interpretability. We also incorporate speaker-specific covariates to assess their association with ideological positions. Applying STBS to U.S. Senate speeches from Congress session 114, we identify immigration and gun violence as the most polarizing topics between the two major parties in Congress. Additionally, we find that, in discussions about abortion, the gender of the speaker significantly influences their position, with female speakers focusing more on women's health. We also see that a speaker's region of origin influences their ideological position more than their religious affiliation.</description>

      <title>Bias correction of quadratic spectral estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three cardinal, statistically consistent, families of non-parametric estimators to the power spectral density of a time series are lag-window, multitaper and Welch estimators. However, when estimating power spectral densities from a finite sample each can be subject to non-ignorable bias. Astfalck et al. (2024) developed a method that offers significant bias reduction for finite samples for Welch's estimator, which this article extends to the larger family of quadratic estimators, thus offering similar theory for bias correction of lag-window and multitaper estimators as well as combinations thereof. Importantly, this theory may be used in conjunction with any and all tapers and lag-sequences designed for bias reduction, and so should be seen as an extension to valuable work in these fields, rather than a supplanting methodology. The order of computation is larger than O(n log n) typical in spectral analyses, but not insurmountable in practice. Simulation studies support the theory with comparisons across variations of quadratic estimators.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Generative Modeling with Variational Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating an individual's potential outcomes under counterfactual treatments is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, facial images) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to predict one's outcomes under counterfactual treatments, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in its high-dimensional observed outcome in addition to the covariates. Prior works using variational inference in counterfactual generative modeling have been focusing on neural adaptations and model variants within the conditional variational autoencoder formulation, which we argue is fundamentally ill-suited to the notion of counterfactual in causal inference. In this work, we present a novel variational Bayesian causal inference framework and its theoretical backings to properly handle counterfactual generative modeling tasks, through which we are able to conduct counterfactual supervision end-to-end during training without any counterfactual samples, and encourage latent disentanglement that aids the correct identification of causal effect in counterfactual generations. In experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of our framework compared to state-of-the-art models in counterfactual generative modeling on multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Regularized R\'enyi divergence minimization through Bregman proximal gradient algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04776v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the variational inference problem of minimizing a regularized R\'enyi divergence over an exponential family. We propose to solve this problem with a Bregman proximal gradient algorithm. We propose a sampling-based algorithm to cover the black-box setting, corresponding to a stochastic Bregman proximal gradient algorithm with biased gradient estimator. We show that the resulting algorithms can be seen as relaxed moment-matching algorithms with an additional proximal step. Using Bregman updates instead of Euclidean ones allows us to exploit the geometry of our approximate model. We prove strong convergence guarantees for both our deterministic and stochastic algorithms using this viewpoint, including monotonic decrease of the objective, convergence to a stationary point or to the minimizer, and geometric convergence rates. These new theoretical insights lead to a versatile, robust, and competitive method, as illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Evolving privacy: drift parameter estimation for discretely observed i.i.d. diffusion processes under LDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of estimating a parameter in the drift coefficient is addressed for $N$ discretely observed independent and identically distributed stochastic differential equations (SDEs). This is done considering additional constraints, wherein only public data can be published and used for inference. The concept of local differential privacy (LDP) is formally introduced for a system of stochastic differential equations. The objective is to estimate the drift parameter by proposing a contrast function based on a pseudo-likelihood approach. A suitably scaled Laplace noise is incorporated to meet the privacy requirements. Our key findings encompass the derivation of explicit conditions tied to the privacy level. Under these conditions, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the associated estimator. Notably, the convergence rate is intricately linked to the privacy level, and is some situations may be completely different from the case where privacy constraints are ignored. Our results hold true as the discretization step approaches zero and the number of processes $N$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Data depth functions for non-standard data by use of formal concept analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we introduce a notion of depth functions for data types that are not given in standard statistical data formats. We focus on data that cannot be represented by one specific data structure, such as normed vector spaces. This covers a wide range of different data types, which we refer to as non-standard data. Depth functions have been studied intensively for normed vector spaces. However, a discussion of depth functions for non-standard data is lacking. In this article, we address this gap by using formal concept analysis to obtain a unified data representation. Building on this representation, we then define depth functions for non-standard data. Furthermore, we provide a systematic basis by introducing structural properties using the data representation provided by formal concept analysis. Finally, we embed the generalised Tukey depth into our concept of data depth and analyse it using the introduced structural properties. Thus, this article presents the mathematical formalisation of centrality and outlyingness for non-standard data and increases the number of spaces in which centrality can be discussed. In particular, we provide a basis for defining further depth functions and statistical inference methods for non-standard data.</description>

      <title>Variance Reduction for the Independent Metropolis Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume that we would like to estimate the expected value of a function $F$ with respect to an intractable density $\pi$, which is specified up to some unknown normalising constant. We prove that if $\pi$ is close enough under KL divergence to another density $q$, an independent Metropolis sampler estimator that obtains samples from $\pi$ with proposal density $q$, enriched with a variance reduction computational strategy based on control variates, achieves smaller asymptotic variance than i.i.d.\ sampling from $\pi$. The control variates construction requires no extra computational effort but assumes that the expected value of $F$ under $q$ is analytically available. We illustrate this result by calculating the marginal likelihood in a linear regression model with prior-likelihood conflict and a non-conjugate prior. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive independent Metropolis algorithm that adapts the proposal density such that its KL divergence with the target is being reduced. We demonstrate its applicability in a Bayesian logistic and Gaussian process regression problems and we rigorously justify our asymptotic arguments under easily verifiable and essentially minimal conditions.</description>

      <title>On The MCMC Performance In Bernoulli Group Testing And The Random Max Set-Cover Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The group testing problem is a canonical inference task where one seeks to identify $k$ infected individuals out of a population of $n$ people, based on the outcomes of $m$ group tests. Of particular interest is the case of Bernoulli group testing (BGT), where each individual participates in each test independently and with a fixed probability. BGT is known to be an "information-theoretically" optimal design, as there exists a decoder that can identify with high probability as $n$ grows the infected individuals using $m^*=\log_2 \binom{n}{k}$ BGT tests, which is the minimum required number of tests among \emph{all} group testing designs.
  An important open question in the field is if a polynomial-time decoder exists for BGT which succeeds also with $m^*$ samples. In a recent paper (Iliopoulos, Zadik COLT '21) some evidence was presented (but no proof) that a simple low-temperature MCMC method could succeed. The evidence was based on a first-moment (or "annealed") analysis of the landscape, as well as simulations that show the MCMC success for $n \approx 1000s$.
  In this work, we prove that, despite the intriguing success in simulations for small $n$, the class of MCMC methods proposed in previous work for BGT with $m^*$ samples takes super-polynomial-in-$n$ time to identify the infected individuals, when $k=n^{\alpha}$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ small enough. Towards obtaining our results, we establish the tight max-satisfiability thresholds of the random $k$-set cover problem, a result of potentially independent interest in the study of random constraint satisfaction problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nair and Sathar (2020) introduced a new metric for uncertainty known as dynamic failure extropy, focusing on the analysis of past lifetimes. In this study, we extend this concept to a bivariate context, exploring various properties associated with the proposed bivariate measure. We show that bivariate conditional failure extropy can uniquely determine the joint distribution function. Additionally, we derive characterizations for certain bivariate lifetime models using this measure. A new stochastic ordering, based on bivariate conditional failure extropy, is also proposed, along with some established bounds. We further develop an estimator for the bivariate conditional failure extropy using a smoothed kernel and empirical approach. The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated through simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery under Latent Class Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07454v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An acyclic causal structure can be described with directed acyclic graph (DAG), where arrows indicate the possibility of direct causation. The task of learning this structure from data is known as "causal discovery." Diverse populations or changing environments can sometimes give rise to data that is heterogeneous in the following sense: each population/environment is a "source" which idiosyncratically determines the forms of those direct causal effects. From this perspective, the source is a latent common cause for every observed variable. While some methods for causal discovery are able to work around latent confounding in special cases, especially when only few observables are confounded, a global confounder is a difficult challenge. The only known ways to deal with latent global confounding involve assumptions that limit the structural equations and/or noise functions. We demonstrate that globally confounded causal structures can still be identifiable with arbitrary structural equations and noise functions, so long as the number of latent classes remains small relative to the size and sparsity of the underlying DAG.</description>

      <title>Benign Overfitting under Learning Rate Conditions for $\alpha$ Sub-exponential Input</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the phenomenon of benign overfitting in binary classification problems with heavy-tailed input distributions, extending the analysis of maximum margin classifiers to $\alpha$ sub-exponential distributions ($\alpha \in (0, 2]$). This generalizes previous work focused on sub-gaussian inputs. We provide generalization error bounds for linear classifiers trained using gradient descent on unregularized logistic loss in this heavy-tailed setting. Our results show that, under certain conditions on the dimensionality $p$ and the distance between the centers of the distributions, the misclassification error of the maximum margin classifier asymptotically approaches the noise level, the theoretical optimal value. Moreover, we derive an upper bound on the learning rate $\beta$ for benign overfitting to occur and show that as the tail heaviness of the input distribution $\alpha$ increases, the upper bound on the learning rate decreases. These results demonstrate that benign overfitting persists even in settings with heavier-tailed inputs than previously studied, contributing to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon in more realistic data environments.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-based Differentiable Structure Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing approaches to differentiable structure learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) rely on strong identifiability assumptions in order to guarantee that global minimizers of the acyclicity-constrained optimization problem identifies the true DAG. Moreover, it has been observed empirically that the optimizer may exploit undesirable artifacts in the loss function. We explain and remedy these issues by studying the behavior of differentiable acyclicity-constrained programs under general likelihoods with multiple global minimizers. By carefully regularizing the likelihood, it is possible to identify the sparsest model in the Markov equivalence class, even in the absence of an identifiable parametrization. We first study the Gaussian case in detail, showing how proper regularization of the likelihood defines a score that identifies the sparsest model. Assuming faithfulness, it also recovers the Markov equivalence class. These results are then generalized to general models and likelihoods, where the same claims hold. These theoretical results are validated empirically, showing how this can be done using standard gradient-based optimizers, thus paving the way for differentiable structure learning under general models and losses.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a novel connection between the metric entropy growth and the embeddability of function spaces into reproducing kernel Hilbert/Banach spaces. Metric entropy characterizes the information complexity of function spaces and has implications for their approximability and learnability. Classical results show that embedding a function space into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) implies a bound on its metric entropy growth. Surprisingly, we prove a \textbf{converse}: a bound on the metric entropy growth of a function space allows its embedding to a $L_p-$type Reproducing Kernel Banach Space (RKBS). This shows that the ${L}_p-$type RKBS provides a broad modeling framework for learnable function classes with controlled metric entropies. Our results shed new light on the power and limitations of kernel methods for learning complex function spaces.</description>
