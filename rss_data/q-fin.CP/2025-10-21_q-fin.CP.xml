      <title>FinFlowRL: An Imitation-Reinforcement Learning Framework for Adaptive Stochastic Control in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional stochastic control methods in finance struggle in real world markets due to their reliance on simplifying assumptions and stylized frameworks. Such methods typically perform well in specific, well defined environments but yield suboptimal results in changed, non stationary ones. We introduce FinFlowRL, a novel framework for financial optimal stochastic control. The framework pretrains an adaptive meta policy learning from multiple expert strategies, then finetunes through reinforcement learning in the noise space to optimize the generative process. By employing action chunking generating action sequences rather than single decisions, it addresses the non Markovian nature of markets. FinFlowRL consistently outperforms individually optimized experts across diverse market conditions.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Network for Cross-Market Portfolio Optimization in Financial Markets: A Neuromorphic Computing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-market portfolio optimization has become increasingly complex with the globalization of financial markets and the growth of high-frequency, multi-dimensional datasets. Traditional artificial neural networks, while effective in certain portfolio management tasks, often incur substantial computational overhead and lack the temporal processing capabilities required for large-scale, multi-market data. This study investigates the application of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for cross-market portfolio optimization, leveraging neuromorphic computing principles to process equity data from both the Indian (Nifty 500) and US (S&amp;P 500) markets. A five-year dataset comprising approximately 1,250 trading days of daily stock prices was systematically collected via the Yahoo Finance API. The proposed framework integrates Leaky Integrate-andFire neuron dynamics with adaptive thresholding, spike-timingdependent plasticity, and lateral inhibition to enable event-driven processing of financial time series. Dimensionality reduction is achieved through hierarchical clustering, while populationbased spike encoding and multiple decoding strategies support robust portfolio construction under realistic trading constraints, including cardinality limits, transaction costs, and adaptive risk aversion. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the SNN-based framework delivers superior risk-adjusted returns and reduced volatility compared to ANN benchmarks, while substantially improving computational efficiency. These findings highlight the promise of neuromorphic computation for scalable, efficient, and robust portfolio optimization across global financial markets.</description>

      <title>A three-step machine learning approach to predict market bubbles with financial news</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a three-step machine learning framework to predict bubbles in the S&amp;P 500 stock market by combining financial news sentiment with macroeconomic indicators. Building on traditional econometric approaches, the proposed approach predicts bubble formation by integrating textual and quantitative data sources. In the first step, bubble periods in the S&amp;P 500 index are identified using a right-tailed unit root test, a widely recognized real-time bubble detection method. The second step extracts sentiment features from large-scale financial news articles using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which capture investors' expectations and behavioral patterns. In the final step, ensemble learning methods are applied to predict bubble occurrences based on high sentiment-based and macroeconomic predictors. Model performance is evaluated through k-fold cross-validation and compared against benchmark machine learning algorithms. Empirical results indicate that the proposed three-step ensemble approach significantly improves predictive accuracy and robustness, providing valuable early warning insights for investors, regulators, and policymakers in mitigating systemic financial risks.</description>

      <title>Moments by Integrating the Moment-Generating Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23587v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for obtaining a wide variety of moments of any random variable with a well-defined moment-generating function (MGF). We derive new expressions for fractional moments and fractional absolute moments, both central and non-central moments. The expressions are relatively simple integrals that involve the MGF, but do not require its derivatives. We label the new method CMGF because it uses a complex extension of the MGF and can be used to obtain complex moments. We illustrate the new method with three applications where the MGF is available in closed-form, while the corresponding densities and the derivatives of the MGF are either unavailable or very difficult to obtain.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent for Sector Rotation in the Taiwan Stock Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV, QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely, the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum reinforcement learning in real-world finance.</description>
