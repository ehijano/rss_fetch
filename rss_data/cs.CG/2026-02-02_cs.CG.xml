      <title>Computing Dominating Sets in Disk Graphs with Centers in Convex Position</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane and a collection of disks centered at these points, the disk graph $G(P)$ has vertex set $P$, with an edge between two vertices if their corresponding disks intersect. We study the dominating set problem in $G(P)$ under the special case where the points of $P$ are in convex position. The problem is NP-hard in general disk graphs. Under the convex position assumption, however, we present the first polynomial-time algorithm for the problem. Specifically, we design an $O(k^2 n \log^2 n)$-time algorithm, where $k$ denotes the size of a minimum dominating set. For the weighted version, in which each disk has an associated weight and the goal is to compute a dominating set of minimum total weight, we obtain an $O(n^5 \log^2 n)$-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>On Small Pair Decompositions for Point Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\newcommand{\Re}{\mathbb{R}}$We study the minWSPD problem of computing the minimum-size well-separated pairs decomposition of a set of points, and show constant approximation algorithms in low-dimensional Euclidean space and doubling metrics. This problem is computationally hard already $\Re^2$, and is also hard to approximate.
  We also introduce a new pair decomposition, removing the requirement that the diameters of the parts should be small. Surprisingly, we show that in a general metric space, one can compute such a decomposition of size $O( \tfrac{n}{\varepsilon}\log n)$, which is dramatically smaller than the quadratic bound for WSPDs. In $\Re^d$, the bound improves to $O( d \tfrac{n}{\varepsilon}\log \tfrac{1}{\varepsilon } )$.</description>

      <title>Computing braids from approximate data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the theoretical and practical aspects of computing braids described by approximate descriptions of paths in the plane. Exact algorithms rely on the lexicographic ordering of the points in the plane, which is unstable under numerical uncertainty. Instead, we formalize an input model for approximate data, based on a separation predicate. It applies, for example, to paths obtained by tracking the roots of a parametrized polynomial with complex coefficients, thereby connecting certified path tracking outputs to exact braid computation.</description>

      <title>Greedy Routing Reachability Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's networks consist of many autonomous entities that follow their own objectives, i.e., smart devices or parts of large AI systems, that are interconnected. Given the size and complexity of most communication networks, each entity typically only has a local view and thus must rely on a local routing protocol for sending and forwarding packets. A common solution for this is greedy routing, where packets are locally forwarded to a neighbor in the network that is closer to the packet's destination.
  In this paper we investigate a game-theoretic model with autonomous agents that aim at forming a network where greedy routing is enabled. The agents are positioned in a metric space and each agent tries to establish as few links as possible, while maintaining that it can reach every other agent via greedy routing. Thus, this model captures how greedy routing networks are formed without any assumption on the distribution of the agents or the specific employed greedy routing protocol. Hence, it distills the essence that makes greedy routing work.
  We study two variants of the model: with directed edges or with undirected edges. For the former, we show that equilibria exist, have optimal total cost, and that in Euclidean metrics they can be found efficiently. However, even for this simple setting computing optimal strategies is NP-hard. For the much more challenging setting with undirected edges, we show for the realistic setting with agents in 2D Euclidean space that the price of anarchy is between 1.75 and 1.8 and for higher dimensions it is less than 2. Also, we show that best response dynamics may cycle, but that in Euclidean space almost optimal approximate equilibria can be computed in polynomial time. Moreover, for 2D Euclidean space, these approximate equilibria outperform the well-known Delaunay triangulation.</description>

      <title>Preprocessing Disks for Convex Hulls, Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03633</link>

Abstract: In the preprocessing framework one is given a set of regions that one is allowed to preprocess to create some auxiliary structure such that when a realization of these regions is given, consisting of one point per region, this auxiliary structure can be used to reconstruct some desired output geometric structure more efficiently than would have been possible without preprocessing. Prior work showed that a set of $n$ unit disks of constant ply can be preprocessed in $O(n\log n)$ time such that the convex hull of any realization can be reconstructed in $O(n)$ time. (This prior work focused on triangulations and the convex hull was a byproduct.) In this work we show for the first time that we can reconstruct the convex hull in time proportional to the number of \emph{unstable} disks, which may be sublinear, and that such a running time is the best possible. Here a disk is called \emph{stable} if the combinatorial structure of the convex hull does not depend on the location of its realized point.
  The main tool by which we achieve our results is by using a supersequence as the auxiliary structure constructed in the preprocessing phase, that is we output a supersequence of the disks such that the convex hull of any realization is a subsequence. One advantage of using a supersequence as the auxiliary structure is that it allows us to decouple the preprocessing phase from the reconstruction phase in a stronger sense than was possible in previous work, resulting in two separate algorithmic problems which may be independent interest. Finally, in the process of obtaining our results for convex hulls, we solve the corresponding problem of creating such supersequences for intervals in one dimension, yielding corresponding results for that case.</description>
