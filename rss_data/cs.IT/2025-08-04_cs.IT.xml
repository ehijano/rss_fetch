      <title>Improved Bounds on Access-Redundancy Tradeoffs in Quantized Linear Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the problem of computing quantized linear functions with only a few queries. Formally, given $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^k$, our goal is to encode $\mathbf{x}$ as $\mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, for $n &gt; k$, so that for any $\mathbf{w} \in A^k$, $\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}$ can be computed using at most $\ell$ queries to $\mathbf{c}$. Here, $A$ is some finite set; in this paper we focus on the case where $|A| = 2$.
  Prior work \emph{(Ramkumar, Raviv, and Tamo, Trans. IT, 2024)} has given constructions and established impossibility results for this problem. We give improved impossibility results, both for the general problem, and for the specific class of construction (block construction) presented in that work. The latter establishes that the block constructions of prior work are optimal within that class.
  We also initiate the study of \emph{approximate} recovery for this problem, where the goal is not to recover $\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}$ exactly but rather to approximate it up to a parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. We give several constructions, and give constructions for $\varepsilon = 0.1$ that outperform our impossibility result for exact schemes.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Flexible Intelligent Metasurfaces: From Model-Based Approaches to Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs) offer a new solution for wireless communications by introducing morphological degrees of freedom, dynamically morphing their three-dimensional shape to ensure multipath signals interfere constructively. However, realizing the desired performance gains in FIM systems is critically dependent on acquiring accurate channel state information across a continuous and high-dimensional deformation space. Therefore, this paper investigates this fundamental channel estimation problem for FIM assisted millimeter-wave communication systems. First, we develop model-based frameworks that structure the problem as either function approximation using interpolation and kernel methods or as a sparse signal recovery problem that leverages the inherent angular sparsity of millimeter-wave channels. To further advance the estimation capability beyond explicit assumptions in model-based channel estimation frameworks, we propose a deep learning-based framework using a Fourier neural operator (FNO). By parameterizing a global convolution operator in the Fourier domain, we design an efficient FNO architecture to learn the continuous operator that maps FIM shapes to channel responses with mesh-independent properties. Furthermore, we exploit a hierarchical FNO (H-FNO) architecture to efficiently capture the multi-scale features across a hierarchy of spatial resolutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed H-FNO significantly outperforms the model-based benchmarks in estimation accuracy and pilot efficiency. In particular, the interpretability analysis show that the proposed H-FNO learns an anisotropic spatial filter adapted to the physical geometry of FIM and is capable of accurately reconstructing the non-linear channel response across the continuous deformation space.</description>

      <title>Active IRS-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communications with Extended Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), in which an active IRS is deployed to assist the base station (BS) in serving multiple communication users (CUs) and simultaneously sensing an \emph{extended} target at the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) area of the BS. The active IRS has the capability of amplifying the reflected signals so as to overcome significant reflection path loss in NLoS communication and sensing. In particular, we derive the sensing Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target response matrix. Accordingly, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS and the reflective beamforming at the active IRS to minimize the sensing CRB, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements at the CUs, the transmit power budgets at the BS and active IRS, as well as the power amplification gain constraints at the active IRS. The CRB minimization problem is highly non-convex and thus difficult to solve in general. To address this challenge, we first focus on two specified conditions by considering the sensing-only scenario via ignoring the SINR constraints for communications, for which the closed-form optimal transmit beamforming is derived. Then, we propose two efficient alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms to obtain high-quality solutions for the general ISAC scenarios. Next, we analyze the inherent relationship between the power scaling at the BS and the amplification scaling at the active IRS. It is shown that the active IRS always amplifies the signal using the maximum amplification gain under practical system settings. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed AO-based algorithms and the benefits of active IRS-enabled ISAC compared to its passive IRSs counterparts.</description>

      <title>LO-Aware Adaptive Modulation for Rydberg Atomic Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic (RA) receivers represent a revolutionary quantum technology for wireless communications, offering unprecedented sensitivity beyond conventional radio frequency (RF) antennas. However, these receivers detect only signal amplitude, losing critical phase information. While reference signals generated by a local oscillator (LO) can assist in phase recovery, existing modulation schemes designed for conventional systems perform poorly with this quantum detection mechanism. This paper introduces a breakthrough LO-aware adaptive modulation (LOAM) scheme specifically developed for RA receivers that dynamically adapts to complex fading channel coefficients. LOAM maximizes the minimum amplitude difference between constellation points, ensuring optimal detection performance. The innovation employs an adaptive co-linear constellation architecture aligned with the combined phase of reference signal and channel coefficient. For strong reference signals, LOAM generates symmetric constellation points centered at origin; for weak signals, it adopts non-symmetric distributions. The paper mathematically derives the threshold governing these operational regimes. Simulation results reveal the transformative impact of LOAM, demonstrating performance gains exceeding 45 dB over conventional modulation schemes, including quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), phase-shift keying (PSK), and pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM).</description>

      <title>Towards a Measure Theory of Semantic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classic account of the quantification of semantic information is that of Bar-Hiller and Carnap. Their account proposes an inverse relation between the informativeness of a statement and its probability. However, their approach assigns the maximum informativeness to a contradiction: which Floridi refers to as the Bar-Hillel-Carnap paradox. He developed a novel theory founded on a distance metric and parabolic relation, designed to remove this paradox. Unfortunately is approach does not succeed in that aim.
  In this paper I critique Floridi's theory of strongly semantic information on its own terms and show where it succeeds and fails. I then present a new approach based on the unit circle (a relation that has been the basis of theories from basic trigonometry to quantum theory). This is used, by analogy with von Neumann's quantum probability to construct a measure space for informativeness that meets all the requirements stipulated by Floridi and removes the paradox. In addition, while contradictions and tautologies have zero informativeness, it is found that messages which are contradictory to each other are equally informative. The utility of this is explained by means of an example.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document provides the supplementary materials for the paper Closed-Form BER Analysis for Uplink NOMA with Dynamic SIC Decoding. The appendices present detailed mathematical derivations and proofs that support the analytical framework of the main paper. Specifically, we include: (i) cumulative distribution functions for ordered channel gains; (ii) probability density functions of normalized signal-plus-interference variances in NOMA dynamic SIC decoding; (iii) closed-form expressions for pairwise error probability (PEP) with two users; (iv) probability derivations for channel gain ordering in the two-UE case, specifically when UE 1 and UE 2 have the strongest or second strongest channel gains; (v) BER analysis for M-QAM modulation schemes including BPSK, 4QAM, 16QAM and 64QAM; (vi) PDF derivations for channel gains under various ordering conditions; and (vii) challenges of PDF derivations for real part of channel gain under various ordering condition. These mathematical foundations enable the closed-form BER analysis of uplink NOMA systems with dynamic SIC decoding under Rayleigh fading channels, supporting analytical expressions for various modulation schemes and system configurations.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Decentralized Secure Aggregation with Collusion Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings, where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users, each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Rate-Adaptive CSI Feedback for Wideband XL-MIMO Systems in the Near-Field Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is crucial for unlocking the substantial spectral efficiency gains of extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems in future 6G networks. However, the combination of near-field spherical wave propagation and frequency-dependent beam split effects in wideband scenarios poses significant challenges for CSI representation and compression. This paper proposes WideNLNet-CA, a rate-adaptive deep learning framework designed to enable efficient CSI feedback in wideband near-field XL-MIMO systems. WideNLNet-CA introduces a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture with multi-stage downsampling and upsampling, incorporating computationally efficient residual blocks to capture complex multi-scale channel features with reduced overhead. A novel compression ratio adaptive module with feature importance estimation is introduced to dynamically modulate feature selection based on target compression ratios, enabling flexible adaptation across a wide range of feedback rates using a single model. Evaluation results demonstrate that WideNLNet-CA consistently outperforms existing compressive sensing and deep learning-based works across various compression ratios and bandwidths, while maintaining fast inference and low model storage requirements.</description>

      <title>Clubs in projective spaces and three-weight rank-metric codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear sets over finite fields are central objects in finite geometry and coding theory, with deep connections to structures such as semifields, blocking sets, KM-arcs, and rank-metric codes. Among them, $i$-clubs, a class of linear sets where all but one point (which has weight $i$) have weight one, have been extensively studied in the projective line but remain poorly understood in higher-dimensional projective spaces. In this paper, we investigate the geometry and algebraic structure of $i$-clubs in projective spaces. We establish upper bounds on their rank by associating them with rank-metric codes and analyzing their parameters via MacWilliams identities. We also provide explicit constructions of $i$-clubs that attain the maximum rank for $i \geq m/2$, and we demonstrate the existence of non-equivalent constructions when $i \leq m-2$. The special case $i = m-1$ is fully classified. Furthermore, we explore the rich geometry of three-weight rank-metric codes, offering new constructions from clubs and partial classification results.</description>

      <title>Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many complex systems - be they financial, natural or social - are composed by units - such as stocks, neurons or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationships between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at providing an answer within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing. Briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph, by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not - and, in case, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, the structure of the negative subgraph being more prone to inter-subject variability than the complementary, positive subgraph. At the mesoscopic level, instead, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practice, low Earth orbit (LEO) and medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellite networks consist of multiple orbits which are populated with many satellites. A widely used spatial architecture for LEO or MEO satellites is the Walker constellation, where the longitudes of orbits are evenly spaced and the satellites are equally spaced along the orbits. In this paper, we develop a stochastic geometry model for the Walker constellations. This proposed model enables an analysis based on dynamical system theory, which allows one to address essential structural properties such as periodicity and ergodicity. It also enables a stochastic geometry analysis under which we derive the performance of downlink communications of a typical user at a given latitude, as a function of the key constellation parameters.</description>

      <title>Radio Map-Enabled 3D Trajectory and Communication Optimization for Low-Altitude Air-Ground Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-altitude economy includes the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving ground robots. This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</description>

      <title>SPLITZ: Certifiable Robustness via Split Lipschitz Randomized Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certifiable robustness gives the guarantee that small perturbations around an input to a classifier will not change the prediction. There are two approaches to provide certifiable robustness to adversarial examples: a) explicitly training classifiers with small Lipschitz constants, and b) Randomized smoothing, which adds random noise to the input to create a smooth classifier. We propose SPLITZ, a practical and novel approach which leverages the synergistic benefits of both the above ideas into a single framework. Our main idea is to split a classifier into two halves, constrain the Lipschitz constant of the first half, and smooth the second half via randomization. Motivation for SPLITZ comes from the observation that many standard deep networks exhibit heterogeneity in Lipschitz constants across layers. SPLITZ can exploit this heterogeneity while inheriting the scalability of randomized smoothing. We present a principled approach to train SPLITZ and provide theoretical analysis to derive certified robustness guarantees during inference. We present a comprehensive comparison of robustness-accuracy trade-offs and show that SPLITZ consistently improves on existing state-of-the-art approaches in the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. For instance, with $\ell_2$ norm perturbation budget of $\epsilon=1$, SPLITZ achieves $43.2\%$ top-1 test accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset compared to state-of-art top-1 test accuracy $39.8\%$.</description>

      <title>Weyl symmetry of the gradient-flow in information geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have revisited the gradient-flow in information geometry from the perspective of Weyl symmetry. The gradient-flow equations are derived from the proposed action which is invariant under the Weyl's gauge transformations. In Weyl integrable geometry, we have related Amari's $\alpha$-connections in IG to the Weyl invariant connection on the Riemannian manifold equipped with the scaled metric.</description>

      <title>Agentic Information Theory: Ergodicity and Intrinsic Semantics of Information Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop information theory for the temporal behavior of memoryful agents moving through complex -- structured, stochastic -- environments. We introduce and explore information processes -- stochastic processes produced by cognitive agents in real-time as they interact with and interpret incoming stimuli. We provide basic results on the ergodicity and semantics of the resulting time series of Shannon information measures that monitor an agent's adapting view of uncertainty and structural correlation in its environment.</description>

      <title>Cyclotomy, cyclotomic cosets and arithmetic properties of some families in $\frac{\mathbb{F}_l[x]}{\langle x^{p^sq^t}-1\rangle}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arithmetic properties of some families in $\frac{\mathbb{F}_l[x]}{\langle x^{p^sq^t}-1\rangle}$ are obtained by using the cyclotomic classes of order 2 with respect to $n=p^sq^t$, where $p\equiv3 \mathrm{mod} 4$, $\gcd(\phi(p^s),\phi(q^t))=2$, $l$ is a primitive root modulo $q^t$ and $\mathrm{ord}_{p^s}(l)=\phi(p^s)/2$. The form of these cyclotomic classes enables us to further generalize the results obtained in \cite{ref1}. The explicit expressions of primitive idempotents of minimal ideals in $\frac{\mathbb{F}_l[x]}{\langle x^{p^sq^t}-1\rangle}$ are also obtained.</description>
