      <title>Second harmonic generation due to spatial structure of radiation beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that spatially structured radiation generates second harmonic in a two-dimensional system even if the system is homogeneous and isotropic. The effect originates from non-locality of electric response to structured electromagnetic field. We develop an analytical theory of such a second harmonic generation in conducting two-dimensional systems. For the general type of structured radiation, we calculate the emerging electric currents at the double frequency and the emitted second harmonic radiation. The theory applied to twisted light reveals that the angular momentum of light doubles in the second harmonic emission. Our results pave the way for second harmonic generation and structuring in two-dimensional materials beyond the constraints imposed by crystal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Enantiomer-Selective Magnetoresistance in Chiral Gold Nanocrystals by Magnetic Control of Surface Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral nanomaterials offer intriguing possibilities for novel electronic and chemical applications. Here, we report the discovery of an enantiomer-selective magnetoresistance effect in chiral gold nanocrystals. Based on precise control of nanocrystal chiral morphology using amino acid-directed synthesis, we demonstrate that an external magnetic field can dramatically modulate resistance in an enantiomer-specific manner. For a given enantiomer, a magnetic field in one direction alters the resistance by over an order of magnitude, while the opposite field direction leaves it unchanged. This asymmetric response reverses for the opposite enantiomer. We attribute this phenomenon to a novel chirality-driven charge trapping mechanism, where the interplay between the chiral nanocrystal morphology and the magnetic field selectively modifies the surface potential. The magnitude and sign of the magnetoresistance can be further tuned by the surface chemistry of the nanocrystal, as demonstrated through sulfide treatment. Our findings reveal a new form of chirality-dependent magnetoresistance, distinct from previously known effects such as chirality-induced spin selectivity and electric magnetochiral anisotropy. The ability to remotely control surface potentials of chiral nanostructures using magnetic fields could enable novel approaches in catalysis, drug delivery, and nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of ~ 10T, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved but can be even enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</description>

      <title>Dynamic sweet spot of driven flopping-mode spin qubits in planar quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots with confined electron or hole spins show promise for quantum information processing as they allow for efficient electric field-driven qubit manipulation. However, their susceptibility to electric noise poses a challenge that may hinder the effectiveness of these qubits. Here, we explore the impact of electric noise on a planar double quantum dot (DQD) spin qubit under the influence of AC gates applied to the dot levels, focusing on the flopping-mode spin qubit with spin-orbit interaction. We employ a rotating wave approximation within a time-dependent effective Hamiltonian to derive analytic expressions for the Rabi frequency of spin qubit oscillations with a single electron or hole in a DQD. We find that driving the qubit off-resonantly effectively mitigates the influence of charge noise, leading to a manifestation of a dynamic sweet spot. The proposed mode of operation notably improves the fidelity of quantum gates, particularly within specific ranges of drive parameters and detuning during qubit manipulation. Furthermore, our study unveils the potential of inducing a second-order dynamic sweet spot, a phenomenon tunable by drive and DQD parameters. Understanding the importance of driving qubits off-resonantly is essential for developing high-coherence planar DQD spin qubits, both for electrons in silicon and holes in germanium.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Controlled Surface Localization of Spin-Wave Ferromagnetic Resonance Modes in 3D Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the current understanding and use of magnonics beyond conventional planar systems, we demonstrate surface localization of spin-wave ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) modes by designing complex three-dimensional nanostructures. Using micromagnetic simulations, we systematically investigate woodpile-like scaffolds and gyroids - periodic chiral entities characterized by their triple junctions. The study highlights the critical role of demagnetizing fields and exchange energy in determining the FMR responses of 3D nanosystems, especially the strongly asymmetric distribution of the spin-wave mode over the system height. Importantly, the top-bottom dynamic switching of the surface mode localization across the structures in response to changes in magnetic field orientation provides a new method for controlling magnetization dynamics. The results demonstrate the critical role of the geometric features in dictating the dynamic magnetic behavior of three-dimensional nanostructures, paving the way for both experimental exploration and practical advances in 3D magnonics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Hybrid Ferromagnetic Metal-Ferrimagnetic Insulator Spin-Hall Nano-Oscillators: A Micromagnetic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-Hall nano-oscillators (SHNO) are nanoscale spintronic devices that generate high-frequency (GHz) microwave signals useful for various applications such as neuromorphic computing and creating Ising systems. Recent research demonstrated that hybrid SHNOs consisting of a ferromagnetic metal (permalloy) and lithium aluminum ferrite (LAFO), a ferrimagnetic insulator, thin films have advantages in having lower auto-oscillation threshold currents ($I_{\text{th}}$) and generating larger microwave output power, making this hybrid structure an attractive candidate for spintronic applications. It is essential to understand how the tunable material properties of LAFO, e.g., its thickness, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ($K_u$), and saturation magnetization ($M_s$), affect magnetic dynamics in hybrid SHNOs. We investigate the change in $I_{\text{th}}$ and the output power of the device as the LAFO parameters vary. We find the $I_{\text{th}}$ does not depend strongly on these parameters, but the output power has a highly nonlinear dependence on $M_s$ and $K_u$. We further investigate the nature of the excited spin-wave modes as a function of $K_u$ and determine a critical value of $K_u$ above which propagating spin-waves are excited. Our simulation results provide a roadmap for designing hybrid SHNOs to achieve targeted spin excitation characteristics.</description>

      <title>Activated Spin Resonance with THz Attempt Frequency in SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relaxation techniques are used commonly to characterize non-equilibrium phenomena such as freezing in spin glass and domain wall motion in ferromagnets. Here we investigate the unusual re-entrant ferromagnetic state in SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$ using ac-susceptibility in the frequency range 0.1 Hz - 1 kHz. Surprisingly, we find Debye-like relaxation with an energy barrier $E_B \approx 840$ $k_B$ and attempt frequencies in the THz range. We discuss the origin of this resonance and, in particular, the implication for single-spin resonance of Sm spins.</description>

      <title>Correlation versus Dissipation in a Non-Hermitian Anderson Impurity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction activity of nitrogen deficient $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study investigates the catalytic performance of a $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ quantum dot aimed at enhancing electrochemical water splitting, using the first-principles density functional theory. The size of the considered quantum dot lies within the range reported experimentally (2nm - 4nm) [Zhou et al. ACS Nano 9, 12480 (2015)]. The nitrogen vacancies are created in the considered $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ structure to simulate the realistic scenario, as the presence of nitrogen and carbon defects are reported in the synthesized $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ quantum dots. First, the structural and vibrational properties are computed to ensure the stability of the nitrogen deficient $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ quantum dots, and subsequently, their electronic and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties are investigated. The calculate HER parameters, i.e., adsorption energies, Gibbs free energies, and overpotentials demonstrate that the considered $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ quantum dot with nitrogen vacancies can be used as a moderately effective electrocatalyst for HER performance. We also considered the quantum dot to be dissolved in water and ethanol, and find that the overpotential gets drastically reduced to 16 mV for the alcohol dissolved quantum dot, while some significant reduction is seen for the aqueous solution also. As a result, this study suggests that the nitrogen-deficient $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ quantum dots dissolved in ethanol are excellent candidates for catalysis aimed at sustainable hydrogen production via electrochemical water splitting.</description>

      <title>Microwave-optics entanglement via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave-optics entanglement plays a crucial role in building hybrid quantum networks with quantum nodes working in the microwave and optical frequency bands. However, there are limited efficient ways to produce such entanglement due to the large frequency mismatch between the two regimes. Here, we present a new mechanism to prepare microwave-optics entanglement based on a hybrid system of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, i.e., a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere holds a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, while the silica sphere supports an optical whispering-gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via an optomechanical interaction. The two mechanical modes are close in frequency and directly coupled via physical contact of the two microspheres. We show that by simultaneously activating the magnomechanical (optomechanical) Stokes (anti-Stokes) scattering, stationary entanglement can be established between the magnon and optical modes via mechanics-mechanics coupling. This leads to stationary microwave-optics entanglement by further coupling the YIG sphere to a microwave cavity and utilizing the magnon-microwave state swapping. Our protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising new approach for preparing microwave-optics entanglement, which finds unique applications in hybrid quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced delocalization and reentrance in a Chern-Hopf insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chern-Hopf insulator is an unconventional three-dimensional topological insulator with a bulk gap and gapless boundary states without protection from global discrete symmetries. This study investigates its fate in the presence of disorder. We find it stable up to moderate disorder by analyzing the surface states and the zero energy bulk density of states using large-scale numerical simulation and the self-consistent Born approximation. The disordered Chern-Hopf insulator shows reentrant behavior: the disorder initially enhances the topological phase before driving it across an insulator-diffusive metal transition. We examine the associated critical exponents via finite-size scaling of the bulk density of states, participation entropy, and two-terminal conductance. We estimate the correlation length exponent $\nu\simeq 1.0(1)$, consistent with the clean two-dimensional Chern universality and distinct from the integer quantum Hall exponent.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Cooper Pairing via Random Matrix Phonons in Superconducting Grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is rich experimental evidence that granular superconductors and superconducting films often exhibit a higher transition temperature, $T_{c}$, than that in bulk samples of the same material. This paper suggests that this enhancement hinges on random matrix phonons mediating Cooper pairing more efficiently than bulk phonons. We develop the Eliashberg theory of superconductivity in chaotic grains, calculate the random phonon spectrum and solve the Eliashberg equations numerically. Self-averaging of the effective electron-phonon coupling constant is noted, which allows us to fit the numerical data with analytical results based on a generalization of the Berry conjecture. The key insight is that the phonon density of states, and hence $T_{c}$, shows an enhancement proportional to the ratio of the perimeter and area of the grain - the Weyl law. We benchmark our results for aluminum films, and find an enhancement of $T_{c}$ of about $10\%$ for a randomly-generated shape. A larger enhancement of $T_{c}$ is readily possible by optimizing grain geometries. We conclude by noticing that mesoscopic shape fluctuations in realistic granular structures should give rise to a further enhancement of global $T_{c}$ due to the formation of a percolating Josephson network.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced topological quantum phase transitions in multi-gap Euler semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of disorder in systems having a non-trivial Euler class. As these recently proposed multi-gap topological phases come about by braiding non-Abelian charged band nodes residing between different bands to induce stable pairs within isolated band subspaces, novel properties may be expected. Namely, a~modified stability and critical phases under the unbraiding to metals can arise, when the disorder preserves the underlying $C_2\cal{T}$ or $\cal{P}\cal{T}$ symmetry on average. Employing elaborate numerical computations, we verify the robustness of associated topology by evaluating the changes in the average densities of states and conductivities for different types of disorders. Upon performing a scaling analysis around the corresponding quantum critical points we retrieve a universality for the localization length exponent of $\nu = 1.4 \pm 0.1$ for Euler-protected phases, relating to two-dimensional percolation models. We generically find that quenched disorder drives Euler semimetals into critical metallic phases. Finally, we show that magnetic disorder can also induce topological transitions to quantum anomalous Hall plaquettes with local Chern numbers determined by the initial value of the Euler invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe theoretically the spin Nernst effect for electrons tunneling to a quantum dot from a quantum wire with the heat flowing along it. Such a tunneling spin Nernst effect is shown to take place due to the spin-dependent electron tunneling produced by the spin-orbit coupling. The Coulomb interaction of electrons in the quantum dot is taken into account using nonequilibrium Green's functions and is shown to increase significantly the accumulated spin in a single quantum dot. The largest possible degree of spin polarization is discussed.</description>

      <title>Spin conductances and magnetization production in chiral molecular junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by experimental reports on chirality induced spin selectivity, we investigate a minimal model that allows us to calculate the charge and spin conductances through helical molecules analytically. The spin-orbit interaction is assumed to be non-vanishing on the molecule and negligible in the reservoirs (leads). The band-structure of the molecule features four helical modes with spin-momentum locking that are analogous of edge-currents in the quantum spin Hall effect. While charge is conserved and therefore the charge current is independent of where it is measured, - reservoirs or molecule, - our detailed calculations reveal that the spin currents in the left and right lead are equal in magnitudes but with opposite signs (in linear response).
  We predict that transport currents flowing through helical molecules are accompanied by a spin accumulation in the contact region with the same magnetization direction for source and drain. Further, we predict that the spin-conductance can be extracted directly from measuring the (quasi-static) spin accumulation - rather than the spin current itself, which is very challenging to obtain experimentally.</description>

Abstract: Doped van der Waals heterostructures host layer-hybridized trions, i.e. charged excitons with layer-delocalized constituents holding promise for highly controllable optoelectronics. Combining a microscopic theory with photoluminescence (PL) experiments, we demonstrate the electrical tunability of the trion energy landscape in naturally stacked WSe$_2$ bilayers. We show that an out-of-plane electric field modifies the energetic ordering of the lowest lying trion states, which consist of layer-hybridized $\Lambda$-point electrons and layer-localized K-point holes. At small fields, intralayer-like trions yield distinct PL signatures in opposite doping regimes characterized by weak Stark shifts in both cases. Above a doping-asymmetric critical field, interlayer-like species are energetically favored and produce PL peaks with a pronounced Stark red-shift and a counter-intuitively large intensity arising from efficient phonon-assisted recombination. Our work presents an important step forward in the microscopic understanding of layer-hybridized trions in van der Waals heterostructures and paves the way towards optoelectronic applications based on electrically controllable atomically-thin semiconductors.</description>

Abstract: Our proposed spin valve prototype showcases a sophisticated design featuring a two-dimensional graphene bilayer positioned between layers of ${CrBr}_3$ ferromagnetic insulators. In this model, proximity coupling plays a pivotal role, influencing the magnetization orientations of the graphene layers and significantly impacting the \textit{in-plane} conductivity of the ${CrBr}_3$ layers. In this present work, we position the graphene bilayer between two layers of the ferromagnetic insulator ${CrBr}_3$ to establish this configuration. Using density functional theory, we conduct detailed computations to analyze the electronic structure of this sandwiched system. Our findings reveal a notable finite gap at specific \textit{k}-points, particularly evident in the antiparallel configuration of the magnetizations. This finding represents a significant advancement in spintronics, underscoring the potential of our spin valve prototype to drive innovation in electronic device technologies.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the helical atomic chains occurring in elemental selenium and tellurium. We postulate a realistic model that includes spin-orbit interaction and show this to be topologically non-trivial, with a topological invariant protected by a crystalline symmetry. We describe the end-states, which are orbitally polarized, with an orbital density modulation strongly peaked at the edge. Furthermore, we propose a simplified model that decomposes into three orbital chains, allowing us to define a topological invariant protected by a crystalline symmetry. We contrast this result with recent observations made for the orbital Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model containing a $p$-orbital zigzag chain.</description>

      <title>The optical absorption in indirect semiconductor to semimetal PtSe2 arises from direct transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\rm{PtSe_2}$ is a van der Waals material transitioning from an indirect bandgap semiconductor to a semimetal with increasing thickness. Its absorption threshold has been conjectured to originate from interband indirect transitions. By quantitative comparison between broadband ($0.8 - 3.0\,\rm{eV}$) optical absorption of high-quality exfoliated crystals and DFT ab-initio simulations, we prove instead that the optical absorption arises only from direct transitions. This understanding allows us to shed light on the semiconductor to semimetal transition and to explore the effect of stacking and excitons on the optical absorption.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and conductivity in functionalized multilayer black phosphorene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phosphorene and its components are highly reactive to oxygen when exposed to ambient conditions due to the presence of lone pairs of electrons on phosphorus atoms. Functionalization serves as a solution to prevent the chemical degradation of these materials. In this paper, we investigate the impact of relatively strong covalent or noncovalent functionalization on phosphorene (monolayer black phosphorus (BP)), few-layer BP, and bulk BP. We use an effective tight-binding Hamiltonian that corresponds to one orbital per site, wherein covalent functionalization is simulated by atomic vacancies, and noncovalent functionalization is simulated by Anderson disorder. We demonstrate that these two types of functionalization act differently on the electronic structure and quantum diffusion, particularly affecting the gap and mobility characteristics, especially with a high degree of functionalization. However, we also show that the mobility gap is not significantly modified by the two types of defect. We also analyze the electron-hole asymmetry that is more important for multilayer and bulk BP.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy and its fluctuations across a dissipative quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy - the maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits - within a parameter regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase transition occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing, and discharging the two-qubit system, interpreted as the working principle of an open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition on ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we construct an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the ground state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state during storage. Using advanced numerical techniques based on matrix product state representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath approximately double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time we observe oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which undergo significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence. Furthermore, we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired ansatz, enabling continuous work extraction (local ergotropy never reaches zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work extraction, leveraging decoherence-free states and phase transitions. Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between ergotropy and quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Training a multilayer dynamical spintronic network with standard machine learning tools to perform time series classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to process time-series at low energy cost is critical for many applications. Recurrent neural network, which can perform such tasks, are computationally expensive when implementing in software on conventional computers. Here we propose to implement a recurrent neural network in hardware using spintronic oscillators as dynamical neurons. Using numerical simulations, we build a multi-layer network and demonstrate that we can use backpropagation through time (BPTT) and standard machine learning tools to train this network. Leveraging the transient dynamics of the spintronic oscillators, we solve the sequential digits classification task with $89.83\pm2.91~\%$ accuracy, as good as the equivalent software network. We devise guidelines on how to choose the time constant of the oscillators as well as hyper-parameters of the network to adapt to different input time scales.</description>
