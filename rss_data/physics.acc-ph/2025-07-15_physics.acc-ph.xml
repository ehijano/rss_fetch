      <title>Characteristics of dark current from an S-band rf gun with exchangeable photocathode system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field emission or dark current from RF electron guns is problematic for accelerators for several reasons, and can be more difficult to predict, measure and understand, compared to the main beam. The work presented here is a study of the dark current emitted from the CLARA 3GHz 2.5 cell electron gun with exchangeable photocathode, which is a type of gun used for single pass high quality low emittance beams for uses such as Free Electron Lasers. The main purpose of these studies was to identify sources of dark current emission within the gun, by examining the dark current distribution and patterns on scintillating screens. It is shown that the features of the patterns can be reproduced qualitatively, and to some extent quantitatively, by finite element simulations. Thus, certain surfaces within the gun and cathode apparatus which contribute most significantly to problematic dark current can be identified, and further development and preparation of the guns and their cathodes can be informed to minimise dark current.</description>

      <title>Excitation of Giant Surface Waves During Laser Wake Field Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have detected the presence of very high intensity surface waves that are excited during plasma waveguided laser wakefield acceleration. Wakefield acceleration can be enchanced by the introduction of an ``all optical" plasma waveguide that confines and guides a laser pulse at the optimal intensity over long distances, producing quasimonoenergetic multi-GeV electron bunches. However strong pulses of radio frequency radiation (RF) are also produced, and particle in cell simulations show why: a continuous stream of multi-MeV electrons are also ejected radially from the plasma due to nonlinear wave breaking, and these excite and copropagate coherently with a giant cylindrical Sommerfeld surface wave. Laboratory measurements, simulations, and analytic approximations all converge on a 20 J laser pulse exciting a 1 Joule, 400 GW broadband THz surface wave, with a peak electric field strength of 35 GV/m.</description>
