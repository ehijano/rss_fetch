      <title>Parity of the coefficients of certain eta-quotients, III: The case of pure eta-powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue a program of investigating the parity of the coefficients of eta-quotients, with the goal of elucidating the parity of the partition function. In this paper, we consider positive integer powers $t$ of the Dedekind eta-function. Previous work and conjectures suggest that arithmetic progressions in which the Fourier coefficients of these functions are even should be numerous. We explicitly identify infinite classes of such progressions modulo prime squares for several values of $t$, and we offer two broad conjectures concerning their existence in general.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic characterization of the affine three space in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an algebraic characterization of the affine $3$-space over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic. We use this characterization to reformulate the following question. Let $$A=k[X, Y, Z, T]/(XY+Z^{p^e}+T+T^{sp})$$ where $p^e\nmid sp$, $sp\nmid p^e$, $e, s\geq 1$ and $k$ is an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic $p$. Is $A= k^{[3]}$? We prove some results on ML and ML$^*$ invariants and use them to prove a special case of the strong cancellation of $k^{[2]}$.</description>

      <title>On the normally torsion-freeness of square-free monomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $I\subset R=K[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ be a square-free monomial ideal, $\mathfrak{q}$ be a prime monomial ideal in $R$, $h$ be a square-free monomial in $R$ with $\mathrm{supp}(h) \cap (\mathrm{supp}(\mathfrak{q}) \cup \mathrm{supp}(I))=\emptyset$, and $L:=I\cap (\mathfrak{q}, h)$. In this paper, we first focus on the associated primes of powers of $L$ and explore the normally torsion-freeness of $L$. We also give an application on a comb inatorial result. Next, we study when a square-free monomial ideal is minimally not normally torsion-free. Particularly, we introduce a class of square-free monomial ideals, which are minimally not normally torsion-free.</description>

      <title>Resolutions as directed colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general principle suggests that "anything flat is a directed colimit of countably presentable flats". In this paper, we consider resolutions and coresolutions of modules over a countably coherent ring $R$ (e.g., any coherent ring or any countably Noetherian ring). We show that any $R$-module of flat dimension $n$ is a directed colimit of countably presentable $R$-modules of flat dimension at most $n$, and any flatly coresolved $R$-module is a directed colimit of countably presentable flatly coresolved $R$-modules. If $R$ is a countably coherent ring with a dualizing complex, then any F-totally acyclic complex of flat $R$-modules is a directed colimit of F-totally acyclic complexes of countably presentable flat $R$-modules. The proofs are applications of an even more general category-theoretic principle going back to an unpublished 1977 preprint of Ulmer. Our proof of the assertion that every Gorenstein-flat module over a countably coherent ring is a directed colimit of countably presentable Gorenstein-flat modules uses a different technique, based on results of Saroch and Stovicek. We also discuss totally acyclic complexes of injectives and Gorenstein-injective modules, obtaining various cardinality estimates for the accessibility rank under various assumptions.</description>

      <title>K-polynomials of multiplicity-free varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the twisted $K$-polynomial of multiplicity-free varieties in a multiprojective setting. More precisely, for multiplicity-free varieties, we show that the support of the twisted $K$-polynomial is a generalized polymatroid. As applications, we show that the support of the M\"obius function of a linear polymatroid is a generalized polymatroid, and we settle a conjecture of Monical, Tokcan and Yong regarding Grothendieck polynomials for the case of zero-one Schubert polynomials.</description>

      <title>On Abel's Problem about Logarithmic Integrals in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients over a field $K$ of positive characteristic $p$ with local exponents in the prime field have a basis of solutions in the differential extension $\mathcal{R}_p=K(z_1, z_2, \ldots)(\!( x)\!)$ of $K(x)$, where $x'=1, z_1'=1/x$ and $z_i'=z_{i-1}'/z_{i-1}$. For differential equations of order $1$ it is shown that there exists a solution $y$ whose projections $y\vert_{z_{i+1}=z_{i+2}=\cdots=0}$ are algebraic over the field of rational functions $K(x, z_1, \ldots, z_{i})$ for all $i$. This can be seen as a characteristic $p$ analogue of Abel's problem about the algebraicity of logarithmic integrals. Further, the existence of infinite product representations of these solutions is shown. As a main tool $p^i$-curvatures are introduced, generalizing the notion of the $p$-curvature.</description>

      <title>Faithlessness in Gaussian graphical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implication problem for conditional independence (CI) asks whether the fact that a probability distribution obeys a given finite set of CI relations implies that a further CI statement also holds in this distribution. This problem has a long and fascinating history, cumulating in positive results about implications now known as the semigraphoid axioms as well as impossibility results about a general finite characterization of CI implications. Motivated by violation of faithfulness assumptions in causal discovery, we study the implication problem in the special setting where the CI relations are obtained from a directed acyclic graphical (DAG) model along with one additional CI statement. Focusing on the Gaussian case, we give a complete characterization of when such an implication is graphical by using algebraic techniques. Moreover, prompted by the relevance of strong faithfulness in statistical guarantees for causal discovery algorithms, we give a graphical solution for an approximate CI implication problem, in which we ask whether small values of one additional partial correlation entail small values for yet a further partial correlation.</description>
