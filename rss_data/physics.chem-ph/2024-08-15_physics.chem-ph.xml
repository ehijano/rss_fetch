      <title>Non-iterative triples for transcorrelated coupled cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implementation of a perturbative triples correction for coupled cluster including single and double excitations based on the transcorrelated Hamiltonian. Transcorrelation introduces explicit electron correlation in the electronic Hamiltonian through similarity transformation with a correlation factor. Due to this transformation, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian includes up to three-body couplings and becomes non-hermitian. Since conventional coupled cluster is solved by projection, it is well suited to harbor non-hermitian Hamiltonians. The arising three-body operator, however, creates a huge memory bottleneck and increases the runtime scaling of the coupled cluster equations. As it has been shown that the three-body operator can be approximated, by expressing the Hamiltonian in the normal-ordered form, we investigate this approximation for the perturbative triples correction. Results are compared with code-generation based transcorrelated coupled cluster up to quadruple excitations.</description>

      <title>Imaging coupled vibrational, rotational, and electronic wave packet dynamics in a triatomic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics triggered by interaction with light often involve the excitation of several electronic, vibrational, and rotational states. Characterizing the resulting coupled electronic and nuclear wave packet motion represents a severe challenge, even for small polyatomic systems. In this Letter, we demonstrate how the interplay between vibrational, rotational, and electronic degrees of freedom governs the evolution of molecular wave packets in the low-lying states of strong-field-ionized sulfur dioxide. Using time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) in combination with quantum mechanical wave packet simulations, we directly map bending vibrations of the molecule, show how the vibrational wave packet is influenced by molecular alignment, and elucidate the role of the coupling between the two lowest electronic states of the cation. A conical intersection between these states couples the bending and asymmetric stretching coordinates, which is clearly reflected in the correlated fragment momenta. Our results suggest that multi-coincident CEI represents an efficient experimental tool for characterizing coupled electronic and nuclear motion in polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Hessian QM9: A quantum chemistry database of molecular Hessians in implicit solvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant challenge in computational chemistry is developing approximations that accelerate \emph{ab initio} methods while preserving accuracy. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as a promising solution for constructing atomistic potentials that can be transferred across different molecular and crystalline systems. Most MLIPs are trained only on energies and forces in vacuum, while an improved description of the potential energy surface could be achieved by including the curvature of the potential energy surface. We present Hessian QM9, the first database of equilibrium configurations and numerical Hessian matrices, consisting of 41,645 molecules from the QM9 dataset at the $\omega$B97x/6-31G* level. Molecular Hessians were calculated in vacuum, as well as water, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene using an implicit solvation model. To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we show that incorporating second derivatives of the potential energy surface into the loss function of a MLIP significantly improves the prediction of vibrational frequencies in all solvent environments, thus making this dataset extremely useful for studying organic molecules in realistic solvent environments for experimental characterization.</description>

      <title>Prediction of NMR Parameters and geometry in 133Cs-containing compounds using Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need to immobilize low-level nuclear waste, in particular 137Cs-bearing waste, has led to a growing interest in geopolymer-based waste matrices, in addition to optimization attempts of cement matrix compositions for this specific application. Although the overall phase composition and structure of these matrices are well characterized, the binding sites of Cs in these materials have not been clearly identified. Recent studies have suggested that combining the sensitivity of solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) to the local atomic structure with other structural techniques provides insights into the mode of Cs binding and release. Density Functional Theory (DFT) can provide the connection between spectroscopic parameters and geometric properties. However, the reliability of DFT results strongly relies on the choice of a suitable exchange-correlation functional, which for 133Cs, the NMR surrogate for such studies, is not well-established. In this work we benchmark various functionals against their performance in predicting the geometry of various simple Cs compounds, their NMR quadrupolar coupling constants, and their chemical shift values. The results show rev-vdW-DF2 to be a leading, though not a flawless, candidate for these systems, and apparently for additional classes of Cs-containing systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Composite Infrared Spectroscopy: Combining the Doubly-Harmonic Approximation with Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational spectroscopy is a cornerstone technique for molecular characterization and offers an ideal target for the computational investigation of molecular materials. Building on previous comprehensive assessments of efficient methods for infrared (IR) spectroscopy, this study investigates the predictive accuracy and computational efficiency of gas-phase IR spectra calculations, accessible through a combination of modern semiempirical quantum mechanical and transferable machine learning potentials. A composite approach for IR spectra prediction based on the doubly-harmonic approximation, utilizing harmonic vibrational frequencies in combination squared derivatives of the molecular dipole moment, is employed. This approach allows for methodical flexibility in the calculation of IR intensities from molecular dipoles and the corresponding vibrational modes. Various methods are systematically tested to suggest a suitable protocol with an emphasis on computational efficiency. Among these methods, semiempirical extended tight-binding (xTB) models, classical charge equilibrium models, and machine learning potentials trained for dipole moment prediction are assessed across a diverse dataset of organic molecules. We particularly focus on the recently reported machine learning potential MACE-OFF23 to address the accuracy limitations of conventional low-cost quantum mechanical and force-field methods. This study aims to establish a standard for the efficient computational prediction of IR spectra, facilitating the rapid and reliable identification of unknown compounds and advancing automated analytical workflows in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Accurate and efficient structure elucidation from routine one-dimensional NMR spectra using multitask machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid determination of molecular structures can greatly accelerate workflows across many chemical disciplines. However, elucidating structure using only one-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra, the most readily accessible data, remains an extremely challenging problem because of the combinatorial explosion of the number of possible molecules as the number of constituent atoms is increased. Here, we introduce a multitask machine learning framework that predicts the molecular structure (formula and connectivity) of an unknown compound solely based on its 1D 1H and/or 13C NMR spectra. First, we show how a transformer architecture can be constructed to efficiently solve the task, traditionally performed by chemists, of assembling large numbers of molecular fragments into molecular structures. Integrating this capability with a convolutional neural network (CNN), we build an end-to-end model for predicting structure from spectra that is fast and accurate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on molecules with up to 19 heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms, a size for which there are trillions of possible structures. Without relying on any prior chemical knowledge such as the molecular formula, we show that our approach predicts the exact molecule 69.6% of the time within the first 15 predictions, reducing the search space by up to 11 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Effect of hydrogen on the local chemical bonding states and structure of amorphous alumina by atomistic and electrostatic modeling of Auger parameter shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study discloses the effect of hydrogen impurities on the local chemical bonding states and structure of amorphous alumina films by predicting measured Auger parameter shifts using a combination of atomistic and electrostatic modeling. Different amorphous alumina polymorphs with variable H-content and density, as grown by atomic layer deposition, were successfully modeled using a universal machine learning interatomic potential. The annealing of highly defective crystalline hydroxide structures with experimental H-contents at the corresponding atomic layer deposition temperatures led to excellent agreement between theory and experiment in the density and structure of the resulting amorphous alumina polymorphs. The measured Auger parameter shifts of Al cations in such polymorphs were accurately predicted with respect to the H content by assuming that all H atoms are present in the form of hydroxyl ligands in the randomly interconnected 4-fold, 5-fold, and 6-fold nearest-coordination spheres of Al. As revealed by a combination of atomistic and electrostatic modeling, the measured Auger shifts with an increase in the H content and an accompanying decrease in the oxide density depend on the complex correlations between local coordination, bond lengths, bond angles, and ligand type(s) around the core-ionized atoms. Moreover, cryogenic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is suggested to offer new insights into the local chemical and structural building blocks of crystalline and amorphous oxides by reducing thermal noise. These findings and fundamental knowledge contribute to advancing the design of e.g. hydrogen oxide barrier films, oxide membranes for H separation, H storage materials, and fuel cells for a hydrogen-based economy.</description>

      <title>Chemical Space-Informed Machine Learning Models for Rapid Predictions of X-ray Photoelectron Spectra of Organic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present machine learning models based on kernel-ridge regression for predicting X-ray photoelectron spectra of organic molecules originating from the $K$-shell ionization energies of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and fluorine (F) atoms. We constructed the training dataset through high-throughput calculations of $K$-shell core-electron binding energies (CEBEs) for 12,880 small organic molecules in the bigQM7$\omega$ dataset, employing the $\Delta$-SCF formalism coupled with meta-GGA-DFT and a variationally converged basis set. The models are cost-effective, as they require the atomic coordinates of a molecule generated using universal force fields while estimating the target-level CEBEs corresponding to DFT-level equilibrium geometry. We explore transfer learning by utilizing the atomic environment feature vectors learned using a graph neural network framework in kernel-ridge regression. Additionally, we enhance accuracy within the $\Delta$-machine learning framework by leveraging inexpensive baseline spectra derived from Kohn--Sham eigenvalues. When applied to 208 combinatorially substituted uracil molecules larger than those in the training set, our analyses suggest that the models may not provide quantitatively accurate predictions of CEBEs but offer a strong linear correlation relevant for virtual high-throughput screening. We present the dataset and models as the Python module, ${\tt cebeconf}$, to facilitate further explorations.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining bistability with the Martini force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time and length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>
