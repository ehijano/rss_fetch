      <title>Instability of quadratic band degeneracies and the emergence of Dirac points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$, where the potential $V$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic and invariant under spatial inversion, complex conjugation, and $\pi/2$ rotation. We show that, under typical small linear deformations of $V$, the quadratic band degeneracy points, occurring over the high-symmetry quasimomentum ${\bf M}$ (see [24, 25]) each split into two separated degeneracies over perturbed quasimomenta ${\bf D}^+$ and ${\bf D}^-$, and that these degeneracies are Dirac points. The local character of the degenerate dispersion surfaces about the emergent Dirac points are tilted, elliptical cones. Correspondingly, the dynamics of wavepackets spectrally localized near either ${\bf D}^+$ or ${\bf D}^-$ are governed by a system of Dirac equations with an advection term. Generalizations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Martinize2 and Vermouth: Unified Framework for Topology Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ongoing advances in force field and computer hardware development enable the use of molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate increasingly complex systems with the ultimate goal of reaching cellular complexity. At the same time, rational design by high-throughput (HT) simulations is another forefront of MD. In these areas, the Martini coarse-grained force field, especially the latest version (i.e. v3), is being actively explored because it offers enhanced spatial-temporal resolution. However, the automation tools for preparing simulations with the Martini force field, accompanying the previous version, were not designed for HT simulations or studies of complex cellular systems. Therefore, they become a major limiting factor. To address these shortcomings, we present the open-source vermouth python library. Vermouth is designed to become the unified framework for developing programs, which prepare, run, and analyze Martini simulations of complex systems. To demonstrate the power of the vermouth library, the martinize2 program is showcased as a generalization of the martinize script, originally aimed to set up simulations of proteins. In contrast to the previous version, martinize2 automatically handles protonation states in proteins and post-translation modifications, offers more options to fine-tune structural biases such as the elastic network, and can convert non-protein molecules such as ligands. Finally, martinize2 is used in two high-complexity benchmarks. The entire I-TASSER protein template database as well as a subset of 200,000 structures from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database are converted to CG resolution and we illustrate how the checks on input structure quality can safeguard HT applications.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory of Non-Markovian Dissipative Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling phase transitions in quantum systems via coupling to reservoirs has been mostly studied for idealized (memory-less) environments. Here, we present a general method to tackle dissipative phase transitions (DPTs) in non-Markovian systems, extending the scope of dissipative engineering of matter phases to more realistic materials and experiments in the solid-state and atomic, molecular and optical physics. We show how memory effects can be used to reshape phase boundaries but also reveal the existence of DPTs genuinely triggered by non-Markovianity.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal Majorana zero modes, ELC waves and soliton-fermion duality in non-Hermitian $sl(2)$ affine Toda coupled to fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian (NH) $sl(2)$ affine Toda model coupled to fermions through soliton theory techniques and the realizations of the pseudo-chiral and pseudo-Hermitian symmetries. The interplay of non-Hermiticity, integrability, nonlinearity, and topology significantly influence the formation and behavior of a continuum of bound state modes (CBM) and extended waves in the localized continuum (ELC). The non-Hermitian soliton-fermion duality, the complex scalar field topological charges and winding numbers in the spectral topology are uncovered.
  The biorthogonal Majorana zero modes, dual to the NH Toda solitons with topological charges $\frac{2}{\pi} \arg{(z=\pm i)}=\pm 1$, appear at the complex-energy point gap and are pinned at zero energy. The zero eigenvalue $\l (z = \pm i)=0$, besides being a zero mode, plays the role of exceptional points (EPs), and each EP separates a real eigenvalue ${\cal A}$-symmetric and ${\cal A}$-symmetry broken regimes for an antilinear symmetry ${\cal A}\in \{ {\cal P}{\cal T}, \g_5{\cal P}{\cal T}\}$. Our findings improve the understanding of exotic quantum states, but also paves the way for future research in harnessing non-Hermitian phenomena for topological quantum computation, as well as the exploration of integrability and NH solitons in the theory of topological phases of matter.</description>
