      <title>Amplitude modulations and resonant decay of excited oscillons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the decay of strongly excited oscillons in a single vacuum model reveals a chaotic, fractal-like pattern very much like one found in kink-antikink collision in the $\phi^4$ model. This structure can be attributed to the resonant energy transfer mechanism triggered by the modulations of amplitudes of constituent oscillons which form the excited oscillon. We also find evidence that such modulations arise as a motion of two quasi-breathers inside the constituent oscillon.</description>

      <title>Negative radiation pressure in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-component non-linear Schr\"odinger equations, the force exerted by incident monochromatic plane waves on an embedded dark soliton and on dark-bright-type solitons is investigated, both perturbatively and by numerical simulations. When the incoming wave is non-vanishing only in the orthogonal component to that of the embedded dark soliton, its acceleration is in the opposite direction to that of the incoming wave. This somewhat surprising phenomenon can be attributed to the well known "negative effective mass" of the dark soliton. When a dark-bright soliton, whose effective mass is also negative, is hit by an incoming wave non-vanishing in the component corresponding to the dark soliton, the direction of its acceleration coincides with that of the incoming wave. This implies that the net force acting on it is in the opposite direction to that of the incoming wave. This rather counter-intuitive effect is a yet another manifestation of negative radiation pressure exerted by the incident wave, observed in other systems. When a dark-bright soliton interacts with an incoming wave in the component of the bright soliton, it accelerates in the opposite direction, hence the force is "pushing" it now. We expect that these remarkable effects, in particular the negative radiation pressure, can be experimentally verified in Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Peeling fingers in an elastic Hele-Shaw channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using experiments and a depth-averaged numerical model, we study instabilities of two-phase flows in a Hele-Shaw channel with an elastic upper boundary and a non-uniform cross-section prescribed by initial collapse. Experimentally, we find increasingly complex and unsteady modes of air-finger propagation as the dimensionless bubble speed, Ca, and level of collapse are increased, including pointed fingers, indented fingers and the feathered modes first identified by Cuttle et al.(J. Fluid Mech., vol. 886, 2020, A20). By introducing a measure of the viscous contribution to finger propagation, we identify a Ca threshold beyond which viscous forces are superseded by elastic effects. Quantitative prediction of this transition between 'viscous' and 'elastic' reopening regimes across levels of collapse establishes the fidelity of the numerical model. In the viscous regime, we recover the non-monotonic dependence on Ca of the finger pressure, which is characteristic of benchtop models of airway reopening. To explore the elastic regime numerically, we extend the depth-averaged model introduced by Fontana et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 916, 2021, A27) to include an artificial disjoining pressure which prevents the unphysical self-intersection of the interface. Using time simulations, we capture for the first time the majority of experimental finger dynamics, including feathered modes. We show that these disordered states continually evolve, with no evidence of convergence to steady or periodic states. We find that the steady bifurcation structure satisfactorily predicts the bubble pressure as a function of Ca, but that it does not provide sufficient information to predict the transition to unsteady dynamics which appears strongly nonlinear.</description>
