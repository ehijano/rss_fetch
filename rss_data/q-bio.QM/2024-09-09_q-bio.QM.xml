      <title>Adaptive cross-country optimisation strategies in thermal soaring birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal soaring enables birds to perform cost-efficient flights during foraging or migration trips. Yet, although all soaring birds exploit vertical winds effectively, this group contains species that vary strongly in their morphologies. Aerodynamic rules dictate the costs and benefits of flight, but, depending on their ecological needs, species may use different behavioural strategies. To quantify these morphology-related differences in behavioural cross-country strategies, we compiled and analysed a large dataset, which includes data from over a hundred individuals from 12 soaring species recorded with high frequency tracking devices. We quantified the performance during thermalling and gliding flights, and the overall cross-country behaviour that is the combination of both. Our results confirmed aerodynamic theory across the 12 species; species with higher wing loading typically flew faster, and consequently turned on a larger radius, than lighter ones. Furthermore, the combination of circling radius and minimum sink speed determines the maximum benefits soaring birds can obtain from thermals. Also, we observed a spectrum of strategies regarding the adaptivity to thermal strength and uncovered a universal rule for cross-country strategies for all analysed species. Finally, our newly described behavioural rules can provide inspirations for technical applications, like the development of autopilot systems for autonomous robotic gliders.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Unilateral Slope Loading on Lower Limb Plantar Flexor Muscle EMG Signals in Young Healthy Males</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different loading modes can significantly affect human gait, posture, and lower limb biomechanics. This study investigated the muscle activity intensity of the lower limb soleus muscle in the slope environment of young healthy adult male subjects under unilateral loading environment. Ten subjects held dumbbells equal to 5% and 10% of their body weight (BW) and walked at a fixed speed on a slope of 5 degree and 10 degree, respectively. The changes of electromyography (EMG) of bilateral soleus muscles of the lower limbs were recorded. Experiments were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to examine the relationship between load weight, slope angle, and muscle activity intensity. The data provided by this research can help to promote the development of the field of lower limb assist exoskeleton. The research results fill the missing data when loading on the slope side, provide data support for future assistance systems, and promote the formation of relevant data sets, so as to improve the terrain recognition ability and the movement ability of the device wearer.</description>

      <title>The Role of Graph Topology in the Performance of Biomedical Knowledge Graph Completion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion has been increasingly adopted as a useful method for several tasks in biomedical research, like drug repurposing or drug-target identification. To that end, a variety of datasets and Knowledge Graph Embedding models has been proposed over the years. However, little is known about the properties that render a dataset useful for a given task and, even though theoretical properties of Knowledge Graph Embedding models are well understood, their practical utility in this field remains controversial. We conduct a comprehensive investigation into the topological properties of publicly available biomedical Knowledge Graphs and establish links to the accuracy observed in real-world applications. By releasing all model predictions and a new suite of analysis tools we invite the community to build upon our work and continue improving the understanding of these crucial applications.</description>

      <title>CISCA and CytoDArk0: a Cell Instance Segmentation and Classification method for histo(patho)logical image Analyses and a new, open, Nissl-stained dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delineating and classifying individual cells in microscopy tissue images is a complex task, yet it is a pivotal endeavor in various medical and biological investigations. We propose a new deep learning framework (CISCA) for automatic cell instance segmentation and classification in histological slices to support detailed morphological and structural analysis or straightforward cell counting in digital pathology workflows and brain cytoarchitecture studies. At the core of CISCA lies a network architecture featuring a lightweight U-Net with three heads in the decoder. The first head classifies pixels into boundaries between neighboring cells, cell bodies, and background, while the second head regresses four distance maps along four directions. The network outputs from the first and second heads are integrated through a tailored post-processing step, which ultimately yields the segmentation of individual cells. A third head enables simultaneous classification of cells into relevant classes, if required. We showcase the effectiveness of our method using four datasets, including CoNIC, PanNuke, and MoNuSeg, which are publicly available H\&amp;E datasets. Additionally, we introduce CytoDArk0, a novel dataset consisting of Nissl-stained images of the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus from mammals belonging to the orders Cetartiodactyla and Primates. We evaluate CISCA in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating CISCA's robustness and accuracy in segmenting and classifying cells across diverse tissue types, magnifications, and staining techniques.</description>

      <title>Noise-free comparison of stochastic agent-based simulations using common random numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random numbers are at the heart of every agent-based model (ABM) of health and disease. By representing each individual in a synthetic population, agent-based models enable detailed analysis of intervention impact and parameter sensitivity. Yet agent-based modeling has a fundamental signal-to-noise problem, in which small changes between simulations cannot be reliably differentiated from stochastic noise resulting from misaligned random number realizations. We introduce a novel methodology that eliminates noise due to misaligned random numbers, a first for agent-based modeling. Our approach enables meaningful individual-level analysis between ABM scenarios because all differences are driven by mechanistic effects rather than random number noise. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on three disparate examples. Results consistently show reductions in the number of simulations required to achieve a given standard error with levels exceeding 10-fold for some applications.</description>

      <title>Re-evaluating Retrosynthesis Algorithms with Syntheseus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated Synthesis Planning has recently re-emerged as a research area at the intersection of chemistry and machine learning. Despite the appearance of steady progress, we argue that imperfect benchmarks and inconsistent comparisons mask systematic shortcomings of existing techniques, and unnecessarily hamper progress. To remedy this, we present a synthesis planning library with an extensive benchmarking framework, called syntheseus, which promotes best practice by default, enabling consistent meaningful evaluation of single-step models and multi-step planning algorithms. We demonstrate the capabilities of syntheseus by re-evaluating several previous retrosynthesis algorithms, and find that the ranking of state-of-the-art models changes in controlled evaluation experiments. We end with guidance for future works in this area, and call the community to engage in the discussion on how to improve benchmarks for synthesis planning.</description>
