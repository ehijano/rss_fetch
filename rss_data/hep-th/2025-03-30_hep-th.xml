      <title>Decomposition and (Non-Invertible) (-1)-Form Symmetries from the Symmetry Topological Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between (-1)-form symmetries and their quantum-dual (d-1)-form counterparts within the framework of Symmetry Topological Field Theories (SymTFTs). In this framework the phenomenon of decomposition -- a d-dimensional quantum field theory with (d-1)-form symmetry being the disjoint union of other theories (or ''universes'') -- arises naturally from manipulations of topological boundary conditions of the SymTFT. We corroborate our findings with various examples, including a generalization of ''instanton-restricted'' 4d Yang-Mills theories with no sum over instanton sectors. Furthermore, we construct a 3d SymTFT with a non-invertible (-1)-form symmetry. The absolute 2d quantum field theory includes a 0-form global symmetry that depends on a parameter whose value gets shifted by the action of the (-1)-form symmetry, and we show that the non-invertibility of the latter is needed to encode this modification of the 0-form symmetry.</description>

      <title>Conformal Collider Physics at Large Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study energy correlators and other event shapes in states created by operators with large global $U(1)$ charge $Q$ in Conformal Field Theories. Focusing on theories whose large charge sector is described by the superfluid Effective Field Theory (EFT), we develop a systematic framework to compute event shapes within the EFT. As formerly observed, event shapes at leading order in $1/Q$ factorize into a product of classical expectation values determined by symmetry. In contrast, the subleading contribution to energy-energy and charge-charge correlators is a nontrivial prediction of the EFT, which we compute explicitly. Our results reveal a sharp collinear enhancement of the correlation between detectors, induced by the propagation of sound. We also generalize our findings to a broad class of event shapes.</description>

      <title>Singularities in Cosmological Loop Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we perform a systematic study of the singularity structure of inflationary correlations at 1-loop. We explicitly compute a few diagrams and find a pattern emerging in the singularities produced. Motivated by this, we derive diagrammatic rules to extract the singularities of any two-site 1-loop diagram. Using these rules, the poles and branch cuts produced can be predicted by simply identifying the energies flowing through certain subgraphs, without having to perform complicated integrals. We demonstrate how these rules follow by analyzing the general structure of the time and momentum integrals of the correlators. An interesting feature of de-Sitter correlators at 1-loop is the presence of an off-shell total energy branch point, which is present in dimensional regularization as well as cutoff regularization. We probe the source of this branch cut in detail, while revisiting the cosmological KLN theorem (arXiv:2308.00680) in this context. Finally, we show that the branch cuts produced in a renormalised correlator always repackage themselves in a dilatation invariant form to produce logarithms of ratios of comoving scales.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Typical States of Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute various averages over bulk geometries of quantum states prepared by the Chern-Simons path integral, for any level $k$ and compact gauge group $G$. We do so by carefully summing over all topologically distinct bulk geometries which have $n$ disjoint boundary tori and a decomposition into space$\times$time of fixed spatial topology. We find that the typical state is unentangled across any bipartition of the tori defining the boundary Hilbert space, to leading order in the complexity defining the state. This is contrary to expectations from three-dimensional gravity. Additionally, we compute an averaged wave function which captures the leading order statistics of boundary observables in the $n$ torus Chern-Simons Hilbert space. We show that this averaged state is a separable state, which implies that different boundary tori only share classical correlations for complex enough bulk geometries.</description>

      <title>Collinear bootstrap for N=(1,1) sYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the multi-collinear behavior of tree amplitudes in the six-dimensional N = (1,1) super Yang-Mills theory (sYM). A generalized dimensional reduction of the latter yields the four-dimensional N = 4 sYM on the Coulomb branch, which is of interest for considerations of massive or off-shell scattering. To this end, we revisit the calculation of tree scattering in the former theory employing the collinear bootstrap and known massless limits. Assuming the universality of the double-collinear asymptotics, the result for six-leg superamplitudes differs from the one available in the literature. We further extract the triple-collinear splitting superamplitudes from these.</description>

      <title>Structure of Carrollian (conformal) superalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate possible supersymmetric extensions of the Carrollian algebra and the Carrollian conformal algebra in both $d=4$ and $d=3$. For the super-Carrollian algebra in $d=4$, we identify multiple admissible structures, depending on the representations of the supercharges with respect to the Carrollian rotation. Some of these structures can be derived by taking the speed of light $c\to 0$ limit from super-Poincar\'e algebra, but others are completely novel. In the conformal case, we demonstrate that the nontrivial Carrollian superconformal algebras for $d=4$ and $d=3$ are isomorphic to super-Poincar\'e algebra of $d=5$ and $d=4$ respectively. Remarkably, neither of these constructions requires R-symmetry to ensure the algebraic closure. Furthermore, we discover two distinct classes of super-BMS$_4$ algebras, i.e. one singlet super-BMS$_4$ algebra and two multiplet chiral super-BMS$_4$ algebras. The singlet case arises from extending the $3$D Carrollian superconformal algebra, whereas the multiplet cases do not admit this pathology due to their finite-dimensional subalgebra containing supercharges with conformal dimension $\Delta=\pm\frac{3}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Casimir pressure with dissipation and quantum corrections from axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of the oscillating axion field present in our environment on the Casimir pressure between two metallic plates. We take into account the finite conductivity of the boundary plates and model the interactions between matter and photons in the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. This allows us to take into account dissipation in the quantum field description of this open quantum system and retrieve the Lifschitz results for the Casimir interaction between two metallic plates. We then compute the leading correction to the Lifschitz theory in inverse powers of the axion suppression scale and show that the Casimir pressure receives oscillating corrections depending on the product of the axion mass and the distance between the plates. This contribution is repulsive at large distance compared to the axion Compton wavelength as a consequence of the breaking of parity invariance by the axion dark matter background.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically safe canonical quantum gravity: Gaussian dust matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent series of publications we have started to investigate possible points of contact between the canonical (CQG) and the asymptotically safe (ASQG) approach to quantum gravity, despite the fact that the CQG approach is exclusively for Lorentzian signature gravity while the ASQG approach is mostly for Euclidean signature gravity. Expectedly, the simplest route is via the generating functional of time ordered N-point functions which requires a Lorentzian version of the Wetterich equation and heat kernel methods employed in ASQG.
  In the present contribution we consider gravity coupled to Gaussian dust matter. This is a generally covariant Lorentzian signature system, which can be considered as a field theoretical implementation of the idealisation of a congruence of collision free test observers in free fall, filling the universe. The field theory version correctly accounts for geometry -- matter backreaction and thus in principle serves as a dark matter model. Moreover, the intuitive geometric interpretation selects a preferred reference frame that allows to disentangle gauge degrees of freedom from observables. The CQG treatment of this theory has already been considered in the past.
  For this particular matter content it is possible to formulate the quantum field theory of observables as a non-linear $\sigma$ model described by a highly non-linear conservative Hamiltonian. This allows to apply techniques from Euclidean field theory to derive the generating functional of Schwinger N-point functions which can be treated with the standard Euclidean version of the heat kernel methods employed in ASQG. The corresponding Euclidean action is closely related to Euclidean signature gravity but not identical to it despite the fact that the underlying Hamiltonian is for Lorentzian signature gravity.</description>

      <title>Higher-order $p$-form asymptotic symmetries in $D = p + 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate higher-order asymptotic symmetries for a $p$-form gauge field in $(p + 2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, where Hodge duality with a scalar holds. Employing symplectic renormalization, we identify $N + 1$ independent asymptotic charges, with each charge being parametrised by an arbitrary function of the angular variables. By means of the Hodge decomposition, these charges share the same formal structure independently from p and are manifestly dual to a scalar charge. We work in Lorenz gauge, therefore the gauge parameters require a radial expansion involving logarithmic (subleading) terms to ensure nontrivial angular dependence at leading order. At the same time we assume a power expansion for the field strength, allowing logarithms in the gauge field expansions within pure gauge sectors.</description>

      <title>Integrable Corners in the Space of Gukov-Witten Surface Defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate integrability properties of Gukov-Witten 1/2-BPS surface defects in $SU(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in the large-$N$ limit. We demonstrate that ordinary Gukov-Witten defects, which depend on a set of continuous parameters, are not integrable except for special sub-sectors. In contrast to these, we show that rigid Gukov-Witten defects, which depend on a discrete parameter but not on continuous ones, appear integrable in a corner of the discrete parameter space. Whenever we find an integrable sector, we derive a closed-form factorised expression for the leading-order one-point function of unprotected operators built out of the adjoint scalars of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory. Our results raise the possibility of finding an all-loop formula for one-point functions of unprotected operators in the presence of a rigid Gukov-Witten defect at the corner in parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate how contact chord diagrams can arise from certain Fock-space models and compute the corresponding correlation functions using the chord path integral technique. In particular, our three-point functions are in the right form dictated by conformal symmetry, and some of our four-point functions match the results of some AdS$_2$ contact Witten diagrams.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the physics-informed renormalisation group (PIRG) for the construction of gauge invariant renormalisation group flows. The respective effective action is a sum of a gauge invariant quantum part and the classical gauge fixing part which arranges for invertibility of the gauge field two-point function. Thus, the BRST transformations simply accommodate the gauge consistency of the gauge fixing sector, while the quantum part of the effective action is gauge and BRST invariant. We apply this physics-informed approach to Yang-Mills theory and gravity and show how the flowing gauge fields arrange for full gauge invariance. We also embed the background field approximation to the functional renormalisation group (fRG) in an exact gauge invariant PIRG flow. This allows us to discuss the dynamics of the correction terms, and the non-trivial ultraviolet or infrared relevant terms are elucidated within a one-loop approximation. The background field approximation of the latter is known for violating one-loop universality for specific regulators and we show how the present setup reinstates universality in a constructive way. Finally, we discuss the landscape of fRG flows in gauge theories through the lens of the novel PIRG approach as well as potential applications.</description>

      <title>Rotational Metric: A Solution to Einstein's Clock-Rate Problem and Its Magnetospheric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotational metric offers an exact solution to Einstein's clock-rate problem in curved spacetime regarding whether time flows more slowly at the equator of a compact object like a neutron star than at its poles. Similar to what Einstein had done for a uniformly rotating disk, the metric can be obtained directly from the Schwarzschild metric through rotational transformations. In accordance with the equivalence of inertia and gravity, the rotational metric exhibits more complex geometric structures due to the effects of inertia-gravity arising from rotation. For instance, it has an extra ergosphere compared to the original Schwarzschild metric. The presence of the ergosphere could serve as a compelling example that illustrates how the rotational transformations can introduce new structures into a gravitational system. Exactly, there are additional physical degrees of freedom, carried by the rotational transformations, that are 'eaten' by the gravitational system to form an extra ergosphere inside the system itself, which is in analogy to the Higgs mechanism in particle physics. In this process, the rotational transformations play a role of 'symmetry breaking'. Besides, the rotational metric can describe the gravitational system that rigidly corotates with a spinning mass. It has potential applications in describing the rotationally-induced gravitational effects within various rotating magnetospheres and relevant astronomical phenomena. The understanding of the rotational metric is therefore expected to bring novel insights into general relativity and high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to compute the probability distributions of the order parameter of the $O(n)$ model at two-loop order of perturbation theory generalizing the methods developed for computing the same in case of the Ising model \cite{Sahu:2025bkp}. We show that even for the $O(n)$ model, there exists not one but a family of these probability distribution functions indexed by $\zeta$ which is the ratio of system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$. We also compare these PDFs to the Monte-Carlo simulations and the existing FRG results \cite{Rancon:2025bjf} for the $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models.</description>

      <title>Positivity at 1-Loop: Bounds on Photon and Gluon EFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we attempt to derive ``positivity" bounds on Photon and Gluon Effective Field Theories (EFTs) at one loop level. While for the Photon case, the one loop amplitude is IR finite and well defined in the forward limit, earlier studies failed to obtain a dispersive bound on dimension-12 operators due to the dependence of the ``arc integral" on the artificial low-energy scale. We show that this awkward dependence can be taken care of by analysing the ultra-violet (UV) side of dispersion relation closely. In particular, we derive an IR safe and RG improved bound at 1-loop. Thereafter, we perform a similar analysis on the Gluon EFT, which has additional complications due to ill-defined forward limit and IR divergences at 1-loop. We show that even in this case, one can get a meaningful bound at 1-loop.</description>

      <title>Wave Interference in Self-Interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) scenario, the dark matter is composed of an ultra-light scalar field with coherence length and wave interference on astrophysical scales. Scalar fields generically have quartic self-interactions that modify their dispersion relation and the associated evolution of density perturbations. We perform the first dedicated analysis of the role of wave interference on this evolution due to self-interactions in FDM and vice versa, developing a perturbative treatment applicable at early times and then comparing against a suite of fully nonlinear benchmark simulations, varying the dark matter density, interaction strength, and fiducial momentum scale. We explicitly simulate the limit where this momentum scale is relatively high compared with the scale of the simulation volume, applicable to cases where the dark matter is initially ``warm" due to causal constraints on a post-inflationary production or in virialized halos and other ``thermalized" cases with initially cold production. We find that in such scenarios, density perturbations are unable to grow on the expected self interaction time scale because of interference effects, instead saturating on the much shorter de Broglie crossing time, with a dependence on the sign of the interaction. Finally, we comment on the implications of our results for astrophysical systems such as high-density ultra-faint dwarf galaxies where wave interference plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Bogoliubov vs Boltzmann approaches in gravitational production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral behavior of scalar fluctuations generated by gravity during inflation and the subsequent reheating phase. We consider a non-perturbative Bogoliubov treatment within the context of pure gravitational reheating. We compute both long and short-wavelength spectra, first for a massless scalar field, revealing that the spectral index in part of the infrared (IR) regime varies between $-6$ and $-3$, depending on the post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $0\leq w_\phi\leq1$. Furthermore, we study the mass-breaking effect of the IR spectrum by including finite mass, $m_{\chi}$, of the daughter scalar field. We show that for $m_{\chi}/H_{\rm e} \gtrsim 3/2$, where $H_{\rm e}$ is the Hubble parameter during inflation, the IR spectrum of scalar fluctuations experiences exponential mass suppression, while for smaller masses, $m_{\chi}/\He&lt;3/2$, the spectrum remains flat in the IR regime regardless of the post-inflationary EoS. For any general EoS, we also compute a specific IR scale, $k_m$, of fluctuations below which the IR spectrum will suffer from this finite mass effect. In the UV regime, oscillations of the inflaton background lead to interference terms that explain the high-frequency oscillations in the spectrum. Interestingly, we find that for any EoS, $1/9 \lesssim w_\phi \lesssim 1$, the spectral behavior turns out to be independent of the EoS, with a spectral index $ -6$. We have compared this Bogoliubov treatment for the UV regime to perturbative computations with solutions to the Boltzmann equation and found an agreement between the two approaches for any EoS, $0 \lesssim w_\phi \lesssim 1$. We also explore the relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the reheating EoS employing the non-perturbative analytic approach, finding that reheating can occur for $w_\phi \gtrsim 0.6$.</description>

      <title>Advances for QCD and the Standard Model: Color-Confining Light-Front Holography and the Principle of Maximum Conformality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I review how the application of superconformal quantum mechanics and light-front holography leads to new insights into the physics of color confinement, the spectroscopy and dynamics of hadrons, as well as surprising supersymmetric relations between the masses of mesons, baryons, and tetraquarks. Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is automatically fulfilled by supersymmetric Light-Front QCD. The light-front holographic approach (HLFQCD) also predicts the behavior of the QCD running coupling and other observables from the nonperturbative color-confining domain to the perturbative domain. One can determine the QCD running coupling to high precision from the data of just a single experiment over the entire perturbative regime by using the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC). The PMC, which generalizes the conventional Gell-Mann-Low method for scale-setting in perturbative QED to non-Abelian QCD, provides a rigorous method for achieving unambiguous scheme-independent, fixed-order Standard Model predictions, consistent with the principles of the renormalization group. I also briefly review a novel feature of hadronic physics predicted by QCD: intrinsic heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Spinor Representations for Fields with any Spin: Lorentz Tensor Basis for Operators and Covariant Multipole Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses a framework to parametrize and decompose operator matrix elements for particles with higher spin $(j &gt; 1/2)$ using chiral representations of the Lorentz group, i.e. the $(j,0)$ and $(0,j)$ representations and their parity-invariant direct sum. Unlike traditional approaches that require imposing constraints to eliminate spurious degrees of freedom, these chiral representations contain exactly the $2j+1$ components needed to describe a spin-$j$ particle. The central objects in the construction are the $t$-tensors, which are generalizations of the Pauli four-vector $\sigma^\mu$ for higher spin. For the generalized spinors of these representations, we demonstrate how the algebra of the $t$-tensors allows to formulate a generalization of the Dirac matrix basis for any spin. For on-shell bilinears, we show that a set consisting exclusively of covariant multipoles of order $0\leq m \leq 2j$ forms a complete basis. We provide explicit expressions for all bilinears of the generalized Dirac matrix basis, which are valid for any spin value. As a byproduct of our derivations we present an efficient algorithm to compute the $t$-tensor matrix elements. The formalism presented here paves the way to use a more unified approach to analyze the non-perturbative QCD structure of hadrons and nuclei across different spin values, with clear physical interpretation of the resulting distributions as covariant multipoles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For decades now, low-energy models of QCD have shown indications that a crystalline quark phase could be stable at high chemical potentials. Beyond models, however, there are numerous difficulties in investigating such a hypothesis in full QCD, such as the sign problem. Functional methods do not suffer from the sign problem, and thus, can access the high--$\mu$ side of the QCD phase diagram. The main tool used to look for signs of inhomogeneous/crystalline phases in low-energy models is the so-called ``stability analysis''. In this talk, I show how the standard stability analysis was generalised to be applicable in any theory, including QCD.</description>

      <title>SU(3) centre vortex geometry at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of examining the structure of centre-vortex matter in the ground-state fields of nonabelian gauge-field theory has been demonstrated in the recent centre-vortex based discovery of a second finite-temperature transition in QCD associated with quark deconfinement. This signals the presence of a new phase of ground-state field structure between the well separated chiral and deconfinement transitions. In this short presentation, we re-examine pure SU(3) gauge theory which provides a foundation for the development of techniques for the examination of full QCD. This time, we reconsider visualisations of the centre-vortex structure in light of the quantitative analysis that demonstrates the first order nature of the deconfinement phase transition in the pure-gauge theory. Here we consider a detailed side-by-side comparison of the field structure slightly below and slightly above the critical temperature. The abrupt changes of the field structure in the first order phase transition are easy to observe in the representative visualisations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss properties of thermal Quantum Chromodynamics obtained by means of lattice simulations with overlap fermions. This fermion discretisation preserves chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing. We present details of the formulation and results for the chiral observables. We determine the topological susceptibility from simulations at fixed global topological charge based on the slab method. Using the measured values of the topological susceptibility we sum the chiral observables over all topological sectors. The volume dependence of the chiral susceptibility is in agreement with the crossover nature of the thermal QCD phase transition. Additionally we discuss the spectrum of the overlap Dirac operator and its volume and temperature dependence. Presented results are obtained at the temporal lattice extent $N_t=8$.</description>

Abstract: We elaborate the problem of magnetized particle motion in the spacetime of a static, spherically symmetric black hole influenced by weak magnetic fields stemming from visible and dark matter sectors. The Wald's procedure for obtaining the weakly magnetized solution, generalized to the case of dark photon - Einstein-Maxwell gravity was implemented. The collision process analysis of two particles in the background of the black hole has been studied in order to find the signature of dark matter presence in the nearby of the object in question.</description>

      <title>Conformal Phase Transition in Supersymmetric QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional supersymmetric QCD in conformal window with a marginally relevant deformation which triggers the spontaneous breaking of (approximate) scale invariance and the subsequent confinement, generating a mass gap, at an energy scale hierarchically smaller than the Planck scale without fine-tuning. We analyze the finite temperature system and show that the phase transition associated with the breaking of conformal invariance is of the strong first order. When such a phase transition takes place at a temperature of the Universe around the electroweak scale, it generates a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background probed by future space-based interferometers, while a conformal phase transition in a dark sector at $\mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV generates GWs to explain the reported pulsar timing array signal.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of heavy quarks by elastic and radiative scatterings in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our investigation of heavy quark transport coefficients in the effective dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM) -- which reproduces nonperturbative QCD phenomena in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) according to lattice QCD data -- by including inelastic $2 \to 3$ processes with massive gluon radiation, in addition to elastic $2 \to 2$ parton scattering. Both elastic and inelastic reactions are evaluated at leading order using DQPM-based effective propagators and vertices, accounting for all channels and their interferences. Based on the obtained matrix elements, we calculate various observables connected to a charm quark. First, we calculate the total cross section of a charm quark with the medium partons as functions of temperature and collision energy. Second, we obtain the drag $\mathcal{A}$ coefficient and $\hat{q}$ coefficient of a charm quark as functions of temperature and momentum and also compare our results with those obtained using the Zakharov model for the momentum-dependent strong coupling for the elastic and radiative vertices with a heavy quark, highlighting the importance of the choice of the strong coupling in the determination of transport coefficients. Third, we calculate the spatial diffusion coefficient of a charm quark and compare our results with those obtained using other approaches. Finally, we explore the mass dependence of the diffusion coefficient by comparing the results for charm quark, bottom quark, and infinitely-heavy quark. We found that inelastic processes can play a significant role in the determination of the transport coefficients at large transverse momenta, but are strongly suppressed at low transverse momenta.</description>

      <title>Axial perturbations of black holes with primary scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study axial perturbations of static black holes with primary hair in a family of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. These solutions possess a scalar charge, fully independent of the mass, leading to a continuous one-parameter deformation of the standard Schwarzschild black hole. Starting from these solutions, we also construct new black holes, solutions of other DHOST theories, obtained via disformal transformations of the metric. In particular, we investigate two specific types of disformal transformations: the first leading to a theory where gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light, the second to a Horndeski theory, where the equations of motion remain second order. The dynamics of axial perturbations can be formally related to the general relativistic equations of motion of axial perturbations in an effective metric. The causal structure of the effective metric differs from that of the background metric, leading to distinct gravitational and luminous horizons. Using a WKB approximation, we compute the quasi-normal modes for the Schr\"odinger-like equation associated with the effective metric outside the gravitational horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the heavy-quark corner of the Columbia plot using the gluon potential derived from the Curci-Ferrari extension of the Faddeev-Popov gauge fixing in the center-symmetric Landau gauge, as a proxy for the Polyakov loop potential. In line with the observation that Landau gauge couplings are not that large in the case of heavy-quark QCD, we consider a one-loop approximation and test its consistency by using various renormalization schemes while investigating the dependence of our results on the renormalization scale. We find that the main qualitative features of the phase structure in the heavy-quark regime are reproduced. Our results agree quantitatively with those of simulations to $10\%$ accuracy, which is the expected precision of the one-loop calculations in applications of the Curci-Ferrari model to Yang-Mills or heavy-quark QCD theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlators of Wilson-line, which capture eikonal contributions, are known to exponentiate in non-abelian gauge theories, and their logarithms can be organised in terms of collections of Feynman diagrams called webs. In~\cite{Agarwal:2020nyc} the concept of correlator web (Cweb), which is a set of skeleton diagrams built with connected gluon correlators and provides a generalisation of webs was introduced. The part of next-to-eikonal contributions to the scattering amplitude which exponentiates is given in terms of next-to-eikonal Cwebs~\cite{Gardi:2010rn,Laenen:2008gt}. In the present article we study next-to-eikonal Cwebs at three loop order, the order at which non trivial Cweb mixing matrices appear for the first time. The methods developed in~\cite{Agarwal:2022wyk} to construct mixing matrices directly without use of replica trick are used in this article to obtain the mixing matrices for next-to-eikonal Cwebs after we establish a relationship between next-to-eikonal and eikonal Cwebs.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper we continue the project of systematic construction of invariant differential operators on the example of the non-compact exceptional Lie algebra $F'_4=F_{4(4)}$ which is split real form of the exceptional Lie algebra $F_4$. We consider induction from a maximal parabolic algebra. We classify the reducible Verma modules over $F_4$ which are compatible with this induction. Thus, we obtain the classification of the corresponding invariant differential operators.</description>

Abstract: We give an overview of recent developments in the computation of the anomalous dimension matrix of composite operators in non-forward kinematics. The elements of this matrix set the evolution of non-perturbative parton distributions such as the generalized parton distribution functions. The latter provide important information about hadronic structure and are accessible experimentally in hard exclusive scattering processes. We focus our discussion on a recent method that exploits consistency relations for the anomalous dimensions which follow from the renormalization structure of quark and gluon operators.</description>

      <title>NEC violation and "beyond Horndeski'' physics in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 results provide compelling evidence that the dark energy equation of state evolves from $w&lt;-1$ at high redshift to $w&gt;-1$ today, reinforcing interest in null energy condition (NEC) violation. While NEC violation may be crucial for dark energy and solving the cosmological singularity problem, it generically leads to ghost or gradient instabilities. It is well established in the study of nonsingular cosmology that the effective field theory (EFT) operator $\delta g^{00} R^{(3)}$ enables fully stable NEC violation and represents ``beyond Horndeski'' physics. We investigate its implications in the observable Universe and confirm within the EFT framework that $\delta g^{00} R^{(3)}$ can also stabilize NEC violation in dark energy, as indicated by the latest DESI DR2 BAO observations. Furthermore, our results show that current data already impose a nontrivial constraint on the EFT coefficient $\tilde{m}^2_4$ associated with $\delta g^{00} R^{(3)}$, indicating $\tilde{m}^2_4 \neq 0$ at approximately $2\sigma$. This finding suggests an unexpected possible connection between the primordial Universe and the late observable Universe.</description>

      <title>To CPL, or not to CPL? What we have not learned about the dark energy equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that using a Taylor expansion for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter and limiting it to the zeroth and first-order terms, i.e., the so-called Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, instead of allowing for higher-order terms and then marginalizing over them, adds extra information not present in the data and leads to markedly different and potentially misleading conclusions. Fixing the higher-order terms to zero, one concludes that vacuum energy that is currently non-dynamical (e.g., the cosmological constant) is excluded at several $\sigma$ significance as the explanation of cosmic acceleration, even in Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI) DR1 data. Meanwhile, instead marginalizing over the higher-order terms shows that we know neither the current dark energy equation of state nor its current rate of change well enough to make such a claim. This issue has become more prominent now with the recent release of high-quality Stage IV galaxy survey data. The results of analyses using simple Taylor expansions should be interpreted with great care.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entropy-Driven Modifications to Holographic Dark Energy in $f(G,T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a $f(G,T)$ gravity-based reconstruction of Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BHDE). This approach extends the conventional HDE model by replacing the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy with Barrow entropy, which encapsulates quantum gravitational corrections to the geometry of black hole horizons. We explore the cosmological dynamics of a flat FRW background filled with a pressureless dust fluid, considering both conserved and non-conserved energy-momentum tensor models. To this end, we employ the Hubble horizon as the infrared cutoff and adopt a power-law ansatz for the scale factor. We then investigate the evolution of key cosmological parameters, including the equation-of-state parameter \( \omega_{GT} \), the deceleration parameter \( q \), and the squared sound speed $v_s^2$. Furthermore, we explore the dynamical behavior in the $\omega_{GT}-\omega'_{GT}$ space. In the case of conserved energy-momentum tensor, our findings indicate that the BHDE model evolves from a quintessence-like regime into the phantom domain. This transition supports the current accelerated expansion of the Universe and offers an improvement over the original HDE model, which does not adequately account for the observed phenomenology. The corresponding $\omega_{GT}-\omega'_{GT}$ trajectory lies within the freezing region. On the other hand, within the non-conserved framework, the BHDE model exhibits phantom-like behavior in the early Universe, subsequently evolving toward either a cosmological constant-like state or a quintessence-like regime. Notably, unlike the conserved scenario, the squared sound speed $v_s^2$ asymptotically attains positive values in the far future. Moreover, the trajectory in the $\omega_{GT}-\omega'_{GT}$ phase space displays a thawing behavior. Finally, we evaluate the observational viability of our results and compare them with predictions from alternative reconstructed DE models.</description>

      <title>R-matrix valued Lax pair for elliptic Calogero-Inozemtsev system and associative Yang-Baxter equations of ${\rm BC}_n$ type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the elliptic Calogero-Inozemtsev system of ${\rm BC}_n$ type with five arbitrary constants and propose $R$-matrix valued generalization for $2n\times 2n$ Takasaki's Lax pair. For this purpose we extend the Kirillov's ${\rm B}$-type associative Yang-Baxter equations to the similar relations depending on the spectral parameters and the Planck constants. General construction uses the elliptic Shibukawa-Ueno $R$-operator and the Komori-Hikami $K$-operators satisfying reflection equation. Then, using the Felder-Pasquier construction the answer for the Lax pair is also written in terms of the Baxter's 8-vertex $R$-matrix. As a by-product of the constructed Lax pair we also propose ${\rm BC}_n$ type generalization for the elliptic XYZ long-range spin chain, and we present arguments pointing to its integrability.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Discrete Spectrum of Interior Length and Timeshift in Two-sided Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the interior length and the horizon timeshift of a two-sided black hole by constructing non-perturbative length and timeshift operators in Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity. We first construct projection operators onto the fixed length or fixed horizon timeshift subspaces using the replica trick. We calculate the densities of state for the length and the timeshift, which are found to be finite. This finiteness implies the discreteness in the spectrum of these quantities. We then construct the non-perturbative length and timeshift operators, and apply them to study the time evolution of the two-sided black hole. We find that at early time, the probability distribution of the interior length and the timeshift are sharply peaked at the classical values, while after the Heisenberg time, the distribution is completely uniform over all possible values of the length and the timeshift, indicating maximal uncertainty. In particular, the probability of having the negative timeshift states, which corresponds to the white hole probability, is $O(1)$ after the Heisenberg time.</description>

      <title>Effective Actions for Domain Wall Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method to derive the effective action for domain walls directly from the scalar field theory that gives rise to their solitonic solutions. The effective action for the Goldstone mode, which characterizes the soliton's position, is shown to consist of the Nambu-Goto action supplemented by higher-order curvature invariants associated to its worldvolume metric. Our approach constrains the corrections to a finite set of Galileon terms, specifying both their functional forms and the procedure to compute their coefficients. We do a collection of tests across various models in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions that confirm the validity of this framework. Additionally, the method is extended to include bound scalar fields living on the worldsheet, along with their couplings to the Goldstone mode. These interactions reveal a universal non-minimal coupling of these scalar fields to the Ricci scalar on the worldsheet. A significant consequence of this coupling is the emergence of a parametric instability, driven by interactions between the bound states and the Goldstone mode.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Derivation of Hidden Zeros and Exact Factorisation of Pion Scattering Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pion scattering amplitudes were recently found to vanish on specific kinematic loci, and to factorise close to these loci into a product of two lower-point amplitudes of an extended theory. We propose a diagrammatic representation of pion amplitudes that makes their vanishing on the loci manifest diagram by diagram. Moreover, we provide evidence that there is a closed-form expression for the amplitudes that generalises the near-zero factorisation in an exact manner, not only close to the loci but for all kinematic configurations. Our approach crucially relies on a novel formulation of the effective field theory of pions, in which tree-level scattering amplitudes are extracted from classical field equations for a set of covariantly conserved currents and emergent composite gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry as a gauge theory of gravity: covariant equations of motion &amp; conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Weyl conformal geometry as a general gauge theory of the Weyl group (of Poincar\'e and dilatations symmetries) in a manifestly Weyl gauge covariant formalism in which this geometry is automatically metric and physically relevant. This gives a realistic (quadratic) gauge theory of gravity, with Einstein-Hilbert gravity recovered in its spontaneously broken phase, motivating our interest in this geometry. For the most general action we compute the manifestly Weyl gauge covariant equations of motion and present the conservation laws for the energy-momentum tensor and Weyl gauge current. These laws are valid both in Weyl conformal geometry (with respect to the Weyl gauge covariant derivative) but also in the Riemannian geometry equivalent picture (with respect to its associated covariant derivative). This interesting result is a consequence of gauged diffeomorphism invariance of the former versus usual diffeomorphism invariance of the latter. These results are first derived in $d=4$ dimensions. We then successfully derive the conservation laws and equations of motion in Weyl conformal geometry in arbitrary $d$ dimensions, while maintaining manifest Weyl gauge invariance/covariance. The results are useful in physical applications with this symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent proposal reinterprets the eikonal as the scattering generator, which computes scattering observables through an action as a symmetry generator. The aim of this study is to incorporate dissipative effects from radiation into this framework, where the eikonal is generalised to the radiation eikonal by including mediator field degrees of freedom. The proposed generalisation is tested through several post-Minkowskian scattering observables; scattering waveform, radiated momentum, and (time asymmetric) radiation loss in the impulse.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the study of wave packets from the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence to AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$ and examine properties of their energy density. We find that, while the energy still localizes on the light cone, its spatial distribution exhibits momentum dependence and is no longer localized in higher dimensions. This result is significant as it reflects leading $1/N$ corrections to the generalized free field theory associated with the free bulk theory at $N=\infty$. Our findings are consistent with previous studies on entanglement wedge reconstruction including $1/N$ corrections, and also provide new insights into the structure of wave packets in higher-dimensional holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical effective action in string theory exhibits background independence and retains its invariance under higher-derivative corrections to the Buscher transformations. In this study, we extend this symmetry to include higher-genus contributions, which inherently introduce background dependence into the effective action. We propose that the Lagrangian density of the circularly reduced effective action maintains its invariance under higher-genus, higher-derivative modifications to the Buscher rules.
  For a self-dual circle, the Lagrangian density at each order of \(\alpha'\) aligns with its classical counterpart, except for a few parameters requiring loop-level S-matrix methods. One-loop \(\alpha'^3\) corrections induced by T-duality for backgrounds with one Killing circle differ from those derived in Minkowski spacetime, emphasizing the background-dependent nature of quantum corrections in string theory and the influence of geometry on quantum effects.</description>

Abstract: We study maximal supergravity in two dimensions, obtained from reduction of IIA supergravity on an $S^8$ sphere. The theory captures the low-lying fluctuations around the non-conformal D0-brane near-horizon geometry, dual to operators in the BFSS matrix model. Upon exciting some of the supergravity scalars, we construct half-supersymmetric domain wall solutions preserving $SO(p)\times SO(9-p)$ subgroups of the original $SO(9)$ symmetry. We determine their uplift to ten dimensions and the corresponding distributions of D0-branes. Finally, we compute the fluctuations around these domain wall backgrounds, corresponding to holographic two-point correlation functions in the Coulomb branch of the matrix model.</description>

Abstract: We study quasi-stationary states in quantum mechanics using the exact WKB analysis as a non-perturbative framework. While previous works focus mainly on stable systems, we explore unstable states such as resonances. As a concrete example, we analyze the inverted Rosen--Morse potential, which exhibits barrier resonance. This model allows exact solutions, enabling a direct comparison with exact WKB predictions. We provide a simple analytic picture of resonance and demonstrate consistency between exact and WKB-based results, extending the applicability of exact WKB analysis to non-polynomial potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When considering the renormalization of composite operators for the description of hard exclusive scattering processes, two types of operator basis called the derivative basis and the Gegenbauer basis are often used in the literature. In this work we set up the explicit similarity transformations between these two bases, both for quark and gluon operators. This way, one can use the properties of both bases to their advantage in the computation of the operator anomalous dimensions, which describe the scale dependence of non-perturbative non-forward parton distributions. We provide several applications of our framework. As an application of the gluon transformation formula, we compute the one-loop non-forward purely gluonic anomalous dimension matrix. For the rest of the applications we focus on the transformation formula of the quark operator. We derive the Gegenbauer anomalous dimensions, in the limit of a large number of quark flavors $n_f$, to all orders in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$, extending the computation previously performed in the derivative basis. Next a numeric calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions in the derivative basis beyond the leading-color limit is presented. Finally, we discuss a novel way of validating existing computations of the conformal anomaly based on the leading-color anomalous dimensions in the derivative basis.</description>

Abstract: Topological quantum matter exhibits a range of exotic phenomena when enriched by subdimensional symmetries. This includes new features beyond those that appear in the conventional setting of global symmetry enrichment. A recently discovered example is a type of subsystem symmetry fractionalization that occurs through a different mechanism to global symmetry fractionalization. In this work we extend the study of subsystem symmetry fractionalization through new examples derived from the general principle of embedding subsystem symmetry into higher-form symmetry. This leads to new types of symmetry fractionalization that are described by foliation dependent higher-form symmetries. This leads to field theories and lattice models that support previously unseen anomalous subsystem symmetry fractionalization. Our work expands the range of exotic topological physics that is enabled by subsystem symmetry in field theory and on the lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of integrable models for spin chains with constrained Hilbert spaces; we focus on spin-1/2 chains with the Rydberg constraint. We extend earlier results for medium-range spin chains to the constrained Hilbert space, and formulate an integrability condition. This enables us to construct new integrable models with fixed interaction ranges. We classify all time- and space-reflection symmetric integrable Rydberg-constrained Hamiltonians of range 3 and 4. At range 3, we find a single family of integrable Hamiltonians: the so-called RSOS quantum chains, which are related to the well-known RSOS models of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. At range 4 we find two families of models, the first of which is the constrained XXZ model. We also find a new family of models depending on a single coupling $z$. We provide evidence of two critical points related to the golden ratio $\phi$, at $z=\phi^{-1/2}$ and $z=\phi^{3/2}$. We also perform a partial classification of integrable Hamiltonians for range 5.</description>

      <title>Symmetric black-to-white hole solutions with a cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a system with a Hamiltonian constraint, we demonstrate that its dynamics is invariant under different choices of the lapse function, regardless of whether the Hamiltonian incorporates quantum corrections. Applying this observation to the interior of black-to-white holes, we analyze its dynamics with different choices of the lapse function. The results explicitly show that the leading-order expansion of both metrics proposed by Rovelli et al. (Class. Quant. Grav. \textbf{35}, 225003 (2018); Class. Quant. Grav. \textbf{35}, 215010 (2018)) and Ashtekar et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{121}, 241301 (2018); Phys. Rev. D \textbf{98}, 126003 (2018)) exhibit identical behavior near the transition surface. Therefore, in this sense the black-to-white hole model proposed by Rovelli et al., (Class. Quant. Grav. \textbf{35}, 225003 (2018); Class. Quant. Grav. \textbf{35}, 215010 (2018)) may be interpreted as a coarse-grained version of the solution within the framework of loop quantum gravity. The black-to-white hole solutions with exact symmetry between the black hole and white hole regions are constructed by appropriately fixing the quantum parameters in the effective theory of loop quantum gravity. This approach circumvents the issue of amplification of mass, which could arise from a mass difference between the black hole and white hole, and provides a way to link the solutions obtained by minisuperspace quantization to those in the covariant approach. Finally, the black-to-white hole solutions with a cosmological constant are constructed. The numerical solutions for the interior of the black-to-white hole with a cosmological constant are obtained, and their symmetric behavior is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Kundt Gravitational Waves Coupled with a Non-Noetherian Conformal Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type N spacetimes of the Kundt class are presented as solutions to Einstein's equations sourced by a real scalar field whose equation of motion is conformally invariant and that generalizes the standard conformal scalar field. The specific spacetimes considered model gravitational waves with uniform and totally geodesic wave fronts, propagating in a maximally symmetric background, and are characterized by the value of their constant scalar curvature and by the so-called wave profile function. All subclasses of such spacetimes are analyzed. It is shown that the scalar field solutions generically divide into two branches, of which one has a strikingly different behavior from that of the standard conformal case. The scalar field contributes to the equation satisfied by the wave profile function by adding new singular terms. Closed form and mode solutions for the wave profile function are found for different scenarios. The resulting energy-momentum tensor has a null eigenvector, but is more general than the pure radiation type usually coupled with this kind of spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part Ic. Limits on lens spaces from circle searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization observations indicate that in the best-fit $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model of the Universe, the local geometry is consistent with at most a small amount of positive or negative curvature, i.e., $\vert\Omega_K\vert\ll1$. However, whether the geometry is flat ($E^3$), positively curved ($S^3$) or negatively curved ($H^3$), there are many possible topologies. Among the topologies of $S^3$ geometry, the lens spaces $L(p,q)$, where $p$ and $q$ ($p&gt;1$ and $0&lt;q&lt;p$) are positive integers, are quotients of the covering space of $S^3$ (the three-sphere) by ${\mathbb{Z}}_p$, the cyclic group of order $p$. We use the absence of any pair of circles on the CMB sky with matching patterns of temperature fluctuations to establish constraints on $p$ and $q$ as a function of the curvature scale that are considerably stronger than those previously asserted for most values of $p$ and $q$. The smaller the value of $\vert\Omega_K\vert$, i.e., the larger the curvature radius, the larger the maximum allowed value of $p$. For example, if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.05$ then $p\leq 9 $, while if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.02$, $p$ can be as high as 24. Future work will extend these constraints to a wider set of $S^{3}$ topologies.</description>

      <title>Local descriptions of the heterotic SU(3) moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heterotic $SU(3)$ system, also known as the Hull--Strominger system, arises from compactifications of heterotic string theory to six dimensions. This paper investigates the local structure of the moduli space of solutions to this system on a compact 6-manifold $X$, using a vector bundle $Q=(T^{1,0}X)^* \oplus {End}(E) \oplus T^{1,0}X$, where $E\to X$ is the classical gauge bundle arising in the system. We establish that the moduli space has an expected dimension of zero. We achieve this by studying the deformation complex associated to a differential operator $\bar{D}$, which emulates a holomorphic structure on $Q$, and demonstrating an isomorphism between the two cohomology groups which govern the infinitesimal deformations and obstructions in the deformation theory for the system. We also provide a Dolbeault-type theorem linking these cohomology groups to \v{C}ech cohomology, a result which might be of independent interest, as well as potentially valuable for future research.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as powerful observables for probing the fragmentation dynamics of high-energy collisions. We introduce the first numerical strategy for calculating energy correlators using the Hamiltonian lattice approach, providing access to the intriguing nonperturbative dynamics of these observables. Furthermore, motivated by rapid advances in quantum computing hardware and algorithms, we propose a quantum algorithm for calculating energy correlators in quantum field theories. This algorithm includes ground state preparation, the application of source, sink, energy flux and real-time evolution operators, and the Hadamard test. We validate our approach by applying it to the SU(2) pure gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on $3\times 3$ and $5\times 5$ honeycomb lattices with $j_{\rm max} = \frac{1}{2}$ at various couplings, utilizing both classical methods and the quantum algorithm, the latter tested using the IBM emulator for specific configurations. The results are consistent with the expected behavior of the strong coupling regime and motivate a more comprehensive study to probe the confinement dynamics across the weak and strong coupling regimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>
