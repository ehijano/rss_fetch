      <title>Flatness of $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and commutativity of Frobenius algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensor functor called $\alpha$-induction produces a new unitary fusion category from a Frobenius algebra, or a $Q$-system, in a braided unitary fusion category. A bi-unitary connection, which is a finite family of complex number subject to some axioms, realizes an object in any unitary fusion category. It also gives a characterization of a finite-dimensional nondegenerate commuting square in subfactor theory of Jones and realizes a certain $4$-tensor appearing in recent studies of $2$-dimensional topological order. We study $\alpha$-induction for bi-unitary connections, and show that flatness of the resulting $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections implies commutativity of the original Frobenius algebra. This gives a converse of our previous result and answers a question raised by R. Longo. We furthermore give finer correspondence between the flat parts of the $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and the commutative Frobenius subalgebras studied by B\"ockenhauer-Evans.</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter operators, differential operators, pre- and Novikov structures on groups and Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter operators on various structures have found important applications in diverse areas, from renormalization of quantum field theory to Yang-Baxter equations. Relative Rota-Baxter operators on Lie algebras are closely related to pre-Lie algebras and post-Lie algebras. Some of their group counterparts have been introduced to study post-groups, skew left braces and set-theoretic solutions of Yang-Baxter equations, but searching suitable notions of relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups with weight zero and pre-groups has been challenging and has been the focus of recent studies, by provisionally imposing an abelian condition.
  Arising from the works of Balinsky-Novikov and Gelfand-Dorfman, Novikov algebras and their constructions from differential commutative algebras have led to broad applications. Finding their suitable counterparts for groups and Lie algebras has also attracted quite much recent attention.
  This paper uses one-sided-inverse pairs of maps to give a perturbative approach to a general notion of relative Rota-Baxter operators and differential operators on a group and a Lie algebra with limit-weight. With the extra condition of limit-abelianess on the group or Lie algebra, we give an interpretation of relative Rota-Baxter and differential operators with weight zero. These operators motivate us to define pre-groups and Novikov groups respectively as the induced structures. The tangent maps of these operators are shown to give Rota-Baxter and differential operators with weight zero on Lie algebras. The tangent spaces of the pre-Lie and Novikov Lie groups are pre-Lie algebras and Novikov Lie algebras, fulfilling the expected property. Furthermore, limit-weight relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups give rise to skew left braces and then set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Commutative exact algebras and modular tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the study of vertex operator algebra extensions, we answer the question of when the category of local modules over a commutative exact algebra in a braided finite tensor category is a (non-semisimple) modular tensor category. Along the way we provide sufficient conditions for the category of local modules to be rigid, pivotal and ribbon. We also discuss two ways to construct such commutative exact algebras. The first is the class of simple current algebras and the second is using right adjoints of central tensor functors. Furthermore, we discuss Witt equivalence and its relation with extensions of VOAs.</description>

      <title>Amenable actions of compact and discrete quantum groups on von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05571v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a compact quantum group and $A\subseteq B$ an inclusion of $\sigma$-finite $\mathbb{G}$-dynamical von Neumann algebras. We prove that the $\mathbb{G}$-inclusion $A\subseteq B$ is strongly equivariantly amenable if and only if it is equivariantly amenable, using techniques from the theory of non-commutative $L^p$-spaces. In particular, if $(A, \alpha)$ is a $\mathbb{G}$-dynamical von Neumann algebra with $A$ $\sigma$-finite, the action $\alpha: A \curvearrowleft \mathbb{G}$ is strongly (inner) amenable if and only if the action $\alpha: A \curvearrowleft \mathbb{G}$ is (inner) amenable. By duality, we also obtain the same result for $\mathbb{G}$ a discrete quantum group, so that, in particular, a discrete quantum group is inner amenable if and only it is strongly inner amenable. This result can be seen as a dynamical generalization of Tomatsu's result on the amenability/co-amenability duality. We also provide the first explicit examples of amenable discrete quantum groups that act non-amenably on a von Neumann algebra.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebra and the duality operation for $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06191v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the space $C(\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q))$ of complex invariant functions on $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$, through a Hopf algebra viewpoint. First, we consider a variant notion of Zelevinsky's PSH algebra defined over the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. In particular, we show that two specific $\mathbb{R}$-lattices inside the complex Hopf algebra $\bigoplus_nC(\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q))$ are real PSH algebras, and that they do not descend to $\mathbb{Z}$. Then, among consequences, we prove that every element in $C(\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q))$ is a linear combination of Harish-Chandra inductions of Kawanaka's pre-cuspidal functions, and give a conceptual characterisation of duality operation for $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$, which in turn allows us to give a new proof of a classical result of Kawanaka.</description>

      <title>Conformal limits in Cayley components and $\Theta$-positive opers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Gaiotto's conformal limit for the $G^{\mathbb{R}}$-Hitchin equations, when $G^{\mathbb{R}}$ is a simple real Lie group admitting a $\Theta$-positive structure. We identify a family of flat connections coming from certain solutions to the equations for which the conformal limit exists and admits the structure of an oper. We call this new class of opers appearing in the conformal limit $\Theta$-positive opers. The two families involved are parameterized by the same base space. This space is a generalization of the base of Hitchin's integrable system in the case when the structure group is a split real group.</description>

      <title>Classical freeness of orthosymplectic affine vertex superalgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of when a vertex algebra is a quantization of the arc space of its associated scheme has recently received a lot of attention in both the mathematics and physics literature. This property was first studied by Tomoyuki Arakawa and Anne Moreau [Lectures on $\mathcal{W}$-algebras, Australian Representation Theory Workshop 2016, University of Melbourne], and was given the name "classical freeness" by Jethro van Ekeren and Reimundo Heluani in their work on chiral homology [Comm. Math. Phys. 386 (2021), no. 1, 495-550]. Later, it was extended to vertex superalgebras by Hao Li [Eur. J. Math. 7 (2021), 1689-1728]. In this note, we prove the classical freeness of the simple affine vertex superalgebra $L_n(\mathfrak{osp}_{m|2r})$ for all positive integers $m,n,r$ satisfying $-\frac{m}{2} + r +n+1 &gt; 0$. In particular, it holds for the rational vertex superalgebras $L_n(\mathfrak{osp}_{1|2r})$ for all positive integers $r,n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zhang twists are a common tool for deforming graded algebras over a field in a way that preserves important ring-theoretic properties. We generalize Zhang twists to the setting of closed monoidal categories equipped with their self-enriched structure. Along the way, we prove several key results about algebraic structures in closed monoidal categories missing from the literature. We use these to ultimately prove Morita-type results, showcasing when graded algebras with equivalent categories of graded modules can be related by Zhang twists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A closed subgroup $G\subset_uU_N^+$ is called easy when its associated Tannakian category $C_{kl}=Hom(u^{\otimes k},u^{\otimes l})$ appears from a category of partitions, $C=span(D)$ with $D=(D_{kl})\subset P$, via the standard implementation of partitions as linear maps. The examples abound, and the main known subgroups $G\subset U_N^+$ are either easy, or not far from being easy. We discuss here the basic theory, examples and known classification results for the easy quantum groups $G\subset U_N^+$, as well as various generalizations of the formalism, known as super-easiness theories, and the unification problem for them.</description>

Abstract: Given a noncommutative Hamiltonian space $A$, we show that the conjecture ``{\it quantization commutes with reduction}'' holds on $A$. We also construct a semi-product algebra $A \rtimes \mG^A$, equivariant sheaves on the representation space are related to left $A \rtimes \mG^A$-modules. In the quiver setting, via the quantum and classical trace maps, we establish the explicit correspondence between quantizations on a preprojective algebra and those on a quiver variety.</description>

      <title>Borel and parabolic-type subalgebras of the lattice vertex operator algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study new classes of subVOAs of the lattice vertex operator algebra, which we call the Borel and parabolic-type subVOAs. These CFT-type VOAs, which are not necessarily strongly finitely generated, satisfy properties similar to the usual Borel and parabolic subalgebras of a Lie algebra and lead to a new definition of induced modules for VOAs. For the lowest-rank examples of Borel-type subVOAs $V_{B}$ of $V_{\Z\al}$, and one typical lowest-rank example of the parabolic-type subVOA $V_P$ of the lattice VOA $V_{A_2}$ associated to the root lattice $A_2$, we explicitly determine their Zhu's algebras $A(V_B)$ and $A(V_P)$ in terms of generators and relations. Using the descriptions of $A(V_B)$ and $A(V_P)$, we classify the irreducible modules over $V_B$ and $V_P$ and explicitly determine the induced modules for these examples.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Tsetlin modules in the Coulomb context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.05415v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper gives a new perspective on the theory of principal Galois orders, as developed by Futorny, Ovsienko, Hartwig, and others. Every principal Galois order can be written as $eFe$ for any idempotent $e$ in an algebra $F$, which we call a flag Galois order; and in most important cases we can assume that these algebras are Morita equivalent. These algebras have the property that the completed algebra controlling the fiber over a maximal ideal has the same form as a subalgebra in a skew group ring, which gives a new perspective to a number of results about these algebras.
  We also discuss how this approach relates to the study of Coulomb branches in the sense of Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima, which are particularly beautiful examples of principal Galois orders. These include most of the interesting examples of principal Galois orders, such as $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$. In this case, all the objects discussed have a geometric interpretation, which endows the category of Gelfand-Tsetlin modules with a graded lift and allows us to interpret the classes of simple Gelfand-Tsetlin modules in terms of dual canonical bases for the Grothendieck group. In particular, we classify the Gelfand-Tsetlin modules over $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ and relate their characters to a generalization of Leclerc's shuffle expansion for dual canonical basis vectors.
  Finally, as an application, we disprove a conjecture of Mazorchuk, showing that the fiber over a maximal ideal of the Gelfand-Tsetlin subalgebra appearing in a finite-dimensional representation has an infinite-dimensional module in its fiber for $n\geq 6$.</description>
