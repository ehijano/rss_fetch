      <title>Nuclear spin-free 70Ge/28Si70Ge quantum well heterostructures grown on industrial SiGe-buffered wafers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence of hole spin qubits in germanium planar heterostructures is limited by the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin bath due to 29Si and 73Ge isotopes. Thus, removing these nuclear spin-full isotopes is essential to extend the hyperfine-limited coherence times needed to implement robust quantum processors. This work demonstrates the epitaxial growth of device-grade nuclear spin-free 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures on industrial SiGe buffers while minimizing the amounts of highly purified 70GeH4 and 28SiH4 used. The obtained 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures exhibit a dislocation density of 5.3 x 10e6 cm-2 and an isotopic purity exceeding 99.99%, with carbon and oxygen impurities below the detection sensitivity, as revealed by atom probe tomography. Magnetotransport measurements on gated Hall bars demonstrate effective gate control of hole density in nuclear spin-free quantum wells. Negative threshold gate voltages confirm the absence of intentional doping in the wells, while Hall and Shubnikov-de Haas analyses yield consistent carrier densities (1.4 x 10e11 cm-2) and high mobilities (2.4 x 10e5 cm2/Vs). Mobility trends reveal interfacetrap- limited scattering and percolation concentration below 7 x 10e10 cm-2. These analyses, along with atomic-level studies, confirm the high quality of epitaxial 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures and their relevance as a platform for long-coherence spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Posterior corrections for systematic distortions in atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital images from crystals, as projected from the third spatial dimension and recorded in atomic resolution with any kind of real-world microscope, feature necessarily broken symmetries of the translation-periodicity-restricted Euclidean plane. The symmetry breakings are due to both the imaging process and the real structure of the imaged crystal, with the former cause typically dominating. A posterior algorithmic reduction of the symmetry breaking in such images constitutes, thus, often a correction for many of the distortions that were introduced by the imaging processes. Numerically quantified restorations of such symmetries can, therefore, be used to demonstrate the efficacy of a newly implemented posterior correction method for atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals. Recently developed information theory based methods are here shown to be suitable for this purpose. Thirteen experimental atomic-resolution images from graphite and monolayer molybdenite (MoS2), as respectively obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy in the torsional resonance mode, and aberration-corrected parallel illumination transmission electron microscopy served as test cases in our larger (in its totality so far unpublished) study, from which we quote here. The source code of the software that was used for our distortion corrections and the whole report on that study are freely available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of charged and neutral density functional formulations for correcting the many-body self-interaction of polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron self-interaction problem in density functional theory affects the accurate modeling of polarons, particularly their localization and formation energy. Charged and neutral density functional formulations have been developed to address this issue, yet their relationship remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate their equivalence in treating the many-body self-interaction of the polaron state. In particular, we connect with each other piecewise-linear functionals based on adding an extra charge to the supercell, the pSIC approach derived from the energetics of the neutral defect with polaronic distortions in a supercell, and the unit-cell method for polarons based on electron-phonon couplings. We show that these approaches lead to the same formal expression of the self-interaction corrected energy, which is fully defined by the energetics of the neutral charge state of the charged polaronic structure. Residual differences between these methods solely arise from the achieved polaronic structure, which is affected by different treatments of electron-screening and finite-size effects. We apply these methods to a set of prototypical small hole and electron polarons, including the hole polaron in MgO, the hole polaron in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, the $V_\text{k}$ center in NaI, the electron polaron in BiVO$_4$, and the electron polaron in TiO$_2$. We show that the ground-state properties of polarons obtained using charged and neutral density functional formulations are in excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spin Coating: Homogeneous All-Inorganic Perovskite Films via High-Pressure Recrystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications owing to their outstanding optical and electronic properties. Among them, all-inorganic perovskites such as CsPbBr$_3$ offer superior thermal and chemical stability. However, obtaining high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ thin films via solution processing remains challenging due to the precursor's low solubility, and current additive or solvent engineering strategies are often complex and poorly reproducible. High-pressure recrystallization has recently emerged as a promising route to improve film quality, yet its impact on film properties remains insufficiently explored. Here, we systematically investigate the morphological, structural, and optical properties of CsPbBr$_3$ thin films prepared by high-pressure recrystallization, in comparison with standard non-recrystallized films. Optimized recrystallization at 300 bar produces smooth, pinhole-free, single-phase 3D perovskite layers with sub-nanometer roughness, while the film thickness is precisely tunable via precursor concentration. The process enhances both grain and crystallite sizes, leading to amplified spontaneous emission with a reduced excitation threshold and improved photostability. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction further reveals the orthorhombic--tetragonal--cubic phase transition, consistent with single-crystal behavior. This study provides fundamental insights into pressure-driven recrystallization and establishes a reproducible, scalable approach for fabricating high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ films for optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Hybridization Gap and Edge States in Strain-layer InAs/In0.5Ga0.5Sb Quantum Spin Hall Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybridization gap in strained-layer InAs/InxGa1-xSb quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) is significantly enhanced compared to binary InAs/GaSb QSHI structures, where the typical indium composition, x, ranges between 0.2 and 0.4. This enhancement prompts a critical question: to what extent can quantum wells (QWs) be strained while still preserving the fundamental QSHI phase? In this study, we demonstrate the controlled molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of highly strained-layer QWs with an indium composition of x = 0.5. These structures possess a substantial compressive strain within the In0.5Ga0.5Sb QW. Detailed crystal structure analyses confirm the exceptional quality of the resulting epitaxial films, indicating coherent lattice structures and the absence of visible dislocations. Transport measurements further reveal that the QSHI phase in InAs/In0.5Ga0.5Sb QWs is robust and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Notably, the edge states in these systems exhibit giant magnetoresistance when subjected to a modest perpendicular magnetic field. This behavior is in agreement with the Z2 topological property predicted by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, confirming the preservation of topologically protected edge transport in the presence of enhanced bulk strain.</description>

      <title>From data to design: Random forest regression model for predicting mechanical properties of alloy steel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Random Forest Regression for predicting mechanical properties of alloy steel-Elongation, Tensile Strength, and Yield Strength-from material composition features including Iron (Fe), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), Manganese (Mn), Silicon (Si), Copper (Cu), Carbon (C), and deformation percentage during cold rolling. Utilizing a dataset comprising these features, we trained and evaluated the Random Forest model, achieving high predictive performance as evidenced by R2 scores and Mean Squared Errors (MSE). The results demonstrate the model's efficacy in providing accurate predictions, which is validated through various performance metrics including residual plots and learning curves. The findings underscore the potential of ensemble learning techniques in enhancing material property predictions, with implications for industrial applications in material science.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Driven Phase Evolution and Optoelectronic Properties of Lead-free Halide Perovskite Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural, vibrational, and optical properties of Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$ have been investigated under high pressure using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), and optical absorption measurements. At ambient conditions, Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$ crystallizes in the cubic Fm-3m structure, which remains stable below 8.0 GPa. Within this pressure range, subtle inter-octahedral rotations develop, producing a gradual localized deviation from the ideal cubic framework. This local reorientation facilitates radiative recombination, leading to a pronounced enhancement of PL intensity with pressure up to 2.4 GPa. Beyond this pressure point, enhancement of nonradiative relaxation channels result in gradual PL quenching. Additionally, the PL intensity increases upon the application of an external weak magnetic field. A structural transition to the orthorhombic Pnnm phase occurs at around 8.0 GPa, followed by a monoclinic P$2_1/m$ phase above 10.7 GPa, and eventual amorphization beyond 25.5 GPa. Optical absorption spectra reveal continuous band-gap narrowing upon compression. These findings demonstrate the strong coupling among lattice dynamics, electronic structure, and optical response in Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$, underscoring its potential as a pressure-tunable optoelectronic material</description>

      <title>$C_{3}$-Symmetry-induced Antisymmetric Planar Hall effect and Magnetoresistance in Single-Crystalline Ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar Hall effect (PHE) is typically symmetric under magnetic field reversal, as required by the Onsager reciprocity relations. Recent advances have identified the antisymmetric PHE (under magnetic field reversal) as an intriguing extension in magnetic systems. While new mechanisms have been proposed, the role of conventional anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in this phenomenon remains unclear. Here, we report the experimental discovery of an antisymmetric (with respect to both magnetic field and magnetization) PHE and magnetoresistance in single-crystal $Co_{30}Pt_{70}$ (111) thin films with $C_{3}$ rotational symmetry and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). We demonstrate that both antisymmetric effects arise naturally from the intrinsic fourth-rank AMR tensor inherent to C3-symmetric planes, assisted by PMA. Our findings link conventional AMR to antisymmetric galvanomagnetic responses, offering new insights into symmetry-governed transport in crystalline ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Strain-Tunable Opto-electronics in PdS$_2$ Monolayer: the Role of Band Nesting and Carrier-Phonon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain engineering is a powerful strategy for tuning the optoelectronic properties in two-dimensional materials, yet the underlying mechanisms governing their strain response are often not fully elucidated. In this work, our first-principle calculations show that the penta-orthorhombic PdS$_2$ monolayer exhibits two key strain-tunable properties: a continuous redshift of its main optical absorption peak from $\sim$2.0 to $\sim$1.6~eV and enhancement in carrier mobility, with a more than threefold increase for electron under 0--4\% biaxial tensile strain. Subsequent analysis reveals that the tunable optical response originates from a robust band nesting feature between the highest valence and lowest conduction bands, which is preserved across the Brillouin zone under biaxial strain. For the carrier transport, deformation potential theory predicts mobility increasing with strain, strongly correlating with the reduction of carrier effective mass. Our first-principles calculations show a strain-induced monotonic decrease in carrier linewidths near the band edges, indicating suppressed carrier-phonon scattering and longer carrier lifetime as the origin of the mobility enhancement. Our work establishes a pathway for engineering the optoelectronic response in 2D semiconductors where strong band nesting governs the optical properties and paves the way for the rational design of continuously tunable flexible optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Parity Anomalous Semimetal with Minimal Conductivity Induced by an In-Plane Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between topological materials and local symmetry breaking gives rise to diverse topological quantum phenomena. A notable example is the parity anomalous semimetal (PAS), which hosts a single unpaired gapless Dirac cone with a half-integer quantized Hall conductivity. Here, we realize this phase in a magnetic topological sandwich structure by applying an in-plane magnetic field. This configuration aligns the magnetization of one surface in-plane while preserving magnetization out-of-plane on the opposite surface, satisfying the condition for a gapless surface state near the Fermi level on only one surface. Our key evidence is a distinctive two-stage evolution of the conductivity tensor ($\sigma_{xy}$, $\sigma_{xx}$). The first stage culminates in the PAS at the fixed point ($\frac{e^2}{2h}$, $m \frac{e^2}{h}$), where $m \approx 0.6$ corresponds to the minimal longitudinal conductivity of a single gapless Dirac cone of fermions on a 2D lattice. This PAS state remains stabilized and is superposed with a gapped band flow in the second stage. This observation demonstrates that this state stabilized by the in-plane field resists localization--contrary to conventional expectations for 2D electron systems with broken time reversal symmetry. The dynamic transition from an integer quantized insulator to a half-integer quantized semimetal establishes this material system as a versatile platform for exploring parity anomaly physics.</description>

      <title>Non-altermagnetic spin texture in MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, altermagnets have emerged as promising candidates in spintronics, uniquely combining large spin-polarized electronic states with zero net magnetization. A prominent example is $\alpha$-MnTe, whose altermagnetic spin splitting, i.e., the degeneracy lift in momentum space induced by collinear magnetic order, has been experimentally observed. However, the direct evidence of its $g$-wave spin polarization, the key property for altermagnetic spintronics, is thus far lacking. By combining high-resolution spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) with first-principles calculations, we reveal a $k_z$-independent, Rashba-like spin texture in $\alpha$-MnTe. Our results indicate that the observed spin polarization is primarily governed by spin-orbit coupling, whereas the magnetic order contributes to the splitting of energy bands but plays a much less dominant role in spin polarization due to the multi-domain nature. From this result, we further establish a way to prescreen altermagnet candidates that favor the formation of large antiferromagnetic domains based on symmetry analysis. Our work elucidates the interplay between magnetic order and spin-orbit coupling in governing spin polarization in altermagnet candidates, and thereby advances the materials design paradigm for spin-functional devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast magnetic moment transfer and bandgap renormalization in monolayer FeCl$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02461v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization remains an open question, to which the non-thermal electronic distribution plays a vital role at the initial stage. Herein, we investigate the connection between the non-thermal electronic distribution and the ultrafast spin dynamics as well as the electronic structure evolution in ferromagnetic FeCl$_2$ monolayer using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) with self-consistent Hubbard $U$ correction. Our simulations reveal that femtosecond laser pulses induce ultrafast magnetic moment transfer from Fe to Cl atoms. More importantly, through a comprehensive analysis of orbital-resolved electronic structure, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this transfer, attributing it to specific intra-atomic and inter-atomic charge transfer pathways driven by non-thermal excitations. The extent of demagnetization of Fe atoms exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the laser photon energy, reaching a maximum at the resonant excitation. In addition, the dynamical evolution of the band structure was studied based on the eigenstates of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. Under resonant excitation, the bandgap reduction reaches up to $41\%$ within tens of fs. These findings provide fundamental insights into ultrafast spin control and suggest a strategy to optically engineer the magnetism in two-dimensional magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Mean field magnetism and spin frustration in a double perovskite oxide with compositional complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of high-entropy oxides as a major functional materials design principle in recent years has prompted us to investigate how compositional disorder affects long-range magnetic ordering in double perovskite oxides. Since ferromagnetic insulators are emerging as an important platform for lossless spintronics, we consider the $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$ ($RE$ : rare-earth) family and investigate single-crystalline films of (La$_{0.4}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sm$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.4}$Y$_{0.4}$)NiMnO$_{6}$ grown on SrTiO$_3$ (001) substrates in this work. Despite configurational disorder and high cationic size variance at the $RE$ site, the material exhibits robust ferromagnetic ordering with a Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) of approximately 150 K. This $T_\mathrm{c}$ is consistent with the expectation based on consideration of the average ionic radii of the rare-earth ($RE$) sites in the bulk $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$. Below $T_\mathrm{c}$, Raman spectroscopy measurement finds a deviation from anharmonic behavior, where the phonon renormalization aligns with a mean-field approximation of spin-spin correlation. At lower temperature, magnetic $RE$ ions also contributed to the magnetic behavior and the system displays a reentrant spin-glass-like behavior. This study demonstrates that while a mean-field approach serves as a viable starting point for predicting the long-range transition temperature, microscopic details of the complex magnetic interactions are essential for understanding the low-temperature phase.</description>

      <title>First-principles Prediction of Carrier Mobility in Semiconductor Nanowires Based on the Spatially Dependent Boltzmann Transport Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrier mobility in bulk semiconductors is typically governed by electron-phonon (e-ph) scattering. In nanostructures, spatial confinement can lead to significant surface scattering, lowering mobility and breaking the spatial homogeneity assumption of conventional models. In this work, a fully ab initio framework based on the spatially dependent Boltzmann transport equation for one-dimensional nanowires is developed. We apply it to Si and GaN assuming diffusive surface scattering, and reveal the mobility-diameter relation: $\mu_\mathrm{1D} = \mu_\mathrm{bulk} \left[1-\left(d/d_0\right)^{-\beta}\right]$. The parameter $d_0$, comparable to the carrier mean free path, defines a boundary layer exhibiting a considerable mobility gradient, and also quantifies the competition between e-ph and surface scattering together with $\beta$. We further discuss the effects of orientation, cross-sectional shape, and temperature. Moreover, experimental data are generally lower than our predictions, possibly due to structural imperfections, systematic errors from measurements, etc. Therefore, our theoretical method can provide an intrinsic benchmark toward optimized experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Suppression of auxetic behavior in black phosphorus with sulfur substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfur-doped black phosphorus (b-P) has recently emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic technologies owing to its enhanced environmental stability and tunable electronic properties. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of sulfur substitution on the elastic, mechanical, and electronic properties of b-P, with a particular focus on its auxetic behavior (that is, negative Poisson's ratio), using first-principles density functional theory calculations. Our results unveil the fundamental origin of the intrinsic auxetic response in pristine b-P and elucidate how sulfur incorporation alters this behavior. We find that sulfur atoms distort the characteristic bow-tie structural motif responsible for the negative Poisson's ratio in b-P, thereby suppressing the in-plane auxeticity. Moreover, the resulting charge redistribution also effectively quenches the out-of-plane auxetic response of b-P. With increasing sulfur content, the bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio increase, whereas the Young's modulus, shear modulus, and Debye temperature decrease. Additionally, sulfur substitution suppresses the semiconducting properties of b-P, giving rise to metallicity. These findings highlight that although sulfur substitution enhances the environmental stability of b-P, it also substantially modifies its elastic and mechanical properties, particularly the auxetic behavior, which is an important consideration in the design of nanoscale electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Exploring mechanisms leading to composition errors in monazite (CePO4) analysed with atom probe tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monazite (CePO4) is widely used in U-Th-Pb geochronology due to its reliable age determinations, although isotopic disturbances often require nanoscale investigation to better understand the mechanisms at play. Atom Probe Tomography (APT) offers unique capabilities for nanoscale chemical analysis and 3D atomic reconstruction but presents challenges for insulating materials such as CePO4, particularly due to oxygen loss during field evaporation. This study investigates the effects of laser wavelength, energy, metallic coatings and detection device on mass spectrum optimization and compositional accuracy in synthetic CePO4 samples. Results show that shorter laser wavelengths (260 nm) enhance peak resolution, particularly when combined with advanced reflectron configurations, as demonstrated with the LEAP 6000 XR. Chromium coatings further improve thermal dissipation and reduce noise levels. However, compositional measurements reveal systematic underestimation of oxygen and overestimation of P and Ce, likely influenced by preferential low-field element evaporation. These findings highlight the need to carefully tune experimental parameters to mitigate quantification biases and enhance the reliability of APT analyses for geological materials.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversed Superfluorescence in a Polaronic Quantum Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superfluorescence, the cooperative burst of spontaneous emission from an ensemble of dipoles, arises when microscopic oscillators spontaneously synchronize their phases. Here we show that this process can be reversed in time within quantum materials. Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy of halide perovskite quantum dots reveals a delayed cooperative absorption burst, the mirror image of superfluorescent emission, driven by transient polaron fields that phase-lock unit-cell dipoles within 100 fs. The effect scales systematically with quantum-dot size and halide composition, reaching near-unity coherence fidelity even at 300 K. A microscopic exciton-polaron model reproduces the buildup and decay of the coherent state, identifying lattice polarons as the mediators of synchronization. These results demonstrate that many-body temporal coherence can self-organize and persist at room temperature, opening routes toward engineered collective optical states and superabsorbing quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Bandgap Engineering On Demand in GaAsN Nanowires by Post-Growth HydrogennImplantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bandgap engineering in semiconductors is required for the development of photonic and optoelectronic devices with optimized absorption and emission energies. This is usually achieved by changing the chemical or structural composition during growth or by dynamically applying strain. Here, the bandgap in GaAsN nanowires grown on Si is increased post-growth by up to 460 meV in a reversible, tunable, and non-destructive manner through H implantation. Such a bandgap tunability is unattained in epilayers and enabled by relaxed strain requirements in nanowire heterostructures, which enables N concentrations of up to 4.2% in core-shell GaAs/GaAsN/GaAs nanowires resulting in a GaAsN bandgap as low as 0.97 eV. Using micro-photoluminescence measurements on individual nanowires, it is shown that the high bandgap energy of GaAs at 1.42 eV is restored by hydrogenation through formation of N-H complexes. By carefully optimizing the hydrogenation conditions, the photoluminescence efficiency increases by an order of magnitude. Moreover, by controlled thermal annealing, the large shift of the bandgap is not only made reversible, but also continuously tuned by breaking up N-H complexes in the hydrogenated GaAsN. Finally, local bandgap tuning by laser annealing is demonstrated, opening up new possibilities for developing novel, locally and energy-controlled quantum structures in GaAsN nanowires.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Electron Transfer in the Adiabatic Limit of the Marcus-Inverted Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling. This "forbidden" behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region.</description>

      <title>Delta-learned force fields for nonbonded interactions: Addressing the strength mismatch between covalent-nonbonded interaction for global models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncovalent interactions--vdW dispersion, hydrogen/halogen bonding, ion-$\pi$, and $\pi$-stacking--govern structure, dynamics, and emergent phenomena in materials and molecular systems, yet accurately learning them alongside covalent forces remains a core challenge for machine-learned force fields (MLFFs). This challenge is acute for global models that use Coulomb-matrix (CM) descriptors compared under Euclidean/Frobenius metrics in multifragment settings. We show that the mismatch between predominantly covalent force labels and the CM's overrepresentation of intermolecular features biases single-model training and degrades force-field fidelity. To address this, we introduce \textit{$\Delta$-sGDML}, a scale-aware formulation within the sGDML framework that explicitly decouples intra- and intermolecular physics by training fragment-specific models alongside a dedicated binding model, then composing them at inference. Across benzene dimers, host-guest complexes (C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, NO$_3^-$@i-corona[6]arene), benzene-water, and benzene-Na$^+$, \mbox{$\Delta$-sGDML} delivers consistent gains over a single global model, with fragment-resolved force-error reductions up to \textbf{75\%}, without loss of energy accuracy. Furthermore, molecular-dynamics simulations further confirm that the $\Delta$-model yields a reliable force field for C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, producing stable trajectories across a wide range of temperatures (10-400~K), unlike the single global model, which loses stability above $\sim$200~K. The method offers a practical route to homogenize per-fragment errors and recover reliable noncovalent physics in global MLFFs.</description>

      <title>Towards Defect Phase Diagrams: From Research Data Management to Automated Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defect phase diagrams provide a unified description of crystal defect states for materials design and are central to the scientific objectives of the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 1394. Their construction requires the systematic integration of heterogeneous experimental and simulation data across research groups and locations. In this setting, research data management (RDM) is a key enabler of new scientific insight by linking distributed research activities and making complex data reproducible and reusable.
  To address the challenge of heterogeneous data sources and formats, a comprehensive RDM infrastructure has been established that links experiment, data, and analysis in a seamless workflow. The system combines: (1) a joint electronic laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system, (2) easy-to-use large-object data storage, (3) automatic metadata extraction from heterogeneous and proprietary file formats, (4) interactive provenance graphs for data exploration and reuse, and (5) automated reporting and analysis workflows. The two key technological elements are the openBIS electronic laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system, and a newly developed companion application that extends openBIS with large-scale data handling, automated metadata capture, and federated access to distributed research data.
  This integrated approach reduces friction in data capture and curation, enabling traceable and reusable datasets that accelerate the construction of defect phase diagrams across institutions.</description>

      <title>COFAP: A Universal Framework for COFs Adsorption Prediction through Designed Multi-Modal Extraction and Cross-Modal Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features. However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly deployable in crystalline porous materials.</description>

      <title>Edge Irregularity Strength: A Complementary Descriptor to Topological Indices in QSPR and QSAR Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In chemical graph theory, topological indices are widely used as numerical descriptors for establishing quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). These indices successfully correlate molecular structure with various physicochemical and biological properties. In addition to these methods, the concept of edge irregularity strength, a graph labeling measure, offers another perspective for representing structural characteristics. In this context, the edge irregularity strength concept provides a systematic way of assigning numerical labels to atoms based on specific rules. In this work, we explore the chemical applicability of the edge irregularity strength and demonstrate that it can also serve as a predictive tool for physicochemical properties, similar to topological indices. The findings show that the edge irregularity strength captures molecular features and complements existing approaches to structure-property analysis in chemical graph theory.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic perturbation theory of the exact factorisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel nonadiabatic perturbation theory (NAPT) for correlated systems of electrons and nuclei beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. The essence of the method is to exploit the smallness of the electronic-to-nuclear mass ratio by treating the electron-nuclear correlation terms in the electronic equation of motion of the exact factorisation (EF) framework as perturbation. We prove that any finite-order truncation of the NAPT preserves the normalisation of the conditional electronic factor as well as the gauge covariance of the resulting perturbative equations of motion. We illustrate the usefulness of NAPT by obtaining nonadiabatic corrections to the BO Berry phase in Jahn--Teller systems with a conical intersection. It well captures the departure of the exact Berry phase from being topological via the lowest-order NAPT. By removing the conical intersection with a constant gap, it further yields the correct scaling of the Berry phase toward zero.</description>

      <title>Extending Reflectometry Range, A Zero-Crossing Algorithm for Thick Film Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and high-efficiency film metrology remains a key challenge in High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM), where conventional spectroscopic reflectometry and white light interferometry (WLI) are either limited by model dependence or throughput. In this work, we extend the measurable film-thickness range of reflectometry to at least 50 um through a new model-free algorithm, the Linearized Reflectance Zero-Crossing (LRZ) method. The approach builds upon the previously reported Linearized Reflectance Extrema (LRE) technique but eliminates the sensitivity to spectral sampling and fringe attenuation that degrade performance in the thick-film regime. By linearizing phase response and extracting zero-crossing positions in wavenumber space, LRZ provides robust and repeatable thickness estimation without iterative fitting, achieving comparable accuracy with much higher computational efficiency than conventional model-based methods. Validation using more than 80 measurements on alumina films over NiFe substrates shows excellent correlation with WLI (r = 0.97) and low gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&amp;R &lt; 3%). Moreover, LRZ achieves an average Move-Acquire-Measure (MAM) time of approximately 2 s, which is about 7 times faster than WLI. The proposed method enables fast, accurate, and model-independent optical metrology for thick films, offering a practical solution for advanced HVM process control.</description>

      <title>Role of on-site Coulomb energy and negative-charge transfer in a Dirac semi-metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in combination with band structure calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, there are conflicting conclusions in the literature regarding the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$. We study the core-level and valence band electronic structure of single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ resonant photoemission spectroscopy(resonant-PES) to quantify electronic parameters in NiTe$_2$. The on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) in the Ni $3d$ states is quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS spectra are analyzed by charge transfer cluster model calculations using the experimentally estimated $U_{dd}$ (= 3.7 eV), and the results show that NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative charge-transfer energy ($\Delta$ = -2.8 eV). The same type of cluster model analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known strongly correlated charge-transfer insulator character, with $U_{dd}$ = 7.0 eV and $\Delta$ = 6.0 eV. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for NiTe$_2$$&lt;$NiO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO is not due to an increase in $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron is attributed to negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$. However, since $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$|\Delta|$, the results indicate the important role of a finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ in making NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated $p$-type Dirac semi-metal.</description>

      <title>Unlocking n-alk-1-ynes Conformers: Quantum "Trigger Finger" versus "Stiff Joint" Conformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular conformation in n-alk-1-ynes (CnA) is conventionally simplified to an all-planar structure. We report a comprehensive quantum chemical analysis revealing two near-isoenergetic rotamers at the acetylenic terminus: planar (C$_s$) and skewed (C$_1$). The high, symmetric rotational energy barrier ($\approx 150$\,meV) arises from unique steric relief near the $\mathrm{sp}$ center coupled with electronic stabilization of C$_1$. This creates a unique kinetic profile: a Quantum ``Trigger Finger'' ($\alpha$ rotation) that enforces an $\approx 50\%:\,50\%$ $\mathrm{C}_s/\mathrm{C}_1$ ensemble, sharply contrasting with the thermodynamically biased ``Stiff Joint'' ($\delta$ rotation) of the alkyl chain. This structural degeneracy necessitates ensemble averaging for spectroscopic data interpretation, while the slow interconversion permits kinetic trapping and intentional conformer enrichment during synthesis and molecular junction fabrication. Our work redefines the alkyne anchor, providing a blueprint for accurate interpretation of spectroscopic data and achieving conformational control in molecular electronics.</description>

      <title>Adhesive strength of bio-inspired fibrillar arrays in the presence of contact defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of bio-inspired fibrillar adhesives can be compromised by surface roughness, manufacturing imperfections or impurities. Previous studies investigated the cases of distributed defects on the array, and defects at the level of single fibrils. However, the influence of localized, macroscopic defects remains largely unexplored. Using numerical simulations of a discrete mechanical model for a fibrillar adhesive with a thick backing layer, we investigate how the size and location of a single circular defect affect the established scaling law between the adhesion force ($F$) and the effective compliance of the system ($\beta$), \ie, $F \propto \beta^{-1/2}$. We find that edge defects are generally more detrimental than central ones, as they act as pre-cracks that amplify stress concentrations at the adhesive's edge, accelerating a crack-like failure. Consequently, the established adhesion scaling law is preserved, with the defect only reducing the effective contact area. In contrast, a central defect fundamentally alters the mechanics of detachment. By transforming the contact geometry into an annulus, it promotes more uniform load sharing across the remaining fibrils and mitigates the edge-dominated failure mechanism. This change makes the adhesive strength less sensitive to the compliance of the system, as reflected by a less negative scaling exponent. The transition between these two regimes appears to occur for defects whose boundary merges with the one of the adhesive. These results provide practical guidance for the design, engineering and quality control of bio-inspired fibrillar adhesives.</description>

      <title>Structure-property relation in the cuprates: a possible explanation for the pseudogap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a structure-property relation that could be key to the pseudogap phenomenology in cuprates. The underlying nonsymmorphic crystal structure in the low-temperature orthogonal phase endows the lattice with a sublattice structure that gives rise to two electronic bands near the Fermi surface. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the hybridization of these two bands generates small Fermi pockets and, correspondingly, a change in the number of free carriers. A sublattice structure also leads to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) matrix-element interference, naturally explaining the emergence of Fermi arcs and their consistency with closed Fermi pockets. We employ a symmetry analysis to highlight the expected Fermi surface properties, and complement it with density functional theory (DFT) for a quantitative discussion and comparison with recent experiments in doped La$_2$CuO$_4$. The proposed mechanism can consistently account for the most salient features of the pseudogap in the cuprates, namely, the Fermi surface reconstruction with the formation of small Fermi pockets and the corresponding change in carrier density, and the observation of Fermi arcs by ARPES.</description>

      <title>Model for charge-carriers spectra in topological semimetals of TaAs family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a four-bands model describing the electron energy spectra near the Weyl points in the topological semimetals of the TaAs family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs, NbP). This model takes into account the fact that these Weyl points result from the band-contact lines which would exist in the mirror-reflection planes of these materials if the spin-orbit interaction were absent in them. Within this model, we obtain conditions for the existence of the Weyl points, determine their positions in the Brillouin zone, and derive the explicit formula for dispersion of the bands along the straight line connecting the two close Weyl points with opposite topological charges. Using NbP as an example, the values of the parameters defining the model spectrum are found. The obtained results show that for the semimetals of the TaAs family, the charge-carriers spectrum in the vicinity of the two close Weyl points can be analyzed without complex band-structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Sliding and superlubric moir\'e twisting ferroelectric transition in HfO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite progress in HfO2 thin-film ferroelectrics, issues like high coercive fields persist, and the dynamics of twisted ferroelectricity remain largely unexplored. Here, we explore how sliding and twisting in bilayer HfO2 enables low barrier switching. Among 144 sliding configurations, two exhibit strong in-plane polarization (2360 pC/m) with a low switching barrier of 9.57 meV/f.u. Twisting generates polar textures associated with moir\'e patterns, which drive ferroelectricity via a soft zone-center mode, as revealed by machine-learning-assisted first-principles calculations. The in-plane (out-of-plane) polarization values for HfO2 at twist angles of 21.79{\deg}, 27.80{\deg}, and 46.83{\deg} are 430 (5.82), 367 (2.20), and 1057 (0.03) pC/m, respectively. For 21.79{\deg} and 27.80{\deg} twisting, switching barriers drop to 1.74 and 0.18 meV/f.u., indicating superlubric-like transitions. Notably, the 46.83{\deg} twisted bilayer shows an almost barrier-free polar evolution (0.03 meV /f.u.), attributed to sharply enhanced zone-center phonon linewidths. Our findings establish a moir\'e-engineered switching route for 2D ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>MicroLad: 2D-to-3D Microstructure Reconstruction and Generation via Latent Diffusion and Score Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets. Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies, hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data, effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation. Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural descriptors and material properties.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and polarization switching in quasi-one-dimensional organic ferroelectrics of phenyltetrazole family</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudospin models are proposed for description of the phase transitions, dielectric characteristics, and polarization switching in two crystals of the phenyltetrazole family. One of them, APHTZ, is a canted ferroelectric, whereas the other, MPHTZ is a simple antiferroelectric. In APHTZ the electric field, applied perpendicularly to the axis of spontaneous polarization, flips the polarization in one of the two sublattices, effectively rotating the non-zero net polarization by 90$^\circ$ and switching the system between two different ferroelectric configurations. The temperature-electric field phase diagrams are constructed. The diagram topology appears to be typical for the Ising-like antiferroelectric systems.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-Cost magnetocaloric compound for Cryogenic Cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cost-effective materials are essential for large-scale deployment. The emerging magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction technology could transform the liquid hydrogen industry due to its potential in achieving higher efficiency. Most studies of the cryogenic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have focused on resource-critical rare-earth-based compounds. Here we report on an ionic magnetocaloric compound FeCl$_2$ which is based on ultralow-cost elements, as a candidate working material for hydrogen liquefaction. FeCl$_2$ shows both inverse and conventional MCE. From 0 to 1.5 T, the inverse effect yields a positive magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_T$) of about 5 J/kg/K near 20 K, then declines toward zero at higher fields. In contrast, the conventional (negative) response strengthens with field. The $\Delta S_T$ reaches 18.6 J/kg/K near 20 K in magnetic fields of 5 T. This value exceeds most light rare-earth-based compounds and approaches that of heavy rare-earth-based compounds. In magnetic fields of 5 T, the adiabatic temperature change reaches about 3.6 K. The large $\Delta S_T$, along with the low cost of the elements in FeCl$_2$, are prerequisites for inexpensive industrial-scale production, giving the prospect of a practical magnetocaloric candidate for hydrogen liquefaction in the 20 $\sim$ 77 K temperature window.</description>

      <title>Are Foundational Atomistic Models Reliable for Finite-Temperature Molecular Dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields have emerged as promising tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, potentially offering quantum-mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of classical MD. Inspired by foundational large language models, recent years have seen considerable progress in developing foundational atomistic models, sometimes referred to as universal force fields, designed to cover most elements in the periodic table. This Perspective adopts a practitioner's viewpoint to ask a critical question: Are these foundational atomistic models reliable for one of their most compelling applications, in particular simulating finite-temperature dynamics? Instead of a broad benchmark, we use the canonical ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition in PbTiO$_3$ as a focused case study to evaluate prominent foundational atomistic models. Our findings suggest a potential disconnect between static accuracy and dynamic reliability. While 0 K properties are often well-reproduced, we observed that the models can struggle to consistently capture the correct phase transition, sometimes exhibiting simulation instabilities. We believe these challenges may stem from inherent biases in training data and a limited description of anharmonicity. These observed shortcomings, though demonstrated on a single system, appear to point to broader, systemic challenges that can be addressed with targeted fine-tuning. This Perspective serves not to rank models, but to initiate a crucial discussion on the practical readiness of foundational atomistic models and to explore future directions for their improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in low-dimensional systems is a cornerstone of modern spintronics, where achieving all-electrical control of spin currents is a major goal. Spin-orbit interactions provide a promising mechanism for such control, yet understanding how spin and charge transport emerge from microscopic principles remains a fundamental challenge. Here we develop a spin-dependent scattering matrix approach to describe spin and charge transport in a multiterminal system in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our framework generalizes the B\"uttiker formalism by offering explicit real-space expressions for spin and charge current densities, along with the corresponding linear response function. It simultaneously captures the effects of quantum confinement, the orbital response to external magnetic fields, and the intrinsic (geometric) properties of the electronic bands, offering a comprehensive description of the spin-charge interconversion mechanisms at play in a Hall bar, in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Dual-Polarization SHG Interferometry for Imaging Antiparallel Domains and Stacking Angles of 2D Heterocrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) enables orientational polarimetry for crystallographic analysis and domain imaging of various materials. However, conventional intensity polarimetry, which neglects phase information, fails to resolve antiparallel domains and to describe two-dimensional heterostructures, which represent a new class of van der Waals-bound composite crystals. In this work, we report dual-polarization spectral phase interferometry (DP-SPI) and establish a generalized SHG superposition model that incorporates the observables of DP-SPI. Antiparallel domains of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) were successfully imaged with distinction, validating the interferometric polarimetry. From DP interferograms of TMD heterobilayers, the orientation of each layer could be determined, enabling layer-resolved probing. By employing the superposition model, we also demonstrate the photonic design and fabrication of ternary TMD heterostructures for circularly polarized SHG. These methods, providing comprehensive SHG measurements and theoretical description, can be extended to heterostructures consisting of more than two constituent layers and are not limited to TMDs or 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: Spin-momentum locking (SML) excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors are appealing to programmable optical control of spin-polarized carriers in ultrafast spintronics. To address the current thirsty for long-lived excitons with zero-external-field stability and room-temperature spin-polarization, we hereby predict the existence of intrinsically SML excitons in altermagnetic V$_2 X_2$O ($X=$ S, Se) driven by giant non-relativistic spin-splittings ($&gt;$ 1.2 eV). First-principles calculations reveal SML excitons with binding energies exceeding 1400 meV in monolayers and 430 meV in their van der Waals heterobilayers, along with stacking-dependent optical selection rules for tunable interlayer excitons. These remarkable physical properties, combined with their long radiative lifetimes, strongly suggest the feasibility of SML excitons with robust spin-polarization at room temperature. Our work provides a new paradigm for SML exciton physics via the novel altermagnetism, opening up new possibilities for all-optical manipulation in advanced opto-spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Marcus theory of electron transfer assumes that diabatic energy gaps are sampled from a single ensemble. This assumption can break down in spatially anisotropic environments, such as Faradaic reactions at electrochemical interfaces, where distinct solvent ensembles arise along a collective variable describing the anisotropy. Treating this collective variable as an additional reaction coordinate linearly independent from the Marcus reaction coordinate, we develop a formalism that enables calculation of the resulting Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer (CIET) free-energy surface directly from constrained ab initio trajectories. Applied to CO2 redox on a gold electrode, this method reveals strong coupling to the anisotropy, predicting significantly different activation barriers compared to either coordinate alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membranes selective to ions of the same charge are increasingly sought for wastewater processing and valuable element recovery. However, while narrow channels are known to be essential, other membrane parameters remain difficult to identify and control. Here we show that Zr$^{4+}$, Sn$^{4+}$, Ir$^{4+}$, and La$^{3+}$ ions intercalated into vermiculite laminate membranes become effectively unexchangeable, creating stable channels, one to two water layers wide, that exhibit robust and tuneable ion selectivity. Ion permeability in these membranes spans five orders of magnitude, following a trend dictated by the ions' Gibbs free energy of hydration. Unexpectedly, different intercalated ions lead to two distinct monovalent ion selectivity sequences, despite producing channels of identical width. The selectivity instead correlates with the membranes' stiffness and the entropy of hydration of the intercalated ions. These results introduce a new ion selectivity mechanism driven by entropic and mechanical effects, beyond classical size and charge exclusion.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a model for characterizing porous, deformable media embedded with magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). These active fluids exhibit tunable mechanical and rheological properties that can be controlled through the application of a magnetic field, which induces a phase transition from a liquid to a solid-like state. This transition profoundly affects both stress transmission and fluid flow within the composite, leading to a behaviour governed by a well-defined threshold that depends on the ratio between the pore size and the characteristic size of clusters of magnetic particles, and can be triggered by adjusting the magnetic field intensity. These effects were confirmed through an experimental campaign conducted on a prototype composite obtained by imbibing a selected MRF into commercial sponges. To design and optimize this new class of materials, a linear poroelastic formulation is proposed and validated through comparison with experimental results. The constitutive relationships, i.e. overall elastic constitutive tensor and permeability, of the model are updated from phenomenological observations, exploiting the experimental data obtained for both the pure fluid and the composite material. The findings demonstrate that the proposed simplified formulation is sufficiently robust to predict and optimize the behaviour of porous media containing MRFs. Such materials hold significant promise for a wide range of engineering applications, including adaptive exosuits for human tissue and joint rehabilitation, as well as innovative structural systems.</description>

Abstract: The electronic properties of a material depend on the spatial freedom of the electron wavefunction. A well-known example is graphite, which is a conventional gapless semiconductor, while a single layer of it, graphene, exhibits extremely high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, graphene ribbons can have different physical properties, such as a tunable band gap, from gapless to large band gap semiconductor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the electronic structure of graphene few-layers composed of a layer of graphene nanoribbons and graphene sheet(s), where quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons can interact with two-dimensional sheet of graphite. Using the tight-binding model for graphite, we show how different configuration of such heterostructures can affect the electronic structure, in which is different from their components electronic structure. Namely, a gap of ~0.6 eV can be opened in a bilayer configuration composed of a layer of gapless armchair nanoribbon stacked on graphene.</description>
