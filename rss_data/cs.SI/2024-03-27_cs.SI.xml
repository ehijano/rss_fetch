      <title>Exploring the Boundaries of Ambient Awareness in Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient awareness refers to the ability of social media users to obtain knowledge about who knows what (i.e., users' expertise) in their network, by simply being exposed to other users' content (e.g, tweets on Twitter). Previous work, based on user surveys, reveals that individuals self-report ambient awareness only for parts of their networks. However, it is unclear whether it is their limited cognitive capacity or the limited exposure to diagnostic tweets (i.e., online content) that prevents people from developing ambient awareness for their complete network. In this work, we focus on in-wall ambient awareness (IWAA) in Twitter and conduct a two-step data-driven analysis, that allows us to explore to which extent IWAA is likely, or even possible. First, we rely on reactions (e.g., likes), as strong evidence of users being aware of experts in Twitter. Unfortunately, such strong evidence can be only measured for active users, which represent the minority in the network. Thus to study the boundaries of IWAA to a larger extent, in the second part of our analysis, we instead focus on the passive exposure to content generated by other users -- which we refer to as in-wall visibility. This analysis shows that (in line with \citet{levordashka2016ambient}) only for a subset of users IWAA is plausible, while for the majority it is unlikely, if even possible, to develop IWAA. We hope that our methodology paves the way for the emergence of data-driven approaches for the study of ambient awareness.</description>

      <title>Belief Samples Are All You Need For Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of social learning, where a group of agents embedded in a social network are interested in learning an underlying state of the world. Agents have incomplete, noisy, and heterogeneous sources of information, providing them with recurring private observations of the underlying state of the world. Agents can share their learning experience with their peers by taking actions observable to them, with values from a finite feasible set of states. Actions can be interpreted as samples from the beliefs which agents may form and update on what the true state of the world is. Sharing samples, in place of full beliefs, is motivated by the limited communication, cognitive, and information-processing resources available to agents especially in large populations. Previous work (Salhab et al.) poses the question as to whether learning with probability one is still achievable if agents are only allowed to communicate samples from their beliefs. We provide a definite positive answer to this question, assuming a strongly connected network and a ``collective distinguishability'' assumption, which are both required for learning even in full-belief-sharing settings. In our proposed belief update mechanism, each agent's belief is a normalized weighted geometric interpolation between a fully Bayesian private belief -- aggregating information from the private source -- and an ensemble of empirical distributions of the samples shared by her neighbors over time. By carefully constructing asymptotic almost-sure lower/upper bounds on the frequency of shared samples matching the true state/or not, we rigorously prove the convergence of all the beliefs to the true state, with probability one.</description>

      <title>Constant-selection evolutionary dynamics on weighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The population structure often impacts evolutionary dynamics. In constant-selection evolutionary dynamics between two types, amplifiers of selection are networks that promote the fitter mutant to take over the entire population, and suppressors of selection do the opposite. It has been shown that most undirected and unweighted networks are amplifiers of selection under a common updating rule and initial condition. Here, we extensively investigate how edge weights influence selection on undirected networks. We show that random edge weights make small networks less amplifying than the corresponding unweighted networks in a majority of cases and also make them suppressors of selection (i.e., less amplifying than the complete graph, or equivalently, the Moran process) in many cases. Qualitatively, the same result holds true for larger empirical networks. These results suggest that amplifiers of selection are not as common for weighted networks as for unweighted counterparts.</description>

      <title>Manufacturing Service Capability Prediction with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current landscape, the predominant methods for identifying manufacturing capabilities from manufacturers rely heavily on keyword matching and semantic matching. However, these methods often fall short by either overlooking valuable hidden information or misinterpreting critical data. Consequently, such approaches result in an incomplete identification of manufacturers' capabilities. This underscores the pressing need for data-driven solutions to enhance the accuracy and completeness of manufacturing capability identification. To address the need, this study proposes a Graph Neural Network-based method for manufacturing service capability identification over a knowledge graph. To enhance the identification performance, this work introduces a novel approach that involves aggregating information from the graph nodes' neighborhoods as well as oversampling the graph data, which can be effectively applied across a wide range of practical scenarios. Evaluations conducted on a Manufacturing Service Knowledge Graph and subsequent ablation studies demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach. This study not only contributes a innovative method for inferring manufacturing service capabilities but also significantly augments the quality of Manufacturing Service Knowledge Graphs.</description>

      <title>Review Ecosystems to access Educational XR Experiences: a Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Educators, developers, and other stakeholders face challenges when creating, adapting, and utilizing virtual and augmented reality (XR) experiences for teaching curriculum topics. User created reviews of these applications provide important information about their relevance and effectiveness in supporting achievement of educational outcomes. To make these reviews accessible, relevant, and useful, they must be readily available and presented in a format that supports decision-making by educators. This paper identifies best practices for developing a new review ecosystem by analyzing existing approaches to providing reviews of interactive experiences. It focuses on the form and format of these reviews, as well as the mechanisms for sharing information about experiences and identifying which ones are most effective. The paper also examines the incentives that drive review creation and maintenance, ensuring that new experiences receive attention from reviewers and that relevant information is updated when necessary. The strategies and opportunities for developing an educational XR (eduXR) review ecosystem include methods for measuring properties such as quality metrics, engaging a broad range of stakeholders in the review process, and structuring the system as a closed loop managed by feedback and incentive structures to ensure stability and productivity. Computing educators are well-positioned to lead the development of these review ecosystems, which can relate XR experiences to the potential opportunities for teaching and learning that they offer.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Negative Sampling on Graphs for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task for graph analysis with important applications on the Web, such as social network analysis and recommendation systems, etc. Modern graph link prediction methods often employ a contrastive approach to learn robust node representations, where negative sampling is pivotal. Typical negative sampling methods aim to retrieve hard examples based on either predefined heuristics or automatic adversarial approaches, which might be inflexible or difficult to control. Furthermore, in the context of link prediction, most previous methods sample negative nodes from existing substructures of the graph, missing out on potentially more optimal samples in the latent space. To address these issues, we investigate a novel strategy of multi-level negative sampling that enables negative node generation with flexible and controllable ``hardness'' levels from the latent space. Our method, called Conditional Diffusion-based Multi-level Negative Sampling (DMNS), leverages the Markov chain property of diffusion models to generate negative nodes in multiple levels of variable hardness and reconcile them for effective graph link prediction. We further demonstrate that DMNS follows the sub-linear positivity principle for robust negative sampling. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMNS.</description>

      <title>Learn from Heterophily: Heterophilous Information-enhanced Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under circumstances of heterophily, where nodes with different labels tend to be connected based on semantic meanings, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often exhibit suboptimal performance. Current studies on graph heterophily mainly focus on aggregation calibration or neighbor extension and address the heterophily issue by utilizing node features or structural information to improve GNN representations. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate that the valuable semantic information inherent in heterophily can be utilized effectively in graph learning by investigating the distribution of neighbors for each individual node within the graph. The theoretical analysis is carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of the idea in enhancing graph learning. Based on this analysis, we propose HiGNN, an innovative approach that constructs an additional new graph structure, that integrates heterophilous information by leveraging node distribution to enhance connectivity between nodes that share similar semantic characteristics. We conduct empirical assessments on node classification tasks using both homophilous and heterophilous benchmark datasets and compare HiGNN to popular GNN baselines and SoTA methods, confirming the effectiveness in improving graph representations. In addition, by incorporating heterophilous information, we demonstrate a notable enhancement in existing GNN-based approaches, and the homophily degree across real-world datasets, thus affirming the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>$(\omega_1, \omega_2)$-Temporal random hyperbolic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a recent model of temporal random hyperbolic graphs by allowing connections and disconnections to persist across network snapshots with different probabilities, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. This extension, while conceptually simple, poses analytical challenges involving the Appell $F_1$ series. Despite these challenges, we are able to analyze key properties of the model, which include the distributions of contact and intercontact durations, as well as the expected time-aggregated degree. The incorporation of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ enables more flexible tuning of the average contact and intercontact durations, and of the average time-aggregated degree, providing a finer control for exploring the effect of temporal network dynamics on epidemic processes. Overall, our results provide new insights into the analysis of temporal networks and contribute to a more general representation of real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current study proposes an innovative methodology for the profiling of psychological traits of Operations Management (OM) and Supply Chain Management (SCM) professionals. We use innovative methods and tools of text mining and social network analysis to map the demand for relevant skills from a set of job descriptions, with a focus on psychological characteristics. The proposed approach aims to evaluate the market demand for specific traits by combining relevant psychological constructs, text mining techniques, and an innovative measure, namely, the Semantic Brand Score. We apply the proposed methodology to a dataset of job descriptions for OM and SCM professionals, with the objective of providing a mapping of their relevant required skills, including psychological characteristics. In addition, the analysis is then detailed by considering the region of the organization that issues the job description, its organizational size, and the seniority level of the open position in order to understand their nuances. Finally, topic modeling is used to examine key components and their relative significance in job descriptions. By employing a novel methodology and considering contextual factors, we provide an innovative understanding of the attitudinal traits that differentiate professionals. This research contributes to talent management, recruitment practices, and professional development initiatives, since it provides new figures and perspectives to improve the effectiveness and success of Operations Management and Supply Chain Management professionals.</description>

      <title>Distance-Based Hierarchical Cutting of Complex Networks with Non-Preferential and Preferential Choice of Seeds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs and complex networks can be successively separated into connected components associated to respective seed nodes, therefore establishing a respective hierarchical organization. In the present work, we study the properties of the hierarchical structure implied by distance-based cutting of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Barab\'asi-Albert, and a specific geometric network. Two main situations are considered regarding the choice of the seeds: non-preferential and preferential to the respective node degree. Among the obtained findings, we have the tendency of geometrical networks yielding more balanced pairs of connected components along the network progressive separation, presenting little chaining effects, followed by the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert types of networks. The choice of seeds preferential to the node degree tended to enhance the balance of the connected components in the case of the geometrical networks.</description>

      <title>Opinion Market Model: Stemming Far-Right Opinion Spread using Positive Interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online extremism has severe societal consequences, including normalizing hate speech, user radicalization, and increased social divisions. Various mitigation strategies have been explored to address these consequences. One such strategy uses positive interventions: controlled signals that add attention to the opinion ecosystem to boost certain opinions. To evaluate the effectiveness of positive interventions, we introduce the Opinion Market Model (OMM), a two-tier online opinion ecosystem model that considers both inter-opinion interactions and the role of positive interventions. The size of the opinion attention market is modeled in the first tier using the multivariate discrete-time Hawkes process; in the second tier, opinions cooperate and compete for market share, given limited attention using the market share attraction model. We demonstrate the convergence of our proposed estimation scheme on a synthetic dataset. Next, we test OMM on two learning tasks, applying to two real-world datasets to predict attention market shares and uncover latent relationships between online items. The first dataset comprises Facebook and Twitter discussions containing moderate and far-right opinions about bushfires and climate change. The second dataset captures popular VEVO artists' YouTube and Twitter attention volumes. OMM outperforms the state-of-the-art predictive models on both datasets and captures latent cooperation-competition relations. We uncover (1) self- and cross-reinforcement between far-right and moderate opinions on the bushfires and (2) pairwise artist relations that correlate with real-world interactions such as collaborations and long-lasting feuds. Lastly, we use OMM as a testbed for positive interventions and show how media coverage modulates the spread of far-right opinions.</description>

      <title>LocalTweets to LocalHealth: A Mental Health Surveillance Framework Based on Twitter Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior research on Twitter (now X) data has provided positive evidence of its utility in developing supplementary health surveillance systems. In this study, we present a new framework to surveil public health, focusing on mental health (MH) outcomes. We hypothesize that locally posted tweets are indicative of local MH outcomes and collect tweets posted from 765 neighborhoods (census block groups) in the USA. We pair these tweets from each neighborhood with the corresponding MH outcome reported by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to create a benchmark dataset, LocalTweets. With LocalTweets, we present the first population-level evaluation task for Twitter-based MH surveillance systems. We then develop an efficient and effective method, LocalHealth, for predicting MH outcomes based on LocalTweets. When used with GPT3.5, LocalHealth achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.7429 and 79.78\%, respectively, a 59\% improvement in F1-score over the GPT3.5 in zero-shot setting. We also utilize LocalHealth to extrapolate CDC's estimates to proxy unreported neighborhoods, achieving an F1-score of 0.7291. Our work suggests that Twitter data can be effectively leveraged to simulate neighborhood-level MH outcomes.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal embeddings of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to their flexibility to represent almost any kind of relational data, graph-based models have enjoyed a tremendous success over the past decades. While graphs are inherently only combinatorial objects, however, many prominent analysis tools are based on the algebraic representation of graphs via matrices such as the graph Laplacian, or on associated graph embeddings. Such embeddings associate to each node a set of coordinates in a vector space, a representation which can then be employed for learning tasks such as the classification or alignment of the nodes of the graph. As the geometric picture provided by embedding methods enables the use of a multitude of methods developed for vector space data, embeddings have thus gained interest both from a theoretical as well as a practical perspective. Inspired by trace-optimization problems, often encountered in the analysis of graph-based data, here we present a method to derive ellipsoidal embeddings of the nodes of a graph, in which each node is assigned a set of coordinates on the surface of a hyperellipsoid. Our method may be seen as an alternative to popular spectral embedding techniques, to which it shares certain similarities we discuss. To illustrate the utility of the embedding we conduct a case study in which we analyse synthetic and real world networks with modular structure, and compare the results obtained with known methods in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Generating graphs from a target distribution is a significant challenge across many domains, including drug discovery and social network analysis. In this work, we introduce a novel graph generation method leveraging $K^2$-tree representation, originally designed for lossless graph compression. The $K^2$-tree representation {encompasses inherent hierarchy while enabling compact graph generation}. In addition, we make contributions by (1) presenting a sequential $K^2$-treerepresentation that incorporates pruning, flattening, and tokenization processes and (2) introducing a Transformer-based architecture designed to generate the sequence by incorporating a specialized tree positional encoding scheme. Finally, we extensively evaluate our algorithm on four general and two molecular graph datasets to confirm its superiority for graph generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of open knowledge graphs has led to a surge in scholarly research on the topic over the past decade. This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the scholarly literature on open knowledge graphs published between 2013 and 2023. The study aims to identify the trends, patterns, and impact of research in this field, as well as the key topics and research questions that have emerged. The work uses bibliometric techniques to analyze a sample of 4445 scholarly articles retrieved from Scopus. The findings reveal an ever-increasing number of publications on open knowledge graphs published every year, particularly in developed countries (+50 per year). These outputs are published in highly-referred scholarly journals and conferences. The study identifies three main research themes: (1) knowledge graph construction and enrichment, (2) evaluation and reuse, and (3) fusion of knowledge graphs into NLP systems. Within these themes, the study identifies specific tasks that have received considerable attention, including entity linking, knowledge graph embedding, and graph neural networks.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become important tools in Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI), enabling new ways to analyze data, treat patients, and conduct research. This bibliometric review aims to provide a panoramic view of how LLMs have been used in BHI by examining research articles and collaboration networks from 2022 to 2023. It further explores how LLMs can improve Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications in various BHI areas like medical diagnosis, patient engagement, electronic health record management, and personalized medicine. To do this, our bibliometric review identifies key trends, maps out research networks, and highlights major developments in this fast-moving field. Lastly, it discusses the ethical concerns and practical challenges of using LLMs in BHI, such as data privacy and reliable medical recommendations. Looking ahead, we consider how LLMs could further transform biomedical research as well as healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. This bibliometric review serves as a resource for stakeholders in healthcare, including researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, to understand the current state and future potential of LLMs in BHI.</description>
