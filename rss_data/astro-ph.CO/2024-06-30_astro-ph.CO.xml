      <title>pop-cosmos: Scaleable inference of galaxy properties and redshifts with a data-driven population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient Bayesian method for estimating individual photometric redshifts and galaxy properties under a pre-trained population model (pop-cosmos) that was calibrated using purely photometric data. This model specifies a prior distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters using a score-based diffusion model, and includes a data model with detailed treatment of nebular emission. We use a GPU-accelerated affine invariant ensemble sampler to achieve fast posterior sampling under this model for 292,300 individual galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog, leveraging a neural network emulator (Speculator) to speed up the SPS calculations. We apply both the pop-cosmos population model and a baseline prior inspired by Prospector-$\alpha$, and compare these results to published COSMOS2020 redshift estimates from the widely-used EAZY and LePhare codes. For the $\sim 12,000$ galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we find that pop-cosmos yields redshift estimates that have minimal bias ($\sim10^{-4}$), high accuracy ($\sigma_\text{MAD}=7\times10^{-3}$), and a low outlier rate ($1.6\%$). We show that the pop-cosmos population model generalizes well to galaxies fainter than its $r&lt;25$ mag training set. The sample we have analyzed is $\gtrsim3\times$ larger than has previously been possible via posterior sampling with a full SPS model, with average throughput of 15 GPU-sec per galaxy under the pop-cosmos prior, and 0.6 GPU-sec per galaxy under the Prospector prior. This paves the way for principled modeling of the huge catalogs expected from upcoming Stage IV galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Coupled to Radiation: Limits from the Milky Way Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between dark matter (DM) and relativistic particles at early times suppress structure formation on small scales. In particular, the scattering process transfers heat and momentum from radiation to DM, ultimately reducing the abundance of low-mass DM halos and the dwarf galaxies they host. Herein, we derive limits on DM--photon and DM--neutrino scattering cross section using the Milky Way (MW) satellite galaxy population. We consider temperature-independent interactions parameterized by DM mass ($m_\chi$) and DM--radiation interaction cross section ($\sigma_{\chi\text{--}i}$, where $i$ represents the target species). By requiring that the linear matter power spectra are strictly less suppressed than in the case of a thermal-relic warm DM, we derive the following $95\%$ upper limits at $m_\chi=1$ MeV: $\sigma_{\chi\text{--}\gamma}&lt;1.50\times10^{-38}\text{cm}^2$ and $\sigma_{\chi\text{--}\nu}&lt;2.41\times10^{-38}\text{cm}^2$. Our bounds on $\sigma_{\chi\text{--}i}$ depend linearly on $m_\chi$ for $m_\chi \gtrsim 1~\mathrm{MeV}$ and improve upon previous limits by an order of magnitude. The mass dependence of our limit approaches $m_\chi^3$ at lower masses due to the effects of DM sound speed; at $m_{\chi}=100~\mathrm{keV}$, we arrive at an upper limit over three orders of magnitude more stringent than achieved in previous explorations. Upcoming dwarf galaxy surveys will further improve the sensitivity of similar analyses, complementing laboratory and indirect detection searches for DM--radiation interactions.</description>

      <title>Tomographic constraints on the production rate of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an optimal quadratic estimator, we measure the large-scale cross-correlation between maps of the stochastic gravitational-wave intensity, constructed from the first three LIGO-Virgo observing runs, and a suite of tomographic samples of galaxies covering the redshift range $z\lesssim 2$. We do not detect any statistically significant cross-correlation, but the tomographic nature of the data allows us to place constraints on the (bias-weighted) production rate density of gravitational waves by astrophysical sources as a function of cosmic time. Our constraints range from $\langle b\dot{\Omega}_{\rm GW}\rangle&lt;3.0\times10^{-9}\,{\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ at $z\sim0.06$ to $\langle b\dot{\Omega}_{\rm GW}\rangle&lt;2.7\times10^{-7}\,{\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ at $z\sim1.5$ (95\% C.L.), assuming a frequency spectrum of the form $f^{2/3}$ (corresponding to an astrophysical background of binary mergers), and a reference frequency $f_{\rm ref}=25\,{\rm Hz}$. Although these constraints are $\sim2$ orders of magnitude higher than the expected signal, we show that a detection may be possible with future experiments.</description>

      <title>Information content in anisotropic cosmological fields: Impact of different multipole expansion scheme for galaxy density and ellipticity correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipole expansions have been often used for extracting cosmological information from anisotropic quantities in observation. However, which basis of the expansion is best suited to quantify the anisotropies is not a trivial question in any summary statistics. In this paper, using the Fisher matrix formalism, we investigate the information content in multipole moments of the power spectra of galaxy density and intrinsic ellipticity fields in linear theory from the Alcock-Paczynski effect and redshift-space distortions (RSD). We consider two expansion schemes, the associated Legendre basis as well as the standard Legendre basis conventionally used in literature. We find that the information in the multipoles of the intrinsic alignment (IA) power spectra in the associated Legendre basis converges more slowly to that in the full 2D power spectra than in the Legendre basis. This trend is particularly significant when we consider a high number density sample. In this high number density case, we show that the errors on the Hubble parameter obtained from the multipoles of the IA cross- and auto-power spectra in the associated Legendre basis are respectively about $6 \%$ and $10 \%$ larger than the full 2D case even when we use multipoles up to $\ell = 6$. Our results demonstrate that the choice of basis is arbitrary but changes the information content encoded in multipoles depending on the sample and statistics under consideration.</description>

      <title>Beam Instability for Wave Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early universe, strong large scale random flows prevail, and when these flows collide it produces sheets and filaments for the conventional particle dark matter model. However, for wave dark matter, the sheets and filaments are parallelly modulated by fine-scale and large-amplitude interference fringes. These long fine fringes tend to be unstable initially and subsequently deform and collapse to form halos of various sizes, perhaps down to proto-globular cluster scales. This work aims to investigate the instability of such fringes. Two colliding streams of quantum waves result in a standing density wave. By contrast, two colliding beams in classical collisionless fluid systems often give rise to beam instability, characterized by unstable oscillations with a complex frequency. Will the quantum standing density wave be subject to a similar instability? In fact, such unstable oscillations have never been observed in conventional quantum mechanical systems. This study discovers that periodic fringes can indeed undergo unstable oscillations or beam instability. The presence of any local density null in the background density that fails the Madelung formulation is shown to be the necessary condition for unstable oscillations. We establish a phase diagram to distinguish between beam instability, Jeans instability, and stable oscillation through theoretical calculations and computer simulations. Roughly speaking, Jeans instability almost always occurs for long-wave density perturbations; beam instability on the other hand always occurs when the density wave is aligned with the beam direction and moreover the period of the density wave is twice the period of background density; lastly, both instabilities diminish for a very low background density. We have engaged in Blocks theorem extensively in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Using relativistic effects in large-scale structure to constrain astrophysical properties of galaxy populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming large-scale structure surveys will be able to measure new features in the galaxy two point correlation function. Relativistic effects appear on large scales as subtle corrections to redshift-space distortions, showing up as a dipole and octupole when cross-correlating two different tracers of dark matter. The dipole and octupole are very sensitive to the evolution and magnification biases of the observed tracers which are hard to model accurately as they depend upon the derivative of the luminosity function at the flux limit of the survey. We show that splitting a galaxy population into bright and faint samples allows us to cross-correlate these and constrain both the evolution bias and magnification bias of the two samples -- using the relativistic odd multipoles of the correlation function, together with the even Newtonian multipoles. Although the octupole has much lower signal-to-noise than the dipole, it significantly improves the constraints by breaking parameter degeneracies. We illustrate this in the case of a futuristic survey with the Square Kilometre Array, and demonstrate how splitting the samples in different ways can help improve constraints. This method is quite general and can be used on different types of tracers to improve knowledge of their luminosity functions. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise of the dipole and octupole peaks on intermediate scales, which means that that they can deliver a clean measurement of the magnification bias and evolution bias without contamination from local primordial non-Gaussianities or from systematics on very large scales.</description>

      <title>Detectable signals of post-Born lensing curl B-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curl lensing, also known as lensing field-rotation or shear B-modes, is a distinct post-Born observable caused by two lensing deflections at different redshifts (lens-lens coupling). For the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the field-rotation is approximately four orders of magnitude smaller than the CMB lensing convergence. Direct detection is therefore challenging for near-future CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO) or CMB `Stage-4' (CMB-S4). Instead, the curl can be probed in cross-correlation between a direct reconstruction and a template formed using pairs of large-scale structure (LSS) tracers to emulate the lens-lens coupling. In this paper, we derive a new estimator for the optimal curl template specifically adapted for curved-sky applications, and test it against non-Gaussian complications using N-body cosmology simulations. We find non-foreground biases to the curl cross-spectrum are purely Gaussian at the sensitivity of SO. However, higher-order curl contractions induce non-Gaussian bias at the order of $1\sigma$ for CMB-S4 using quadratic estimators (QE). Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) lensing estimators significantly reduce biases for both SO and CMB-S4, in agreement with our analytic predictions. We also show that extragalactic foregrounds in the CMB can bias curl measurements at order of the signal, and evaluate a variety of mitigation strategies to control these biases for SO-like experiments. Near-future observations will be able to measure post-Born lensing curl B-modes.</description>

      <title>Reionization Parameter Inference from 3D Minkowski Functionals of the 21 cm Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minkowski Functionals (MFs), a set of topological summary statistics, have emerged as a powerful tool for extracting non-Gaussian information. We investigate the prospect of constraining the reionization parameters using the MFs of the 21 cm brightness temperature field from the epoch of reionization (EoR). Realistic effects, including thermal noise, synthesized beam, and foreground avoidance, are applied to the mock observations from the radio interferometric array experiments such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We demonstrate that the MFs of the 21 cm signal measured with SKA-Low can be used to distinguish different reionization models, whereas the MF measurement with a HERA-like array cannot be made accurately enough. We further forecast the accuracies with which the MF measurements can place constraints on reionization parameters, using the standard MCMC analysis for parameter inference based on forward modeling. We find that for SKA-Low observation, MFs provide unbiased estimations of the reionization parameters with accuracies comparable to the power spectrum (PS) analysis. Furthermore, joint constraints using both MFs and PS can improve the constraint accuracies by up to $30\%$ compared to those with the PS alone. Nevertheless, the constraint accuracies can be degraded if the EoR window is shrunk with strong foreground avoidance. Our analysis demonstrates the promise of MFs as a set of summary statistics that extract complementary information from the 21 cm EoR field to the two-point statistics, which suggests a strong motivation for incorporating the MFs into the data analysis of future 21 cm observations.</description>

      <title>Curbing PBHs with PTAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sizeable primordial curvature perturbations needed to seed a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) will be accompanied by a scalar-induced gravitational wave signal that can be detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTA). We derive conservative bounds on the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum at the PTA frequencies and estimate the implied constraints on the PBH abundance. We show that only a small fraction of dark matter can consist of stellar mass PBHs when the abundance is calculated using threshold statistics. The strength and the shape of the constraint depend on the shape of the power spectrum and the nature of the non-Gaussianities. We find that constraints on the PBH abundance arise in the mass range $0.1-10^3\, M_{\odot}$, with the sub-solar mass range being constrained only for narrow curvature power spectra. These constraints are softened when positive non-Gaussianity is introduced and can be eliminated when $f_{\rm NL} \gtrsim 5$. On the other hand, if the PBH abundance is computed via the theory of peaks, the PTA constraints on PBHs are significantly relaxed, signalling once more the theoretical uncertainties in assessing the PBH abundance. We further discuss how strong positive non-Gaussianites can allow for heavy PBHs to potentially seed supermassive BHs.</description>

      <title>On the minimum number of radiation field parameters to specify gas cooling and heating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate approximations of gas cooling and heating functions are needed for hydrodynamic galaxy simulations. We use machine learning to analyze atomic gas cooling and heating functions in the presence of a generalized incident local radiation field computed by Cloudy. We characterize the radiation field through binned radiation field intensities instead of the photoionization rates used in our previous work. We find a set of 6 energy bins whose intensities exhibit relatively low correlation. We use these bins as features to train machine learning models to predict Cloudy cooling and heating functions at fixed metallicity. We compare the relative SHAP importance of the features. From the SHAP analysis, we identify a feature subset of 3 energy bins ($0.5-1, 1-4$, and $13-16 \, \mathrm{Ry}$) with the largest importance and train additional models on this subset. We compare the mean squared errors and distribution of errors on both the entire training data table and a randomly selected 20% test set withheld from model training. The machine learning models trained with 3 and 6 bins, as well as 3 and 4 photoionization rates, have comparable accuracy everywhere. We conclude that 3 energy bins (or 3 analogous photoionization rates: molecular hydrogen photodissociation, neutral hydrogen HI, and fully ionized carbon CVI) are sufficient to characterize the dependence of the gas cooling and heating functions on our assumed incident radiation field model.</description>

      <title>Graviton- and Inflaton-mediated Dark Matter Production after Large Field Polynomial Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polynomial inflation is a simple cosmological scenario, which fits the cosmic microwave background data well. It provides testable predictions for the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the running of the spectral index. In this work, we investigate the production of Dirac dark matter (DM) within the framework of large-field polynomial inflation. We study all relevant production channels including $i$) non-thermal production through inflaton decays and scatterings, and $ii$) thermal production from scattering of standard model particles mediated by inflatons and gravitons. In contrast to small-field polynomial inflation, where inflaton decay dominates DM production, we find that graviton-mediated processes can be dominant in the large-field scenario. In particular, graviton-mediated scatterings can account for the observed relic abundance even when DM is up to one order of magnitude heavier than the inflaton. For DM lighter than the inflaton, we demonstrate that the interplay between graviton- and inflaton-mediated production channels give rise to non-trivial relations between the DM mass and the reheating temperature required to account for the DM relic abundance.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: The secondary maximum in Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves have a secondary maximum that exists in the $r$, $i$, and near-infrared filters. The secondary maximum is relatively weak in the $r$ band, but holds the advantage that it is accessible, even at high redshift. We used Gaussian Process fitting to parameterise the light curves of 893 SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility's (ZTF) second data release (DR2), and we were able to extract information about the timing and strength of the secondary maximum. We found $&gt;5\sigma$ correlations between the light curve decline rate ($\Delta m_{15}(g)$) and the timing and strength of the secondary maximum in the $r$ band. Whilst the timing of the secondary maximum in the $i$ band also correlates with $\Delta m_{15}(g)$, the strength of the secondary maximum in the $i$ band shows significant scatter as a function of $\Delta m_{15}(g)$. We found that the transparency timescales of 97 per cent of our sample are consistent with double detonation models, and that SNe Ia with small transparency timescales ($&lt;$ 32 d) reside predominantly in locally red environments. We measured the total ejected mass for the normal SNe Ia in our sample using two methods, and both were consistent with medians of $1.3\ \pm \ 0.3$ and $1.2\ \pm\ 0.2$ solar masses. We find that the strength of the secondary maximum is a better standardisation parameter than the SALT light curve stretch ($x_1$). Finally, we identified a spectral feature in the $r$ band as Fe II, which strengthens during the onset of the secondary maximum. The same feature begins to strengthen at $&lt;$ 3 d post maximum light in 91bg-like SNe. Finally, the correlation between $x_1$ and the strength of the secondary maximum was best fit with a broken line, with a split at $x_1^0\ =\ -0.5\ \pm\ 0.2$, suggestive of the existence of two populations of SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Group Ellipticity Confirms a Younger Cosmos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the ellipticities of galaxy groups, derived from the spatial distribution of member galaxies, revealing a notable incongruity between the observed local galaxy groups and their counterparts in the Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. Specifically, our investigation reveals a substantial disparity in the ellipticities of observed groups with masses \mbox{$10^{13.0}&lt;M_{\rm{h}}&lt;10^{14.5}\ {\rm M_{\odot}}\ h^{-1}$} exhibiting significantly higher ellipticities (at a confidence level of approximately $4\sigma$) compared to their simulated counterparts. Notably, the consistent use of the same group finder for identifying galaxy groups in both observational and simulated datasets underscores the robustness of this result. This observation may imply a potential incongruence between the inferred age of the Universe from observations and the predictions of the model, which aligns with the younger Universe hypothesis suggested by the elevated fraction of observed satellite pairs with correlated line-of-sight relative velocities compared to simulations. Our findings significantly strengthen the plausibility of a younger age for our Universe.</description>

      <title>Refined approaches in second leptogenesis for the baryon-lepton asymmetry discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temperature-dependent mass of the heavy neutrino can lead to the second leptogenesis occurring below the electroweak scale, potentially explaining the large discrepancy between baryon and lepton asymmetries. We investigate this scenario further, exploring the intricate interplay of the weak interaction processes within this framework. It includes notable shifts in the dominant decay channels of heavy neutrinos around the electroweak symmetry breaking, along with the resonance behavior of the scattering processes near the $W/Z$ mass. The $CP$ asymmetry can also vary over cosmic history due to the temperature-dependent mass, allowing the $B-L$ asymmetry generation to be amplified in the late epoch. These findings elucidate how such alterations in the dynamics of second leptogenesis contribute to addressing the observed discrepancies in baryon-lepton asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Forecast of cosmological constraints with superluminous supernovae from the Chinese Space Station Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a class of intense celestial events that can be standardized for measuring cosmological parameters, bridging the gap between type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background. In this work, we discuss the cosmological applications of SLSNe from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). Our estimation suggests that SLSNe rate is biased tracing the cosmic star formation rate, exhibiting a factor of $(1+z)^{1.2}$. We futher predict that CSST is poised to observe $\sim 360$ SLSNe in the 10 square degrees ultra-deep field survey within a span of 2.5 years. A stringent constraint on cosmological parameters can be derived from their peak-color relationship. CSST is anticipated to uncover a substantial number of SLSNe, contributing to a deeper understanding of their central engines and shedding light on the nature of dark energy at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Enhanced induced gravitational waves in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study secondary gravitational wave production in Horndenski gravity, when the scalar field dominates the very early universe. We find that higher derivative interactions easily dominate the source term on subhorizon scales and significantly enhance the amplitude of induced GWs. We analytically derive, for the first time, the Horndeski induced GW spectrum for a general class of power-law solutions. The main effect of modifications of gravity are stronger resonances and a growth of tensor fluctuations on small scales. The maximum attainable amplitude of the induced GW spectrum is bounded by the possible backreaction of higher derivatives on curvature fluctuations, thereby shutting down the source term to induced GWs. We argue that the maximum attainable amplitude depends linearly on the primordial curvature spectrum ($\Omega_{\rm GW}\propto {\cal P}_\zeta$), as opposed to the standard case where it depends quadratically. Resonances may further enhance the maximum amplitude by a factor $(k/{\cal H}_t)^2$ or $(k/{\cal H}_t)$ respectively for sharp and broad peaks (including a scale invariant) primordial spectrum, where ${\cal H}_t$ is the comoving horizon at the time when standard gravity is recovered. Remarkably, in the scale invariant case, the Horndeski-induced GW spectrum grows as $k^3$. This opens up the interesting possibility that induced GWs might be observable despite no enhancement of the primordial curvature spectrum. Our formalism can be generalized to a wider class of solutions and to more general scalar-tensor theories, such as DHOST and spatially covariant gravity. In the appendices we provide discussions on the gauge issue and disformal transformations of induced GWs.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant quantum backreaction in U(1) axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the quantum backreaction due to a gauge field coupled to a pseudo scalar field driving a slow-roll inflationary stage, the so-called axion inflation. The backreaction is evaluated for the first time using a gauge invariant approach, going to second order in perturbation theory and taking in consideration inflaton fluctuations as well as scalar perturbations of the metric. Within our gauge invariant, but observer-dependent approach, we naturally consider as physical observer the one comoving with the inflaton field. Considering the effective expansion rate consequent to the gauge fields bacreaction, we observe that the backreaction effect becomes significant quite rapidly, moving the system out of the perturbative regime and into what is often referred to the strong backreaction regime. This behavior also applies to the parameter which dictates the production of the gauge fields. The space-time dynamic is initially mainly influenced by the helicity contribution, with a significant response to the energy density which occurs much later with respect to the number of e-folds. As a final result, we see that the evaluated backreaction prolongs the inflationary period much more compared to the scenarios previously studied neglecting scalar metric perturbations.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal production of heavy vector dark matter from relativistic bubble walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy vector boson dark matter at the TeV scale or higher may be produced non-thermally in a first-order phase transition taking place at a lower energy scale. While the production of vector dark matter has previously been studied for bubble wall collisions, here we calculate production by bubble wall expansion in a plasma, which can be the dominant production mechanism. We compute the results numerically and provide an analytical fit for the vector dark matter density. The numerical fit is also validated for scalar dark matter production, obtaining results in agreement with past literature. We find that vector pair production leads to bubble wall friction with a novel boost factor scaling behaviour compared to transition radiation emission of a single vector. We conclude that TeV-scale WIMP vector dark matter can be efficiently produced non-thermally by first-order phase transitions in a wide region of parameter space where thermal freeze-out is inefficient. In this scenario, the phase transition scale is predicted to be in the sub-GeV to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV range and could therefore be accessible to future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>How to detect lensing rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing rotation of images is predicted to be negligible at linear order in density perturbations, but can be produced by the post-Born lens-lens coupling at second order. This rotation is somewhat enhanced for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing due to the large source path length, but remains small and very challenging to detect directly by CMB lensing reconstruction alone. We show the rotation may be detectable at high significance as a cross-correlation signal between the curl reconstructed with Simons Observatory (SO) or CMB-S4 data, and a template constructed from quadratic combinations of large-scale structure (LSS) tracers. Equivalently, the lensing rotation-tracer-tracer bispectrum can also be detected, where LSS tracers considered include the CMB lensing convergence, galaxy density, and the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB), or optimal combinations thereof. We forecast that an optimal combination of these tracers can probe post-Born rotation at the level of $5.7\sigma$-$6.1\sigma$ with SO and $13.6\sigma$-$14.7\sigma$ for CMB-S4, depending on whether standard quadratic estimators or maximum a posteriori iterative methods are deployed. We also show possible improvement up to $21.3\sigma$ using a CMB-S4 deep patch observation with polarization-only iterative lensing reconstruction. However, these cross-correlation signals have non-zero bias because the rotation template is quadratic in the tracers, and exists even if the lensing is rotation free. We estimate this bias analytically, and test it using simple null-hypothesis simulations to confirm that the bias remains subdominant to the rotation signal of interest. Detection and then measurement of the lensing rotation cross-spectrum is therefore a realistic target for future observations.</description>

      <title>One loop to rule them all: Perturbativity in the presence of ultra slow-roll dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the issue of perturbativity in single-field inflationary models with a phase of ultra slow-roll (USR) tailor suited to generate an order-one abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs). More in detail, we impose the condition that loop corrections made up of short-wavelength modes enhanced by the USR dynamics do not alter the tree-level power spectrum of curvature perturbations. In our analysis, the USR phase is preceded and followed by two stages of ordinary slow-roll (SR), and we model the resulting SR/USR/SR dynamics using both instantaneous and smooth transitions. Focusing on scales relevant for CMB observations, we find that it is not possible, with these arguments, to rule out the scenario of PBH formation via USR, not even in the limit of instantaneous transition. However, we also find that loop corrections of short modes on the power spectrum of long modes, even though not large enough to violate perturbativity requirements, remain appreciable and, most importantly, are not tamed in realistic realisations of smooth SR/USR/SR transitions. This makes perturbativity a powerful theoretical tool to constrain USR dynamics. We extend the analysis at any scale beyond those relevant for CMB observations. We find that loop corrections of short modes remain within the few percent if compared to the tree-level power spectrum. However, we also find one notable exception of phenomenological relevance: we show that the so-called dip in the power spectrum of curvature perturbation is an artifact of the tree-level computation.</description>

      <title>The Primordial Black Hole Abundance: The Broader, the Better</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the abundance of primordial black holes, if formed through the collapse of large fluctuations generated during inflation and unless the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation is very peaked, is always dominated by the broadest profile of the compaction function, even though statistically it is not the most frequent. The corresponding threshold is therefore 2/5. This result exacerbates the tension when combining the primordial black hole abundance with the signal seen by pulsar timing arrays and originated from gravitational waves induced by the same large primordial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Large curvature fluctuations from no-scale supergravity with a spectator field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the large curvature perturbations which can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the context of no-scale supergravity. Our study does not depend on any exotic scenario, such as scalar potentials with inflection points or bulks, and aims to avoid the fine-tuning of model parameters to achieve the formation of PBHs. This formation relies on the quantum fluctuations of a light spectator stochastic field after the inflationary period. Our analysis is based on the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, considering both the inflaton and the spectator field. Specifically, we examine existing no-scale models with Starobinsky-like scalar potentials that are consistent with observable constraints on inflation from measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These models involve two chiral fields: the inflaton and the modulus field. We propose a novel role for the modulus field as a spectator field, responsible for generating PBHs. Our hypothesis suggests that while the inflaton field satisfies the CMB constraints of inflation, it is the modulus field acting as the spectator that leads to large curvature perturbations, capable to explain the production of PBHs. Additionally, we prioritize retaining the inflationary constraints from the CMB through the consideration of spectator fluctuations. Therefore, by exploring the relationship between these fields within the framework of the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, our aim is to unveil their implications for the formation of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Damping Wing-Like Features in the Stacked Ly$\alpha$ Forest: Potential Neutral Hydrogen Islands at $z&lt;6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent quasar absorption line observations suggest that reionization may end as late as $z \approx 5.3$. As a means to search for large neutral hydrogen islands at $z&lt;6$, we revisit long dark gaps in the Ly$\beta$ forest in VLT/X-Shooter and Keck/ESI quasar spectra. We stack the Ly$\alpha$ forest corresponding to both edges of these Ly$\beta$ dark gaps and identify a damping wing-like extended absorption profile. The average redshift of the stacked forest is $z=5.8$. By comparing these observations with reionization simulations, we infer that such a damping wing-like feature can be naturally explained if these gaps are at least partially created by neutral islands. Conversely, simulated dark gaps lacking neutral hydrogen struggle to replicate the observed damping wing features. Furthermore, this damping wing-like profile implies that the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction must be $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle \geq 6.1 \pm 3.9\%$ at $z = 5.8$. Our results offer robust evidence that reionization extends below $z=6$.</description>

      <title>PUREPath: A Deep Latent Variational Model for Estimating CMB Posterior over Large Angular Scales of the Sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive neural architecture, the PUREPath, which leverages a nested Probabilistic multi-modal U- Net framework, augmented by the inclusion of probabilistic ResNet blocks in the Expanding Pathway of the decoders, to estimate the posterior density of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) signal conditioned on the observed CMB data and the training dataset. By seamlessly integrating Bayesian statistics and variational methods our model effectively minimizes foreground contamination in the observed CMB maps. The model is trained using foreground and noise contaminated CMB temperature maps simulated at Planck LFI and HFI frequency channels 30 - 353 GHz using publicly available Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background (CAMB) and Python Sky Model (PySM) packages. During training, our model transforms initial prior distribution on the model parameters to posterior distributions based on the training data. From the joint full posterior of the model parameters, during inference, a predicitve CMB posterior and summary statistics such as the predictive mean, variance etc of the cleaned CMB map is estimated. The predictive standard deviation map provides a direct and interpretable measure of uncertainty per pixel in the predicted mean CMB map. The cleaned CMB map along with the error estimates can be used for more accurate measurements of cosmological parameters and other cosmological analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) may originate from multiple explosion channels. Previous studies have indicated that the ejecta velocity of SNe Ia is one powerful tool to discriminate between different channels. In this work, we study ~400 confirmed SNe Ia discovered by the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS), and obtain a sample of ~50 SNe Ia that have near-peak Si II 6355 velocity (Vsi) measurements. We investigate the relationships between Vsi and various parameters, including SN light-curve width, color, host-galaxy properties, and redshift. No significant trends are identified between Vsi and light-curve parameters. Regarding the host-galaxy properties, we see a significant trend that high-velocity (HV) SNe Ia (Vsi &gt; 12000 km/s) tend to reside in more massive galaxies compared to normal-velocity (NV) SNe Ia (Vsi &lt; 12000 km/s) when combining both the PS1-MDS dataset and those from previous low-z studies. While we do not see a significant trend between Vsi and redshift, HV SNe Ia appear to be more prevalent in low-z samples than in high-z samples. We discuss several possibilities that could potentially contribute to this trend. Furthermore, we investigate the potential bias on SN Ia distances and find no significant difference in Hubble residuals between HV and NV subgroups.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational-wave energy-density spectra from cosmological first-order phase transitions crucially depend on the terminal wall velocity of asymptotic bubble expansion when the driving force from the effective potential difference is gradually balanced by the backreaction force from the thermal plasma. Much attention has previously focused on the backreaction force acting on the bubble wall alone but overlooked the backreaction forces on the sound shell and shockwave front, if any, which have been both numerically and analytically accomplished in our previous studies but only for a bag equation of state. In this paper, we will generalize the backreaction force on bubble expansion beyond the simple bag model.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories for dark matter pairs in the early universe: center-of-mass recoil effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For non-relativistic thermal dark matter, close-to-threshold effects largely dominate the evolution of the number density for most of the times after thermal freeze-out, and hence affect the cosmological relic density. A precise evaluation of the relevant interaction rates in a thermal medium representing the early universe includes accounting for the relative motion of the dark matter particles and the thermal medium. We consider a model of dark fermions interacting with a plasma of dark gauge bosons, which is equivalent to thermal QED. The temperature is taken to be smaller than the dark fermion mass and the inverse of the typical size of the dark fermion-antifermion bound states, which allows for the use of non-relativistic effective field theories. For the annihilation cross section, bound-state formation cross section, bound-state dissociation width and bound-state transition width of dark matter fermion-antifermion pairs, we compute the leading recoil effects in the reference frame of both the plasma and the center-of-mass of the fermion-antifermion pair. We explicitly verify the Lorentz transformations among these quantities. We evaluate the impact of the recoil corrections on the dark matter energy density. Our results can be directly applied to account for the relative motion of quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions. They may be also used to precisely assess thermal effects in atomic clocks based on atomic transitions; the present work provides a first field theory derivation of time dilation for these processes in vacuum and in a medium.</description>

We show that all stars near the SMC's TRGB are SARGs. Distinguishing older and younger RGs near the Tip according to two period-luminosity sequences labeled A and B, we show many similarities among SARG populations of the LMC and the SMC, along with notable differences. Specifically, SMC SARGs have shorter periods due to lower metallicity and lower amplitudes due to younger ages than LMC SARGs. We discover two period-color relations near the TRGB that span all A-sequence and B-sequence stars in the OGLE-III footprints of the SMC and LMC, and we investigate using periods instead of color for TRGB standardization. Using variability derived information only, we trace the SMC's age and metallicity gradients and show the core to be populated by younger, more metal rich RGs. B-sequence SARGs yield both the most precise and the brightest tip magnitude, and they are best suited for distance determination and Hubble constant measurements because they correspond to the oldest stars near TRGB. Assuming the geometric distance measured by detached eclipsing binaries, the B-sequence yields the SMC's most accurate TRGB calibration to date: M_{F814W,syn} = -4.057 \pm 0.019(stat.) \pm 0.029(syst.) mag (1.5% in distance). Further study of SARGs will unravel the impact of population diversity on TRGB distances and further improve TRGB standardization.</description>
