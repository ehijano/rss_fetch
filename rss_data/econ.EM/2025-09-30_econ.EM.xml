      <title>Leveraging LLMs to Improve Experimental Design: A Generative Stratification Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-experiment stratification, or blocking, is a well-established technique for designing more efficient experiments and increasing the precision of the experimental estimates. However, when researchers have access to many covariates at the experiment design stage, they often face challenges in effectively selecting or weighting covariates when creating their strata. This paper proposes a Generative Stratification procedure that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize high-dimensional covariate data to improve experimental design. We demonstrate the value of this approach by applying it to a set of experiments and find that our method would have reduced the variance of the treatment effect estimate by 10%-50% compared to simple randomization in our empirical applications. When combined with other standard stratification methods, it can be used to further improve the efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based simulation is a practical and easy-to-implement way to improve experimental design in covariate-rich settings.</description>

      <title>Joint Inference for the Regression Discontinuity Effect and Its External Validity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The external validity of regression discontinuity (RD) designs is essential for informing policy and remains an active research area in econometrics and statistics. However, we document that only a limited number of empirical studies explicitly address the external validity of standard RD effects. To advance empirical practice, we propose a simple joint inference procedure for the RD effect and its local external validity, building on Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014, Econometrica) and Dong and Lewbel (2015, Review of Economics and Statistics). We further introduce a locally linear treatment effects assumption, which enhances the interpretability of the treatment effect derivative proposed by Dong and Lewbel. Under this assumption, we establish identification and derive a uniform confidence band for the extrapolated treatment effects. Our approaches require no additional covariates or design features, making them applicable to virtually all RD settings and thereby enhancing the policy relevance of many empirical RD studies. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated through an empirical application, highlighting its complementarity to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Triadic Network Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study estimation and inference for triadic link formation with dyad-level fixed effects in a nonlinear binary choice logit framework. Dyad-level effects provide a richer and more realistic representation of heterogeneity across pairs of dimensions (e.g. importer--exporter, importer--product, exporter--product), yet their sheer number creates a severe incidental parameter problem. We propose a novel ``hexad logit'' estimator and establish its consistency and asymptotic normality. Identification is achieved through a conditional likelihood approach that eliminates the fixed effects by conditioning on sufficient statistics, in the form of hexads -- wirings that involve two nodes from each part of the network. Our central finding is that dyad-level heterogeneity fundamentally changes how information accumulates. Unlike under node-level heterogeneity, where informative wirings automatically grow with link formation, under dyad-level heterogeneity the network may generate infinitely many links yet asymptotically zero informative wirings. We derive explicit sparsity thresholds that determine when consistency holds and when asymptotic normality is attainable. These results have important practical implications, as they reveal that there is a limit to how granular or disaggregate a dataset one can employ under dyad-level heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Persuasion Effects in Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for identifying and estimating persuasion effects in regression discontinuity (RD) designs. The RD persuasion rate measures the probability that individuals at the threshold would take the action if exposed to a persuasive message, given that they would not take the action without exposure. We present identification results for both sharp and fuzzy RD designs, derive sharp bounds under various data scenarios, and extend the analysis to local compliers. Estimation and inference rely on local polynomial regression, enabling straightforward implementation with standard RD tools. Applications to public health and media illustrate its empirical relevance.</description>

      <title>A Dimension-Agnostic Bootstrap Anderson-Rubin Test For Instrumental Variable Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak-identification-robust tests for instrumental variable (IV) regressions are typically developed separately depending on whether the number of IVs is treated as fixed or increasing with the sample size, forcing researchers to make a stance on the asymptotic behavior, which is often ambiguous in practice. This paper proposes a bootstrap-based, dimension-agnostic Anderson-Rubin (AR) test that achieves correct asymptotic size regardless of whether the number of IVs is fixed or diverging, and even accommodates cases where the number of IVs exceeds the sample size. By incorporating ridge regularization, our approach reduces the effective rank of the projection matrix and yields regimes where the limiting distribution of the AR statistic can be a weighted chi-squared, a normal, or a mixture of the two. Strong approximation results ensure that the bootstrap procedure remains uniformly valid across all regimes, while also delivering substantial power gains over existing methods by exploiting rank reduction.</description>

      <title>Wald inference on varying coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present simple to implement Wald-type statistics that deliver a general nonparametric inference theory for linear restrictions on varying coefficients in a range of regression models allowing for cross-sectional or spatial dependence. We provide a general central limit theorem that covers a broad range of error spatial dependence structures, allows for a degree of misspecification robustness via nonparametric spatial weights and permits inference on both varying regression and spatial dependence parameters. Using our method, we first uncover evidence of constant returns to scale in the Chinese nonmetal mineral industry's production function, and then show that Boston house prices respond nonlinearly to proximity to employment centers. A simulation study confirms that our tests perform very well in finite samples.</description>

      <title>Detecting multiple change points in linear models with heteroscedastic errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of detecting change points in the regression parameters of a linear regression model with errors and covariates exhibiting heteroscedasticity is considered. Asymptotic results for weighted functionals of the cumulative sum (CUSUM) processes of model residuals are established when the model errors are weakly dependent and non-stationary, allowing for either abrupt or smooth changes in their variance. These theoretical results illuminate how to adapt standard change point test statistics for linear models to this setting. We studied such adapted change-point tests in simulation experiments, along with a finite sample adjustment to the proposed testing procedures. The results suggest that these methods perform well in practice for detecting multiple change points in the linear model parameters and controlling the Type I error rate in the presence of heteroscedasticity. We illustrate the use of these approaches in applications to test for instability in predictive regression models and explanatory asset pricing models.</description>

      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the "Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R\&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>
