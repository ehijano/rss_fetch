      <title>Band structure and optical response of Kekul\'e-modulated $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electronic band structure and optical response of a hybrid model, a $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ model featuring a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ Kekul\'e pattern modulation. Such a hybrid system may result from the depositing of adatoms in a hexagonal lattice, where the two sublattices are displaced in the perpendicular direction, like in germanene and silicene. We derive analytical expressions for the energy dispersion and the eigenfunctions using a tight-binding approximation of nearest-neighbor hopping electrons. The energy spectrum consists of a double-cone structure with Dirac points at zero momentum caused by Brillouin zone folding and a doubly degenerate flat band resulting from destructive quantum interference effects. Furthermore, we study the spectrum of intraband and interband transitions through the joint density of states, the optical conductivity, and the Drude spectral weight. We find new conductivity terms resulting from the opening of intervalley channels that are absent in the $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ model and manifest themselves as van Hove singularities in the optical response. In particular, we identify an absorption window related to intervalley transport, which serves as a viable signature for detecting Kekul\'e periodicity in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Probing g-tensor reproducibility and spin-orbit effects in planar silicon hole quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we probe the sensitivity of hole-spin properties to hole occupation number in a planar silicon double-quantum dot device fabricated on a 300 mm integrated platform. Using DC transport measurements, we investigate the g-tensor and spin-relaxation induced leakage current within the Pauli spin-blockade regime as a function of magnetic-field orientation at three different hole occupation numbers. We find the g-tensor and spin-leakage current to be highly anisotropic due to light-hole/heavy-hole mixing and spin-orbit mixing, but discover the anisotropies to be relatively insensitive to the dot hole number. Furthermore, we extract the dominant inter-dot spin-orbit coupling mechanism as surface Dresselhaus, with an in-plane orientation parallel to transport and magnitude $\boldsymbol{t_{SO}}$ $\approx$ 300 neV. Finally, we observe a strong correlation between the g-factor difference ($\delta$$\boldsymbol{g}$) between each dot and the spin-leakage current anisotropy, as a result of $\delta$$\boldsymbol{g}$ providing an additional spin-relaxation pathway, and should be considered. ]Our findings indicate that hole-spin devices are not as sensitive to precise operating conditions as anticipated. This has important implications optimizing spin control and readout based on magnetic-field direction, together with tuning large arrays of QDs as spin-qubits.</description>

      <title>Proposed Five-Electron Charge Quadrupole Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A charge qubit couples to environmental electric field fluctuations through its dipole moment, resulting in fast decoherence. We propose the p orbital (pO) qubit, formed by the single electron, p-like valence states of a five-electron Si quantum dot, which couples to charge noise through the quadrupole moment. We demonstrate that the pO qubit offers distinct advantages in quality factor, gate speed, readout and size. We use a phenomenological, dipole two-level-fluctuator charge noise model to estimate a $T_2^* \sim 80$ ns. In conjunction with Rabi frequencies of order 10 GHz, an order of magnitude improvement in qubit quality factor is expected relative to state-of-the-art semiconductor spin qubits. The pO qubit features all-electrical control via modulating the dot's eccentricity. We also show how to perform two-qubit gates via the $1/r^5$ quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. We find a universal gate set using gradient ascent based control pulse optimization, subject to 10 GHz maximum allowable bandwidth and 1 ns pulse times.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Crystallographic Orientation Effects on Tunneling Magnetoresistance via Transfer Matrix and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transfer matrix method (TMM) is widely used to analyze the transport properties of one-dimensional or quasi-one-dimensional systems, such as nanostructures and layered materials in spintronics. However, its application in quantifying the influence of different crystallographic orientations on tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) remains underexplored [1, 2]. This study employs the transfer matrix method to construct orientation-specific matrices, enabling a systematic investigation of conductance variations under different magnetic and crystallographic conditions. This approach offers a deeper understanding of how crystallographic orientation modulates TMR by developing a framework that adapts the TMM to account for orientation-dependent electronic states and interfacial characteristics [3]. Fundamentally, the TMM represents the partition function for systems with interactions limited to nearest neighbors. It is particularly well-suited for modeling spin-dependent electron tunneling in oriented magnetic tunnel junctions [4, 5].</description>

      <title>Anomalous switching pattern in the ferrimagnetic memory cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Replacing the ferromagnet with ferrimagnet (FiM) in the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) allows faster magnetization switching in picoseconds. The operation of a memory cell that consists of the MTJ and a transistor requires reversable magnetization switching. When a constant voltage is applied, we find that the spin-transfer torque can only switch the FiM-MTJ from parallel to antiparallel state. This stems from the small switching window of FiM and the dynamic resistance variation during the magnetization switching. We find the resulting current variation can be suppressed by reducing the magnetoresistance ratio. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the switching window can be expanded by adjusting the amount of Gd in FiM. We predict that the polarity of both switching current (Jc,switch) and oscillation current (Jc,osc) reverses at the angular momentum compensation point but not the magnetization compensation point. This anomalous dynamic behavior is attributed to the different physical nature of magnetization switching and oscillation in FiM, which must be considered when designing FiM-based MRAM.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Spin-Orbit Torque-Induced Deterministic Switching in NiO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical switching of antiferromagnet (AFM) is very important for the development of ultrafast magnetic random-access memory (MRAM). This task becomes more difficult in antiferromagnetic oxide NiO which has complex anisotropy. We show that by utilizing two spin-orbit torques (SOT) from orthogonal currents, one can deterministically switch the magnetic moments of NiO in two electrical distinguishable states that can be read out using the spin Hall magnetoresistance. This deterministic switching relies on the symmetry of SOT on different sublattices, where the sign reversal of magnetic moments leads to constructive torques in the beginning and balanced torques in the end. In addition, we show that the easy-plane anisotropy plays a key role in the switching, which has been ignored in some previous works. The uniform magnetic dynamics in this work provides a clear physical picture in understanding the SOT switching of NiO. Furthermore, the electrical writing and reading function in our device advances the development of AFM-MRAM.</description>

      <title>Entropic magnetic interlayer coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomagnetism concerns the engineering of magnetic interactions in heterostructures that consist of layers of magnetic and non-magnetic materials. Mostly, these interactions are dominated by the minimization of energy. Here, we propose an effective magnetic interlayer coupling that is dominated by the maximization of entropy. As an example, we consider the system that mediates the effective interactions to be square spin ice, in which case we find purely entropic interactions that are long-ranged. We argue that in the thermodynamic limit the entropic interlayer coupling gives rise to entropic torques on the magnetization direction. For small systems, the physical properties are well characterized by the mutual information between the two magnets that are coupled. Because entropic interactions become stronger for higher temperatures, our findings may benefit the development of nanomagnetic devices that require thermal stability.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional 2d infrared photodetectors enabled by asymmetric singular metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials offering ultrafast photoresponse suffer from low intrinsic absorbance, especially in the mid-infrared wavelength range. Challenges in 2d material doping further complicate the creation of light-sensitive $p-n$ junctions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a graphene-based infrared detector with simultaneously enhanced absorption and strong structural asymmetry enabling zero-bias photocurrent. A key element for those properties is an asymmetric singular metasurface (ASMS) atop graphene with keen metal wedges providing singular enhancement of local absorbance. The ASMS geometry predefines extra device functionalities. The structures with connected metallic wedges demonstrate polarization ratios up to 200 in a broad range of carrier densities at a wavelength of 8.6 $\mu$m. The structures with isolated wedges display gate-controlled switching between polarization-discerning and polarization-stable photoresponse, a highly desirable yet scarce property for polarized imaging.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall effects with an exceptional ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian band structures, exceptional points generically form gapless lines or loops that give rise to extensively many defective eigenstates. In this work, we investigate how they non-trivially contribute to higher-order nonlinear responses by introducing unique singularities in the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) or Berry connection polarizability (BCP). Using a tilted 2D dissipative Dirac model ansatz that harbors an exceptional ring, broken inversion symmetry is shown to give rise to extrinsic (BCD) and intrinsic (BCP) nonlinear Hall behaviors unique to systems with extensive exceptional singularities. In particular, when the non-Hermiticity is increased while keeping the ring radius fixed, the BCD response exhibits a power-law increase, while the BCP response correspondingly decreases. Our work sheds light on how non-Hermiticity can qualitatively control the extent and nature of higher harmonic generation in solids.</description>

      <title>Friedel oscillations in two-dimensional materials with inverted bands and Mexican-hat dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Friedel oscillations (FOs) in two-dimensional topological materials with Mexican hat band dispersion, which attract great interest due to the complex of its inherent non-trivial features, including the Van Hove singularity, doubly connected Fermi surface, non-trivial quantum-geometric properties, and the presence of states with negative effective mass. These factors are found to lead to a three-mode structure of the FOs. One of the modes, arising from electron transitions between the Fermi contours, has an unexpectedly large amplitude. The evolution of the amplitudes of all modes with Fermi energy is largely determined by the interplay of three main factors: intra-contour and inter-contour electron transitions, the quantum metric of the basis states, and the electron-electron interaction. We traced the role of each factor in the formation of the FO pattern and identified the corresponding features of the FO evolution.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast light-driven optical rotation and hidden orders in bulk WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-layer semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, lacking point inversion symmetry, provide an efficient platform for valleytronics, where the electronic, magnetic, valley and lattice degrees of freedom can be selectively manipulated by using polarized light. This task is however thought to be limited in parent bulk compounds where the point inversion symmetry is restored. Exploiting the underlying quantum physics in bulk materials is thus one of the biggest paradigmatic challenges. Here we show that a sizable optical Kerr rotation can be efficiently generated in a wide energy range on ultrafast timescales in bulk WSe$_2$, by means of circularly-polarized light. We rationalize these findings as a result of the hidden spin/layer/valley quantum entanglement. The spectral analysis reveals clear features at the three characteristic frequencies corresponding to the A-, B- and C-exciton edges. The origin and the relative sign of all these features is shown to stem from the selective Pauli blocking of intralayer and interlayer optical transitions. The long lifetime of the broadband Kerr response ($\tau \sim 500$ fs) provides a strong indication that coupled photo-induced electron and hole densities survive in bulk compounds longer than previously expected. The present report demonstrates that a hidden quantum entanglement is operative also in bulk centrosymmetric layered materials, opening the way for an effective exploitation of bulk WSe$_2$ in optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Noise Spectroscopy and Electrical Transport in NbO2 Memristors with Dual Resistive Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative differential resistance (NDR) behavior observed in several transition metal oxides is crucial for developing next-generation memory devices and neuromorphic computing systems. NbO2-based memristors exhibit two regions of NDR at room temperature, making them promising candidates for such applications. Despite this potential, the physical mechanisms behind the onset and the ability to engineer these NDR regions remain unclear, hindering further development of these devices for applications. This study employed electrical transport and ultra-low frequency noise spectroscopy measurements to investigate two distinct NDR phenomena in nanoscale thin films of NbO2. By analyzing the residual current fluctuations as a function of time, we find spatially inhomogeneous and non-linear conduction near NDR-1 and a two-state switching near NDR-2, leading to an insulator-to-metal (IMT) transition. The power spectral density of the residual fluctuations exhibits significantly elevated noise magnitudes around both NDR regions, providing insights into physical mechanisms and device size scaling for electronic applications. A simple theoretical model, based on the dimerization of correlated insulators, offers a comprehensive explanation of observed transport and noise behaviors near NDRs, affirming the presence of non-linear conduction followed by an IMT connecting macroscopic device response to transport signatures at atomic level.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian charge conversion in bilayer binary honeycomb lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional systems with space-time inversion symmetry, Dirac nodes (DNs) carry non-Abelian topological charges which induce intriguing momentum space braiding phenomenon. Although the original idea was proposed in condensed matter setup, the experimental verification of non-Abelian charge conversion has been limited to artificial metamaterials because of the difficulty in identifying suitable materials in which controlled tuning of DN positions is possible. In this work, we propose bilayer binary honeycomb lattices (BBHL) as a new material platform to study the non-Abelian charge conversion phenomenon in which DN positions in momentum space can be manipulated. More explicitly, we demonstrate that layer sliding and vertical pressure serve as tunable braiding parameters controlling the non-Abelian charge conversion process which is crucial to understand the stacking-dependent electronic properties of BBHL systems. We show that the BBHL systems are a promising candidate for the experimental realization of non-Abelian phenomena of DNs in condensed matter.</description>

Abstract: Time-varying media break the temporal translation symmetry of wave propagation in materials, enabling advanced wave manipulations. However, this novel phenomenon has been rarely explored in magnonic systems due to the significant challenge of achieving a sudden and prominent change in magnon dispersion within materials. Here, we drive a ferrimagnet with periodic pump pulses to construct time-varying strong coupling between two magnon modes. We observe a change in the beats of Rabi-like oscillations near the pulse edges, indicating the time-varying strong magnon coupling and the formation of time interfaces. Using a frequency comb spectroscopy technique developed in this work, we characterize the frequency conversion of magnon modes induced by the time-varying strong coupling effect. Moreover, we construct time slits with adjacent time interfaces and demonstrate, for the first time, the double-slit time diffraction of magnon modes. The frequency spacing of the multiplied magnon modes inversely correlates with the separation between two time slits, analogous to the well-known Yang's double-slit experiment. These findings rely solely on the time-varying strong magnon coupling, independent of device reconfiguration. Our results open avenues for applications such as all-magnetic mixers or on-chip GHz sources.</description>

      <title>Edge reconstruction of compressible Quantum Hall fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge reconstruction of gate-tunable compressible quantum Hall fluids in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3 is studied by measuring transmitted conductance of two individually excited fractional $e^2/3h$ edge modes of bulk 2/3 fractional quantum Hall fluid. Our findings reveal that the measured transmitted conductance deviates from the fully equilibrated value for the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3 of the gate-tunable compressible quantum Hall fluids at higher magnetic fields. This observation suggests that at the boundary of the compressible fluid a reconstructed $e^2/3h$ fractional edge mode is present and the mode does not completely equilibrate with the inner dissipative bulk region. Consequently, this outer reconstructed edge mode supports adiabatic charge transport, allowing non-equilibrated current transport through the compressible region. These studies open new avenues for achieving robust fractional edge modes even in compressible quantum Hall fluids under strong magnetic fields, enhancing our understanding of edge state dynamics in these complex systems.</description>

      <title>External Control over Magnon-Magnon Coupling in a Two-Dimensional Array of Square Shaped Nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of hybrid magnonics has gained significant momentum in recent years, driven by its potential to enable coherent information transfer and quantum transduction. This study delves into the tunable magnon-magnon coupling within a two-dimensional array of Ni80Fe20 (Permalloy) square nanomagnets by modulating its internal magnetic field configuration. Using a broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy, we systematically investigate the influence of the orientation of external magnetic field and microwave power on the coupling properties. Our findings reveal a pronounced anticrossing behavior, indicative of robust magnon-magnon coupling, whose strength can be tuned through both static and dynamic external parameters. The ability to modulate coupling strengths in this system highlights its potential for developing flexible and adaptive magnonic devices, crucial for future applications in quantum information processing and spintronic technologies. This work not only broadens the understanding of magnon-magnon interactions in complex geometries but also opens new avenues for the design of next-generation quantum magnonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point-gap topological phases of non-Hermitian systems exhibit exotic boundary states that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. Here, we develop classification of second-order point-gap topological phases with reflection symmetry. Based on this classification, we propose exceptional second-order topological insulators, exhibiting second-order boundary states stabilized by point-gap topology. As an illustrative example, we uncover a two-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator with point-gapless corner states. Furthermore, we identify a three-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator that features hinge states with isolated exceptional points, representing second-order topological phases intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Our work enlarges the family of point-gap topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>3D Magnetic Textures with Mixed Topology: Unlocking the Tunable Hopf Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knots and links play a crucial role in understanding topology and discreteness in nature. In magnetic systems, twisted, knotted and braided vortex tubes manifest as Skyrmions, Hopfions, or screw dislocations. These complex textures are characterized by topologically non-trivial quantities, such as a Skyrmion number, a Hopf index $H$, a Burgers vector (quantified by an integer $\nu$), and linking numbers. In this work, we introduce a discrete geometric definition of $H$ for periodic magnetic textures, which can be separated into contributions from the self-linking and inter-linking of flux tubes. We show that fractional Hopfions or textures with non-integer values of $H$ naturally arise and can be interpreted as states of ``mixed topology" that are continuously transformable to one of the multiple possible topological sectors. Our findings demonstrate a solid physical foundation for the Hopf index to take integer, non-integer, or specific fractional values, depending on the underlying topology of the system.</description>

      <title>Majorana modes in quantum dots coupled via a floating superconducting island</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana modes can be engineered in arrays where quantum dots (QDs) are coupled via grounded superconductors, effectively realizing an artificial Kitaev chain. Minimal Kitaev chains, composed by two QDs, can host fully-localized Majorana modes at discrete points in parameter space, known as Majorana sweet spots. Here, we extend previous works by theoretically investigating a setup with two QDs coupled via a floating superconducting island. We study the effects of the charging energy of the island and the properties of the resulting minimal Kitaev chain. We initially employ a minimal perturbative model, valid in the weak QD-island coupling regime, to derive analytic expressions for the Majorana sweet spots and the splitting of the ground state degeneracy as a function of tunable physical parameters. The conclusions from this perturbative approximation are then benchmarked using a microscopic model that explicitly describes the internal degrees of freedom of the island. Our work shows the existence of Majorana sweet spots, even when the island is not tuned at a charge-degeneracy point. In contrast to the Kitaev chains in grounded superconductors, these sweet spots involve a degeneracy between states with a well-defined number of particles.</description>

      <title>Evidence of zero-field Wigner solids in ultra-thin films of cadmium arsenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Wigner crystal is a many-body state where Coulombic repulsion quenches the kinetic energy of electrons, causing them to crystallize into a lattice. Experimental realization of a quantum Wigner crystal at zero magnetic field has been a long-sought goal. Here, we report on the experimental evidence of a Wigner solid in ultra-thin films of cadmium arsenide (Cd3As2) at zero magnetic field. We show that a finite bias depins the domains and produces an unusually sharp threshold current-voltage behavior. Hysteresis and voltage fluctuations point to domain motion across the pinning potential and disappear at finite temperature as thermal fluctuations overcome the potential. The application of a small magnetic field destroys the Wigner solid, pointing to an unconventional origin. We use Landau level spectroscopy to show that the formation of the Wigner solid is closely connected to a topological transition as the film thickness is reduced.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer spin-polarons and ferromagnetism in weakly doped AB-stacked TMD heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of ferromagnetic and magnetic polaron states in weakly doped heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides in the ``heavy fermion'' limit in which one layer hosts a dense set of local moments and the other hosts a low density of itinerant holes. We show that interactions among the carriers in the itinerant layer induces a ferromagnetic exchange. We characterize the ground state finding a competition, controlled by the carrier concentration and interlayer exchange, between a layer decoupled phase of itinerant carriers in a background of local moments, a fully polarized ferromagnet and a canted antiferromagnet. In the canted antiferromagnet phase the combination of the in-plane 120$^{\circ}$ N\'eel order and Ising spin orbit couplings induces winding in the electronic wavefunction giving rise to a topologically non-trivial spin texture and an observable anomalous Hall effect. At larger carrier density the ferromagnetically ordered phase transitions into a paramagnetic heavy Fermi liquid state. This theory enables a comprehensive understanding of the existing experimental observations while also making predictions including experimental signatures enabling direct imaging of spin polaron bound states with scanning tunneling microscopy. Our work shows that the prevailing paradigm of the (Doniach) phase diagram of heavy fermion metals is fundamentally modified in the low doping regime of heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. We also propose additional experiments that support the existence of axions. The appearance of the axion effect in the quantum Hall effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.</description>

Abstract: Yttrium calcium aluminate, with the formula CaYAl3O7, has been extensively researched due to its remarkable luminescent properties when doped or co-doped. Additionally, it exhibits exceptional piezoelectric properties at high temperatures. However, the potential magnetic properties this material can acquire through doping or co-doping have largely gone unexplored until now. In this innovative study, we investigate the quantum magnetic characteristics of yttrium calcium aluminate particles doped with transition metals such as cobalt, iron, and nickel. Our magnetic measurements of hysteresis curves in the macroscopic regime reveal intriguing magnetic characteristics that have not been documented in the literature. Given the high applicability of this material in biological microelectromechanical systems, we conducted a detailed study to demonstrate these findings.</description>

      <title>Interface second harmonic generation enhancement in hetero-bilayer van der Waals nanoantennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a promising platform for nanophotonics due to large refractive indexes and giant optical anisotropy. Unlike conventional dielectrics and semiconductors, the absence of covalent bonds between layers allows for novel degrees of freedom in designing optically resonant nanophotonic structures down to the atomic scale, from the precise stacking of vertical heterostructures to controlling the twist angle between crystallographic axes. Specifically, while transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers exhibit giant second order nonlinear responses, their bulk counterparts with 2H stacking have zero second order response. In this work, we show second harmonic generation (SHG) arising from the interface of WS$_2$/MoS$_2$ hetero-bilayer thin films with an additional SHG enhancement in nanostructured optical antennas mediated by both the excitonic resonances and the anapole condition. When both conditions are met, we observe up to $10^2$ SHG signal enhancement. Our results highlights vdW materials as a platform for designing unique multilayer optical nanostructures and metamaterial, paving the way for advanced applications in nanophotonics and nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition in small-size 1d and 2d Josephson junction arrays: analysis of the experiments within the interacting plasmons picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretically, Josephson junction (JJ) arrays can exhibit either a superconducting or insulating state, separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT). In this work, we analyzed published data on QPTs in three one-dimensional arrays and two two-dimensional arrays using a recently developed phenomenological model of QPTs. The model is based on the insight that the scaled experimental data depend in a universal way on two characteristic length scales of the system: the microscopic length scale $L_0$ from which the renormalization group flow starts, and the dephasing length, $L_{\varphi}(T)$ as given by the distance travelled by system-specific elementary excitations over the Planckian time. Our analysis reveals that the data for all five arrays (both 1D and 2D) can be quantitatively and self-consistently explained within the framework of interacting superconducting plasmons. In this picture, $L_{\varphi}=v_p\hbar/k_B T$, and $L_0 \approx \Lambda$, where $v_p$ is the speed of the plasmons and $\Lambda$ is the Coulomb screening length of the Cooper pairs. We also observe that, in 1D arrays, the transition is significantly shifted towards the insulating side compared to the predictions of the sine-Gordon model. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences with recent microwave studies of extremely long JJ chains, as well as with the pair-breaking QPT observed in superconducting nanowires and films.</description>

      <title>Multifield tunable valley splitting and anomalous valley Hall effect in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic MnBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to the ferromagnetic materials that realize the anomalous valley Hall effect by breaking time-reversal symmetry and spin-orbit coupling, the antiferromagnetic materials with the joint spatial inversion and time-reversal (PT) symmetry are rarely reported that achieve the anomalous valley Hall effect. Here, we predict that the antiferromagnetic monolayer MnBr possesses spontaneous valley polarization. The valley splitting of valence band maximum is 21.55 meV at K and K' points, which is originated from Mn-dx2-y2 orbital by analyzing the effective Hamiltonian. Importantly, monolayer MnBr has zero Berry curvature in the entire momentum space but non-zero spin-layer locked Berry curvature, which offers the condition for the anomalous valley Hall effect. In addition, the magnitude of valley splitting can be signally tuned by the onsite correlation, strain, magnetization rotation, electric field, and built-in electric field. The electric field and built-in electric field induce spin splitting due to breaking the P symmetry. Therefore, the spin-layer locked anomalous valley Hall effect can be observed in MnBr. More remarkably, the ferroelectric substrate Sc2CO2 can tune monolayer MnBr to realize the transition from metal to valley polarization semiconductor. Our findings not only extend the implementation of the anomalous valley Hall effect, but also provides a platform for designing low-power and non-volatile valleytronics devices.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between novel topological states and superconductivity has garnered substantial interest due to its potential for topological quantum computing. The Josephson effect serves as a useful probe for edge superconductivity in these hybrid topological materials. In Josephson junctions based on topological materials, supercurrents exhibit unique quantum interference patterns, including the conventional Fraunhofer oscillations, the $\Phi_0$-periodic oscillation, and the $2\Phi_0$-periodic oscillation in response to the external magnetic field ($\Phi_0 = h/2e$ is the flux quantum, $h$ the Planck constant, and $e$ the electron charge). These interference patterns stem from varied Andreev reflection mechanisms and the associated current density profiles. This review seeks to comprehensively examine the theoretical and experimental advancements in understanding the quantum interference patterns of edge supercurrents in Josephson junctions based on quantum spin Hall, quantum Hall, and quantum anomalous Hall systems.</description>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium quantum transport is crucial to technological advances ranging from nanoelectronics to thermal management. In essence, it deals with the coherent transfer of energy and (quasi-)particles through quantum channels between thermodynamic baths. A complete understanding of quantum transport thus requires the ability to simulate and probe macroscopic and microscopic physics on equal footing. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate the emergence of non-equilibrium steady quantum transport by emulating the baths with qubit ladders and realising steady particle currents between the baths. We experimentally show that the currents are independent of the microscopic details of bath initialisation, and their temporal fluctuations decrease rapidly with the size of the baths, emulating those predicted by thermodynamic baths. The above characteristics are experimental evidence of pure-state statistical mechanics and prethermalisation in non-equilibrium many-body quantum systems. Furthermore, by utilising precise controls and measurements with single-site resolution, we demonstrate the capability to tune steady currents by manipulating the macroscopic properties of the baths, including filling and spectral properties. Our investigation paves the way for a new generation of experimental exploration of non-equilibrium quantum transport in strongly correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Re-entrant topological order in strongly correlated nanowire due to Rashba spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of the Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC) on the topological properties of the one-dimensional (1D) extended \emph{s}-wave superconducting Hamiltonian, in the presence of strong electron-electron correlation, is investigated. It is found that a non-zero RSOC increases the periodicity of the effective Hamiltonian, which results in the folding of the Brillouin zone (BZ), and consequently in the emergence of an energy gap at the boundary of the BZ. If the chemical potential is inside the energy gap and it does not perceive the two-band structure of the resulting energy spectrum the topological phase is removed from the phase diagram.In contrast, if we move the chemical potential upwards towards the highest occupied band the opposite happens and the non-trivial topology is restored. This is the origin of re-entrant nature of the existent topological properties. This property of the system allows us to drive the system in and out of the topological phase only by the proper tuning of the chemical potential. A heterostructure involving van der Waals materials and a 1D Moire pattern for an investigation of the predicted effect has also been proposed and discussed in our work.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent Kardar-Parisi-Zhang Universality in Degenerate Coupled Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the multicomponent Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation describes the low-energy theory for phase fluctuations in a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ degenerate non-equilibrium driven-dissipative condensate with global $U(1)\times U(1)$ symmetry. Using dynamical renormalisation group in spatial dimension $d=1$, we demonstrate that coupled stochastic complex Ginsburg-Landau equations exhibit an emergent stationary distribution, enforcing KPZ dynamical exponent $z=3/2$ and static roughness exponent $\chi=1/2$ for both components. By tuning intercomponent interactions, the system can access other regimes, including a fragmented condensate regime from a dynamical instability in the phase fluctuations, as well as a spacetime vortex regime driven by the non-linear terms in the coupled KPZ equations. In stable regimes, we show that in specific submanifolds relevant to polaritons, the RG fixed point offers a transformation to decoupled KPZ equations. Our findings have broad implications for understanding multicomponent KPZ systems in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional spintronic transistors: Sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local GMR, and NDR in spin gapless semiconductor and/or spin gapped metal FETs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, enabling functions beyond conventional electronics. This study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike traditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60 mV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs for low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications like logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support computing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for these multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for simulations. Using a non-equilibrium Green's function method with density functional theory, we simulate transfer ($I{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{G}}$) and output ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{D}}$) characteristics of a VS$_2$/Ga$_2$O$_2$ FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS$_2$, predicting a sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 10$^8$, and a notable non-local GMR effect, demonstrating potential for low-power, high-performance applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Synchronization in Presence of Shot Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization is a widespread phenomenon encountered in many natural and engineered systems with nonlinear classical dynamics. How synchronization concepts and mechanisms transfer to the quantum realm and whether features are universal or platform specific are timely questions of fundamental interest. Here, we present a new approach to model incoherently driven dissipative quantum systems susceptible to synchronization within the framework of Josephson photonics devices, where a dc-biased Josephson junction creates (non-classical) light in a microwave cavity. The combined quantum compound constitutes a self-sustained oscillator with a neutrally stable phase. Linking current noise to the full counting statistics of photon emission allows us to capture phase diffusion, but moreover permits phase locking to an ac-signal and mutual synchronization of two such devices. Thereby one can observe phase stabilization leading to a sharp emission spectrum as well as unique photon emission statistics revealing shot noise induced phase slips. Two-time perturbation theory is used to obtain a reduced description of the oscillators phase dynamics in form of a Fokker-Planck equation in generalization of classical synchronization theories.</description>

      <title>Manifestation of edge-bulk incompatibility in fractional quantum Hall platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The edges of a two-dimensional topological phase of matter serve as a platform underlying its low-energy dynamics. The topology of the bulk phase dictates the structure of the gapless modes. Proximitizing boundary modes to another boundary, may lead to gap opening at the edge. Subsequently, one may engineer different segments of the boundary with intrinsic incompatibility of gap-generating mechanisms ("edge-edge incompatibility"), facilitating the generation of topological excitations, e.g. Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here we address the possibility of bulk-edge incompatibility, whereby the intrinsic bulk gap competes with a gap generated via boundary modes. Specifically, we consider two $\nu = 2/3$ fractional quantum Hall phases whose shared boundary modes are gapped out via disorder-generated tunneling across the boundary. A neutral superconducting phase, made up of neutral edge modes, is stabilized over a broad range of interaction parameters. This phase cannot coexist with the bulk gap. The resulting edge-bulk incompatibility gives rise to the emergence of MZMs (in the neutral sector). We propose an experimental setup to verify both the neutral superconductivity phase and the emergent MZMs.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Fraunhofer-like patterns in quantum anomalous Hall Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intriguing interplay between topology and superconductivity has attracted significant attention, given its potential for realizing topological superconductivity. In the quantum anomalous Hall insulators (QAHIs)-based junction, the supercurrents are carried by the chiral edge states, characterized by a $2\Phi_0$ magnetic flux periodicity ($\Phi_0 = h/2e$ is the flux quantum, $h$ the Planck constant, and $e$ the electron charge). However, experimental observations indicate the presence of bulk carriers in QAHI samples due to magnetic dopants. In this study, we reveal a systematic transition from edge-state to bulk-state dominant supercurrents as the chemical potential varies from the bulk gap to the conduction band. This results in an evolution from a $2\Phi_0$-periodic oscillation pattern to an asymmetric Fraunhofer pattern. Furthermore, a novel Fraunhoher-like pattern emerges due to the coexistence of chiral edge states and bulk states caused by magnetic {\color{black}domains}, even when the chemical potential resides within the gap. These findings not only advance the theoretical understanding but also pave the way for the experimental discovery of the chiral Josephson effect based on QAHI doped with magnetic impurities.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic droplets are nanoscale, non-topological, dynamical solitons that can be nucleated in different spintronic devices, such as spin torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) and spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). This chapter first briefly discusses the theory of spin current driven dissipative magnetic droplets in ferromagnetic thin films with uniaxial anisotropy. We then thoroughly review the research literature on magnetic droplets and their salient features, as measured using electrical, microwave, and synchrotron techniques, and as envisaged by micromagnetic simulations. We also touch upon a closely related soliton, the dynamical skyrmion. Finally, we present an outlook of new routes in droplet science.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Diamond Microscopy using Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) defects in diamond crystals has enabled the magnetic field imaging of a wide variety of nanoscale current profiles. Intimately linked with the imaging process is the problem of reconstructing the current density, which provides critical insight into the structure under study. This manifests as a non-trivial inverse problem of current reconstruction from noisy data, typically conducted via Fourier-based approaches. Learning algorithms and Bayesian methods have been proposed as novel alternatives for inference-based reconstructions. We study the applicability of Fourier-based and Bayesian methods for reconstructing two-dimensional current density maps from magnetic field images obtained from NV imaging. We discuss extensive numerical simulations to elucidate the performance of the reconstruction algorithms in various parameter regimes, and further validate our analysis via performing reconstructions on experimental data. Finally, we examine parameter regimes that favor specific reconstruction algorithms and provide an empirical approach for selecting regularization in Bayesian methods.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport and current noise through a multilevel Anderson impurity: Three-body Fermi-liquid corrections in quantum dots and magnetic alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Fermi-liquid description for thermoelectric transport and current noise, applicable to multilevel quantum dots (QD) and magnetic alloys (MA) without electron-hole or time-reversal symmetry. Our formulation for the low-energy transport is based on an Anderson model with $N$ discrete impurity levels, and is asymptotically exact at low energies, up to the next-leading order terms in power expansions with respect to temperature $T$ and bias voltage $eV$. The expansion coefficients can be expressed in terms of the Fermi-liquid parameters, which include the three-body correlation functions defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state in addition to the linear susceptibilities and the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of impurity electrons. We apply this formulation to SU($N$) symmetric QD and MA, and calculate the correlation functions for $N=4$ and $6$, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The three-body correlations are shown to be determined by a single parameter over a wide range of electron fillings $1 \lesssim N_d^{} \lesssim N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions $U$, and they also exhibit the plateau structures due to the SU($N$) Kondo effects at integer values of $N_d^{}$. We find that the Lorenz number $L=\kappa/(T \sigma)$ for QD and MA, defined as the ratio of the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ to the electrical conductivity $\sigma$, deviates from the universal Wiedemann-Franz value $\pi^2/(3e^2)$ as the temperature increases from $T=0$, showing the $T^2$ dependence, the coefficient for which depends on the three-body correlations away from half filling. We also demonstrate the role of three-body correlations on the nonlinear current noise and the other transport coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The applications of nanomechanical resonators range from from biomolecule mass sensing to hybrid quantum interfaces. Their performance is often is limited by internal material damping, which can be greatly reduced by using crystalline materials. Crystalline silicon carbide is particularly appealing due to its exquisite mechanical, electrical and optical properties, but has suffered from high internal damping due to material defects. Here we resolve this by developing nanomechanical resonators fabricated from bulk monocrystalline 4H-silicon carbide. This allows us to achieve damping as low as 2.7 mHz, more than an order-of-magnitude lower than any previous crystalline silicon carbide resonator and corresponding to a quality factor as high as 20 million at room temperature. The volumetric dissipation of our devices reaches the material limit for silicon carbide for the first time. This provides a path to greatly increase the performance of silicon carbide nanomechanical resonators, with potential for quality factors that exceed 10 billion at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a minimal low-energy model for Bernal bilayer graphene and related rhombohedral graphene multilayers at low electronic densities by constructing Wannier orbitals defined in real-space supercells of the original primitive cell. Starting from an ab-initio electronic structure theory comprising the atomic carbon $p_z$-orbitals, momentum locality of the Fermi surface pockets around $K,K'$ is circumvented by backfolding the $\pi$-bands to the concomitant mini-Brillouin zone of the supercell, reminiscent of their (twisted) moir\'e counterparts. The supercell Wannier functions reproduce the spectral weight and Berry curvature of the microscopic model and offer an intuitive real-space picture of the emergent physics at low electronic densities being shaped by flavor-polarized wave packets with mesoscopic extent. By projecting an orbital-resolved, dual-gated Coulomb interaction to the effective Wannier basis, we find that the low-energy physics of Bernal bilayer graphene is governed by weak electron-electron interactions. Our study bridges between existing continuum theories and ab-initio studies of small Fermi pocket systems like rhombohedral graphene stacks by providing a symmetric lattice description of their low-energy physics.</description>

Abstract: We study the optical response of the alternating twisted trilayer graphene by making use of a unitary transformation for the trilayer Hamiltonian and the Kubo formulation of linear response theory. The layer-resolved optical conductivities are expressed in terms of contributions from effective twisted bilayer and single-layer systems along with their coupling. We show that the in-plane magnetic response is proportional to this coupling between the twisted bilayer and single-layer systems; and, due to the different energy scales, the in-plane magnetic response is negligibly small. We also formulate a local electro-magnetic response that involves the vertical gradients of the magnetic field and moment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin transport in a junction system composed of a ferromagnetic insulator (FI) and a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with both Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. We briefly present our findings on spin pumping into the 2DEG under microwave irradiation and subsequent current generation via the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect. We highlight the crucial role of vertex corrections in the theoretical description of these effects.</description>

      <title>Topological States in Finite Graphene Nanoribbons Tuned by Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this comprehensive study, we conduct a theoretical investigation into the Stark shift of topological states (TSs) in finite armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) and heterostructures under transverse electric fields. Our focus centers on the multiple end zigzag edge states of AGNRs and the interface states of $9-7-9$ AGNR heterostructures. For the formal TSs, we observe a distinctive blue Stark shift in energy levels relative to the electric field within a range where the energy levels of TSs do not merge into the energy levels of bulk states. Conversely, for the latter TSs, we identify an oscillatory Stark shift in energy levels around the Fermi level. Simultaneously, we reveal the impact of the Stark effect on the transmission coefficients for both types of TSs. Notably, we uncover intriguing spectra in the multiple end zigzag edge states. In the case of finite $9-7-9$ AGNR heterostructures, the spectra of transmission coefficient reveal that the coupling strength between the topological interface states can be well controlled by the transverse electric fields. The outcomes of this research not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the electronic property in graphene-based materials but also pave the way for innovations in next-generation electronic devices and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Chiral Flat-Band Optical Cavity with Atomically Thin Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental requirement for photonic technologies is the ability to control the confinement and propagation of light. Widely utilized platforms include two-dimensional (2D) optical microcavities in which electromagnetic waves are confined between either metallic or distributed Bragg reflectors. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides hosting tightly bound excitons with high optical quality have emerged as promising atomically thin mirrors. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a sub-wavelength 2D nano-cavity using two atomically thin mirrors with degenerate resonances. Angle-resolved measurements show a flat band, which sets this system apart from conventional photonic cavities. Remarkably, we demonstrate how the excitonic nature of the mirrors enables the formation of chiral and tunable optical modes upon the application of an external magnetic field. Moreover, we show the electrical tunability of the confined mode. Our work demonstrates a mechanism for confining light with high-quality excitonic materials, opening perspectives for spin-photon interfaces, and chiral cavity electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Magnetostatic modes and criticality in quantum-Ising materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze modes in a dipole-dipole coupled quantum-Ising material, taking into consideration shape effects present in any real magnet. We find that the soft mode governing quantum criticality in a non-ellipsoidal sample is a magnetostatic mode which nulls out the effects of dynamic-demagnetization-field fluctuations. The demagnetization field is analyzed from a microscopic perspective. Two additional modes are calculated relying solely on knowledge of the demagnetization factor of the sample, one of which has lower energy than the soft mode governing quantum criticality in the bulk of the magnet. Experimental evidence for these theoretical results is provided by analysis of electronuclear modes in LiHoF$_4$, an archetypal quantum-Ising material.</description>

      <title>Topology of shallow-water waves on the rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological properties of the spectrum of shallow-water waves on a rotating spherical body are established. Particular attention is paid to its spectral flow, i.e. the modes whose frequencies transit between the Rossby and inertia-gravity wavebands as the zonal wave number is varied. Organising the modes according to the number of zeros of their meridional velocity, we conclude that the net number of modes transiting between the shallow-water wavebands on the sphere is null, in contrast with the Matsuno spectrum. This difference can be explained by a miscount of zeros under the $\beta$-plane approximation. We corroborate this result with the analysis of Delplace et al (2017) by showing that the curved metric discloses a pair of degeneracy points in the Weyl symbol of the wave operator, non-existent under the $\beta$-plane approximation, each of them bearing a Chern number $-1$.</description>

      <title>Stability of slow Hamiltonian dynamics from Lieb-Robinson bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a local spin system giving rise to a slow Hamiltonian dynamics is stable against generic, even time-dependent, local perturbations. The sum of these perturbations can cover a significant amount of the system's size. The stability of the slow dynamics follows from proving that the Lieb-Robinson bound for the dynamics of the total Hamiltonian is the sum of two contributions: the Lieb-Robinson bound of the unperturbed dynamics and an additional term coming from the Lieb-Robinson bound of the perturbations with respect to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of the study of the stability of Many-Body-Localized systems, implying that if a so called ergodic region is present in the system, to spread across a certain distance it takes a time proportional to the exponential of such distance. The non-perturbative nature of our result allows us to develop a dual description of the dynamics of a system. As a consequence we are able to prove that the presence of a region of disorder in a ergodic system implies the slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity of that region.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Thermal Transport in Tunable Self-Assembled Nanocrystal Supercrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing tunable functional materials with built-in nanoscale heat flow directionality represents a significant challenge that could advance thermal management strategies. Here we use spatiotemporally-resolved thermoreflectance to visualize lateral thermal transport anisotropy in self-assembled supercrystals of anisotropic Au nanocrystals. Correlative electron and thermoreflectance microscopy reveal that nano- to meso-scale heat predominantly flows along the long-axis of the anisotropic nanocrystals, and does so across grain boundaries and curved assemblies while voids disrupt heat flow. We finely control the anisotropy via the aspect ratio of constituent nanorods, and it exceeds the aspect ratio for nano-bipyramid supercrystals and certain nanorod arrangements. Finite element simulations and effective medium modeling rationalize the emergent anisotropic behavior in terms of a simple series resistance model, further providing a framework for estimating thermal anisotropy as a function of material and structural parameters. Self-assembly of colloidal nanocrystals promises an interesting route to direct heat flow in a wide range of applications that utilize this important class of materials.</description>

      <title>Material-realistic modelling of quantum many-body effects in a monolayer TMDC nanolaser device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient light-matter interaction in combination with the small volume occupied by monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) makes this material class a notable option as gain layer in future opto-electronic devices. Many-body effects of excited carriers influence the emission dynamics due to the introduction of optical non-linearities following excitation, but the exact mechanisms remain unexamined from a theoretical point of view. In this paper, we present a material-realistic microscopic theory of a device based on an MoS2-monolayer, which demonstrates stimulated emission activity at room temperature. The modelling procedure combines Coulomb and light-matter interaction matrix elements with doublet-level Quantum Laser Equations (QLEs). These give access to the dynamics of the photon-assisted polarisation, populations, and photon number while allowing the solution of a multi-scale problem ranging from femto- to nanoseconds. The input-output curve, hole burning and spectral clamping obtained from this theory present strong indications of electron-hole-plasma-based lasing occurring at densities above $5 \cdot 10^{13}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ in this device.</description>

      <title>Emergence of non-ergodic multifractal quantum states in geometrical fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality, a hallmark of non-interacting disordered metals which can potentially be observed in many-body localized states as well, is characterized by anomalous slow dynamics and appears relevant for many areas of quantum physics from measurement-driven systems to superconductivity. We propose a novel approach to achieve non-ergodic multifractal (NEM) states without disorder by iteratively introducing defects into a crystal lattice, reshaping it from a plain structure into fractal geometry. By comprehensive analysis of the Sierpi\'nski gasket case, we find a robust evidence of the emergence of NEM states that go beyond the conventional classification of quantum states and designate new pathways for quantum transport studies. We discuss potential experimental signatures of these states.</description>

      <title>Coulomb interactions in systems of generalized semi-Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions have strong effects in systems with flat bands. We examine the role of Coulomb interactions in two dimensional chiral anisotropic quasiparticles that disperse linearly in one direction and have relatively flat bands near the neutrality point in the other direction, dispersing with an arbitrary positive even power law $2n\geq 2$. As in the conventional semi-Dirac case ($n = 1$), we show using renormalization group that strong logarithmic divergences in the self-energy of generalized semi-Dirac fermions resum and lead to a restoration of the linearity of the spectrum for arbitrary n over a sizable energy window in the perturbative regime. We discuss those results in light of previous non-perturbative large $N_f$ results and address the implications for physical observables.</description>
