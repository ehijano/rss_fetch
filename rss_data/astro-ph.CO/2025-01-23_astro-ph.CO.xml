      <title>Introducing the AIDA-TNG project: galaxy formation in alternative dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the AIDA-TNG project, a suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations that simultaneously model galaxy formation and different variations of the underlying dark matter model. We consider the standard cold dark matter model and five variations, including three warm dark matter scenarios and two self-interacting models with constant or velocity-dependent cross-section. In each model, we simulate two cosmological boxes of 51.7 and 110.7 Mpc on a side, with the same initial conditions as TNG50 and TNG100, and combine the variations in the physics of dark matter with the fiducial IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. The AIDA-TNG runs are thus ideal for studying the simultaneous effect of baryons and alternative dark matter models on observable properties of galaxies and large-scale structures. We resolve haloes in the range between $10^{8}$ and $4\times10^{14}\,$M$_{\odot}$ and scales down to the nominal resolution of 570 pc in the highest resolution runs. This work presents the first results on statistical quantities such as the halo mass function and the matter power spectrum; we quantify the modification in the number of haloes and the power on scales smaller than 1 Mpc, due to the combination of baryonic and dark matter physics. Despite being calibrated on cold dark matter, we find that the TNG galaxy formation model can produce a realistic galaxy population in all scenarios. The stellar and gas mass fraction, stellar mass function, black hole mass as a function of stellar mass and star formation rate density are very similar in all dark matter models, with some deviations only in the most extreme warm dark matter model. Finally, we also quantify changes in halo structure due to warm and self-interacting dark matter, which appear in the density profiles, concentration-mass relation and galaxy sizes.</description>

      <title>DarkAI: Reconstructing the density, velocity and tidal field of dark matter from DESI-like bright galaxy sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the dark matter density, velocity, and tidal (MTV) fields from galaxy surveys is essential for advancing our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe. In this work, we present a machine learning-based framework using a UNet convolutional neural network to reconstruct the MTV fields from mock samples of the DESI bright galaxy survey within the redshift range $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.4$. Our approach accounts for realistic observational effects, including geometric selection, flux-limited data, and redshift space distortion (RSD) effects, thereby improving the fidelity of the reconstructed fields. Testing on mock galaxy catalogs generated from the Jiutian N-body simulation, our method achieves significant accuracy level. The reconstructed density field exhibits strong consistency with the true field, effectively eliminating most RSD effects and achieving a cross-correlation power spectrum coefficient greater than 0.985 on scales with $k &lt; 0.1 \, h \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The velocity field reconstruction accurately captures large-scale coherent flows and small-scale turbulent features, exhibiting slopes of the grid-to-grid relationship close to unity and a scatter below $\sim$100 $\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Additionally, the tidal field is reconstructed without bias, successfully recovering the features of the large-scale cosmic web, including clusters, filaments, sheets, and voids. Our results confirm that the proposed framework effectively captures the large-scale distribution and dynamics of dark matter while addressing key systematic challenges. These advancements provide a reliable and robust tool for analyzing current and future galaxy surveys, paving the way for new insights into cosmic structure formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytic model for decaying dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) affects the evolution of cosmic structure relative to standard cold, collisionless, stable dark matter (CDM). We introduce a new semi-analytic model for the effects of two-body DDM on halo structure and subhalo populations. In this scenario, cold parent dark matter particles decay into less massive daughter particles plus dark radiation with a lifetime comparable to the age of the universe. Our DDM model is implemented in the open-source software $\texttt{Galacticus}$ and accounts for heating (due to the velocity kicks imparted on daughter particles) and mass loss (due to the parent--daughter mass splitting). We show that decays flatten and reduce the amplitude of halos' inner density profiles. These effects make DDM subhalos susceptible to tidal disruption, which we show yields a mass-dependent suppression of the subhalo mass function relative to CDM. Our predictions for DDM density profiles, velocity dispersion profiles, and subhalo populations are consistent with results from isolated and cosmological DDM N-body simulations. Thus, our model enables efficient and accurate exploration of DDM parameter space and will be useful for deriving constraints from upcoming small-scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence between galaxy angular correlation function and power spectrum in constraining primordial non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the angular power spectrum ($C_\ell)$ and angular correlation function ($w(\theta)$) of galaxy number density field in the presence of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), explicitly accounting for the integral constraint in an all-sky survey. We show that the PNG signature in $C_{\ell}$ is confined to low multipoles in the linear regime, whereas its signature in $w(\theta)$ extends across a wide range of angular scales, including those below the nonlinear scale. Therefore, the equivalence between $C_\ell$ and $w(\theta)$ can be violated when scale cuts of multipoles or angular scales -- for example, to mitigate systematic effects -- are applied in the analysis. Assuming samples of photometric galaxies divided into multiple redshift bins in the range $0&lt;z&lt;7$, we forecast the precision of constraining the PNG parameter ($f_{\rm NL}$) from the hypothetical measurements of $C_\ell$ or $w(\theta)$ assuming different scale cuts in the multipoles or angular scales, respectively. Our results imply that the PNG information can be extracted from $w(\theta)$ on relatively small angular scales such as $\lesssim 10$ degree for a high-redshift galaxy sample or from $w(\theta)$ measured in a survey with partial area coverage.</description>

      <title>The late-time heating Green's function and improvements to distortion frequency hierarchy treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early energy injection leaves an imprint on the observed blackbody spectrum of the CMB, allowing us to study the thermal history of the Universe. For small energy release, the distortion can be efficiently computed using the quasi-exact Green's function method. For pre-recombination injections, the Green's function has already been studied previously. Here we reconsider the pre- and post-recombination periods, showcasing both the spectral distortion intensity and the relative temperature difference, which encrypt precious information about physical processes such as free-free interactions and thermal decoupling. We present the associated distortion visibility function, investigating the impact of various physical effects. We then study improvements to the so-called frequency hierarchy (FH) treatment, a method that was developed for the modelling of anisotropic distortions, which like the average distortion signals encode valuable cosmological information. Specifically, the FH treatment has shortcomings even in the $\mu$ era, that in principle should be easy to overcome. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to reduce the mismatch, concluding with a redefinition of the $\mu$ spectral shape using CosmoTherm. This solution takes into account double Compton and Bremsstrahlung effects in the low tail, which can be included in the FH. This opens the path towards a refined modeling of spectral distortion anisotropies.</description>

      <title>The Machine Learning to reconstruct GRB lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current knowledge in cosmology deals with open problems whose solutions are still under investigation. The main issue is the so-called Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, namely, the $4-6 \sigma$ discrepancy between the local value of $H_0$ obtained with Cepheids+Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) and the cosmological one estimated from the observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). For the investigation of this problem, probes that span all over the redshift $z$ ranges are needed. Cepheids are local objects, SNe Ia reached up to $z=2.9$, and CMB is observed at $z=1100$. In this context, the use of probes at intermediate redshift $z&gt;3$ is auspicious for casting more light on modern cosmology. The Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are particularly suitable for this task, given their observability up to $z=9.4$. The use of GRBs as standardizable candles requires the use of tight and reliable astrophysical correlations and the presence of gaps in the GRB time-domain data represents an obstacle in this sense. In this work, we propose to improve the precision of the lightcurve (LC) parameters through a reconstruction process performed with the functional forms of GRB LCs and the Gaussian Processes (GP). The filling of gaps in the GRB LCs through these processes shows an improvement up to $41.5\%$ on the precision of the LC parameters fitting, which lead to a reduced scatter in the astrophysical correlations and, thus, in the estimation of cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>The QCD Equation of State with $N_f=3$ flavours up to the electro-weak scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Equation of State of Quantum Chromodynamics with $N_f=3$ flavours is determined non-perturbatively in the range of temperatures between $3$ and $165$ GeV with a precision of about $0.5$-$1.0\%$. The calculation is carried out by numerical simulations of lattice gauge theory discretized \`a la Wilson with shifted boundary conditions in the compact direction. At each given temperature the entropy density is computed at several lattice spacings in order to extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. Taken at face value, data point straight to the Stefan-Boltzmann value by following a linear behaviour in the strong coupling constant squared. They are also compatible with the known perturbative formula supplemented by higher order terms in the coupling constant, a parameterization which describes well our data together with those present in the literature down to $500$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Supercooled phase transitions in conformal dark sectors explain NANOGrav data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to recent lore, supercooled first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) cannot explain the evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background obtained by pulsar timing arrays. We demonstrate that supercooled FOPTs in Majoron-like U(1)' models with a conformal dark sector easily explain the nHz signal at NANOGrav in conjunction with the observed pattern of active neutrino masses and mixing. We find that models with a U(1)' charge of the Higgs doublet close to that of the B-L model are favored.</description>

      <title>Potential of RES-NOVA as Dark Matter observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The RES-NOVA project is an experimental initiative aimed at detecting neutrinos from the next galactic supernova using PbWO$_{4}$ cryogenic detectors, operated at low temperatures in a low-background environment. By utilizing archaeological lead (Pb) as the target material, RES-NOVA leverages its high radiopurity, large nuclear mass, and the natural abundance of $^{207}$Pb, making it well-suited for exploring both spin-independent and spin-dependent Dark Matter (DM) interactions via nuclear scattering. This work presents a background model developed for the RES-NOVA technology demonstrator and evaluates its implications for Dark Matter detection. Detailed calculations of nuclear matrix elements, combined with the unique properties of archaeological Pb, demonstrate RES-NOVA's potential as a complementary tool to existing direct detection experiments for studying Dark Matter interactions. The experiment will conduct DM searches over a broad mass range spanning 4 orders of magnitude, from sub-GeV/$c^2$ to TeV/$c^2$. In the most optimistic scenario, RES-NOVA is expected to probe DM-nucleon cross-sections down to 1$\times 10^{-43}$ cm$^2$ and 2$\times 10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for candidates with masses of 2 GeV/$c^2$ and 20 GeV/$c^2$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Constraining Proper Motion of Strongly Lensed Eccentric Binary Mergers using Doppler Triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong lensing of gravitational wave (GW) sources allows the observer to see the GW source from different lines-of-sight (LOS) through the corresponding images, which provides a way for constraining the relative proper motion of the GW source. This is possible as the GW signals received from each image will have slightly different projected velocity components, from which one can `Doppler-Triangulate' for the GW source velocity vector. The difference in projected velocity between the different images can be observationally inferred through pairwise GW phase measurements that accumulate over the time-of-observation. In this paper we study lensed eccentric GW sources and explore how the observable GW phase shift between images evolve as a function of time, eccentricity, lens- and binary parameters. Next generation GW observatories, including the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will see $\sim $hundreds/year of lensed GW sources, where a significant fraction of these are expected to be eccentric. We discuss the expected unique observables for such eccentric lensed GW sources, and the relation to their observable relative linear motion, which otherwise is exceedingly difficult to constrain in general.</description>

      <title>Detection of Unresolved Strongly Lensed Supernovae with 7-Dimensional Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) are a powerful tool for exploring the realms of astronomy and cosmology. Time-delay measurements and lens modeling of glSNe can provide a robust and independent method for constraining the expansion rate of the universe. The study of unresolved glSNe light curves presents a unique opportunity for utilizing small telescopes to investigate these systems. In this work, we investigate diverse observational strategies for the initial detection of glSNe using the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT), a multi-telescope system composed of twenty 50-cm telescopes. We implement different observing strategies on a subset of 5807 strong lensing systems and candidates identified within the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), as reported in various publications. Our simulations under ideal observing conditions indicate the maximum expected annual detection rates for various glSNe types (Type Ia and core-collapse (CC)) using the 7DT target observing mode in the $r$-band at a depth of 22.04 mag, as follows: 8.25 events for type Ia, 3.06 for type Ic, 1.04 for type IIb, 0.66 for type IIL, 0.89 for type IIn, 5.26 for type IIP, and 1.44 for type Ib. Furthermore, in the case of medium-band filter observations (m6000) at a depth of 20.61 in the Wide-Field Survey (WFS) program, the predicted detection rate for glSNe Ia is 3.30 $yr^{-1}$. Given targeted follow-up observations of these initially detected systems with more powerful telescopes, we can apply a model-independent approach to forecast the ability to measure $H_{0}$ using a Gaussian process from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) data and time-delay distance information derived from glSNe systems, which include both Ia and CC types. We forecast that the expected detection rate of glSNe systems can achieve a $2.4\%$ precision in estimating the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields limit the mass of Population III stars even before the onset of protostellar radiation feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The masses of Population III stars are largely unconstrained since no simulations exist that take all relevant primordial star formation physics into account. We perform the first suite of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation, with the POPSICLE project. Compared to control simulations that only include magnetic fields (MHD), protostellar ionizing and dissociating feedback, or neither, the RMHD simulation best resembles the MHD simulation during the earliest stages of collapse and star formation. In $5000\,\rm{yrs}$, the mass of the most massive star is $65\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in the RMHD simulation, compared to $120\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in simulations without magnetic fields. This difference arises because magnetic fields act against gravity, suppress mass transport, and reduce compressional heating. The maximum stellar mass of Population III stars is thus already limited by magnetic fields, even before accretion rates drop to allow significant protostellar radiative feedback. Following classical main sequence stellar evolution with MESA reveals that it is difficult to create Population III stars with masses larger than $600\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \gtrsim 20$, with maximum stellar masses $\sim 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ more likely due to expected negative feedback from both magnetic fields and stellar radiation. This work lays the first step in building a full physics-informed mass function of Population III stars.</description>

Abstract: BayesEoR is a GPU-accelerated, MPI-compatible Python package for estimating the power spectrum of redshifted 21-cm emission from interferometric observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Utilizing a Bayesian framework, BayesEoR jointly fits for the 21-cm EoR power spectrum and a "foreground" model, referring to bright, contaminating emission between us and the cosmological signal, and forward models the instrument with which these signals are observed. To perform the sampling, we use MultiNest [arXiv:1402.0004], which calculates the Bayesian evidence as part of the analysis. Thus, BayesEoR can also be used as a tool for model selection [see e.g. arXiv:1701.03384].</description>

      <title>Can supermassive stars form in protogalaxies due to internal Lyman-Werner feedback?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population III stars are possible precursors to early massive and supermassive black holes (BHs). The presence of soft UV Lyman Werner (LW) background radiation can suppress Population III star formation in minihalos and allow them to form in pristine atomic cooling halos. In the absence of molecular hydrogen ($\rm H_2$) cooling, atomic-cooling halos enable rapid collapse with suppressed fragmentation. High background LW fluxes from preceding star-formation have been proposed to dissociate $\rm H_2$. This flux can be supplemented by LW radiation from one or more Population III star(s) in the same halo, reducing the necessary background level. Here we consider atomic-cooling halos in which multiple protostellar cores form close to one another nearly simultaneously. We assess whether the first star's LW radiation can dissociate nearby $\rm H_2$, enabling the prompt formation of a second, supermassive star (SMS) from warm, atomically-cooled gas. We use a set of hydrodynamical simulations with the code ENZO, with identical LW backgrounds centered on a halo with two adjacent collapsing gas clumps. When an additional large local LW flux is introduced, we observe immediate reductions in both the accretion rates and the stellar masses that form within these clumps. While the LW flux reduces the $\text{H}_2$ fraction and increases the gas temperature, the halo core's potential well is too shallow to promptly heat the gas to $\gtrsim$ 1000 K and increase the accretion rate onto the second protostar. We conclude that internal LW feedback inside atomic-cooling halos is unlikely to facilitate the formation of SMSs or massive BH seeds.</description>

      <title>Constraining the shape of dark matter haloes using only starlight. I. A new technique and its application to the galaxy Nube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new technique to constrain the gravitational potential of a galaxy from the observed stellar mass surface density alone under a number of assumptions. It uses the classical Eddington Inversion Method to compute the phase-space distribution function (DF) needed for the stars to reside in a given gravitational potential. In essence, each potential defines a set of density profiles, and it is the expansion of the observed profile in this database that provides the DF. If the required DF becomes negative then the potential is inconsistent with the observed stars and can be discarded. It is particularly well-suited for analyzing low-mass low surface brightness galaxies, where photometric but not spectroscopic data can be obtained. The recently discovered low surface brightness galaxy 'Nube' was used to showcase its application. For the observed Nube's stellar core to be reproduced with non-negative DF, cuspy NFW (Navarro, Frenk, and White) potentials are highly disfavored compared with potentials having cores (Schuster-Plummer or rho-230). The method assumes the stellar system to have spherical symmetry and isotropic velocity distribution, however, we discuss simple extensions that relax the need for isotropy and may help to drop the spherical symmetry assumption.</description>

      <title>Testing an oscillatory behavior of dark energy</title>

Abstract: The main aim of this work is to use a model-independent approach, along with late-time observational probes, to reconstruct the dark energy (DE) equation of state $w_{\rm DE}(z)$. Our analysis showed that, for a late time universe, $w_{\rm DE}$ deviates from being a constant but in contrast exhibits an oscillatory behavior, hence both quintessence ($w_{\rm DE}&gt; -1$) and phantom ($w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$) regimes are equally allowed. In order to portray this oscillatory behavior, we explored various parametrizations for the equation of state and identified the closest approximation based on the goodness of fit with the data and the Bayesian evidence analysis. Our findings indicated that while all considered oscillating DE parametrizations provided a better fit to the data, compared to the cosmological constant, they are penalized in the Bayesian evidence analysis due to the additional free parameters. Overall, the present article demonstrates that in the low redshift regime, the equation of state of the DE prefers to be dynamical and oscillating. We anticipate that future cosmological probes will take a stand in this direction.</description>

      <title>The LISA forecast on a smooth crossover beyond the Standard Model through the scalar-induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supposing the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational wave (GW) detector, we exhibit the detectability of a hypothetical smooth crossover in the early universe beyond the Standard Model of particle physics through the scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) in terms of the Fisher forecast. A crossover at $\sim100\,\mathrm{TeV}$ can leave a signal on the GW spectrum in the $\sim\mathrm{mHz}$ frequency range, the sweet spot of the LISA sensitivity. These possibilities are also interesting in the primordial black hole (PBH) context as the associated PBH mass $\sim10^{22}\,\mathrm{g}$ lies at the window to explain the whole dark matter. We found that the properties of the crossover can be well determined if the power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations are as large as $\sim5\times10^{-4}$ on the corresponding scale $\sim10^{12}\,\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Can decaying vacuum solve the H_0 Tension?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work we analyze two different models of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, also known as vacuum decay models or $\Lambda(t)$CDM models. In both models, when the $H_0$ parameter is constrained by the Planck distance priors, its value is compatible with a higher value of $H_0$, in agreement with SH0ES data, while simultaneously reducing the values of $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_b$. In both models, we find $H_0=73.1\pm0.86$ at 68\% c.l. by combining Planck+SH0ES data. We also find the decay parameter to be $\varepsilon=0.0197^{+0.0032}_{-0.0027}$ for one model and $\varepsilon=0.0203\pm0.0034$ for the other one. From these analyses, a noninteracting model is excluded at least at $6\sigma$ c.l.! This shows that these types of models are promising in solving or at least alleviating the $H_0$ tension problem. Our analysis also shows a preference for the decay of vacuum into dark matter, in agreement to thermodynamic analyses.</description>

      <title>Lyman Alpha Forest - Halo Cross-Correlations in Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a perturbative effective field theory (EFT) description for anisotropic (redshift-space) correlations between the Lyman alpha forest and a generic biased tracer of matter, which could be represented by quasars, high-redshift galaxies, or dark matter halos. We compute one-loop EFT power spectrum predictions for the combined analysis of the Lyman alpha and biased tracers' data and test them on the publicly available high fidelity Sherwood simulations. We use massive and light dark matter halos at redshift $z=2.8$ as proxies for quasars and high-redshift galaxies, respectively. In both cases, we demonstrate that our EFT model can consistently describe the complete data vector consisting of the Lyman alpha forest auto spectrum, the halo auto spectrum, and the Lyman alpha -- halo cross spectrum. We show that the addition of cross-correlations significantly sharpens constraints on EFT parameters of the Lyman alpha forest and halos. In the combined analysis, our EFT model fits the simulated cross-spectra with a percent level accuracy at $k_{\rm max}= 1~h$Mpc$^{-1}$, which represents a significant improvement over previous analytical models. Thus, our work provides precision theoretical tools for full-shape analyses of Lyman alpha - quasar cross-correlations with ongoing and upcoming spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>A New Master Supernovae Ia sample and the investigation of the $H_0$ tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern cosmological research still thoroughly debates the discrepancy between local probes and the Cosmic Microwave Background observations in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements, ranging from $4\sigma$ to $6\sigma$. In the current study we examine this tension using the Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) data from the Pantheon, PantheonPlus, Joint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA), and Dark Energy Survey (DES) catalogs together with their combination called Master Sample containing 3789 SNe Ia, and dividing all of them into redshift-ordered bins. Two main binning techniques are presented: the equipopulation and the equispace in the $\log\, z$. We perform a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) for each bin to determine the $H_0$ value, estimating it within the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM and the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM models. These $H_0$ values are then fitted with the following phenomenological function: $\mathcal{H}_0(z) = \tilde{H}_0 / (1 + z)^\alpha$, where $\tilde{H}_0$ is a free parameter representing $\mathcal{H}_0(z)$ fitted at $z=0$, and $\alpha$ is the evolutionary parameter. Our results indicate a decreasing trend characterized by $\alpha \sim 0.01$ whose consistency with zero range from $1.00 \sigma$ at 3 bins in the Pantheon sample with the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model to $\geq 6 \sigma$ at 12 bins with the JLA and DES samples within the $\Lambda$CDM model. Such a trend in the SNe Ia catalogs could be due to evolution with redshift for the SNe Ia astrophysical variables or unveiled selection biases. Alternatively, intrinsic physics, possibly the $f(R)$ theory of gravity, could be responsible for this trend.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formalism for cosmological perturbations: fixing the gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbation theory is an example of a gauge theory, where gauge transformations correspond to changes in the space-time coordinate system. To determine physical quantities, one is free to introduce gauge conditions (\ie to work with specific space-time coordinates), and such conditions are often used to simplify technical aspects of the calculation or to facilitate the interpretation of the physical degrees of freedom. Some of the prescriptions introduced in the literature are known to fix the gauge only partially, but it is commonly assumed that the remaining gauge degrees of freedom can be fixed somehow. In this work, we show that this is not necessarily the case, and that some of these gauges are indeed pathological. We derive a systematic procedure to determine whether a gauge is pathological or not, and to complete partially-fixed gauges into healthy gauges when this is possible. In this approach, the Lagrange multipliers (\ie the perturbed lapse and shift in the ADM formalism) cannot appear in the off-shell definition of the gauges, they necessarily arise as on-shell consequences of the gauge conditions. As illustrative applications, we propose an alternative, non-pathological formulation of the synchronous gauge, and we show that the uniform-expansion gauge (as well as any gauge ensuring vanishing lapse perturbations) can hardly be made healthy. Our methodology also allows us to construct all gauge-invariant variables. We further show that our non-pathological criterion for gauges is also the one that ensures Dirac brackets to be properly defined. This allows cosmological perturbations to be quantised in a gauge-fixed way. We finally discuss possible generalisations of our formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel realisation of leptogenesis that relies on the out-of-equilibrium decay of an axion-like particle (ALP) into right-handed Majorana neutrinos (RHNs) in the early Universe. With respect to standard thermal leptogenesis, our mechanism lowers by two orders of magnitude the RHN mass, or the tuning in the RHN mass splittings, needed to reproduce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and neutrino masses. We find that ALP leptogenesis requires $m_a &gt; 10^{4}$ GeV and $f_a &gt; 10^{11}$ GeV for the ALP mass and decay constant, and predicts an early period of matter domination induced by the ALP in parts of its parameter space. We finally provide a viable supersymmetric realisation of ALP leptogenesis where the ALP is the $R$-axion, which accommodates GeV gravitino dark matter and predicts RHN below 10 TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06032v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Cosmic superstrings, metastable strings and ultralight primordial black holes: from NANOGrav to LIGO and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While topologically stable cosmic strings are disfavoured by the recent observation of nHz stochastic gravitational waves (GW) by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), e.g., NANOGrav, cosmic metastable strings and superstrings are not. However, because the gravitational waves from all classes of strings generally span a wide range of frequencies, they contradict LIGO's non-observation of stochastic gravitational waves at the $f\sim $ 25 Hz band for a substantial string-parameter space favoured by the PTA data. Suppose ultralight primordial black holes ($M_{\rm BH}&lt;10^9$ g) existed in the early universe. In this case, they reduce the amplitude of the GWs at higher frequencies by providing an early matter-dominated phase, alleviating the tension between LIGO observation and PTA data. We show that the recent PTA data complemented by future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) runs plus detectors such as LISA and ET would be able to dapple the properties and further search strategies of such ultralight primordial black holes which are otherwise fairly elusive as they evaporate in the early universe by Hawking radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the conditions for finding an island in an anisotropic universe - Bianchi Type-I filled with radiation. We verify that the existence of islands does not depend on their shape. We then find that islands may form at certain times, near the turnaround point - where the universe turns from contraction to expansion in one of the directions. This is in line with previous analyses regarding cosmological space-times where islands form if one has two energy scales in the problem, such as the typical temperature of the universe and, on top of that, cosmological constant, curvature, anisotropy, or some mass scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01758v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two inhomogeneous cosmological models, namely, the flat McVittie spacetime and a simple specific LTB spacetime. Relative to the world line of a reference comoving observer that remains spatially at rest, we study the local deviations of the world lines of free test particles. These local peculiar motions can be invariantly characterized within the framework of a quasi-inertial Fermi normal coordinate system established along the world line of the reference comoving observer. Tidal dynamics in the McVittie model involves the sum of the curvature due to the inhomogeneity, the curvature due to the background FLRW spacetime and a mixed term, while tidal dynamics in the particular LTB model turns out to be qualitatively the same as in the Einstein-de Sitter universe. Peculiar motions in the two cosmological models are briefly compared and contrasted.</description>

      <title>Early formation of supermassive black holes from the collapse of strongly self-interacting dark matter</title>

Abstract: Evidence for high-redshift supermassive black holes challenges standard scenarios for how such objects form in the early universe. Here, we entertain the possibility that a fraction of the cosmological dark matter could be ultra-strongly self interacting. This would imply that gravothermal collapse occur at early times in the cores of dark matter halos, followed by accretion. We study under which conditions on the abundance and interaction strength and structure of such ultra self-interacting dark matter the black holes resulting from the end-point of gravothermal core collapse can seed the observed, early-forming supermassive black holes. We find, depending on the velocity dependence of the self-interaction cross section, a bimodal structure in the favored parameter space, where data points to either a small collapsing dark matter fraction with a large cross section, or a large fraction and a relatively small cross section. While self-interaction cross sections with different velocity dependence can explain observations, we find that the best, self-consistent results correspond to a Rutherford-like self-interaction, typical of long-range dark-sector forces with light mediators. We discuss complementary observational probes if this scenario is realized in nature, focusing especially on the expected intermediate mass black holes predicted to exist in smaller galaxies.</description>

      <title>From Dark Matter Minihalos to Large-Scale Radiative Feedback: A Self-Consistent 3D Simulation of the First Stars and Galaxies using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key obstacle to accurate models of the first stars and galaxies is the vast range of distance scales that must be considered. While star formation occurs on sub-parsec scales within dark matter (DM) minihalos, it is influenced by large-scale baryon-dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm bc}$) and Lyman-Werner (LW) radiative feedback which vary significantly on scales of $\sim$100 Mpc. We present a novel approach to this issue in which we utilize artificial neural networks (NNs) to emulate the Population III (PopIII) and Population II (PopII) star formation histories of many small-scale cells given by a more complex semi-analytic framework based on DM halo merger trees. Within each simulation cell, the NN takes a set of input parameters that depend on the surrounding large-scale environment, such as the cosmic overdensity, $\delta(\vec{x})$, and $v_{\rm bc}$ of the cell, then outputs the resulting star formation far more efficiently than is possible with the semi-analytic model. This rapid emulation allows us to self-consistently determine the LW background intensity on $\sim$100 Mpc scales, while simultaneously including the detailed merger histories (and corresponding star formation histories) of the low-mass minihalos that host the first stars. Comparing with the full semi-analytic framework utilizing DM halo merger trees, our NN emulators yield star formation histories with redshift-averaged errors of $\sim$7.3\% and $\sim$5.2\% for PopII and PopIII, respectively. When compared to a simpler sub-grid star formation prescription reliant on halo mass function integration, we find that the diversity of halo merger histories in our simulation leads to enhanced spatial fluctuations, an earlier transition from PopIII to PopII dominated star formation, and more scatter in star formation histories overall.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Noise and Singularities in Bayesian Calibration Methods for Global 21-cm Cosmology Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the large dynamic ranges involved with separating the cosmological 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn from galactic foregrounds, a well-calibrated instrument is essential to avoid biases from instrumental systematics. In this paper we present three methods for calibrating a global 21-cm cosmology experiment using the noise wave parameter formalisation to characterise a low noise amplifier including a careful consideration of how calibrator temperature noise and singularities will bias the result. The first method presented in this paper builds upon the existing conjugate priors method by weighting the calibrators by a physically motivated factor, thereby avoiding singularities and normalising the noise. The second method fits polynomials to the noise wave parameters by marginalising over the polynomial coefficients and sampling the polynomial orders as parameters. The third method introduces a physically motivated noise model to the marginalised polynomial method. Running these methods on a suite of simulated datasets based on the REACH receiver design and a lab dataset, we found that our methods produced a calibration solution which is equally as or more accurate than the existing conjugate priors method when compared with an analytic estimate of the calibrator's noise. We find in the case of the measured lab dataset the conjugate priors method is biased heavily by the large noise on the shorted load calibrator, resulting in incorrect noise wave parameter fits. This is mitigated by the methods introduced in this paper which calibrate the validation source spectra to within 5% of the noise floor.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations meet Wheeler DeWitt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study approximate solutions of the Wheeler DeWitt (WdW) equation and compare them with the standard results of cosmological perturbation theory. In mini-superspace, we introduce a dimensionless gravitational coupling $\alpha$ that is typically very small and functions like $\hbar$ in a WKB expansion. We seek solutions of the form $\Psi = e^{iS/\alpha} \psi$ that are the closest quantum analog of a given classical background spacetime. The function $S$ satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, while $\psi$ obeys a Schr\"odinger-like equation and can be given a probabilistic interpretation. The semiclassical limit suggests a specific relation between $\psi$ and the standard perturbation-theory wavefunction $\psi_P$. We verify this relation in two main examples: a scalar field with a purely exponential potential, of which simple scaling solutions are known and a slow-roll scenario expanded in the vicinity of the origin in field space. Each example is worked out in two different gauges, that are the minisuperspace equivalent of unitary gauge and spatially flat gauge. We discuss possible deviations from the classical background trajectory as well as the higher ``time" derivative terms that are present in the WdW equation but not in the perturbative approach. We clarify the \emph{conditional probability} content of the wavefunctions and how this is related with the standard gauge fixing procedure in perturbation theory.</description>
