      <title>Maximum-likelihood regression with systematic errors for astronomy and the physical sciences: I. Methodology and goodness-of-fit statistic of Poisson data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a new statistical method that enables the use of systematic errors in the maximum-likelihood regression of integer-count Poisson data to a parametric model. The method is primarily aimed at the characterization of the goodness-of-fit statistic in the presence of the over-dispersion that is induced by sources of systematic error, and is based on a quasi-maximum-likelihood method that retains the Poisson distribution of the data. We show that the Poisson deviance, which is the usual goodness-of-fit statistic and that is commonly referred to in astronomy as the Cash statistics, can be easily generalized in the presence of systematic errors, under rather general conditions. The method and the associated statistics are first developed theoretically, and then they are tested with the aid of numerical simulations and further illustrated with real-life data from astronomical observations. The statistical methods presented in this paper are intended as a simple general-purpose framework to include additional sources of uncertainty for the analysis of integer-count data in a variety of practical data analysis situations.</description>

      <title>Developing a Wyne Corrector for higher spectral bandwidth focal plane wavefront sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focal plane wavefront sensing techniques are generally limited to using imaging systems that have below 1% spectral bandwidths, due to the radial smearing of speckles from chromatic diffraction that causes optical image magnification over larger spectral bandwidths. Wyne (1979) designed a pair of triplet lenses to optically minimize this chromatic magnification and increase the spectral bandwidth. Such a Wyne corrector could enable focal plane wavefront sensing at up to 50% spectral bandwidths and as a result open enable $&gt;50x$ higher-speed focal plane wavefront sensing. We present results of the design and laboratory testing of a Wyne corrector prototype, including a detailed tolerancing analysis considering manufactural wavelength ranges and alignment tolerances. These tests show promising results that this technology can be deployed to current and future high speed focal plane wavefront sensing instruments to enable significant performance enhancements. This document number is LLNL-ABS-857246.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of a Quantum-Optimal Coronagraph Using Spatial Mode Sorters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ideal direct imaging coronagraph, which selectively rejects the fundamental mode of a telescope, has been shown to achieve the quantum information limits for exoplanet detection and localization. In this study, we experimentally implement this quantum-optimal coronagraph using spatial mode (de)multiplexing. Our benchtop system includes a forward and inverse pass through a free-space programmable spatial mode sorter, designed to isolate photons in a point spread function (PSF)-adapted basis. During the forward pass, the fundamental mode is rejected, effectively eliminating light from an on-axis point-like star. On the inverse pass, the remaining modes are coherently recombined, enabling direct imaging of a faint companion. We develop a probabilistic measurement model that accounts for combined effects of fundamental shot noise and experimental noise specific to our benchtop setup, such as modal cross-talk, dark noise, and ambient background illumination. We leverage this measurement model to formulate a maximum-likelihood estimator of the exoplanet position given an image captured with the coronagraph. Using this approach, we successfully localize an artificial exoplanet at sub-diffraction distances $(&lt;\sigma)$ from its host star under a 1000:1 star-planet contrast ratio. Our system accurately localizes the exoplanet up to an absolute error $&lt;0.03\sigma$ over the separation range $[0,\,0.6]\sigma$. Finally, we numerically evaluate the precision of our experimental coronagraph against state-of-the-art coronagraphs subject to comparable noise models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting AGN Placement on the BPT Diagram: A Spectral Decomposition Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional single-fibre spectroscopy provides a single galaxy spectrum, forming the basis for crucial parameter estimation. However, its accuracy can be compromised by various sources of contamination, such as the prominent \Ha~emission line originating from both Star-Forming (SF) regions and non-Star-Forming regions (NonSF), including Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The potential to dissect a spectrum into its SF and NonSF constituents holds the promise of significantly enhancing precision in parameter estimates. In contrast, Integral Field Unit (IFU) surveys present a solution to minimize contamination. These surveys examine spatially localized regions within galaxies, reducing the impact of mixed sources. Although an IFU survey's resulting spectrum covers a smaller region of a galaxy than single-fibre spectroscopy, it can still encompass a blend of heterogeneous sources. Our study introduces an innovative model informed by insights from the MaNGA IFU survey. This model enables the decomposition of galaxy spectra, including those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), into SF and NonSF components. Applying our model to these survey datasets produces two distinct spectra, one for SF and another for NonSF components, while conserving flux across wavelength bins. When these decomposed spectra are visualized on a BPT diagram, interesting patterns emerge. There is a significant shift in the placement of the NonSF decomposed spectra, as well as the emergence of two distinct clusters in the LINER and Seyfert regions. This shift highlights the key role of SF `contamination' in influencing the positioning of NonSF spectra within the BPT diagram.</description>

      <title>Development of MMC-based lithium molybdate cryogenic calorimeters for AMoRE-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AMoRE collaboration searches for neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{100}$Mo using molybdate scintillating crystals via low temperature thermal calorimetric detection. The early phases of the experiment, AMoRE-pilot and AMoRE-I, have demonstrated competitive discovery potential. Presently, the AMoRE-II experiment, featuring a large detector array with about 90 kg of $^{100}$Mo isotope, is under construction.This paper discusses the baseline design and characterization of the lithium molybdate cryogenic calorimeters to be used in the AMoRE-II detector modules. The results from prototype setups that incorporate new housing structures and two different crystal masses (316 g and 517 - 521 g), operated at 10 mK temperature, show energy resolutions (FWHM) of 7.55 - 8.82 keV at the 2.615 MeV $^{208}$Tl $\gamma$ line, and effective light detection of 0.79 - 0.96 keV/MeV. The simultaneous heat and light detection enables clear separation of alpha particles with a discrimination power of 12.37 - 19.50 at the energy region around $^6$Li(n, $\alpha$)$^3$H with Q-value = 4.785 MeV. Promising detector performances were demonstrated at temperatures as high as 30 mK, which relaxes the temperature constraints for operating the large AMoRE-II array.</description>

      <title>BIPP: An efficient HPC implementation of the Bluebild algorithm for radio astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bluebild algorithm is a new technique for image synthesis in radio astronomy which forms a least-squares estimate of the sky intensity function using the theory of sampling and interpolation operators. We present an HPC implementation of the Bluebild algorithm for radio-interferometric imaging: Bluebild Imaging++ (BIPP). BIPP is a spherical imager that leverages functional PCA to decompose the sky into distinct energy levels. The library features interfaces to C++, C and Python and is designed with seamless GPU acceleration in mind. We evaluate the accuracy and performance of BIPP on simulated observations of the upcoming Square Kilometer Array Observatory and real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope. We find that BIPP offers accurate wide-field imaging with no need for a w-term approximation and has improved execution time with respect to the interferometric imaging libraries CASA and WSClean. Futhermore, due to the energy level decomposition, images produced with BIPP can reveal information about faint and diffuse structures before any cleaning iterations. The source code of BIPP is publicly released.</description>

      <title>Identifying Black Holes Through Space Telescopes and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03821v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The EHT has captured a series of images of black holes. These images could provide valuable information about the gravitational environment near the event horizon. However, accurate detection and parameter estimation for candidate black holes are necessary. This paper explores the potential for identifying black holes in the ultraviolet band using space telescopes. We establish a data pipeline for generating simulated observations and present an ensemble neural network model for black hole detection and parameter estimation. The model achieves mean average precision [0.5] values of 0.9176 even when reaching the imaging FWHM ($\theta_c$) and maintains the detection ability until $0.54\theta_c$. The parameter estimation is also accurate. These results indicate that our methodology enables super-resolution recognition. Moreover, the model successfully detects the shadow of M87* from background noise and other celestial bodies and estimates its inclination and positional angle. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of detecting black holes in the ultraviolet band and provides a new method for black hole detection and further parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Using A One-Class SVM To Optimize Transit Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As machine learning algorithms become increasingly accessible, a growing number of organizations and researchers are using these technologies to automate the process of exoplanet detection. These mainly utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect periodic dips in lightcurve data. While having approximately 5% lower accuracy than CNNs, the results of this study show that One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be fitted to data up to 84 times faster than simple CNNs and make predictions over 3 times faster on the same datasets using the same hardware. In addition, One-Class SVMs can be run smoothly on unspecialized hardware, removing the need for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) usage. In cases where time and processing power are valuable resources, One-Class SVMs are able to minimize time spent on transit detection tasks while maximizing performance and efficiency.</description>
