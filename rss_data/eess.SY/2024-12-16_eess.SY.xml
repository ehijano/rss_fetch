      <title>V2Sim: An Open-Source Microscopic V2G Simulation Platform in Urban Power and Transportation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes V2Sim, an open source Pythonbased simulation platform designed for advanced vehicle-to-grid (V2G) analysis in coupled urban power and transportation networks. By integrating a microscopic urban transportation network (MUTN) with a power distribution network (PDN), V2Sim enables precise modeling of electric vehicle charging loads (EVCL) and dynamic V2G operations. The platform uniquely combines SUMO for MUTN simulations and an optimized DistFlow model for PDN analysis, with dedicated models for fast charging stations (FCS) and slow charging stations (SCS), capturing detailed charging dynamics often overlooked in existing simulation tools. V2Sim supports a range of customizable V2G strategies, advanced fault-sensing in charging stations, and parallel simulation through multi-processing to accelerate large-scale case studies. Case studies using a real-world MUTN from Nanjing, China, demonstrate V2Sim's capability to analyze the spatial-temporal distribution of EVCL and evaluate V2G impacts, such as fault dissemination and pricing variations, in unprecedented detail. Unlike traditional equilibrium models, V2Sim captures single-vehicle behavior and charging interactions at the microscopic level, offering unparalleled accuracy in assessing the operational and planning needs of V2G-compatible systems. This platform serves as a comprehensive tool for researchers and urban planners aiming to optimize integrated power and transportation networks.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Target Defense under Communication and Sensing Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a variant of the target defense problems where a group of defenders are tasked to simultaneously capture an intruder. The intruder's objective is to reach a target without being simultaneously captured by the defender team. Some of the defenders are sensing-limited and do not have any information regarding the intruder's position or velocity at any time. The defenders may communicate with each other using a connected communication graph. We propose a decentralized feedback strategy for the defenders, which transforms the simultaneous capture problem into a unique nonlinear consensus problem. We derive a sufficient condition for simultaneous capture in terms of the agents' speeds, sensing, and communication capabilities. The proposed decentralized controller is evaluated through extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Exploiting structural observability and graph colorability for optimal sensor placement in water distribution networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water distribution networks (WDNs) are critical systems for our society and detecting leakages is important for minimizing losses and water waste. This makes optimal sensor placement for leakage detection very relevant. Existing sensor placement methods rely on simulation-based scenarios, often lacking structure and generalizability, or depend on the knowledge of specific parameters of the WDN as well as on initial sensor data for linearization and demand estimation. Motivated by this, this paper investigates the observability of an entire WDN, based on structural observability theory. This allows us to establish the conditions for the observability of the WDN model, independently of parameter uncertainties and without the need for initial sensor data. Additionally, a sensor placement algorithm is proposed, that leverages such observability conditions and graph theory and accounts for the industrial and material costs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to a hydraulic-transient WDN model.</description>

      <title>Model Order Reduction of Large-Scale Wind Farms: A Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven algorithm for model order reduction (MOR) of large-scale wind farms and studies the effects that the obtained reduced-order model (ROM) has when this is integrated into the power grid. With respect to standard MOR methods, the proposed algorithm has the advantages of having low computational complexity and not requiring any knowledge of the high order model. Using time-domain measurements, the obtained ROM achieves the moment matching conditions at selected interpolation points (frequencies). With respect to the state of the art, the method achieves the so-called two-sided moment matching, doubling the accuracy by doubling the interpolated points. The proposed algorithm is validated on a combined model of a 200-turbine wind farm (which is reduced) interconnected to the IEEE 14-bus system (which represents the unreduced study area) by comparing the full-order model and the reduced-order model in terms of their Bode plots, eigenvalues and the point of common coupling voltages in extensive fault scenarios of the integrated power system.</description>

      <title>Shape error prediction in 5-axis machining using graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative method for predicting shape errors in 5-axis machining using graph neural networks. The graph structure is defined with nodes representing workpiece surface points and edges denoting the neighboring relationships. The dataset encompasses data from a material removal simulation, process data, and post-machining quality information. Experimental results show that the presented approach can generalize the shape error prediction for the investigated workpiece geometry. Moreover, by modelling spatial and temporal connections within the workpiece, the approach handles a low number of labels compared to non-graphical methods such as Support Vector Machines.</description>

      <title>FDM-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Additive Manufacturing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a widely used additive manufacturing (AM) technique valued for its flexibility and cost-efficiency, with applications in a variety of industries including healthcare and aerospace. Recent developments have made affordable FDM machines accessible and encouraged adoption among diverse users. However, the design, planning, and production process in FDM require specialized interdisciplinary knowledge. Managing the complex parameters and resolving print defects in FDM remain challenging. These technical complexities form the most critical barrier preventing individuals without technical backgrounds and even professional engineers without training in other domains from participating in AM design and manufacturing. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their advanced capabilities in text and code processing, offer the potential for addressing these challenges in FDM. However, existing research on LLM applications in this field is limited, typically focusing on specific use cases without providing comprehensive evaluations across multiple models and tasks. To this end, we introduce FDM-Bench, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLMs on FDM-specific tasks. FDM-Bench enables a thorough assessment by including user queries across various experience levels and G-code samples that represent a range of anomalies. We evaluate two closed-source models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and two open-source models (Llama-3.1-70B and Llama-3.1-405B) on FDM-Bench. A panel of FDM experts assess the models' responses to user queries in detail. Results indicate that closed-source models generally outperform open-source models in G-code anomaly detection, whereas Llama-3.1-405B demonstrates a slight advantage over other models in responding to user queries. These findings underscore FDM-Bench's potential as a foundational tool for advancing research on LLM capabilities in FDM.</description>

      <title>Coordinated vehicle dispatching and charging scheduling for an electric ride-hailing fleet under charging congestion and dynamic prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective utilization of charging station capacity plays an important role in enhancing the profitability of ride-hailing systems using electric vehicles. Existing studies assume constant energy prices and uncapacitated charging stations or do not explicitly consider vehicle queueing at charging stations, resulting in over-optimistic charging infrastructure utilization. In this study, we develop a dynamic charging scheduling method (named CongestionAware) that anticipates vehicles' energy needs and coordinates their charging operations with real-time energy prices to avoid long waiting time at charging stations and increase the total profit of the system. A sequential mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to devise vehicles' day-ahead charging plans based on their experienced charging waiting times and energy consumption. The obtained charging plans are adapted within the day in response to vehicles' energy needs and charging station congestion. The developed charging policy is tested using NYC yellow taxi data in a Manhattan-like study area with a fleet size of 100 vehicles given the scenarios of 3000 and 4000 customers per day. The computational results show that our CongestionAware policy outperforms different benchmark policies with up to +15.06% profit and +19.16% service rate for 4000 customers per day. Sensitivity analysis is conducted with different system parameters and managerial insights are discussed.</description>

      <title>One Filter to Deploy Them All: Robust Safety for Quadrupedal Navigation in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As learning-based methods for legged robots rapidly grow in popularity, it is important that we can provide safety assurances efficiently across different controllers and environments. Existing works either rely on a priori knowledge of the environment and safety constraints to ensure system safety or provide assurances for a specific locomotion policy. To address these limitations, we propose an observation-conditioned reachability-based (OCR) safety-filter framework. Our key idea is to use an OCR value network (OCR-VN) that predicts the optimal control-theoretic safety value function for new failure regions and dynamic uncertainty during deployment time. Specifically, the OCR-VN facilitates rapid safety adaptation through two key components: a LiDAR-based input that allows the dynamic construction of safe regions in light of new obstacles and a disturbance estimation module that accounts for dynamics uncertainty in the wild. The predicted safety value function is used to construct an adaptive safety filter that overrides the nominal quadruped controller when necessary to maintain safety. Through simulation studies and hardware experiments on a Unitree Go1 quadruped, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can automatically safeguard a wide range of hierarchical quadruped controllers, adapts to novel environments, and is robust to unmodeled dynamics without a priori access to the controllers or environments - hence, "One Filter to Deploy Them All". The experiment videos can be found on the project website.</description>

      <title>Indirect Adaptive Control Using a Static Update Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The update law in the indirect adaptive control scheme can be extended to include feedthrough of an error term. This reduces undesired oscillations of the calculated weights. When the {\sigma}-modification is used for achieving robustness against unstructured uncertainties, the gain of the feedthrough in the update law cannot be chosen arbitrarily. Compared to our previous result, we show stability of the closed loop for a larger parameter-range for the gain of the feedthrough in the update law. This parameter-range includes a configuration for which the influence of the integration in the update law diminishes over time, i.e. for which the adaptation for large times is governed solely by the feedthrough in the update law. By initializing at zero, this allows for removing the integration from the update law, resulting in a static update law. For the purely linear case, the adaptation acts like a disturbance observer. Frequency-domain analysis of the closed loop with a second order plant shows that removing the integration from the update law with {\sigma}-modification and feedthrough affects how precisely disturbances in the low-frequency band are observed. If the damping injected into the adaptation process by the {\sigma}-modification exceeds certain bounds, then the precision is increased by using the static update law.</description>

      <title>A General Safety Framework for Autonomous Manipulation in Human Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots are projected to augment the manual workforce, especially in repetitive and hazardous tasks. For a successful deployment of such robots in human environments, it is crucial to guarantee human safety. State-of-the-art approaches to ensure human safety are either too restrictive to permit a natural human-robot collaboration or make strong assumptions that do not hold when for autonomous robots, e.g., knowledge of a pre-defined trajectory. Therefore, we propose SaRA-shield, a power and force limiting framework for AI-based manipulation in human environments that gives formal safety guarantees while allowing for fast robot speeds. As recent studies have shown that unconstrained collisions allow for significantly higher contact forces than constrained collisions (clamping), we propose to classify contacts by their collision type using reachability analysis. We then verify that the kinetic energy of the robot is below pain and injury thresholds for the detected collision type of the respective human body part in contact. Our real-world experiments show that SaRA-shield can effectively reduce the speed of the robot to adhere to injury-preventing energy limits.</description>

      <title>Controlling dynamical systems into unseen target states using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, model-free, and data-driven methodology for controlling complex dynamical systems into previously unseen target states, including those with significantly different and complex dynamics. Leveraging a parameter-aware realization of next-generation reservoir computing, our approach accurately predicts system behavior in unobserved parameter regimes, enabling control over transitions to arbitrary target states. Crucially, this includes states with dynamics that differ fundamentally from known regimes, such as shifts from periodic to intermittent or chaotic behavior. The method's parameter-awareness facilitates non-stationary control, ensuring smooth transitions between states. By extending the applicability of machine learning-based control mechanisms to previously inaccessible target dynamics, this methodology opens the door to transformative new applications while maintaining exceptional efficiency. Our results highlight reservoir computing as a powerful alternative to traditional methods for dynamic system control.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dual-Headway Unicycle Pose Control and Motion Prediction for Optimal Sampling-Based Feedback Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe, smooth, and optimal motion planning for nonholonomically constrained mobile robots and autonomous vehicles is essential for achieving reliable, seamless, and efficient autonomy in logistics, mobility, and service industries. In many such application settings, nonholonomic robots, like unicycles with restricted motion, require precise planning and control of both translational and orientational motion to approach specific locations in a designated orientation, such as for approaching changing, parking, and loading areas. In this paper, we introduce a new dual-headway unicycle pose control method by leveraging an adaptively placed headway point in front of the unicycle pose and a tailway point behind the goal pose. In summary, the unicycle robot continuously follows its headway point, which chases the tailway point of the goal pose and the asymptotic motion of the tailway point towards the goal position guides the unicycle robot to approach the goal location with the correct orientation. The simple and intuitive geometric construction of dual-headway unicycle pose control enables an explicit convex feedback motion prediction bound on the closed-loop unicycle motion trajectory for fast and accurate safety verification. We present an application of dual-headway unicycle control for optimal sampling-based motion planning around obstacles. In numerical simulations, we show that optimal unicycle motion planning using dual-headway translation and orientation distances significantly outperforms Euclidean translation and cosine orientation distances in generating smooth motion with minimal travel and turning effort.</description>

      <title>Approximate Dynamic Programming for Constrained Piecewise Affine Systems with Stability and Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite-horizon optimal control of constrained piecewise affine (PWA) systems has been approximately addressed by hybrid model predictive control (MPC), which, however, has computational limitations, both in offline design and online implementation. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach based on approximate dynamic programming (ADP), an important class of methods in reinforcement learning. We accommodate non-convex union-of-polyhedra state constraints and linear input constraints into ADP by designing PWA penalty functions. PWA function approximation is used, which allows for a mixed-integer encoding to implement ADP. The main advantage of the proposed ADP method is its online computational efficiency. Particularly, we propose two control policies, which lead to solving a smaller-scale mixed-integer linear program than conventional hybrid MPC, or a single convex quadratic program, depending on whether the policy is implicitly determined online or explicitly computed offline. We characterize the stability and safety properties of the closed-loop systems, as well as the sub-optimality of the proposed policies, by quantifying the approximation errors of value functions and policies. We also develop an offline mixed-integer linear programming-based method to certify the reliability of the proposed method. Simulation results on an inverted pendulum with elastic walls and on an adaptive cruise control problem validate the control performance in terms of constraint satisfaction and CPU time.</description>

      <title>Incremental Volt/Var Control for Distribution Networks via Chance-Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers an incremental Volt/Var control scheme for distribution systems with high integration of inverter-interfaced distributed generation (such as photovoltaic systems). The incremental Volt/Var controller is implemented with the objective of minimizing reactive power usage while maintaining voltages within safe limits sufficiently often. To this end, the parameters of the incremental Volt/Var controller are obtained by solving a chance-constrained optimization problem, where constraints are designed to ensure that voltage violations do not occur more often than a pre-specified probability. This approach leads to cost savings in a controlled, predictable way, while still avoiding significant over- or under-voltage issues. The proposed chance-constrained problem is solved using a successive convex approximation method. Once the gains are broadcast to the inverters, no additional communication is required since the controller is implemented locally at the inverters. The proposed method is successfully tested on a low-voltage single-phase 42-nodes network and on the three-phase unbalanced IEEE 123-node test system.</description>

      <title>Proper Implicit Discretization of the Super-Twisting Controller -- without and with Actuator Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrete-time implementation of the super-twisting sliding mode controller for a plant with disturbances with bounded slope, zero-order hold actuation, and actuator constraints is considered. Motivated by restrictions of existing implicit or semi-implicit discretization variants, a new proper implicit discretization for the super-twisting controller is proposed. This discretization is then extended to the conditioned super-twisting controller, which mitigates windup in presence of actuator constraints by means of the conditioning technique. It is proven that the proposed controllers achieve best possible worst-case performance subject to similarly simple stability conditions as their continuous-time counterparts. Numerical simulations and comparisons demonstrate and illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Disturbance-Robust Backup Control Barrier Functions: Safety Under Uncertain Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining a controlled invariant set is crucial for safety-critical control with control barrier functions (CBFs) but is non-trivial for complex nonlinear systems and constraints. Backup control barrier functions allow such sets to be constructed online in a computationally tractable manner by examining the evolution (or flow) of the system under a known backup control law. However, for systems with unmodeled disturbances, this flow cannot be directly computed, making the current methods inadequate for assuring safety in these scenarios. To address this gap, we leverage bounds on the nominal and disturbed flow to compute a forward invariant set online by ensuring safety of an expanding norm ball tube centered around the nominal system evolution. We prove that this set results in robust control constraints which guarantee safety of the disturbed system via our Disturbance-Robust Backup Control Barrier Function (DR-bCBF) solution. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated in simulation, applied to a double integrator problem and a rigid body spacecraft rotation problem with rate constraints.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Gear Fault Diagnosis in Motor Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to quantify the uncertainties in fault diagnosis of motor drives using Bayesian neural networks (BNN). Conventional data-driven approaches used for fault diagnosis often rely on point-estimate neural networks, which merely provide deterministic outputs and fail to capture the uncertainty associated with the inference process. In contrast, BNNs offer a principled framework to model uncertainty by treating network weights as probability distributions rather than fixed values. It offers several advantages: (a) improved robustness to noisy data, (b) enhanced interpretability of model predictions, and (c) the ability to quantify uncertainty in the decision-making processes. To test the robustness of the proposed BNN, it has been tested under a conservative dataset of gear fault data from an experimental prototype of three fault types at first, and is then incrementally trained on new fault classes and datasets to explore its uncertainty quantification features and model interpretability under noisy data and unseen fault scenarios.</description>

      <title>Passivity Tools for Hybrid Learning Rules in Large Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has pioneered the use of system-theoretic passivity to study equilibrium stability for the dynamics of noncooperative strategic interactions in large populations of learning agents. In this and related works, the stability analysis leverages knowledge that certain ``canonical'' classes of learning rules used to model the agents' strategic behaviors satisfy a passivity condition known as $\delta$-passivity. In this paper, we consider that agents exhibit learning behaviors that do not align with a canonical class. Specifically, we focus on characterizing $\delta$-passivity for hybrid learning rules that combine elements from canonical classes. Our analysis also introduces and uses a more general version of $\delta$-passivity, which, for the first time, can handle discontinuous learning rules, including those showing best-response behaviors. We state and prove theorems establishing $\delta$-passivity for two broad convex cones of hybrid learning rules. These cones can merge into a larger one preserving $\delta$-passivity in scenarios limited to two strategies. In our proofs, we establish intermediate facts that are significant on their own and could potentially be used to further generalize our work. We illustrate the applicability of our results through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop Analysis of ADMM-based Suboptimal Linear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many practical applications of optimal control are subject to real-time computational constraints. When applying model predictive control (MPC) in these settings, respecting timing constraints is achieved by limiting the number of iterations of the optimization algorithm used to compute control actions at each time step, resulting in so-called suboptimal MPC. This paper proposes a suboptimal MPC scheme based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). With a focus on the linear quadratic regulator problem with state and input constraints, we show how ADMM can be used to split the MPC problem into iterative updates of an unconstrained optimal control problem (with an analytical solution), and a dynamics-free feasibility step. We show that using a warm-start approach combined with enough iterations per time-step, yields an ADMM-based suboptimal MPC scheme which asymptotically stabilizes the system and maintains recursive feasibility.</description>
