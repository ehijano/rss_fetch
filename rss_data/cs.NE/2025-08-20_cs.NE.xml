      <title>Multi-Plasticity Synergy with Adaptive Mechanism Assignment for Training Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising brain-inspired models known for low power consumption and superior potential for temporal processing, but identifying suitable learning mechanisms remains a challenge. Despite the presence of multiple coexisting learning strategies in the brain, current SNN training methods typically rely on a single form of synaptic plasticity, which limits their adaptability and representational capability. In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired training framework that incorporates multiple synergistic plasticity mechanisms for more effective SNN training. Our method enables diverse learning algorithms to cooperatively modulate the accumulation of information, while allowing each mechanism to preserve its own relatively independent update dynamics. We evaluated our approach on both static image and dynamic neuromorphic datasets to demonstrate that our framework significantly improves performance and robustness compared to conventional learning mechanism models. This work provides a general and extensible foundation for developing more powerful SNNs guided by multi-strategy brain-inspired learning.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural encoding parameters for spiking neural networks (SNNs) are typically set heuristically. We propose a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to optimize them. Applied to an SNN-based equalizer and demapper in an IM/DD system, the method improves performance while reducing computational load and network size.</description>

      <title>Zobrist Hash-based Duplicate Detection in Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression encompasses a family of search algorithms that aim to discover the best fitting function for a set of data without requiring an a priori specification of the model structure. The most successful and commonly used technique for symbolic regression is Genetic Programming (GP), an evolutionary search method that evolves a population of mathematical expressions through the mechanism of natural selection. In this work we analyze the efficiency of the evolutionary search in GP and show that many points in the search space are re-visited and re-evaluated multiple times by the algorithm, leading to wasted computational effort. We address this issue by introducing a caching mechanism based on the Zobrist hash, a type of hashing frequently used in abstract board games for the efficient construction and subsequent update of transposition tables. We implement our caching approach using the open-source framework Operon and demonstrate its performance on a selection of real-world regression problems, where we observe up to 34\% speedups without any detrimental effects on search quality. The hashing approach represents a straightforward way to improve runtime performance while also offering some interesting possibilities for adjusting search strategy based on cached information.</description>

      <title>HiFo-Prompt: Prompting with Hindsight and Foresight for LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation (EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and superior query efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Design of Machine Learning Pipelines via Metalearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge. Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by (1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space. Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection, meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space reduction strategies.</description>

      <title>Timestep-Compressed Attack on Spiking Neural Networks through Timestep-Level Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications. This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse (A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable attack success rate.</description>

      <title>Neural Cellular Automata for ARC-AGI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular automata and their differentiable counterparts, Neural Cellular Automata (NCA), are highly expressive and capable of surprisingly complex behaviors. This paper explores how NCAs perform when applied to tasks requiring precise transformations and few-shot generalization, using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) as a domain that challenges their capabilities in ways not previously explored. Specifically, this paper uses gradient-based training to learn iterative update rules that transform input grids into their outputs from the training examples and apply them to the test inputs. Results suggest that gradient-trained NCA models are a promising and efficient approach to a range of abstract grid-based tasks from ARC. Along with discussing the impacts of various design modifications and training constraints, this work examines the behavior and properties of NCAs applied to ARC to give insights for broader applications of self-organizing systems.</description>

      <title>Correlations Are Ruining Your Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Herein the topics of (natural) gradient descent, data decorrelation, and approximate methods for backpropagation are brought into a common discussion. Natural gradient descent illuminates how gradient vectors, pointing at directions of steepest descent, can be improved by considering the local curvature of loss landscapes. We extend this perspective and show that to fully solve the problem illuminated by natural gradients in neural networks, one must recognise that correlations in the data at any linear transformation, including node responses at every layer of a neural network, cause a non-orthonormal relationship between the model's parameters. To solve this requires a method for decorrelating inputs at each individual layer of a neural network. We describe a range of methods which have been proposed for decorrelation and whitening of node output, and expand on these to provide a novel method specifically useful for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation within multi-layer neural networks, we can show that not only is training via backpropagation sped up significantly but also existing approximations of backpropagation, which have failed catastrophically in the past, benefit significantly in their accuracy and convergence speed. This has the potential to provide a route forward for approximate gradient descent methods which have previously been discarded, training approaches for analogue and neuromorphic hardware, and potentially insights as to the efficacy and utility of decorrelation processes in the brain.</description>
