      <title>Subdivisions of Oriented Cycles in Digraphs with Hamiltonian directed path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cohen et al. conjectured that for every oriented cycle $C$ there exist an integer $f(C)$ such that every strong $f(C)$-chromatic digraph contains a subdivision of $C$. El Joubbeh confirmed this conjecture for Hamiltonian digraphs. Indeed, he showed that every $3n$-chromatic Hamiltonian digraph contains a subdivision of every oriented cycle of order $n$. In this article, we improve this bound to $2n$. Furthermore, we show that, if $D$ is a digraph containing a Hamiltonian directed path with chromatic number at least $12n-5$, then $D$ contains a subdivision of every oriented cycle of order $n$. Note that a digraph containing a Hamiltonian directed path need not be strongly connected. Thus, our current result provides a deeper understanding of the condition that may be needed to fully solve the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Hamiltonian cycle of a complete graph and the Traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monography considers the problem of constructing a Hamiltonian cycle in a complete graph. A rule for constructing a Hamiltonian cycle based on isometric cycles of a graph is established. An algorithm for constructing a Hamiltonian cycle based on ring summation of isometric cycles of a graph is presented. Based on the matrix of distances between vertices, the weight of each cycle is determined as an additive sum of the weights of its edges. To construct an optimal route of a graph, the basic idea of finding an optimal route between four vertices is used. Further successive constructions are aimed at joining an adjacent isometric cycle with an increase in the number of vertices by one unit. The recursive process continues until all vertices of the graph are connected. Based on the introduced mathematical apparatus, the monography presents a new algorithm for solving the symmetric Traveling salesman problem. Some examples of solving the problem are provided.</description>

      <title>On the off-diagonal unordered Erd\H{o}s-Rado numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Rado [P. Erd\H{o}s, R. Rado, A combinatorial theorem, Journal of the London Mathematical Society 25 (4) (1950) 249-255] introduced the Canonical Ramsey numbers $\text{er}(t)$ as the minimum number $n$ such that every edge-coloring of the ordered complete graph $K_n$ contains either a monochromatic, rainbow, upper lexical, or lower lexical clique of order $t$. Richer [D. Richer, Unordered canonical Ramsey numbers, Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 80 (2000) 172-177] introduced the unordered asymmetric version of the Canonical Ramsey numbers $\text{CR}(s,r)$ as the minimum $n$ such that every edge-coloring of the (unorderd) complete graph $K_n$ contains either a rainbow clique of order $r$, or an orderable clique of order $s$.
  We show that $\text{CR}(s,r) = O(r^3/\log r)^{s-2}$, which, up to the multiplicative constant, matches the known lower bound and improves the previously best known bound $\text{CR}(s,r) = O(r^3/\log r)^{s-1}$ by Jiang [T. Jiang, Canonical Ramsey numbers and proporly colored cycles, Discrete Mathematics 309 (2009) 4247-4252]. We also obtain bounds on the further variant $\text{ER}(m,\ell,r)$, defined as the minimum $n$ such that every edge-coloring of the (unorderd) complete graph $K_n$ contains either a monochromatic $K_m$, lexical $K_\ell$, or rainbow $K_r$.</description>

      <title>Cops against a cheating robber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a cheating robot version of Cops and Robber, first introduced by Huggan and Nowakowski, where both the cops and the robber move simultaneously, but the robber is allowed to react to the cops' moves. For conciseness, we refer to this game as Cops and Cheating Robot. The cheating robot number for a graph is the fewest number of cops needed to win on the graph. We introduce a new parameter for this variation, called the push number, which gives the value for the minimum number of cops that move onto the robber's vertex given that there are a cheating robot number of cops on the graph. After producing some elementary results on the push number, we use it to give a relationship between Cops and Cheating Robot and Surrounding Cops and Robbers. We investigate the cheating robot number for planar graphs and give a tight bound for bipartite planar graphs. We show that determining whether a graph has a cheating robot number at most fixed $k$ can be done in polynomial time. We also obtain bounds on the cheating robot number for strong and lexicographic products of graphs.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for pancyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is called an $[s,t]$-graph if any induced subgraph of $G$ of order $s$ has size at least $t.$ We prove that every $2$-connected $[4,2]$-graph of order at least $7$ is pancyclic. This strengthens existing results. There are $2$-connected $[4,2]$-graphs which do not satisfy the Chv\'{a}tal-Erd\H{o}s condition. We also determine the triangle-free graphs among $[p+2,p]$-graphs for a general $p.$</description>

      <title>Colouring the 1-skeleton of $d$-dimensional triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While every plane triangulation is colourable with three or four colours, Heawood showed that a plane triangulation is 3-colourable if and only if every vertex has even degree. In $d \geq 3$ dimensions, however, every $k \geq d+1$ may occur as the chromatic number of some triangulation of ${\mathbb S}^d$. As a first step, Joswig structurally characterised which triangulations of ${\mathbb S}^d$ have a $(d+1)$-colourable 1-skeleton. In the 20 years since Joswig's result, no characterisations have been found for any $k&gt;d+1$.
  In this paper, we structurally characterise which triangulations of ${\mathbb S}^d$ have a $(d+2)$-colourable 1-skeleton: they are precisely the triangulations that have a subdivision such that for every $(d-2)$-cell, the number of incident $(d-1)$-cells is divisible by three.</description>

      <title>Abelian and stochastic sandpile models on complete bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the sandpile model, vertices of a graph are allocated grains of sand. At each unit of time, a grain is added to a randomly chosen vertex. If that causes its number of grains to exceed its degree, that vertex is called unstable, and topples. In the Abelian sandpile model (ASM), topplings are deterministic, whereas in the stochastic sandpile model (SSM) they are random. We study the ASM and SSM on complete bipartite graphs. For the SSM, we provide a stochastic version of Dhar's burning algorithm to check if a given (stable) configuration is recurrent or not, with linear complexity. We also exhibit a bijection between sorted recurrent configurations and pairs of compatible Ferrers diagrams. We then provide a similar bijection for the ASM, and also interpret its recurrent configurations in terms of labelled Motzkin paths.</description>

      <title>Variations on Bollob\'{a}s systems of $d$-partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates five kinds of systems of $d$-partitions of $[n]$, including symmetric Bollob\'{a}s systems, strong Bollob\'{a}s systems, Bollob\'{a}s systems, skew Bollob\'{a}s systems, and weak Bollob\'{a}s systems. Many known results on variations of Bollob\'{a}s systems are unified. Especially we give a negative answer to a conjecture on Bollob\'{a}s systems of $d$-partitions of $[n]$ that was presented by Heged\"{u}s and Frankl [European J. Comb., 120 (2024), 103983]. Even though this conjecture does not hold for general Bollob\'{a}s systems, we show that it holds for strong Bollob\'{a}s systems of $d$-partitions of $[n]$.</description>

Abstract: Let $m$ be a positive integer. A group $G$ is said to be an $m$-BCI-group if $G$ has the $k$-BCI property for all positive integers $k$ at most $m$. Let $G$ be a generalized quaternion group of order $4n$ with $n\geq 2$. It is shown that $G$ is a 3-BCI-group if and only if $G$ is a $2$-BCI-group if and only if $n=2$ or $n$ is odd.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph polytopes arising from the vertex weighted graph, which was first introduced and studied by B\'ona, Ju, and Yoshida. A conjecture states that for a simple connected graph, the polynomial in the numerator of the Ehrhart series is palindromic. We confirm the conjecture. Furthermore, we introduce the hypergraph polytope. We prove that the simple connected unimodular hypergraph polytopes are integer polytopes. We also prove the polynomial in the numerator of the Ehrhart series of simple connected uniform hypergraph polytopes is palindromic.</description>

      <title>The repetition threshold for ternary rich words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie, Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + \sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper, we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich words is $1 + 1/(3 - \mu) \approx 2.25876324$, where $\mu$ is the unique real root of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say a directed graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is irredundant if the removal of any edge reduces the number of ordered pairs of distinct vertices $(u,v)$ such that there exists a directed path from $u$ to $v$. We determine the maximum possible number of edges such a graph can have, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We also characterize the cases of equality. This resolves, in a strong form, a question of Crane and Russell.</description>

Abstract: Using the language of Seshadri stratifications we develop a geometrical interpretation of Lakshmibai-Seshadri-tableaux and their associated standard monomial bases. These tableaux are a generalization of Young-tableaux and De-Concini-tableaux to all Dynkin types. More precisely, we construct filtrations of multihomogeneous coordinate rings of Schubert varieties, such that the subquotients are one-dimensional and indexed by standard tableaux.</description>

      <title>The Moran process on a random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fixation probability for two versions of the Moran process on the random graph $G_{n,p}$ at the threshold for connectivity. The Moran process models the spread of a mutant population in a network. Throughtout the process there are vertices of two types, mutants and non-mutants. Mutants have fitness $s$ and non-mutants have fitness 1. The process starts with a unique individual mutant located at the vertex $v_0$. In the Birth-Death version of the process a random vertex is chosen proportional to its fitness and then changes the type of a random neighbor to its own. The process continues until the set of mutants $X$ is empty or $[n]$. In the Death-Birth version a uniform random vertex is chosen and then takes the type of a random neighbor, chosen according to fitness. The process again continues until the set of mutants $X$ is empty or $[n]$. The {\em fixation probability} is the probability that the process ends with $X=\emptyset$.
  We give asymptotically correct estimates of the fixation probability that depend on degree of $v_0$ and its neighbors.,</description>

Abstract: The following problem has been known since the 80s. Let $\Gamma$ be an Abelian group of order $m$ (denoted $|\Gamma|=m$), and let $t$ and $\{m_i\}_{i=1}^{t}$, be positive integers such that $\sum_{i=1}^t m_i=m-1$. Determine when $\Gamma^*=\Gamma\setminus\{0\}$, the set of non-zero elements of $\Gamma$, can be partitioned into disjoint subsets $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^{t}$ such that $|S_i|=m_i$ and $\sum_{s\in S_i}s=0$ for every $1 \leq i \leq t$. Such a subset partition is called a \textit{zero-sum partition}. $|I(\Gamma)|\neq 1$, where $I(\Gamma)$ is the set of involutions in $\Gamma$, is a necessary condition for the existence of zero-sum partitions. In this paper, we show that the additional condition of $m_i\geq 4$ for every $1 \leq i \leq t$, is sufficient. Moreover, we present some applications of zero-sum partitions to magic- and antimagic-type labelings of graphs.</description>

      <title>On polynomials associated to Voronoi diagrams of point sets and crossing numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three polynomials are defined for given sets $S$ of $n$ points in general position in the plane: The Voronoi polynomial with coefficients the numbers of vertices of the order-$k$ Voronoi diagrams of $S$, the circle polynomial with coefficients the numbers of circles through three points of $S$ enclosing $k$ points of $S$, and the $E_{\leq k}$ polynomial with coefficients the numbers of (at most $k$)-edges of $S$. We present several formulas for the rectilinear crossing number of $S$ in terms of these polynomials and their roots. We also prove that the roots of the Voronoi polynomial lie on the unit circle if, and only if, $S$ is in convex position. Further, we present bounds on the location of the roots of these polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Delta-matroids are "type B" generalizations of matroids in the same way that maximal orthogonal Grassmannians are generalizations of Grassmannians. A delta-matroid analogue of the Tutte polynomial of a matroid is the interlace polynomial. We give a geometric interpretation for the interlace polynomial via the K-theory of maximal orthogonal Grassmannians. To do so, we develop a new Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch-type formula for the type B permutohedral variety.</description>

Abstract: We prove that in every metric space where no line contains all the points, there are at least $\Omega(n^{2/3})$ lines. This improves the previous $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lower bound on the number of lines in general metric space, and also improves the previous $\Omega(n^{4/7})$ lower bound on the number of lines in metric spaces generated by connected graphs.</description>

      <title>The Density Formula: One Lemma to Bound Them All</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Density Formula for (topological) drawings of graphs in the plane or on the sphere, which relates the number of edges, vertices, crossings, and sizes of cells in the drawing. We demonstrate its capability by providing several applications: we prove tight upper bounds on the edge density of various beyond-planar graph classes, including so-called $k$-planar graphs with $k=1,2$, fan-crossing / fan-planar graphs, $k$-bend RAC-graphs with $k=0,1,2$, quasiplanar graphs, and $k^+$-real face graphs. In some cases ($1$-bend and $2$-bend RAC-graphs and fan-crossing / fan-planar graphs), we thereby obtain the first tight upper bounds on the edge density of the respective graph classes. In other cases, we give new streamlined and significantly shorter proofs for bounds that were already known in the literature. Thanks to the Density Formula, all of our proofs are mostly elementary counting and mostly circumvent the typical intricate case analysis found in earlier proofs. Further, in some cases (simple and non-homotopic quasiplanar graphs), our alternative proofs using the Density Formula lead to the first tight lower bound examples.</description>

      <title>A study of H. Martens' Theorem on chains of cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a chain of cycles of genus $g$. Let $d$,$r$ be integers with $1 \leq r \leq g-2$ and $2r\leq d \leq g-3+r$. Then $w^r_d(\Gamma)=d-2r$ implies $\Gamma$ is hyperelliptic. For each $g \geq 2r+3$ there exist non-hyperelliptic chains of cycles satisfying $w^r_{g-2+r}(\Gamma)=g-2-r$. In the case of algebraic curves such equality implies the curve is hyperelliptic. In particular we obtain the existence of chains of cycles $\Gamma$ such that $w^r_{g-2+r}(\Gamma) \neq w^1_{g-r}(\Gamma)$ in case $r \geq 2$. In the case of algebraic curves such numbers are equal because of the Riemann-Roch Theorem.</description>

      <title>NP-completeness of Tiling Finite Simply Connected Regions with a Fixed Set of Wang Tiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational complexity of tiling finite simply connected regions with a fixed set of tiles is studied in this paper. We show that the problem of tiling simply connected regions with a fixed set of $23$ Wang tiles is NP-complete. As a consequence, the problem of tiling simply connected regions with a fixed set of $111$ rectangles is NP-complete. Our results improve that of Igor Pak and Jed Yang by using fewer numbers of tiles. Notably in the case of Wang tiles, the number has decreased by more than one third from $35$ to $23$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bigraph $G$ is weakly norming if the $e(G)$th root of the density of $G$ in $\lvert W\rvert$ is a norm in the space of bounded measurable functions $W\colon\Omega\times\Lambda\to\mathbb{R}$. The only known technique, due to Conlon--Lee, to show that a bigraph $G$ is weakly norming is to present a cut-percolation sequence of $G$.
  In this paper, we identify a key obstacle for cut-percolation, which we call fold-stability and we show that existence of a cut-percolating of a bigraph $G$ is equivalent to non-existence of non-monochromatic fold-stable colorings of the edges of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We confirm a conjecture of Bonini et. al. on the precise Lin-Lu-Yau curvature values of conference graphs, i.e., strongly regular graphs with parameters $(4\gamma+1,2\gamma,\gamma-1,\gamma)$, with $\gamma\geq 2$. Our method only depends on the parameter relations and applies to more general classes of amply regular graphs. In particular, we develop a new combinatorial method for showing the existence of local perfect matchings. A key observation is that counting common neighbors leads to useful quadratic polynomials. Our result also leads to an interesting number theoretic consequence on quadratic residues.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a PL manifold admits a handle decomposition into handles of index $\le k$ if and only if $M$ is $k$-stacked, i.e., it admits a PL triangulation in which all $(d-k-1)$-faces are on $\partial M$.
  We use this to solve a problem posed in 2008 by Kalai: In any dimension higher than four, there are infinitely many homology-spheres with $g_3 =0$.</description>

      <title>Beyond trees: the metric geometry of subsets of weighted Hamming cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Associated to any finite metric space are a large number of objects and quantities which provide some degree of structural or geometric information about the space. In this paper we show that in the setting of subsets of weighted Hamming cubes there are unexpected relationships between many of these quantities. We obtain in particular formulas for the determinant of the distance matrix, the $M$-constant and the cofactor sum for such spaces. In general, these types of results offer valuable insights into the combinatorial optimization of certain constrained quadratic forms on finite metric spaces. A key focus in this context are embedding properties of negative type metrics, which play a prominent role in addressing important questions like the sparsest cut problem in graph theory. The current work extends previous results for unweighted metric trees, and more generally, for subsets of standard Hamming cubes, as well as results for weighted metric trees. Finally we consider polygonal equalities in these spaces, giving a complete description of the nontrivial $1$-polygonal equalities that can arise in weighted Hamming cubes.</description>

      <title>Approximation and FPT Algorithms for Finding DM-Irreducible Spanning Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding a minimum-weight strongly connected spanning subgraph of an edge-weighted directed graph is equivalent to the weighted version of the well-known strong connectivity augmentation problem. This problem is NP-hard, and a simple $2$-approximation algorithm was proposed by Frederickson and J\'aj\'a (1981); surprisingly, it still achieves the best known approximation ratio in general. Also, Bang-Jensen and Yeo (2008) showed that the unweighted problem is FPT (fixed-parameter tractable) parameterized by the difference from a trivial upper bound of the optimal value. In this paper, we consider a generalization related to the Dulmage--Mendelsohn decompositions of bipartite graphs instead of the strong connectivity of directed graphs, and extend these approximation and FPT results to the generalized setting.</description>

      <title>From Maximum Cut to Maximum Independent Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Maximum Cut (Max-Cut) problem could be naturally expressed either in a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation, or as an Ising model. It has long been known that the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem could also be related to a specific Ising model. Therefore, it would be natural to attack MIS with various Max-Cut/Ising solvers. It turns out that this strategy greatly improves the approximation for the independence number of random Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs. It also exhibits perfect performance on a benchmark arising from coding theory. These results pave the way for further development of approximate quantum algorithms on MIS, and specifically on the corresponding coding problems.</description>
