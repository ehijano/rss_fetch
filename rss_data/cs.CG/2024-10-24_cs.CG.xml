      <title>Pillow Box Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on packaging design using origami techniques, specifically designs incorporating curves, known as pillow boxes. While conventional paper packaging boxes are typically cuboid, pillow box designs include curved surfaces, offering both aesthetic and practical advantages. This study analyzes the specific curved folds of pillow boxes, clarifying the fundamental geometric condition these curves must meet. Additionally, it proposes new design variations for pillow boxes based on the condition. The relationship between the shape of the folds and the volume of the final three-dimensional shape is also explored. This research extends the boundaries of functionality and aesthetics in origami design and explores new possibilities in packaging solutions.</description>

      <title>Timetable Nodes for Public Transport Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Faster pathfinding in time-dependent transport networks is an important and challenging problem in navigation systems. There are two main types of transport networks: road networks for car driving and public transport route network. The solutions that work well in road networks, such as Time-dependent Contraction Hierarchies and other graph-based approaches, do not usually apply in transport networks. In transport networks, non-graph solutions such as CSA and RAPTOR show the best results compared to graph-based techniques. In our work, we propose a method that advances graph-based approaches by using different optimization techniques from computational geometry to speed up the search process in transport networks. We apply a new pre-computation step, which we call timetable nodes (TTN). Our inspiration comes from an iterative search problem in computational geometry. We implement two versions of the TTN: one uses a Combined Search Tree (TTN-CST), and the second uses Fractional Cascading (TTN-FC). Both of these approaches decrease the asymptotic complexity of reaching new nodes from $O(k\times \log|C|)$ to $O(k + \log(k) + \log(|C|))$, where $k$ is the number of outgoing edges from a node and $|C|$ is the size of the timetable information (total outgoing edges). Our solution suits any other time-dependent networks and can be integrated into other pathfinding algorithms. Our experiments indicate that this pre-computation significantly enhances the performance on high-density graphs. This study showcases how leveraging computational geometry can enhance pathfinding in transport networks, enabling faster pathfinding in scenarios involving large numbers of outgoing edges.</description>
