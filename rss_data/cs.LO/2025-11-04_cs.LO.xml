      <title>Runtime Verification of Interactions Using Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runtime verification consists in observing and collecting the execution traces of a system and checking them against a specification, with the objective of raising an error when a trace does not satisfy the specification. We consider distributed systems consisting of subsystems which communicate by message-passing. Local execution traces consisting of send and receive events are collected on each subsystem. We do not assume that the subsystems have a shared global clock, which would allow a reordering of the local traces. Instead, we manipulate multitraces, which are collections of local traces. We use interaction models as specifications: they describe communication scenarios between multiple components, and thus specify a desired global behaviour. We propose two procedures to decide whether a multitrace satisfies an interaction, based on automata-theoretic techniques. The first procedure is straightforward, while the second provides more information on the type of error and integrates the idea of reusability: because many multitraces are compared against one interaction, some preprocessing can be done once at the beginning. We implement both procedures and compare them.</description>

      <title>A Simple Logic of Cohesive Group Agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a structure to represent the social fabric of a group. We call it the `cohesion network' of the group. It can be seen as a graph whose vertices are strict subgroups and whose edges indicate a prescribed `pro-social behaviour' from one subgroup towards another. In social psychology, pro-social behaviours are building blocks of full-blown cooperation, which we assimilate here with `group cohesiveness'. We then define a formal framework to study cohesive group agency. To do so, we simply instantiate pro-social behaviour with the more specific relation of `successful assistance' between acting entities in a group. The relations of assistance within a group at the moment of agency constitute the social fabric of the cohesive group agency. We build our logical theory upon the logic of agency "bringing-it-about". We obtain a family of logics of cohesive group agency, one for every class of cohesion networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Logic of Trust-Based Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, an agent's beliefs would come from what the agent can see, hear, or sense. In the modern world, beliefs are often based on the data available to the agents. In this work, we investigate a dynamic logic of such beliefs that incorporates public announcements of data. The main technical contribution is a sound and complete axiomatisation of the interplay between data-informed beliefs and data announcement modalities. We also describe a non-trivial polynomial model checking algorithm for this logical system.</description>

      <title>pacSTL: PAC-Bounded Signal Temporal Logic from Data-Driven Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world robotic systems must comply with safety requirements in the presence of uncertainty. To define and measure requirement adherence, Signal Temporal Logic (STL) offers a mathematically rigorous and expressive language. However, standard STL cannot account for uncertainty. We address this problem by presenting pacSTL, a framework that combines Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bounded set predictions with an interval extension of STL through optimization problems on the atomic proposition level. pacSTL provides PAC-bounded robustness intervals on the specification level that can be utilized in monitoring. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through maritime navigation and analyze the efficiency and scalability of pacSTL through simulation and real-world experimentation on model vessels.</description>

      <title>A Physical Analogy between Molecular Ordering and SAT-to-Ising Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As temperature drops, molecular systems may undergo spontaneous ordering, moving from random behavior to orderly structure. This research demonstrates a direct analogy between this type of thermodynamic ordering in molecular systems and the development of coherent logic in computationally complex problem sets. We have proposed a mapping of Boolean SAT problem instances to pairwise Ising Hamiltonian models. Using simulated annealing, we then applied phenomenal cooling to the system through thermal evolution from high entropy random assignment to lower entropy, ordered assignments (the energy minima) using molecular cooling analogs. This indicated that there was a rapid "first-order" or "logical crystallization" of satisfiable logical configurations. The degree of backbone rigidity did not strongly correlate with the level of physical ordering observed in the system; thus, it appears that there is primarily a local alignment of constraint satisfaction occurring in the system. Thus, we have provided empirical evidence that satisfiable logical configurations are analogous to the low energy crystalline states observed in molecular systems and provide evidence for a unified thermodynamic view of computational coherence and complexity.</description>

      <title>SM-based Semantics for Answer Set Programs Containing Conditional Literals and Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern answer set programming solvers such as CLINGO support advanced language constructs that improve the expressivity and conciseness of logic programs. Conditional literals are one such construct. They form "subformulas" that behave as nested implications within the bodies of logic rules. Their inclusion brings the form of rules closer to the less restrictive syntax of first-order logic. These qualities make conditional literals useful tools for knowledge representation. In this paper, we propose a semantics for logic programs with conditional literals and arithmetic based on the SM operator. These semantics do not require grounding, unlike the established semantics for such programs that relies on a translation to infinitary propositional logic. The main result of this paper establishes the precise correspondence between the proposed and existing semantics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following Hoare's seminal invention, later called Hoare logic, to reason about correctness of computer programs, we advocate a related but fundamentally different approach to reason about access security of computer programs such as access control. We define the formalism, which we denote access Hoare logic, and present examples which demonstrate its usefulness and fundamental difference to Hoare logic. We prove soundness and completeness of access Hoare logic, and provide a link between access Hoare logic and standard Hoare logic.</description>

      <title>Computation as a Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unifying representation of computation as a two-player game between an \emph{Algorithm} and \emph{Nature}, grounded in domain theory and game theory. The Algorithm produces progressively refined approximations within a Scott domain, while Nature assigns penalties proportional to their distance from the true value. Correctness corresponds to equilibrium in the limit of refinement. This framework allows us to define complexity classes game-theoretically, characterizing $\mathbf{P}$, $\mathbf{NP}$, and related classes as sets of problems admitting particular equilibria. The open question $\mathbf{P} \stackrel{?}{=} \mathbf{NP}$ becomes a problem about the equivalence of Nash equilibria under differing informational and temporal constraints.</description>

      <title>Inferring multiple helper Dafny assertions with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dafny verifier provides strong correctness guarantees but often requires numerous manual helper assertions, creating a significant barrier to adoption. We investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically infer missing helper assertions in Dafny programs, with a primary focus on cases involving multiple missing assertions. To support this study, we extend the DafnyBench benchmark with curated datasets where one, two, or all assertions are removed, and we introduce a taxonomy of assertion types to analyze inference difficulty. Our approach refines fault localization through a hybrid method that combines LLM predictions with error-message heuristics. We implement this approach in a new tool called DAISY (Dafny Assertion Inference SYstem). While our focus is on multiple missing assertions, we also evaluate DAISY on single-assertion cases. DAISY verifies 63.4% of programs with one missing assertion and 31.7% with multiple missing assertions. Notably, many programs can be verified with fewer assertions than originally present, highlighting that proofs often admit multiple valid repair strategies and that recovering every original assertion is unnecessary. These results demonstrate that automated assertion inference can substantially reduce proof engineering effort and represent a step toward more scalable and accessible formal verification.</description>

      <title>Position: Vibe Coding Needs Vibe Reasoning: Improving Vibe Coding with Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ``Vibe coding'' -- the practice of developing software through iteratively conversing with a large language model (LLM) -- has exploded in popularity within the last year. However, developers report key limitations including the accumulation of technical debt, security issues, and code churn to achieve satisfactory results. We argue that these pitfalls result from LLMs' inability to reconcile accumulating human-imposed constraints during vibe coding, with developers inadvertently failing to resolve contradictions because LLMs prioritize user commands over code consistency. Given LLMs' receptiveness to verification-based feedback, we argue that formal methods can mitigate these pitfalls, making vibe coding more reliable. However, we posit that integrating formal methods must transcend existing approaches that combine formal methods and LLMs. We advocate for a side-car system throughout the vibe coding process which: (1) \emph{Autoformalizes} specifications (2) Validates against targets, (3) Delivers \emph{actionable} feedback to the LLM, and (4) Allows intuitive developer influence on specifications.</description>

      <title>Computational expressivity of (circular) proofs with fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14825v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the computational expressivity of proof systems with fixed point operators, within the 'proofs-as-programs' paradigm. We start with a calculus muLJ (due to Clairambault) that extends intuitionistic logic by least and greatest positive fixed points. Based in the sequent calculus, muLJ admits a standard extension to a 'circular' calculus CmuLJ.

Our main result is that, perhaps surprisingly, both muLJ and CmuLJ represent the same first-order functions: those provably total in $\Pi^1_2$-$\mathsf{CA}_0$, a subsystem of second-order arithmetic beyond the 'big five' of reverse mathematics and one of the strongest theories for which we have an ordinal analysis (due to Rathjen). This solves various questions in the literature on the computational strength of (circular) proof systems with fixed points.

For the lower bound we give a realisability interpretation from an extension of Peano Arithmetic by fixed points that has been shown to be arithmetically equivalent to $\Pi^1_2$-$\mathsf{CA}_0$ (due to M\"ollerfeld). For the upper bound we construct a novel computability model in order to give a totality argument for circular proofs with fixed points. In fact we formalise this argument itself within $\Pi^1_2$-$\mathsf{CA}_0$ in order to obtain the tight bounds we are after. Along the way we develop some novel reverse mathematics for the Knaster-Tarski fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>Extracting total Amb programs from proofs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a logical system CFP (Concurrent Fixed Point Logic) supporting the extraction of nondeterministic and concurrent programs that are provably total and correct. CFP is an intuitionistic first-order logic with inductive and coinductive definitions extended by two propositional operators: Restriction (binary), a strengthening of implication, and a unary operator for total concurrency. The source of the extraction are formal CFP proofs, the target is a lambda calculus with constructors and recursion extended by a constructor Amb (for McCarthy's amb) which is interpreted operationally as globally angelic choice and is used to implement nondeterminism and concurrency. The correctness of extracted programs is proven via an intermediate domain-theoretic denotational semantics. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system by extracting a nondeterministic program that translates infinite Gray code into the signed digit representation. A noteworthy feature of CFP is the fact that the proof rules for restriction and concurrency involve variants of the classical law of excluded middle that would not be interpretable computationally without Amb.This is a revised and extended version of the conference paper presented at ESOP 2022 with the same title that contains full proofs of all major results.</description>

      <title>Monoid Theory in Alonzo: A Little Theories Formalization in Simple Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alonzo is a practice-oriented classical higher-order version of predicate logic that extends first-order logic and that admits undefined expressions. Named in honor of Alonzo Church, Alonzo is based on Church's type theory, Church's formulation of simple type theory. The little theories method is a method for formalizing mathematical knowledge as a theory graph consisting of theories as nodes and theory morphisms as directed edges. The development of a mathematical topic is done in the "little theory" in the theory graph that has the most convenient level of abstraction and the most convenient vocabulary, and then the definitions and theorems produced in the development are transported, as needed, to other theories via the theory morphisms in the theory graph.
  The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how a body of mathematical knowledge can be formalized in Alonzo using the little theories method. This is done by formalizing monoid theory -- the body of mathematical knowledge about monoids -- in Alonzo. Instead of using the standard approach to formal mathematics in which mathematics is done with the help of a proof assistant and all details are formally proved and mechanically checked, we employ an alternative approach in which everything is done within a formal logic but proofs are not required to be fully formal. The standard approach focuses on certification, while this alternative approach focuses on communication and accessibility.</description>

      <title>Duality for Fitting's Multi-valued Modal logic via bitopology and biVietoris coalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fitting's Heyting-valued logic and Heyting-valued modal logic have already been studied from an algebraic viewpoint. In addition to algebraic axiomatizations with the completeness of Fitting's Heyting-valued logic and Heyting-valued modal logic, both topological and coalgebraic dualities have also been developed for algebras of Fitting's Heyting-valued modal logic. Bitopological methods have recently been employed to investigate duality for Fitting's Heyting-valued logic. However, the concepts of bitopology and bi-Vietoris coalgebras are conspicuously absent from the development of dualities for Fitting's many-valued modal logic. With this study, we try to bridge that gap. The main results are bitopological and coalgebraic duality for Fitting's many-valued modal logic. We develop a bitopological duality for algebras of Fitting's Heyting-valued modal logic by extending known bitopological duality for Fitting's non-modal logic. To develop coalgebraic duality, we adapt Lauridsen's bi-Vietoris construction from the category of pairwise Stone spaces to the category $PBS_{\mathcal{L}}$ of $\mathcal{L}$-valued (with $\mathcal{L}$ a bounded finite distributive lattice, i.e., a Heyting algebra) pairwise Boolean spaces by incorporating a structure map, and from this obtain the $\mathcal{L}$-biVietoris functor.
  Finally, we establish dual equivalence between coalgebras for the $\mathcal{L}$-biVietoris functor and algebras of Fitting's $\mathcal{L}$-valued modal logic. As a result, we conclude that Fitting's Heyting-valued modal logic is sound and complete with respect to the coalgebras of the $\mathcal{L}$-biVietoris functor. We also apply this coalgebraic approach to the bitopological duality to show the existence of cofree and final coalgebras and to establish a Hennessy-Milner property.</description>

      <title>Distributing Retractions, Weak Distributive Laws and Applications to Monads of Hyperspaces, Continuous Valuations and Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two monads $S$, $T$ on a category where idempotents split, and a weak distributive law between them, one can build a combined monad $U$. Making explicit what this monad $U$ is requires some effort. When we already have an idea what $U$ should be, we show how to recognize that $U$ is indeed the combined monad obtained from $S$ and $T$: it suffices to exhibit what we call a distributing retraction of $ST$ onto $U$. We show that distributing retractions and weak distributive laws are in one-to-one correspondence, in a 2-categorical setting. We give three applications, where $S$ is the Smyth, Hoare or Plotkin hyperspace monad, $T$ is a monad of continuous valuations, and $U$ is a monad of previsions or of forks, depending on the case. As a byproduct, this allows us to describe the algebras of monads of superlinear, resp. sublinear previsions. In the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, the Plotkin hyperspace monad is sometimes known as the Vietoris monad, the monad of probability valuations coincides with the Radon monad, and we infer that the associated combined monad is the monad of normalized forks.</description>

      <title>On the entailment problem for DL-Lite$_{core}$ ontologies and conjunctive queries with negation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the entailment problem, for a given entailment problem for DL-Lite$_{core}$ ontology, and given conjunctive query with inequalities, is undecidable.
  We also show that this problem remains undecidable if conjunctive queries with safe negation are considered instead of conjunctive queries with inequalities.</description>

      <title>Where to Search: Measure the Prior-Structured Search Space of LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via two instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.</description>
