      <title>GPS constellation search for exotic physics messengers coincident with the binary neutron star merger GW170817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Global Positioning System (GPS) includes a continuously operating, planet-scale network of atomic clocks that, beyond navigation and time dissemination, enables precision tests of fundamental physics. Here we use GPS carrier phase archival data to perform a retrospective search for exotic low-mass fields (ELFs) that might be emitted by the binary neutron-star merger GW170817, complementing gravitational wave and electromagnetic modalitiesnin multi-messenger astronomy. Such ultra-relativistic fields would imprint a dispersive, anti-chirp signature in clock-frequency time series, delayed with respect to the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave detection. We construct network-median pseudo-frequency data from eighteen Rb satellite clocks referenced to a terrestrial hydrogen maser and conduct a template-bank search spanning ELF pulse duration, arrival delay, and characteristic frequency. No statistically significant signal is observed after accounting for noise statistics and template-bank trials. We derive 95\% confidence-level lower bounds on the interaction energy scale $\Lambda_\alpha$ of quadratic couplings driving variations in electromagnetic fine-structure constant. These limits improve upon existing astrophysical and gravity-test constraints across the ELF-energy range $\approx10^{-18}$--$10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$. This demonstrates that mature global satellite-clock networks provide an observational capability for retrospective, multi-messenger searches for new physics using decades of archival timing data.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Point Spread Function Modeling in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the development of a data-driven, AI-based model of the Point Spread Function (PSF) that achieves higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art approach, "PSF in the Full Field-of-View'' (PIFF). PIFF is widely used in leading weak-lensing surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The PSF characterizes how a point source, such as a star, is imaged after its light traverses the atmosphere and telescope optics, effectively representing the "blurred fingerprint'' of the entire imaging system. Accurate PSF modeling is essential for weak gravitational lensing analyses, as biases in its estimation propagate directly into cosmic shear measurements -- one of the primary cosmological probes of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of large-scale structure for dark energy studies. To address the limitations of PIFF, which constructs PSF models independently for each CCD and therefore loses spatial coherence across the focal plane, we introduce a deep-learning-based framework for PSF reconstruction. In this approach, an autoencoder is trained on stellar images obtained with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) of the Subaru Telescope and combined with a Gaussian process to interpolate the PSF across the telescope's full field of view. This hybrid model captures systematic variations across the focal plane and achieves a reconstruction error of $3.4 \times 10^{-6}$ compared to PIFF's $3.7 \times 10^{-6}$, laying the foundation for integration into the LSST Science Pipelines.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws for Boosted Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established that scaling compute, through joint increases in model capacity and dataset size, is the primary driver of performance in modern machine learning. While machine learning has long been an integral component of High Energy Physics (HEP) data analysis workflows, the compute used to train state-of-the-art HEP models remains orders of magnitude below that of industry foundation models. With scaling laws only beginning to be studied in the field, we investigate neural scaling laws for boosted jet classification using the public JetClass dataset. We derive compute optimal scaling laws and identify an effective performance limit that can be consistently approached through increased compute. We study how data repetition, common in HEP where simulation is expensive, modifies the scaling yielding a quantifiable effective dataset size gain. We then study how the scaling coefficients and asymptotic performance limits vary with the choice of input features and particle multiplicity, demonstrating that increased compute reliably drives performance toward an asymptotic limit, and that more expressive, lower-level features can raise the performance limit and improve results at fixed dataset size.</description>

      <title>Analog-based ensembles to characterize turbulent dynamics from observed data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology for the study of the dispersion of trajectories of stochastic processes in reconstructed phase spaces from observed data. The methodology allows to find ensembles of analog states, i.e. states that are close in the phase space. Once these states are found, we focus on the characterisation of their dispersion in function of 1) the time and 2) their initial separation. We study an experimental turbulent velocity measurement and two scale-invariant stochastic processes: a regularized fractional Brownian motion and a regularized multifractal random walk. Both stochastic processes are synthesized to have the same covariance structure as the experimental turbulent velocity, but only the regularized multifractal random walk mimics the intermittency of turbulent velocity. We illustrate that while the covariance structure of the processes governs the time dependence of the dispersion of the analog states, the intermittency phenomenon is responsible for the impact of the initial separation of the analogs on their dispersion.</description>

      <title>Agents of Discovery</title>

Abstract: The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector Geometry as a New Route to Criticality in Random Multiplicative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy-tailed fluctuations and power law distributions pervade physics, biology, and the social sciences, with numerous mechanisms proposed for their emergence. Kesten processes, which are multiplicative stochastic recursions with additive noise or reinjection, provide a canonical explanation, where power law tails arise from transient supercritical excursions as eigenvalues intermittently cross the stability boundary. Here we uncover a distinct and more general mechanism in multidimensional systems: non-normal eigenvector amplification. In random non-normal matrices, the non-orthogonality of eigenvectors, quantified at each time step by the condition number $\kappa_t$ in Kesten-like processes, induces transient growth that increases the effective Lyapunov exponent $\gamma \to \gamma + \mathbb{E}\left[\ln \kappa_t \right]$ and lowers the tail exponent $\alpha \simeq -2\gamma / \sigma_{\kappa}^2$, where $\mathbb{E}\left[\ln \kappa_t \right]$ and $\sigma_{\kappa}^2$ are respectively the mean and variance of $\ln \kappa_t$. As the system dimension $N$ grows, $\kappa$ typically increases proportionally, making non-normal amplification the dominant source of scale-free behavior. We illustrate this mechanism in polymer stretching in turbulent flows, where intermittent extensions arise from eigenvector amplification of velocity gradients.</description>
