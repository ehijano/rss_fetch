      <title>On-shell recursion relations for higher-spin Compton amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recursively construct tree-level electromagnetic and gravitational Compton amplitudes of higher-spin massive particles by the all-line transverse momentum shift. With three-point amplitude as input, we demonstrate that higher-point electromagnetic and gravitational Compton amplitudes are on-shell constructible up to spin $s = 3/2$ and $s = 5/2$, respectively, under the all-line transverse shift after imposing the current constraint condition. We unambiguously derive the four-point electromagnetic and gravitational Compton amplitudes for $s \leq 3/2$ and $s \leq 5/2$, which are uniquely determined by the on-shell recursion relation and are free from unphysical spurious poles. In addition, we explore amplitudes of spin-$3/2$ particles with non-minimal three-point interactions with photon, as well as $s &gt; 3/2$ particles, and comment on their notable features. Our work furthers the understanding of on-shell methods for massive amplitudes, with hopes to shed light on physical observables in particle physics and higher-spin amplitudes relevant for Kerr black-hole scattering.</description>

      <title>Towards a microscopic description of de Sitter dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing dynamics in a gravitational universe with positive cosmological constant, such as de Sitter space, is a conceptually challenging problem. We propose a principle for constructing a quantum system that can potentially be used to study this question. This quantum system describes a heavy object in such a universe interacting with its environment, to which gauge invariant dynamical observables can be anchored. In order to describe gravity with positive cosmological constant, the proposed quantum system needs to agree with all known semiclassical results. We investigate this with a particular microscopic realization constructed using SYK. We first find that correlators match the classical limit of gravity, given by quantum fields in rigid de Sitter space. In particular, the usual UV behavior of quantum fields is surprisingly reproduced by the quantum mechanical system. In order to probe small effects in the gravitational constant, we also consider the intrinsically dynamical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). These correspond to gravitational scattering in the bulk away from the worldline associated with the quantum system. Such OTOCs have highly non-trivial features in de Sitter space, including a Lyapunov exponent which is twice as big as the maximal chaos exponent from the bound on chaos, as well as an unusual behavior of the coefficients in various OTOCs. Interestingly, we find that these features are reproduced by the quantum system.</description>

      <title>Wigner negativity, random matrices and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a choice of an ordered, orthonormal basis for a $D$-dimensional Hilbert space, one can define a discrete version of the Wigner function -- a quasi-probability distribution which represents any quantum state as a real, normalized function on a discrete phase space. The Wigner function, in general, takes on negative values, and the amount of negativity in the Wigner function gives an operationally meaningful measure of the complexity of simulating the quantum state on a classical computer. Further, Wigner negativity also gives a lower bound on an entropic measure of spread complexity. In this paper, we study the growth of Wigner negativity for a generic initial state under time evolution with chaotic Hamiltonians. In arXiv:2402.13694, a perturbative argument was given to show that the Krylov basis minimizes the early time growth of Wigner negativity in the large-$D$ limit. Using tools from random matrix theory, here we show that for a generic choice of basis, the Wigner negativity for a classical initial state becomes exponentially large in an $O(1)$ amount of time evolution. On the other hand, we show that in the Krylov basis the negativity grows at most as a power law, and becomes exponentially large only at exponential times. We take this as evidence that the Krylov basis is ideally suited for a dual, semi-classical effective description of chaotic quantum dynamics for large-$D$ at sub-exponential times. For the Gaussian unitary ensemble, this effective description is the $q\to 0$ limit of $q$-deformed JT gravity.</description>

      <title>The particle spectra of parity-violating theories: A less radical approach and an upgrade of PSALTer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to computational barriers, the effects of parity violation have so far been grossly neglected in gravitational model-building, leading to a serious gap in the space of prior models. We present a new algorithm for efficiently computing the particle spectrum for any parity-violating tensorial field theory. It allows to extract conditions for the absence of massive ghosts without resorting to any manipulation of radicals in cases where the particle masses are irrational functions of the Lagrangian coupling coefficients. We test it against several examples, among which is the most general parity-indefinite Einstein-Cartan/Poincar\'e gravity that propagates two healthy massive scalars (in addition to the massless graviton). Importantly, we upgrade the PSALTer software in the Wolfram Language to accommodate parity-violating theories. PSALTer is a contribution to the xAct project.</description>

      <title>Black Shell Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black shells have been proposed as black hole mimickers, i.e. horizonless ultra-compact objects that replace black holes. In this paper, we assume the existence of black shells and consider their thermodynamic properties, but remain agnostic about their wider role in gravitational physics. An ambient negative cosmological constant is introduced in order to have a well-defined canonical ensemble, leading to a rich phase structure. In particular, the Hawking-Page transition between thermal AdS vacuum and large AdS black holes is split in two, with an intermediate black shell phase, which may play a role in gauge/gravity duality at finite volume. Similarly, for non-vanishing electric charge below a critical value, a black shell phase separates two black hole phases at low and high temperatures. Above the critical charge, there are no phase transitions and large AdS black holes always have the lowest free energy.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlation beyond entanglement: Holographic discord and multipartite generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum theory and holography, quantum correlations arising from superposition, such as quantum discord, offer a broader perspective that has remained largely unexplored in holography. We construct gravity duals of quantum discord and classical correlation. In both holographic systems and Haar random states, discord exceeds entanglement, revealing an additional quantum correlation linked to the Markov gap and non-distillable entanglement, suggesting holographic states are intrinsically non-bipartite. In black hole setups, discord can increase despite decoherence and persists beyond the sudden death of distillable entanglement. Motivated by the holographic formula, we define reflected discord -- an optimization-free boundary quantity based on reflected entropy -- which remains effective even outside the holographic regime. We also propose several multipartite generalizations of discord, including a holography-inspired one based on multi-entropy. These results provide new tools for quantifying quantum correlations beyond entanglement in strongly coupled many-body systems and offer a novel approach to multipartite correlation measures.</description>

      <title>Gravitons on Nariai Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, for any $d\geq 3$, the one-loop graviton path integral on $S^2\times S^{d-1}$ factorizes into bulk and edge parts. The bulk equals the thermal partition function of an ideal graviton gas in the Lorentzian Nariai geometry. The edge factor is the inverse of the path integral over two identical copies, each containing one shift-symmetric vector and three shift-symmetric scalars on $S^{d-1}$. Unlike the round $S^{d+1}$ case, all scalars are massless, indicating that graviton edge partition functions probe beyond the horizon's intrinsic geometry - in contrast to $p$-form gauge theories. In the course of this work, we obtain a compact formula for the one-loop Euclidean graviton path integral on any $\Lambda &gt;0$ Einstein manifold.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields and 3D Flat Space Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat Space Cosmologies (FSC) are time-dependent solutions in Einstein gravity in three-dimensional (3D) spacetimes with zero cosmological constant. These are orbifolds of 3D flat space that have a cosmological horizon and can be thought of as analogs of the Banados-Tietelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black holes of AdS$_3$. We study scalar perturbations about these FSC solutions and explore the spectrum of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) crucially treating the cosmological horizon as a hard wall and extending to complex momenta. We connect this intrinsic analysis with the flatspace limit of the corresponding analysis in the BTZ black hole. The FSC QNMs are then utilized to build the scalar one-loop partition function by methods pioneered by Denef, Hartnoll and Sachdev in various simplifying limits and compared with existing answers in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of models in the framework of metric-affine gravity and establish their correspondence to the bosonic sector of a class of no-scale supergravity models. The excellent inflationary behavior of the gravitational models considered is carried over to the corresponding supergravity ones, thus, enriching the landscape of inflation-compatible models.</description>

      <title>Mixed Solutions to the Liouville Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We enlarge the set of explicit classical solutions to the Liouville equation with three singularities to the cases with mixed hyperbolic and elliptic monodromies. We analyze the large hyperbolic monodromy limit of the solutions and the farthest geodesics looping one hyperbolic singularity. These two-dimensional geometries describe a time-symmetric spatial slice of a solution to three-dimensional general relativity. The geodesics are reinterpreted as snapshots of horizons of evolving black holes. We study the spatial slice with three horizons of very heavy black holes in some detail. We use uniform saddle point integration to present the Liouville and heavy black hole geometries in terms of simpler special functions. These make a detailed analysis of mixed particle and black hole geometries possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian formulation of the BMS symmetry on spacelike hypersurfaces enables one to define its action on solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Using the BRST reformulation of the theory, we provide operator expressions for the matrix elements of the BMS operators between Wheeler-DeWitt states. To that end, we construct the BRST-invariant extensions of the BMS generators, which form a BRST-extension of the BMS algebra.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetries in twisted eleven-dimensional supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In supersymmetric theories, protected quantities can be reorganized into holomorphic-topological theories by twisting. Recently, it was observed by \cite{JKY} that residual super-Poincar\'e symmetries in certain twisted theories can receive higher corrections, turning them into $L_\infty$ algebras with non-strict actions on the twisted fields. In this note, we show that the same phenomenon occurs for the two admissible twists of eleven-dimensional supergravity. Along the way, we discuss in detail the connection between components of physical and twisted fields.</description>

      <title>A short overview on the Black Hole-Tower Correspondence and Species Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breakdown of gravitational effective field theories is intimately connected to the emergence of infinite towers of light states near infinite-distance limits in field space. In string theory, up to duality frame, such towers arise from Kaluza-Klein or weakly-coupled critical string oscillator modes. Motivated by the Black Hole-String Correspondence, we review a broader mechanism whereby black holes undergo a transition into a tower of light states, governed by the Quantum Gravity cutoff -- known as the Species Scale. Building on these developments, the Black Hole-Tower correspondence aims to provide a unified thermodynamic framework that describes black hole entropy in terms of the spectrum of the lightest degrees of freedom across various perturbative regimes of quantum gravity theories. In those regimes, thermodynamic consistency of such transition imposes stringent constraints on the spectrum, in agreement with string theory predictions. This defines the basis of the so-called Species Thermodynamics.
  In this review, we emphasize these recent advances and synthesize their implications, offering an overview of how the outlined correspondence, the species scale and related thermodynamic principles enhance our understanding of black hole entropy within the effective field theory framework.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=1$ Jackiw -Teitelboim supergravity beyond the Schwarzian regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic symmetry structure of two--dimensional dilaton gravity in its $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric extension based on the $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ Lie superalgebra. Within the BF theoretical framework, we analyze affine and superconformal boundary conditions for each case and systematically derive the associated asymptotic symmetry algebras. While the classical theory recovers the Virasoro algebra or its affine enhancement, the supersymmetric extension yields a classical $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal algebra, subject to dynamical symmetry breaking mechanisms induced by the dilaton supermultiplet. We find that the boundary behavior of the dilaton not only leads to a reduction of the full affine $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)_k$ symmetry down to $\tt{O} \tt{S} p(1|2)$, but also introduces an abelian extension through commuting modes. These results reveal a novel interplay between symmetry breaking and symmetry extension in low-dimensional supergravity. Our construction generalizes previous analyses of $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ dilaton gravity to the supersymmetric domain and offers a consistent foundation for investigating boundary dynamics beyond the Schwarzian regime.</description>

      <title>Bulk/boundary Modular Quintessence and DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest DESI DR2 results, when combined with other independent cosmological data on the Cosmic Microwave Background and supernovas, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy.
  We propose a novel cosmological scenario, which features two distinct scalar fields. One governs the magnitude of the present-day dark energy density and is related to the size of extra-dimensions. Accounting for the observed smallness of this energy density requires the scalar to reside near the boundary of field space.
  The second field, responsible for the time evolution of dark energy and associated with the string coupling, must instead lie in the bulk to remain consistent with the non-observation of light string states. We show that a natural candidate for such dark energy dynamics is a quintessence modular-invariant potential, in which the second scalar field rolls down a negatively curved slope, starting from a self-dual critical point. We find that this scenario is in good agreement with the latest findings by DESI.</description>

      <title>ModMax Electrodynamics and Holographic Magnetotransport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study magnetotransport in a holographic model where ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics is coupled to Einstein AdS gravity. To incorporate momentum relaxation, we introduce spatially linear axion fields that break translational symmetry, resulting in an anisotropic medium. Using linear response theory, we compute the DC conductivity matrix in the presence of an external magnetic field, expressing the conductivities in terms of horizon data. Our results demonstrate how the nonlinear ModMax parameter modifies charge transport, particularly influencing the Hall angle and Nernst signal. The nonlinear corrections introduce distinct deviations in both longitudinal and Hall conductivities while preserving the characteristic temperature scaling of strange metals, offering new insights into strongly coupled systems with nonlinear electromagnetic interactions. Notably, the Nernst signal reproduces that of high$-T_c$ cuprate superconductors showing a superconducting dome and a normal phase, with the ModMax deformation parameter tuning critical and onset temperatures. In the strongly nonlinear regime, we find evidence of an exotic state dominated by quasiparticle excitations in the dual material.</description>

      <title>BCOV on the Large Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the BCOV theory of deformations of complex structures as a pull-back to the super moduli space of the worldline of a spinning particle. In this approach the appearance of a non-local kinetic term in the target space action has the same origin as the mismatch of pictures in the Ramond sector of super string field theory and is resolved by the same type of auxiliary fields in shifted pictures. The BV-extension is manifest in this description. A compensator for the holomorphic 3-form can be included by resorting to a description in the large Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of the entropy of de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an infinite family of semiclassical de Sitter (dS) microstates, realized as backreacted geometries of dS spacetime with a constant tension thin-shell brane located outside the dS event horizon. The contribution of wormholes in semiclassical gravitational path integral computations of overlaps between these microstates implies that they are not fully orthogonal. We count the dimension of the Hilbert space spanned by these dS microstates and find that it equals the exponential of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the de Sitter spacetime. Our construction provides a gravitational states counting derivation of Gibbons-Hawking formula for dS entropy.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Electrodynamics via the Characteristic Method: Relativistic and Carrollian Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric-magnetic duality plays a pivotal role in understanding the structure of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). The Gaillard-Zumino (GZ) criterion provides a powerful constraint for identifying self-dual theories. In this work, we systematically explore solutions to the GZ self-duality condition by applying the method of characteristics, a robust tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. Our approach enables the construction of new classes of Lagrangians that respect duality symmetry, both in the relativistic and Carrollian frameworks. In the relativistic setting, we not only recover well-known examples such as Born-Infeld and ModMax theories, but also identify novel models. We then generalize the GZ formalism to the Carrollian case and construct several classes of Carrollian self-dual non-linear electrodynamic models. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the characteristic flow exhibits an attractor behavior, in the sense that different seed theories that may not be self-dual can generate the same descendant self-dual Lagrangian. These findings broaden the landscape of self-dual theories and open new directions for exploring duality in ultra-relativistic regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various approximate symmetries exist in nature. For example, the flavor $SU(4)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange/charm$ quarks is severely broken, the flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange$ quarks is moderately broken, and the isospin $SU(2)$ symmetry involving the $up/down$ quarks is slightly broken. These broken symmetries are primarily governed by the strong interaction, making them an ideal platform for investigating the general behavior of approximate symmetries. To explore the application of the flavor $SU(4)$ group to ground-state baryons, we systematically calculate the transition matrices associated with various flavor $SU(4)$ representations as well as the matrices that describe their connections. These matrices are then employed to analyze the mass spectrum of ground-state baryons. Our results indicate that these states can be described as mixtures of various flavor representations, such as $\Sigma_c/\Xi_c^\prime/\Omega_c \sim \mathbf{20_M} \oplus \mathbf{20_S}\oplus \mathbf{\bar{4}_A}~[SU(4)]$, $\Xi_c/\Xi_c^\prime \sim \mathbf{\bar 3_A} \oplus \mathbf{6_S}~[SU(3)]$, $\Lambda^0/\Sigma^0 \sim \mathbf{1_A} \oplus \mathbf{3_S}~[SU(2)]$, where the subscripts $\mathbf{S}$, $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{M}$ denote the symmetric, antisymmetric, and mixed flavor wave functions, respectively. Our results also indicate that the flavor symmetries, as they break, necessitate the mixing of these flavor representations according to specific rules.</description>

      <title>Differential Equations for Energy Correlators in Any Angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy Correlators (EC) are the simplest IR finite observables, which connect theories and experiments. In this paper, we provide a systematic algorithm to calculate the canonical differential equations for energy correlators at generic angle in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. The integrand is obtained from the 5-point form factor square for scalar half-BPS operators. Applying the algorithm, we obtain the canonical basis for three-point EC and the full set of master integrals for four-point EC. We analyze the function space for four-point case. For multiple polylogrithmic (MPLs) integrals, we calculate their symbols, and for integrals beyond MPLs, we make further investigation by Picard-Fuchs operators. We find two elliptic curves and one genus 2 hyperelliptic curve. The results are achieved by means of integration by part (IBP) reduction and differential equations powered by computational algebraic geometry methods. We provide a package that implements the algorithm. The data is a valuable reference for exploring the structure of physical observables in perturbation theories.</description>

      <title>Nonminimal infrared gravitational reheating in light of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation is known to produce large infrared scalar fluctuations. Further, if a scalar field $(\chi)$ is non-minimally coupled with gravity through $\xi \chi^2 R$, those infrared modes experience \textit{tachyonic instability} during and after inflation. Those large non-perturbative infrared modes can collectively produce hot Big Bang universe upon their horizon entry during the post-inflationary period. We indeed find that for reheating equation of state (EoS), $w_{\phi} &gt; 1/3$, and coupling strength, $\xi&gt;1/6$, large infrared fluctuations lead to successful reheating. We further analyze perturbative reheating by solving the standard Boltzmann equation in both Jordan and Einstein frames, and compare the results with the non-perturbative ones. Finally, embedding this infrared reheating scenario into the well-known $\alpha-$attractor inflationary model, we examine possible constraints on the model parameters in light of the latest ACT, DESI results. To arrive at the constraints, we take into account the latest bounds on tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{0.05}\leq 0.038$, isocurvature power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{S}} \lesssim 8.3\times 10^{-11}$, and effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.17 $. Subject to these constraints, we find successful reheating to occur only for EoS $w_{\phi}\gtrsim 0.6$, which translates to a sub-class of $\alpha-$attractor models being favored and placing them within the 2$\sigma$ region in the $ n_s-r$ plane of the latest ACT, DESI data. In this range of EoS, we find that the coupling strength should lie within $2.11\lesssim\xi\lesssim 2.95$ for $w_{\phi}=0.6$. Finally, we compute secondary gravitational wave signals induced by the scalar infrared modes, which are found to be strong enough to be detected by future GW observatories, namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Four-point correlation functions in axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model. Using an open quantum system formalism from our previous work, we calculate the influence functional to fourth order, from which we then derive the inflaton four-point correlation function. When we decompose this function using isotropic basis functions, the expansion coefficients $\zeta_{\ell',\ell'',\ell'''}$ naturally split into parity-even and parity-odd components. In the large $\xi$ approximation, which enhances the production of right-handed photons in the model, the derivation of these coefficients simplifies. We work out the lowest-order nonvanishing parity-odd $\zeta_{234}$ term which clearly indicates the presence of parity violation. Moreover, our derived values of the coefficients are consistent with recent observational data from galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Identification of gapless phases by squaring a twist operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general necessary condition for a spin chain with SO(3) spin-rotation symmetry to be gapped. Specifically, we prove that the ground state(s) of an SO(3)-symmetric gapped spin chain must be spin singlet(s), and the expectation value of the square of a twist operator asymptotically approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit, where finite-size corrections are inversely proportional to the square root of the system size. This theorem provides (i) supporting evidence for various conjectured gapped phases, and (ii) a sufficient criterion for identifying gapless spin chains. We verify our theorem by numerical simulations for a variety of spin models and show that it offers a novel efficient way to identify gapless phases in spin chains with spin-rotation symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We generalize Block-G\"ottsche polynomials, originally defined for toric del Pezzo surfaces, to arbitrary surfaces. To do this, we show that these polynomials arise as special cases of BPS polynomials, defined for any surface $S$ as Laurent polynomials in a formal variable $q$ encoding the BPS invariants of the $3$-fold $S \times \mathbb{P}^1$. We conjecture that for surfaces $S_n$ obtained by blowing up $\mathbb{P}^2$ at $n$ general points, the evaluation of BPS polynomials at $q=-1$ yields Welschinger invariants, given by signed counts of real rational curves. We prove this conjecture for all surfaces $S_n$ with $n \leq 6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum phase estimation in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer using q-deformed photon states, including q-coherent and q-cat states, which model realistic deviations from ideal light sources. By deriving closed-form photon count likelihoods via the Jordan-Schwinger mapping, we compute the quantum and classical Fisher information and perform Bayesian inference on simulated detector data. Our results show that photon counting remains an optimal measurement strategy even for deformed states, with classical and quantum Fisher information in exact agreement. Furthermore, the phase sensitivity improves with increasing q-deformation, indicating enhanced metrological performance driven by nonclassical photon statistics. These findings highlight the utility of q-deformed states in quantum sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some time ago it was claimed in "Spontaneous Breaking of Lepton Number and Cosmological Domain Wall Problem" (Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 151301 (2019)) that non perturbative instantons of the weak interaction $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$ lead to the formation of domain walls in Majoron models owing to the anomaly of the spontaneously broken global lepton number $L$ symmetry $\text{U}(1)_L$ with respect to $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$. We point out that it has long been known, that this effect can be completely rotated away unless there is a source of explicit $B+L$ breaking present, where $B$ denotes baryon number. We further estimate the tiny instanton induced Majoron mass from $B+L$ breaking and analyze the cosmological impact of such domain walls including possible finite temperature effects. In general this scenario does not lead to a cosmological catastrophe.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Barrow and Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy from DESI DR2 BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barrow and Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) are two recently proposed extensions of the standard HDE framework, incorporating generalized corrections to horizon entropy through the use of Barrow and Tsallis entropies. Tsallis entropy arises from non-extensive statistical phenomena which account for long-range correlations and deviations from additivity, while Barrow entropy emerges from quantum-gravitational effects on the horizon geometry, associated with fractal modifications and deformations. At the cosmological level, both scenarios lead to the same equations, nevertheless the involved parameters obey different theoretical bounds. In this work, we use observational data from Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), including the recently released DESI DR2 dataset, to place constraints on both scenaria. We show that both can be in agreement with observations, although they cannot alleviate the $H_0$ tension. However, applying information criteria we deduce that both of them are not favoured comparing to $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmological paradigm.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spacetime Theories Can Explain the Muon Magnetic Moment Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An unsolved problem of particle physics is a discrepancy between the measured value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the theoretical prediction based on standard quantum electrodynamics. In this paper we show that if spacetime possesses a fundamental length scale, the ensuing modifications to the photon propagator can account for the discrepancy if the scale is chosen to be $10^{-22}$~m; the corresponding energy being about $30$~TeV. The possibility that spacetime possesses a graininess on a fine enough scale has a long history. One class of theories that develops this idea is Doubly Special Relativity (DSR), and we choose this as a model for our calculation. We note that the derived length scale is many orders of magnitude larger than the Planck length, but comparable to that of some higher dimensional gravitational theories. It is also within scope of experimental confirmation in the next generation of colliders.</description>

Abstract: We will give two representations for thermofield-double (TFD). The first representation is the well-known Kerr-BTZ black hole geometry, which is the solution of Einstein's equation. The second representation is a disjoint union of two circles, which is a solution to two copies of the Schwarzian theory. This representation, in particular, admits the reparametrization modes, which are absent in any two dimensional CFT on a torus, and are essential for (dis-)entangling the TFD. Since the two representations describe the same state, they must be equivalent.</description>

Abstract: We study the complexity of the gravity dual to the confining $SU(N)\times SU(N+M)$ Klebanov-Strassler gauge theory, which is an important test case for holographic complexity in higher-dimensional and nonconformal gauge/gravity dualities. We emphasize the dependence of the complexity on parameters of the gauge theory, finding a common behavior with confinement scale for several complexity functionals. We also analyze how the complexity diverges with the UV cut off, which is more complicated than in AdS backgrounds because the theory is nonconformal. Our results may provide new perspectives on questions in the holographic complexity program as well as a starting point for further studies of complexity in general gauge/gravity dualities.</description>

      <title>The q-Schwarzian and Liouville gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new holographic duality between q-Schwarzian quantum mechanics and Liouville gravity. The q-Schwarzian is a one parameter deformation of the Schwarzian, which is dual to JT gravity and describes the low energy sector of SYK. We show that the q-Schwarzian in turn is dual to sinh dilaton gravity. This one parameter deformation of JT gravity can be rewritten as Liouville gravity. We match the thermodynamics and classical two point function between q-Schwarzian and Liouville gravity. We further prove the duality on the quantum level by rewriting sinh dilaton gravity as a topological gauge theory, and showing that the latter equals the q-Schwarzian. As the q-Schwarzian can be quantized exactly, this duality can be viewed as an exact solution of sinh dilaton gravity on the disk topology. For real q, this q-Schwarzian corresponds to double-scaled SYK and is dual to a sine dilaton gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Abelian gauge symmetry proposed by Hermann Weyl is extended to a more general form. Afterwards the standard model is generalized to incorporate the newly defined symmetry. This symmetry extension brings new gauge particles that can be potential candidates for the dark matter. It also naturally introduces a second scalar field into the theory. The breaking of the Weyl symmetry turns this scalar field into a dimensional constant, making the Higgs as the only scalar component in the standard model. In addition to the expected benefits, there are three unexpected bonuses: (1) it brings some new understanding of the parity violation; (2) it provides an answer to the sign problem in the Higgs mechanism; (3) it gives some new perspectives on the nature of the neutrino: the extended Weyl symmetry demands that there \textit{must be} right-handed neutrino; furthermore, the smallness of the neutrino mass is protected by the extended Weyl symmetry.</description>

      <title>Exploring superconformal Yang-Mills theories through matrix Bessel kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A broad class of observables in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal Yang-Mills theories can be exactly computed for arbitrary 't Hooft coupling as Fredholm determinants of integrable Bessel operators. These observables admit a unifying description through a one-parameter generating function, which possesses a determinant representation involving a matrix generalization of the Bessel operator. We analyze this generating function over a wide range of parameter values and finite 't Hooft coupling. We demonstrate that it has a well-behaved weak-coupling expansion with a finite radius of convergence. In contrast, the strong-coupling expansion exhibits factorially growing coefficients, necessitating the inclusion of non-perturbative corrections that are exponentially suppressed at strong coupling. We compute these non-perturbative corrections and observe a striking resemblance between the resulting trans-series expansion of the generating function and the partition function of a strongly coupled theory expanded in powers of a mass gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the high-energy fixed-angle scattering of pions and $\rho$-mesons in a bottom-up holographic QCD model. To this end, we generalise the approach of Polchinski and Strassler arXiv:hep-th/0109174 to write an ansatz for meson scattering amplitudes based on superstring scattering amplitudes in asymptotically AdS space. We demonstrate that our generalisation of the Polchinski--Strassler proposal is necessary to describe $\rho$-meson scattering consistently with the Nambu--Goldstone boson equivalence theorem. Our results for pion and $\rho$-meson scattering amplitudes are in agreement with the constituent counting rule found in QCD. Moreover, our proposal for 2-to-2 scattering amplitudes provides a method for computing scattering angle dependence.</description>

      <title>Presymplectic BV-AKSZ for $N=1$, $D=4$ Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elaborate on the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach to supersymmetric systems. In particular, we construct such a formulation for the $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity by taking as a target space the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of the super-Poincar\'e algebra which, as we demonstrate, admits an invariant presymplectic structure of degree $3$. This data encodes a full-scale Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the system, including a concise form of the BV master action. The important feature of (presymplectic) AKSZ models is that, at least at the level of equations of motion, they can be equivalently reformulated in the spacetime obtained by adding or eliminating contractible dimensions. For instance, the presymplectic AKSZ formulation of gravity can be lifted to the respective ``group manifold'', endowing it with the structure of a principle bundle and the Cartan connection therein, at least locally. In particular, the so-called rheonomy conditions emerge as a part of the presymplectic AKSZ equations of motion. The analogous considerations apply to supergravity and its uplift to superspace. We also study general presymplectic BV-AKSZ models related by adding or removing contractible spacetime dimensions in order to systematically relate the spacetime and superspace formulations of the same system within the AKSZ-like framework. These relations are then illustrated using the supersymmetric particle as a toy model.</description>

      <title>S-dual Quintessence, the Swampland, and the DESI DR2 Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dark energy model in which a quintessence field $\phi$ rolls near the vicinity of a local maximum of its potential characterized by the simplest $S$ self-dual form $V(\phi) = \Lambda \ {\rm sech}(\sqrt{2} \, \phi/M_p)$, where $M_p$ is the reduced Planck mass and $\Lambda \sim 10^{-120} M_p^4$ is the cosmological constant. We confront the model with Swampland ideas and show that the $S$-dual potential is consistent with the distance conjecture, the de Sitter conjecture, and the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture. We also examine the compatibility of this phenomenological model with the intriguing DESI DR2 results and show that the shape of the $S$-dual potential is almost indistinguishable from the axion-like potential, $V (\phi) = m_a^2 \ f_a^2 \ [ 1 + \cos(\phi/f_a)]$, with $m_a$ and $f_a$ parameters fitted by the DESI Collaboration to accommodate the DR2 data. The self-dual potential has the advantage that one starts at the self-dual point and this is a theoretical motivation, because as the universe cools off the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gets broken leading to a natural rolling away from the symmetric point.</description>

      <title>Geometrizing the Anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently a manifestly gauge invariant formalism for calculating amplitudes in quantum electrodynamics was outlined in which the field strength, rather than the gauge potential, is used as the propagating field. To demonstrate the utility of this formalism we calculate the axial and gauge anomalies explicitly in theories with both electrically and magnetically charged particles. Usually the gauge anomaly is identified as an amplitude that (in certain theories) fails to be gauge invariant, so it seems particularly enlightening to understand it in a manifestly gauge invariant formalism. We find that the three photon amplitude is still anomalous in these same theories because it depends explicitly upon the choice of the Stokes surface needed to couple the field strength to sources, so the gauge anomaly arises from geometric considerations.</description>

      <title>On local fields invariant under the action of topological defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look into the problem of constructing and classifying pairs consisting of a local operator and a topological defect which commutes or anticommutes with it. We discuss the bulk and boundary versions of the problem. In the latter one considers a conformal boundary condition, a boundary operator on it and a junction with a topological defect. In the case of the charge conjugation modular invariant commuting configurations in each problem can be obtained when a certain restriction on the fusion rules in realised. We study the corresponding fusion rule problems in detail. While in the bulk case it reduces to realising the $a\times b = c$ fusion rule which was studied in arXiv:2012.14689 [hep-th], in the boundary it leads to a new type of problem. We obtain a full solution to this problem for the $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ WZW theory, thus constructing a class of commuting boundary operators and junctions in that theory, and suggest an approach to general WZW theories.</description>

Abstract: We consider wave packets of a massless scalar field that have well-localized Rindler energy, and examine how their energy appears to a Minkowski observer to see how the classical gravitational blue-shift formula is modified quantum mechanically. We derive, by using the saddle point approximation, an analytic expression for the Minkowski momentum distribution of such Rindler wave packets. We find a universal lower bound on the uncertainty of Minkowski momentum; the momentum distribution can never become arbitrarily sharp.</description>

      <title>The non-relastivistic limit of HSZ Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-relativistic (NR) limit of HSZ theory, a higher-derivative theory of gravity with exact and manifest T-duality invariance. Since the theory can be formulated using the generalized metric formalism, the HSZ Lagrangian remains convergent to all orders in derivatives when taking the NR limit. In this work, we analyze the three-derivative corrections to the symmetry transformations of the fields in the NR case, as well as the four-derivative action in the absence of a b-field. Interestingly, the corrections to the metric degrees of freedom cannot be fully trivialized, as in the relativistic case, in order to preserve the convergence of the theory. As HSZ theory interpolates order by order between heterotic and bosonic string theories, the results of this work can be interpreted as a truncation of the four-derivative structure of heterotic supergravity in the NR limit.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Spectral Method: From Atomic Orbitals to Classical Self-Force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03798v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can classical systems be described analytically at all orders in their interaction strength? For periodic and approximately periodic systems, the answer is yes, as we show in this work. Our analytical approach, which we call the \textit{Quantum Spectral Method}, is based on a novel application of Bohr's correspondence principle, obtaining non-perturbative classical dynamics as the classical limit of \textit{quantum matrix elements}. A major application of our method is the calculation of self-force as the classical limit of atomic radiative transitions. We demonstrate this by calculating an adiabatic electromagnetic inspiral, along with its associated radiation, at all orders in the multipole expansion. Finally, we propose a future application of the Quantum Spectral Method to compute scalar and gravitational self-force in Schwarzschild, analytically.</description>

      <title>Rotational mass of anisotropic neutron stars within Rastall gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01837v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to rotation, the mass correction of neutron stars arises and causes the rotational mass to be larger than the static mass. In this work, we extend the formulation of the rotational mass of anisotropic neutron stars within Rastall gravity. We apply numerical simulation on the formulation we obtained. We refer to mass of J0740+6620, GW170817, and GW190814 as the mass constraints of the neutron stars. For the free parameters, we use three values of Rastall's parameter, i.e. $\lambda=0.00019$, $\lambda=0.00038$, $\lambda=0.00071$; and three values of anisotropic strength, i.e. $\zeta=-1.15$, $\zeta=-1.50$, and $\zeta=-2.00$. We have found that both $\lambda$ and $\zeta$ impact on the increment of the NS's rotational mass within the compact regimes, and also impact on the decrease of the NS's rotational mass within the loose regimes. All mass constraints are satisfied by the NS with $\zeta=-2.00$. In term of the moment of inertia $I$ of the neutron stars, all numerical results match with the constraint range which is based on radio observations of heavy pulsars; while in term of the angular velocity of the stars relative to the distant observers $\Omega$, the mass correction $\delta M$ significantly increases when $\Omega$ increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By measuring, modeling and interpreting cosmological datasets, one can place strong constraints on models of the Universe. Central to this effort are summary statistics such as power spectra and bispectra, which condense the high-dimensional data into low-dimensional representations. In this work, we introduce a modern set of estimators for computing such statistics from three-dimensional clustering data, and provide a flexible Python/Cython implementation; PolyBin3D. Working in a maximum-likelihood formalism, we derive general estimators for the two- and three-point functions, which yield unbiased spectra regardless of the survey mask and weighting scheme. These can be directly compared to theory without the need for mask-convolution. Furthermore, we present a numerical scheme for computing the optimal (minimum-variance) estimators for a given survey, which is shown to reduce error-bars on large-scales. Our Python package includes both general "unwindowed" estimators and their idealized equivalents (appropriate for simulations), each of which are efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms and Monte Carlo summation tricks, and additionally supports GPU acceleration using JAX. These are extensively validated in this work, with Monte Carlo convergence (relevant for masked data) achieved using only a small number of iterations (typically $&lt;10$ for bispectra). This will allow for fast and unified measurement of two- and three-point functions from current and upcoming survey data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incompressible insulating phases of electronic systems at partial filling of a lattice are often associated with charge ordering that breaks lattice symmetry. The resulting phases have an enlarged unit cell with an effective integer filling. Here we explore the possibility of insulating states - which we dub "Quantum Charge Liquids" (QCL) - at partial lattice filling that preserve lattice translation symmetry. Such QCL phases must necessarily either have gapped fractionally charged excitations and associated topological order or have gapless neutral excitations. We establish some general constraints on gapped fermionic QCL phases that restrict the nature of their topological order. We prove a number of results on the minimal topological order that is consistent with the lattice filling. In particular we show that at rational fillings $\nu = p/q$ with $q$ an even integer the minimal ground state degeneracy on a torus of the fermionic QCL is $4q^2$, 4 times larger than that of the bosonic QCL at the same filling. We comment on models and physical systems which may host fermionic QCL phases and discuss the phenomenology of these phases.</description>

      <title>Duality-preserving deformation of 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory with exact gapped ground states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a deformation of the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory that preserves the non-invertible Wegner duality symmetry at the self-dual point. We identify a frustration-free point along this deformation where there are nine exactly degenerate ground states (on a periodic cubic lattice) even at finite volume. One of these ground states is a trivial product state and the rest are the topologically-ordered ground states of the 3+1d toric code. We also prove that the frustration-free point is gapped in the thermodynamic limit. Our model, therefore, realizes a gapped phase with spontaneously broken Wegner duality symmetry. Furthermore, by imposing the Gauss law constraints energetically, all the above features can be realized on a tensor product Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss a generalization of this deformation to the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_N$ gauge theory and conjecture the possible phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Family Unification in $SO(16)$ Grand Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified model for the three Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetries and $SU(3)$ family symmetry based on $SO(16)$ grand unified gauge symmetry on six-dimensional (6D) spacetime. In this model, three chiral generations of quarks and leptons are unified into a 6D Weyl fermion in the spinor representation of $SO(16)$. The 6D $SO(16)$ gauge anomaly is canceled by the vectorlike nature of the model, and the 4D gauge anomalies are canceled by introducing suitable 4D localized fermions at the fixed point. The 4D gauge coupling constant of $SO(16)$ has the property of becoming weaker at high energies.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum nature of gravity remains an open question in fundamental physics, lacking experimental verification. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a potential avenue for detecting gravitons, the hypothetical quantum carriers of gravity. However, by analogy with quantum optics, distinguishing gravitons from classical GWs requires the preservation of quantum coherence, which may be lost due to interactions with the cosmic environment causing decoherence. We investigate whether GWs retain their quantum state by deriving the reduced density matrix and evaluating decoherence, using an environmental model where a scalar field is conformally coupled to gravity. Our results show that quantum decoherence of GWs is stronger at lower frequencies and higher reheating temperatures. We identify a model-independent amplitude threshold below which decoherence is negligible, providing a fundamental limit for directly probing the quantum nature of gravity. In the standard cosmological scenario, the low energy density of the universe at the end of inflation leads to complete decoherence at the classical amplitude level of inflationary GWs. However, for higher energy densities, decoherence is negligible within a frequency window in the range $100\ {\rm Hz} \text{-} 10^8\ {\rm Hz}$, which depends on the reheating temperature. In a kinetic-dominated scenario, the dependence on reheating temperature weakens, allowing GWs to maintain quantum coherence above $10^7\ {\rm Hz}$.</description>

      <title>Colour structure of next-to-eikonal correlator webs at three loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlators of Wilson-line, which capture eikonal contributions, are known to exponentiate in non-abelian gauge theories, and their logarithms can be organised in terms of collections of Feynman diagrams called webs. In~\cite{Agarwal:2020nyc} the concept of correlator web (Cweb), which is a set of skeleton diagrams built with connected gluon correlators and provides a generalisation of webs was introduced. The part of next-to-eikonal contributions to the scattering amplitude which exponentiates is given in terms of next-to-eikonal Cwebs~\cite{Gardi:2010rn,Laenen:2008gt}. In the present article we study next-to-eikonal Cwebs at three loop order, the order at which non trivial Cweb mixing matrices appear for the first time. The methods developed in~\cite{Agarwal:2022wyk} to construct mixing matrices directly without use of replica trick are used in this article to obtain the mixing matrices for next-to-eikonal Cwebs after we establish a relationship between next-to-eikonal and eikonal Cwebs.</description>

      <title>Imprints of extra dimensions in eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals gravitational waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies regarding extra-dimensions have been of great interest in modern theoretical physics, including their observational consequences from future gravitational wave (GW) observatories. In this direction, extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), attracting considerable interest in GW astronomy and fundamental physics, can potentially provide a useful platform for the search of extra dimensions. In this paper, we examine a rotating braneworld black hole in the context of equatorial eccentric EMRI and attempt to provide an order of magnitude analysis for the extra-dimensional parameter termed "tidal charge". We estimate GW fluxes for the dominant mode and determine the impact of the tidal charge parameter on the orbital evolution. We further evaluate the prospects of detecting such a parameter through mismatch computation. We observe a significant enhancement in the mismatch as the value of orbital eccentricity or tidal charge parameter increases; the phenomenon becomes more obvious for rapidly rotating massive black holes. Thus, the study suggests that eccentric EMRI can potentially probe the existence of extra dimensions with future low-frequency detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).</description>

      <title>Ensuring continued operation of INSPIRE as a cornerstone of the HEP information infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The INSPIRE platform -- the most widely-used discovery service specifically tailored to the needs of researchers in High Energy Physics (HEP) -- has become a central component of the information infrastructure for the discipline. Despite this, INSPIRE's continued sustainability is frequently endangered by resource constraints, recently made more acute by the loss of support from historical funders changing their research priorities. If the European particle physics community wishes to ensure INSPIRE's long-term sustainability, the community should secure international support and ensure appropriate funding.</description>

      <title>A Quantal Theory of Restoration of Strong CP Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for relaxing a gauge theory CP violating phase in discrete steps to very small values. The idea is that the CP violating phase includes the magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux which can discharge by the nucleation of membranes. Inside the bubbles surrounded by the membranes, the total CP violating phase is reduced. When the bubbles are produced rapidly during radiation domination in the early universe, near the chiral symmetry breaking scale, they will collide and percolate, melting away into gauge theory radiation and dramatically relaxing CP violation.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal magnetoconductivity in chiral multifold semimetals exemplified by pseudospin-1 nodal points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We embark on computing the longitudinal magnetoconductivity within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, where an isotropic triple-point semimetal (TSM) is subjected to collinear electric ($\boldsymbol E $) and magnetic ($\boldsymbol B$) fields. Except for the Drude part, the $B$-dependence arises exclusively from topological properties like the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. We solve the Boltzmann equations exactly in the linear-response regime, applicable in the limit of weak/nonquantising magnetic fields. The novelty of our investigation lies in the consideration of the truly multifold character of the TSMs, where the so-called flat-band (flatness being merely an artifact of linear-order approximations) is made dispersive by incorporating the appropriate quadratic-in-momentum correction in the effective Hamiltonian. It necessitates the consideration of interband scatterings within the same node as well, providing a complex interplay of intraband, interband, intranode, and internode processes, offering an overwhelmingly rich set of possibilities. The exact results are compared with those obtained from a naive relaxation-time approximation.</description>

      <title>Boundary terms in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the derivation of the Einstein field equations via Hamilton's principle, the inclusion of a boundary term is essential to render the variational problem well-posed, as it addresses variations that do not vanish at the boundary of the spacetime manifold. Typically, this term is chosen as the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. In this work, we propose an alternative treatment of the boundary term within a cosmological framework by employing the Lagrange multiplier method. This approach enforces the vanishing of the boundary term throughout the evolution of the Universe, leading to the prediction of a fluid component that decays as the sixth power of the scale factor. This type of fluid has been studied in the context of the early universe under the name of stiff matter, and it can be related to a scalar field known as kination.</description>
