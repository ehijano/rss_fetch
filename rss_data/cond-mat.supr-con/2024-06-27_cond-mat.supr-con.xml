      <title>Superconducting phase diagram in Bi$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$ thin films$\colon$ the effects of Bi stoichiometry on superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bi${-}$Ni binary system has been of interest due to possible unconventional superconductivity aroused therein, such as time-reversal symmetry breaking in Bi/Ni bilayers or the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in Bi$_3$Ni crystals. While Ni acts as a ferromagnetic element in such systems, the role of strong spin-orbit-coupling element Bi in superconductivity has remained unexplored. In this work, we systematically studied the effects of Bi stoichiometry on the superconductivity of Bi$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$ thin films (${x} \approx$ 0.5 to 0.9) fabricated via a composition-spread approach. The superconducting phase map of Bi$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$ thin films exhibited a superconducting composition region attributable to the intermetallic Bi$_3$Ni phase with different amount of excess Bi, revealed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis. Interestingly, the mixed phase region with Bi$_3$Ni and Bi showed unusual increases in the superconducting transition temperature and residual resistance ratio as more Bi impurities were included, with the maximum ${T}_{c}$ ($=$ 4.2 K) observed at $x \approx$ 0.79. A correlation analysis of structural, electrical, and magneto-transport characteristics across the composition variation revealed that the unusual superconducting $"$dome$"$ is due to two competing roles of Bi$\colon$ impurity scattering and carrier doping. We found that the carrier doping effect is dominant in the mild doping regime (0.74 $\leq {x} \leq$ 0.79), while impurity scattering becomes more pronounced at larger Bi stoichiometry.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in Electronic and Magneto-transport of 2D superconductor NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reports the successful synthesis of single crystalline two-dimensional thin flakes of NbSe$_2$. The XRD pattern of the grown crystal ensured its crystallization in a single phase with a hexagonal structure. The EDAX endorsed the stoichiometry of the as grown sample. To study the vibrational modes, the Raman spectra were recorded, which exhibited the expected four Raman active modes. The resistance vs temperature measurement showed a well-established superconducting transition (Tc) at 7.3 K. The ZFC (Zero-Field Cooled) &amp; FC (Field Cooled) magnetization curves, as well as the isothermal MH (Magnetization vs. field) measurements, have been performed for both in plane and out-of-plane H directions. Distinct anisotropy is observed in both magnetization and magneto-transport measurements with field direction, leading to different critical fields (Hc). Out-of-plane magneto-transport data hints towards the existence of a filamentary state. The density functional theory (DFT) has been used to study the band structure of NbSe$_2$. Although the bulk band structure confirmed metallic behavior, the same for mono-layers of NbSe$_2$ within the GGA+U framework showed a band gap of 1.17eV. The article addresses the anisotropy in the electronic and magneto-transport of 2D superconductor NbSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Switching current distributions in superconducting nanostrips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study switching current distributions in superconducting nanostrips using theoretical models and numerical simulations. Switching current distributions are commonly measured in experiments and may provide a window into the microscopic switching mechanisms. As the current through a superconducting strip is increased from zero it will at some point switch to the normal dissipative state. Due to thermal and/or quantum fluctuations the switching current will be random and follow a certain distribution depending on sweep rate, temperature, material properties and geometry. By analyzing the resulting distribution it is possible to infer the transition rate for a switch, which can be related to the free energy barrier separating the metastable superconducting state and the normal one. We study different switching scenarios and show using simulations how data taken for different sweep rates can be combined to obtain the switching rate over a wider interval of currents.</description>

      <title>Theory of superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian minimal Kitaev chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from a double quantum dot realization of a minimal Kitaev chain, we demonstrate that non-Hermicity stabilizes the so-called poor man's Majorana zero modes in a region of parameter space that is much broader than in the Hermitian regime. In particular, we consider the simplest non-Hermitian mechanism which naturally appears due to coupling to normal reservoirs and is commonly present in all transport experiments. Specifically, such couplings induce exceptional points which connect stable and highly tunable zero energy real lines that are well separated from the quasicontinuum. Such zero-energy lines reflect spectral degeneracies protected by topology and represent the non-Hermitian generalization of the Hermitian poor mans Majorana modes occurring at single points in parameter space. Our findings pave the way for realizing robust non-Hermitian effects by combining unconventional superconductors and non-Hermitian topology.</description>

      <title>A magnetic excitation linking quasi-1D Chevrel-type selenide and arsenide superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasi-one-dimensional Chevrel phases, A$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ (A = Tl, In, K, Rb, Cs), are of interest due to their atypical electronic properties. The Tl and In analogues undergo a superconducting transition whereas the alkali metal analogues show charge gapping of another, not well understood type. We report the results of inelastic neutron scattering on polycrystalline In$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ ($T_c=2.85\,$K) and Rb$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ (non-superconducting) samples, which reveal a column of intensity with linear dispersion from [0 0 1/2] to [0 0 1] in both compounds. The observed temperature and |$Q$| independence together suggest the presence of unconventional carriers with a spin contribution to the excitation. This is contrary to the prevailing model for these materials, which is that they are non-magnetic. The excitation has similar dispersion and $S(Q,E,T)$ behavior as one observed in the structurally related superconducting compounds A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ and A$_2$Mo$_3$As$_3$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), which has been interpreted as magnetic in origin and related to Fermi surface nesting. The connection is unexpected because the calculated Fermi surface of the arsenides differs substantially from the A$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ compounds, and many consider them distinct classes of materials. The new observation suggests a hidden link in the physics between both classes of superconductors, perhaps originating from their quasi-low-dimensional character.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study non-Hermitian Josephson junctions formed by superconductors with a finite phase difference under non-Hermiticity, which naturally appears due to coupling to normal reservoirs. Depending on the structure of non-Hermiticity, captured in terms of retarded self-energies, the low-energy spectrum hosts topologically stable exceptional points either at zero or finite real energies as a function of the superconducting phase difference. Interestingly, the corresponding phase-biased supercurrents may acquire divergent profiles at such exceptional points. This instance is a natural and unique non-Hermitian effect that signals a possible way to enhance the sensitivity of Josephson junctions. Our work opens a way for realizing unique non-Hermitian phenomena due to the interplay between non-Hermitian topology and the Josephson effect.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in metallic hydrogen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity, the amazing phenomenon of lossless transmission of electric current through metallic wires, requires cooling of the wire to low temperatures. Metallic hydrogen is considered as the most likely candidate for superconductivity at very high temperatures, possibly even room temperature. However, as a result of various approximations used, conflicting theoretical predictions exist for the range of temperatures where superconductivity is expected to occur. Here we avoid those approximations and confirm that metallic hydrogen is indeed a superconductor, but this is limited to temperatures far below previous estimates. We exploit the "jellium" model proposed in 1966 by De Gennes, where superconductivity is caused by the combination of Coulomb repulsion between the electrons and Coulomb attraction between the protons and the electrons. We find that the superconducting order develops over an energy range far exceeding the characteristic phonon energy, and that the phase of the order parameter flips 180 degrees at the characteristic phonon energy above and below the Fermi energy.</description>

      <title>Ab initio modeling of superconducting alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing new, technologically relevant superconductors has long been at the forefront of solid-state physics and chemistry research. However, developing efficient approaches for modeling the thermodynamics of superconducting alloys while accurately evaluating their physical properties has proven to be a very challenging task. To fill this gap, we propose an ab initio thermodynamic statistical method, the Extended Generalized Quasichemical Approximation (EGQCA), to describe off-stoichiometric superconductors. Within EGQCA, one can predict any computationally accessible property of the alloy, such as the critical temperature in superconductors and the electron-phonon coupling parameter, as a function of composition and crystal growth conditions by computing the cluster occurrence probabilities that minimize the overall mixing Gibbs free energy. Importantly, EGQCA incorporates directly chemical ordering, lattice distortions, and vibrational contributions. As a proof of concept, we applied EGQCA to the well-known Al-doped MgB$_2$ and to niobium alloyed with titanium and vanadium, showing a remarkable agreement with the experimental data. Additionally, we model the near-room temperature sodalite-like Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$H$_6$ superconducting solid solution, demonstrating that EGQCA particularly possesses a promising potential for designing in silico high-$T_{\text{c}}$ superhydride alloys. Our approach notably enables the high-throughput screening of complex superconducting solid solutions, intrinsically providing valuable insights into the interplay between synthesis, thermodynamics, and physical properties.</description>
