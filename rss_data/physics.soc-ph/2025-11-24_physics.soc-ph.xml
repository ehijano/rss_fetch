      <title>Empirical Validation of Continuum Traffic Flow Model of Capacity Drop at Sag and Tunnel Bottlenecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study validates the continuum traffic flow model of capacity drop at sag and tunnel bottlenecks, as proposed by Jin (2018) and Wada et al. (2020), through empirical analysis. Specifically, after addressing the limitations in the existing studies, we calibrate the model using data from multiple congestion events at several expressway bottlenecks. We then demonstrate that the model can reproduce the observed speed recovery near the head of the queue, and assess whether both estimated bottleneck capacities and locations are consistent with observed traffic conditions. Finally, as an application of the calibration results, we examine the relationship between the spatial changes in the estimated traffic capacity and longitudinal gradients.</description>

      <title>Modeling memory in time-respecting paths on temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human close-range proximity interactions are the key determinant for spreading processes like knowledge diffusion, norm adoption, and infectious disease transmission. These dynamical processes can be modeled with time-respecting paths on temporal networks. Here, we propose a framework to quantify memory in time-respecting paths and evaluate it on several empirical datasets encoding proximity between humans collected in different settings. Our results show strong memory effects, robust across settings, model parameters, and statistically significant when compared to memoryless null models. We further propose a generative model to create synthetic temporal graphs with memory and use it to show that memory in time-respecting paths decreases the diffusion speed, affecting the dynamics of spreading processes on temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Thermonuclear Explosions for Large-Scale Carbon Sequestration: A Call for Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is a rapidly accelerating problem that requires fast and large-scale carbon sequestration to prevent catastrophe. This paper proposes a novel approach to use explosives for large-scale carbon sequestration. Combining the long-practiced method of explosive mining with newer enhanced rock weathering techniques, we propose a faster, greener, and profitable method of large-scale carbon sequestration. This method is applicable for all explosives, including thermonuclear, and can be done safely with minimal anthropological and ecological impact. We estimate a cost of $0.68/ton of CO2 sequestered.</description>

      <title>Signed Networks: theory, methods, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signed networks provide a principled framework for representing systems in which interactions are not merely present or absent but qualitatively distinct: friendly or antagonistic, supportive or conflicting, excitatory or inhibitory. This polarity reshapes how we think about structure and dynamics in complex systems: a negative tie is not simply a missing positive one but a constraint that generates tension, and possibly asymmetry. Across disciplines, from sociology to neuroscience and machine learning, signed networks provide a shared language to formalise duality, balance, and opposition as integral components of system behaviour. This review provides a comprehensive and foundational summary of signed network theory. It formalises the mathematical principles of signed graphs and surveys signed-network-specific measures, including signed degree distributions, clustering, centralities, motifs, and Laplacians. It revisits balance theory, tracing its cognitive and structural formulations and their connections to frustration. Structural aspects of signed networks are examined, analysing key topics such as null models, node embeddings, sign prediction, and community detection. Subsequent sections address dynamical processes on and of signed networks, such as opinion dynamics, contagion models, and data-driven approaches for studying evolving networks. Practical challenges in constructing, inferring and validating signed data from real-world systems are also highlighted, and we offer an overview of currently available datasets. We also address common pitfalls and challenges that arise when modelling or analysing signed data. Overall, this review integrates theoretical foundations, methodological approaches, and cross-domain examples, providing a structured entry point and a reference framework for researchers interested in the study of signed networks in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Circulation of Elites in an Adaptive Network Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Societies experience politically stable and unstable phases along history, whereas political power is usually passed to new elite groups by these changes. Structural dynamics of the elites in a society have been proposed to be one of the core drivers shaping long term behavior. As current models and data are rather macroscopic, the emergence of macroscopic behavior from microscopic dynamics is largely unclear. Here, we introduce an adaptive network model of directed links representing political power and competing political ideas, based on local dynamical rules, only. The model is based on two socially motivated behaviors: the cumulative advantage effect of political power and intra-elite conflict. We observe punctuated equilibria as an emergent behavior and find a phase transition towards a disordered phase. We define an advance warning measure for elite collapse and find that the states of only a few largest nodes are suitable as a proxy with predictive information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue how AI can assist mathematics in three ways: theorem-proving, conjecture formulation, and language processing. Inspired by initial experiments in geometry and theoretical physics in 2017, we summarize how this emerging field has grown over the past years, and show how various machine-learning algorithms can help with pattern detection across disciplines in the mathematical sciences. At the heart is the question how does AI help with theoretical discovery, and the implications for the future of mathematics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Friendship Paradoxes in Network Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized friendship paradoxes occur when, on average, our friends have more of some attribute than us. These paradoxes are relevant to many aspects of human interaction, notably in social science and epidemiology. Here, we derive new theoretical results concerning the inevitability of a paradox arising, using a linear algebra perspective. Following the seminal 1991 work of Scott L. Feld, we consider two distinct ways to measure and compare averages, which may be regarded as global and local. For global averaging, we show that a generalized friendship paradox holds for a large family of walk-based centralities, including Katz centrality and total subgraph communicability, and also for nonbacktracking eigenvector centrality. Defining loneliness as the reciprocal of the number of friends, we show that for this attribute the generalized friendship paradox always holds in reverse. In this sense, we are always more lonely, on average, than our friends. We also derive a global averaging paradox result for the case where the arithmetic mean is replaced by the geometric mean. The nonbacktracking eigenvector centrality paradox is also established for the case of local averaging.</description>

      <title>Easy-access online social media metrics are associated with misinformation sharing activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15186v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant challenge studied extensively by researchers, yet acquiring data to identify primary sharers is time-consuming and challenging. To address this, we propose a low-barrier approach to differentiate social media users who are more likely to share misinformation from those who are less likely. Leveraging insights from previous studies, we demonstrate that easy-access online social network metrics-average daily tweet count, and account age-can be leveraged to help identify potential low factuality content spreaders on X (previously known as Twitter). We find that higher tweet frequency is positively associated with low factuality in shared content, while account age is negatively associated with it. We also find that some of the effects differ depending on the number of accounts a user follows. Our findings show that relying on these easy-access social network metrics could serve as a low-barrier approach for initial identification of users who are more likely to spread misinformation, and therefore contribute to combating misinformation effectively on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Analogical models to introduce high school students to modern physics: an inquiry-based activity on Rutherford's gold foil experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the design and the implementation of an inquiry-based reconstruction of Rutherford's gold foil experiment. The activity engaged students in collaborative exploration using a "black box" as an analogical model of the atom. Grounded in constructivist theory and the Focus Action-Reflection (FAR) model to introduce analogies in the in-class context, we explore how analogical reasoning can support high school students in understanding the atomic structure. Data from student worksheets, graphical representations, and group discussions were analyzed using thematic, phenomenographic, and conceptual metaphor analysis. Results indicate that students were able to develop and refine analogical models, reason from empirical evidence, and engage in critical reflection on the epistemological limits of the analogy. While students demonstrated conceptual gains and collaborative problem-solving, the analysis also revealed persistent risks of reifying metaphors or overextending macroscopic analogies to quantum domains. These findings highlight the value - and limitations - of structured analogical modeling in contemporary physics education, and point to the need for teacher training that fosters epistemological awareness and reflective use of models in the classroom.</description>

      <title>How LLMs Learn to Reason: A Complex Network Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, a V-shaped response-length trajectory, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these behaviors are emergent collective phenomena governed not by neural implementation details, but by the topological evolution of the latent reasoning graph in semantic space. By demonstrating a dynamical isomorphism between a 1.5B-parameter LLM and a minimal Concept Network Model (CoNet), we trace the causal source to the self-organization of a sparse concept web pinned to an average degree of two. This geometric perspective provides a unified physical explanation for the observed anomalies: the V-shaped trajectory tracks the evolution from parallel local skill optimization to global network integration; catastrophic forgetting stems from the topological disconnection of critical ``trunk'' edges; and policy collapse arises from the accumulation of sequential transitions at the web's leaf nodes, where broad exploration abruptly freezes into rigid, high-reward trajectories. Identifying a ``maximally frustrated state'' at the transition between learning stages, we propose Annealed-RLVR, a principled algorithm that injects a targeted SFT ``heating'' step to resolve this topological bottleneck. Experiments confirm that this theory-driven intervention outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks (including Minerva and AIME). By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.</description>
