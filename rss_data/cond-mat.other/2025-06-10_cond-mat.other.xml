      <title>Additive Manufacturing of Lunar Regolith for Reconfigurable Building Blocks toward Lunar Habitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing locally available materials is a crucial step towards sustainable planetary habitation. Lunar regolith has gained tremendous interest in additive manufacturing in the past decades. However, due to the constrained manufacturing facilities and materials on the moon, many existing additive manufacturing methods are not suitable for practical on-site manufacturing. Here, we envision that light-based direct sintering of lunar regolith can be a feasible approach. Instead of directly manufacturing large structures, we hypothesize that small-scale, reconfigurable building blocks can be an alternative to form large and complex structures. To verify the feasibility, we conducted laser sintering of lunar regolith simulants as a proof of concept, following a simple theoretical calculation for direct sintering using the light available in space. Different laser processing parameters are investigated to obtain controllable lunar regolith sintering. We further designed Lego-like interlocking bricks that are reconfigurable for different structure assemblies without additional material. Mechanical performance (compressive strength) of sintered cubic blocks is evaluated, showing a peak stress of ~1.5 MPa. We hope this work will inspire other in-space manufacturing techniques and enable low-cost space habitation.</description>

      <title>Spin pumping driven by magnon-polaritons in a ferromagnet-coplanar superconducting resonator hybrid system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate spin pumping driven by a strongly coupled magnon-photon system using a ferromagnet-coplanar superconducting resonator hybrid system at 1.4 K. Electrical readout via the inverse spin-Hall effect reveals characteristic coupling features, including mode splitting and linewidth broadening, demonstrating the electrical detection of strongly coupled microwave photons and magnons. The magnon-photon coupling strength obtained by combined spin pumping and inverse spin-Hall effect measurements is compared to microwave transmission experiments. Furthermore, microwave power-dependent measurements reveal a decrease in the coupling strength with increasing microwave power alongside the onset of nonlinearities of the superconducting resonator above a critical microwave power threshold.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Fingerprint of Controlled Structural Disorder in Artificial Spin Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the emergence of complexity in disordered interacting systems, central to fields like spin glass physics, remains challenging due to difficulties in systematic experimental tuning. We introduce a tunable artificial spin lattice platform to directly probe the connection between controlled structural disorder and collective spin-wave dynamics. By precisely varying positional and rotational randomness in Ni81Fe19 nanobar arrays from periodic to random, we map the evolution from discrete spectral modes to a complex, dense manifold. Crucially, we establish a quantitative correlation between information-theoretic measures of static disorder and the dynamic spectral complexity derived from the GHz spin-wave response. This correlation provides a dynamic fingerprint of an increasingly complex energy landscape resulting from tuned disorder. Furthermore, thermal probe via thermal Brillouin light scattering reveal significantly richer microstates diversity in disordered states than driven probe using broadband ferromagnetic resonance. Our work presents a unique experimental testbed for studying how the ingredients of glassy physics manifest in high-frequency dynamics, offering quantitative insights into the onset of complexity in interacting nanomagnet systems.</description>

      <title>Dimensionless Hierarchical Topological Phononic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators exhibit unique boundary states that are protected by the topology of the bulk bands, a phenomenon that has now been extended to classical systems such as phononics and mechanics. Typically, nontrivial topology in an $n$-dimensional bulk leads to the emergence of $(n-1)$-dimensional topologically protected boundary states. However, these states can often be gapped out by breaking the symmetry that protects them, resulting in the possible creation of new in-gap higher-order topological modes. A notable example of this is the higher-order topological insulator (HOTI), where gapping out surface states leads to the formation of lower-dimensional topological modes, such as hinge or corner states. This process reduces the spatial dimensionality of the protected modes from $(n-1)$ to $(n-2)$ or even lower. In this work, we propose an alternative method to achieve higher-order topological modes using a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Instead of relying on dimensional reduction, we manipulate the positions of domain walls to gap out the originally topologically protected domain-wall states, thereby inducing new higher-order topological states. These new higher-order topological states can be characterized using a generalized winding number calculation. This approach allows for the realization of multiple (and even infinite) topological orders within simple 1D lattices while maintaining the principle of bulk-boundary correspondence. Our study reveals a new mechanism that enriches topological hierarchies beyond conventional classifications. Such a mechanism could also be extended to higher dimensions, potentially creating intricate networks of topological states and advancing our control over wave phenomena.</description>

      <title>Self-Attention Assistant Classification of Non-Hermitian Phases in Two-Dimensional Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14453v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classification of the non-Hermitian phases in high-dimensional lattice becomes challenging due to interplay of the band topology and non-Hermiticity. The significant increase in data dimensions and the number of categories has rendered traditional supervised learning and unsupervised manifold learning failed. Here, we propose the self-attention assistant machine learning for clustering non-Hermitian phases in two-dimensional lattice. By incorporating the self-attention mechanism, the model can effectively capture long-range dependencies and important patterns, resulting in a more compact and information-rich latent space. It can achieve Altland-Zirnbauer classification with Bloch vector dataset and distinguish the phases of eigenstates' localized behavior with the competition between non-Hermitian skin effect and topological localization. Our results provide a general method for characterizing non-Hermitian phases in two-dimensional lattice via machine learning.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the vanishing EELS cross section in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In transmission electron energy-loss spectroscopy, the cross section in 2D is quenched by kinematic effects once the momentum transfer becomes smaller than a critical value set by $q_z$, the momentum loss parallel to the beam. Our highly momentum ($\Delta q = 0.02$~\r{A}$^{-1}$) and energy ($\Delta E = 45$~meV) resolved setup is instrumental on delivering the unprecedented experimental verification of quenched 2D EEL spectra on freestanding graphene at momentum transfers $q$ below $0.06$\r{A}$^{-1}$. We retrieve the intrinsic uniform dielectric response of graphene from measured spectra by quantifying the kinematic suppression.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in presence of nonlocal exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamical electronic response function in theoretical frameworks that include nonlocal exchange interactions, such as the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction, Hartree-Fock, and range-separated Hybrid DFT approaches. Within these pictures, we demonstrate that any time-dependent electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen formulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in separate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened electronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the stationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a tight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>
