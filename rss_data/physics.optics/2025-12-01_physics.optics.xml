      <title>Photonic Generation and Free-Space Distribution of Millimeter Waves for Portable Optical Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust and portable optical clocks promise to bring sub-picosecond timing instability to smaller form factors, offering possible performance improvements and new scenarios for positioning and navigation, radar technologies, and experiments probing fundamental physics. However, there are currently limited methods suitable for broadly disseminating the sub-picosecond timing signals or performing frequency comparison of these clocks--particularly over open-air paths. Established microwave time transfer techniques only offer nanosecond level time synchronization, whereas optical techniques have challenging pointing requirements and lack the capability of all-weather operation. In this paper, we explore optically derived millimeter-wave carriers as a time-frequency link for full utilization of the next generation of portable optical clocks. We introduce an architecture that synthesizes 90 GHz millimeter waves with a one second residual instability of 2x10^-15, averaging into the 10^-17 range. In addition, we demonstrate a first-of-its-kind 110 m phase-stabilized free-space frequency comparison link over a millimeter-wave band with a one second instability in the 10^-14 region. Technical and systematic uncertainties are investigated and characterized, providing a foundation for future time and frequency transfer experiments among distributed portable optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised prior learning improves structured illumination microscopy resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a wide-field super-resolution technique normally limited to roughly twice the diffraction-limited resolution ($\approx 100$--$200$~nm). Surpassing this bound is a classic ill-posed inverse problem: recovering high-frequency structure from band-limited raw data. We introduce SIMFormer, a fully blind SIM reconstruction framework that learns a powerful, data-driven prior directly from raw images via self-supervision. This learned prior regularizes the solution and enables reliable extrapolation beyond the optical transfer function cutoff, yielding an effective resolution of approximately 45~nm. We validate SIMFormer on synthetic data and the BioSR dataset, where it resolves features such as flattened endoplasmic reticulum lipid bilayers previously reported to require STORM-level resolution. A self-distilled variant, SIMFormer+, further improves noise robustness while preserving high resolution at extremely low photon counts. These results show that learned priors can substantially extend SIM resolution and robustness, enabling rapid, large-scale imaging with STORM-level detail.</description>

      <title>Optical spin precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Period-averaged electromagnetic spin angular momentum is a well-established quantity for monochromatic fields, governing phenomena such as light-matter interactions with chiral particles and spin-orbit coupling effects. In contrast, the spin angular momentum of non-monochromatic fields remains unexplored. Here, we extend the concept of optical spin to the domain of non-monochromatic electromagnetic fields. Through this formulation, we uncover the precessional dynamics of electromagnetic spin in specific polychromatic configurations, including the superposition of circularly and linearly polarized plane waves propagating orthogonally at different frequencies, as well as fields generated by a precessing magnetic dipole. We discover that the dynamics of the electromagnetic spin in these cases obeys a Landau-Lifshitz-like equation establishing a profound parallel between dynamics of magnetization and photonic spin.</description>

      <title>2D MoS$_2$/Au interfaces for enhanced opto-electronic response with sub-bandgap photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer MoS$_2$ is a direct band gap semiconductor with potential applications in optoelectronics and photonics. MoS$_2$ also has a large optical nonlinearity. However, the atomic thickness of the monolayer limits the strength of the measured functional signals, such as the photocurrent or photoluminescence, in optoelectronic devices. Here, we show that photocurrent in monolayer MoS$_2$ can be induced by sub-band gap photons by depositing Au nanoparticles on it. In this system, the nonlinear light-matter interaction in Au nanoparticles enhanced by the localized surface plasmons results in the generation of supercontinuum, which is reabsorbed by MoS$_2$ due to efficient resonant energy transfer. Au nanoparticle assisted photocurrent is more than an order of magnitude larger than two-photon photocurrent in monolayer MoS$_2$. Optimization of the shape, size and composition of the nanoparticle has the potential to enhance the photocurrent significantly with the prospect of applications in the detection of NIR photons, and related technologies including optical telecommunication.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced giant modulation of terahertz nonlinearity from metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active control of optical nonlinearity is essential for advancing next-generation electronics and photonics, including high-speed wireless communications, optical information processing, and nonlinear signal manipulation. However, achieving tunable nonlinearity at terahertz (THz) frequencies faces significant challenges due to the lack of materials that combine high nonlinear responses with strong sensitivity to external stimuli in this spectral regime. Here, we show giant modulation of THz nonlinearity by optically tailoring the valley degree of freedom in semiconductor-based metasurfaces. Mediated by the resonant behaviors of metasurfaces, photoexcited electrons transition into different valleys in the conduction band in response to the driving THz field, with the transition rate controlled by light intensity. Since THz nonlinearities vary significantly with electron dynamics in different valleys, various nonlinear effects-such as nonlinear transmission and generation-can be efficiently enhanced and modulated within a single metasurface using weak optical pumping. With optical energy as low as a few picojoules, we achieve on-off switching of THz third harmonic generation with a modulation depth exceeding 20000%, along with effective tunability of its nonperturbative behaviors. Our approach breaks new ground in active THz devices fully compatible with semiconductor industry standards, indicating a promising building block for ultrafast THz signal processing, all-optical computing, and nonlinear optical elements.</description>

      <title>Integration of 2D Materials in Radial van der Waals Heterostructure Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), exhibit strong excitonic transitions at room temperature and offer a unique platform for exploring light-matter interactions in nanoscale photonic systems. In this work, we demonstrate a compact and polarization-invariant photonic metasurface, fabricated from hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) and based on radial bound states in the continuum (BIC), which are formed by radially distributed pairs of structurally asymmetric resonators. The metasurface employs multiple symmetry-breaking perturbations to support high quality-(Q-)factor resonances within a footprint smaller than 8 x 8 $\mu m^2$ - one-sixth of the area of previous approaches. Compared to established hBN metasurface designs, the radial geometry furthermore achieves significantly higher Q-factors with a reduced footprint. By integrating the hBN photonic structure with a WS$_2$ monolayer, we observe enhanced photoluminescence when its resonance is spectrally aligned with the exciton resonance, accompanied by signatures of discrete momentum-space patterns that identify the orbital-angular-momentum-carrying ring eigenmodes. These features persist over a wide range of excitation powers and show minimal linewidth broadening, indicating robust and spatially modulated exciton-photon coupling. This work establishes a scalable approach for generating hybrid photonic-excitonic states with momentum-space structure, offering new opportunities for exciton localization, valley emission, spatially programmable light-matter interaction in two-dimensional material platforms and compact luminescent devices based on 2D material-integrated metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Universal convolution from wave dynamics: photonic processing and encryption in synthetic dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolution, a cornerstone of signal processing and optical neural networks, has traditionally been implemented by mapping mathematical operations onto complex hardware. Here, we overcome this challenge by revealing that wave dynamics in translation-symmetric lattices intrinsically performs convolution, with the dispersion relation uniquely defining the complex-valued kernel. Leveraging this universal principle, we develop a convolutional architecture of minimal complexity through wave evolution in programmable photonic synthetic lattices, delivering high-throughput, multifunctional capabilities at a rate of 13.5 tera-operations per second (TOPS) for image processing. Beyond convolution acceleration, the kernel's complex nature facilitates the photonic simulation of both irreversible diffusion and reversible unitary quantum dynamics under classical incoherent excitation. Capitalizing on the physics-based reversibility and undetectable phase information, we demonstrate a novel convolution-driven optical encryption strategy. This work establishes a unified framework for photonic computing by grounding convolution in wave dynamics, opening avenues toward scalable, multifunctional photonic processors with high integration potential.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Enhanced Mid-Infrared Imaging Spectroscopy with Broadband Quantum Cascade Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectroscopy offers unparalleled opportunities in sensing through chemically specific detection of molecular absorption fingerprints. Yet, its practical applications are limited by the weak light-matter interaction in the mid-IR range and low brightness of mid-IR light sources. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy addresses the sensitivity limitations by leveraging resonant photonic structures, in particular, plasmonic and frequency-selective dielectric metasurfaces. However, current implementations of SEIRA approach mainly rely on complex instruments and scanning components such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and tunable external cavity quantum cascade lasers (EC QCLs). Here, we present a compact and high-throughput imaging-based SEIRA platform that combines broadband gradient metasurfaces with a radiofrequency-modulated QCL that generates remarkably broad instantaneous emission spectrum (250 cm$^{-1}$) covering absorption bands of multiple distinct molecular vibrational modes. By matching the resonance spectrum of the compact (1 mm$^2$) broadband gradient metasurface with the laser emission projected on its surface through a dispersive element, we ensure that every QCL spectral component is uniquely addressed for an efficient targeted enhancement of the electromagnetic field. This enables us to use a low-cost and room-temperature mid-IR camera, acquiring in a single frame the enhanced absorption signatures of analytes deposited on the metasurface as a barcode image, thus reducing the acquisition time by up to 3 orders of magnitude compared to the FTIR and EC QCL based measurements. Eliminating the need for tunable light sources, bulky spectrometers, and expensive low-temperature detectors, our approach enables high-throughput, miniaturized, and highly specific molecular diagnostics for diverse chemical and biological applications.</description>

      <title>Broadband Low-Frequency Near-Perfect Sound Absorber via Coupled Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective method for low-frequency broadband acoustic absorption. The absorber consists of two concentric space-coiling resonators with distinct resonance frequencies, with the inner resonator characterized by a low-quality factor (Q) and the outer resonator by a high Q factor. The coupling between the two resonators enables efficient broadband absorption within a deep-subwavelength range exceeding 15 times the structural thickness. Numerical simulations, theoretical analysis, and experimental measurements demonstrate that highly efficient (greater than 80 percent) low-frequency broadband absorption is achieved in the range of 198-315 Hz, as well as a 58 percent fractional bandwidth spanning 183-334 Hz. Furthermore, with the outer dimension fixed, adjusting the parameters of the internal resonators enables flexible tuning of the absorption band across a broad frequency range. This work presents a powerful design methodology that eliminates the need for traditional complex spatially arranged multi-resonator assemblies. By employing a single class of resonant units, thin and efficient broadband absorbers can be achieved, offering various application prospects in the field of low-frequency sound absorption.</description>

      <title>Acoustically control of integrated optical microrings: from photonic molecule to Mobius strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microring resonators (MRRs) are fundamental building blocks of photonic integrated circuits, yet their dynamic reconfiguration has been limited to tuning refractive index or absorption. Here, we demonstrate acoustic control over optical path topology on a lithium niobate on sapphire platform. By launching gigahertz acoustic waves into a hybrid phononic-photonic waveguide, a dynamic Bragg mirror (DBM) is created within the optical path, coupling forward and backward propagating light. Employing a pair of coupled MRRs, we achieve strong coupling between supermodes of the photonic molecule with only milliwatt-level drive power, yielding a cooperativity of 2.46 per milliwatt. At higher power, DBM reflectivity up to 24% is achieved, revealing breakdowns of both the photonic molecule picture and perturbative coupled mode theory, indicating the transformation toward Mobius strip topology. Our work establishes a new dimension for controlling photonic devices, opening pathways toward fully reconfigurable photonic circuits through acoustic drive.</description>

      <title>A 160 {\deg} x 160 {\deg} Dynamic Holographic Meta-Projector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holography can reconstruct immersive light fields for virtual and augmented reality by modulating optical wavefront. Due to huge pixel sizes, current spatial light modulators (SLMs) have small field-of-view (FOV) for holographic displays. Despite various methods for etendue expansion, the largest full-screen FOV for dynamic holography is only 70 {\deg} X 70 {\deg}, which remains insufficient for large-scale, high-resolution, three-dimensional displays. Here, we report a pixel-interpolation-assisted holographic meta-projector that substantially expands the FOV by integrating multiple subwavelength metasurface pixels within each microscale pixel of a traditional SLM. Leveraging large-angle diffraction of the metasurface and implementing k-space distortion correction for ultra-wide angles, we experimentally demonstrate dynamic holographic image reconstruction with a FOV of 160 {\deg} X 160 {\deg} -equivalent to a system numerical aperture of 0.985-at a high framerate of 60 Hz, surpassing the temporal resolution threshold of human vision. This system represents the state-of-the-art near-full-screen holographic dynamic display, thereby opening the door to high-dynamic-range and large-FOV holographic displays.</description>

      <title>Integrated polarization-entangled photon source for wavelength-multiplexed quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled photons are fundamental resources for quantum communication, computing, and networking. Among them, polarization-entangled photon pairs play an important role due to their straightforward state manipulation and direct use in quantum key distribution, teleportation, and network protocols. However, realizing compact, efficient, and scalable polarization-entangled sources that meet the requirements of practical deployment remains a major challenge. Here, we present a simple yet high-performance on-chip polarization-entangled photon-pair source on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). Our device employs dual quasi-phase matching (D-QPM) that sequentially supports type-0 and type-I spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a single nanophotonic waveguide, eliminating the need for interferometers, polarization rotators, or other complex circuits. The source directly produces high-fidelity Bell states with broad bandwidth, high brightness, and low noise. Using this integrated platform, we realize wavelength-multiplexed entanglement distribution in a four-user quantum network deployed over metropolitan fiber links up to 50 km. These results establish a robust and scalable pathway toward practical quantum communication systems and multi-user quantum mesh networks based on integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Long-range evanescent coupling through photonic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic molecules support the excitation of higher-order states, which are otherwise hard to access at individual waveguides. In this work, we demonstrate the resonant excitation of photonic molecular states which evanescently couple to single-mode waveguides. We implement the experiments on femtosecond laser written photonic structures and demonstrate an efficient resonant excitation of higher-orbital states, optimized at specific wavelengths and propagation distances. We suggest the use of long photonic molecules as long-distance photonic links, and demonstrate strong coupling for very distant waveguides separated by 127 {\mu}m. We apply this concept to a one-dimensional lattice and demonstrate the excitation of topological edge states emerging due to the third-order next-neighbour interactions. Our findings demonstrate effective long-range evanescent coupling which could be a concrete solution for fiber-based photonic chips, topological physics emerging from long-range interactions, or fundamental studies of initially uncoupled systems.</description>

      <title>High-gain optical amplification and lasing from erbium-doped single-crystal films epitaxially grown on silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip erbium-doped optical amplifiers and lasers are essential for realizing fully integrated active silicon photonic circuits, but their performance has been limited by the low gain of amorphous host materials and the difficulty of direct integration on silicon. Here, we demonstrate optical amplification and lasing from erbium-doped single-crystal gadolinium oxide (Er:Gd$_2$O$_3$) thin films epitaxially grown on silicon. Optical gain measurements on waveguides fabricated on this platform exhibit a giant material gain of $78.3\pm2.1$ dB/cm and an on-chip net gain exceeding 13 dB in a 6-mm-long waveguide at 2.3 K, while a measurable gain is maintained up to room temperature. Continuous-wave lasing with low threshold, narrow linewidth, and large side-mode suppression ratio is also demonstrated in Er:Gd$_2$O$_3$ microring resonators. These results establish Er:Gd$_2$O$_3$ as the first monolithic crystalline gain medium directly integrated on silicon, providing a scalable route toward high-performance cryogenic and quantum photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Narrowband and high-rate entangled photon-pair generation from a high-Q silicon microring resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled photon-pair sources are indispensable building blocks of quantum information processing technologies. Among the available approaches, on-chip microresonators are particularly promising owing to their resonant enhancement, CMOS-compatible fabrication, and wafer-scale integration capabilities. In this study, we optimized the structure of silicon microring resonators to suppress sidewall scattering. As a result, we achieved an intrinsic Q-factor of 1.26$\times$10$^6$ using only standard fabrication processes. The high-Q resonator enabled a brightness coefficient of 3.9$\times$10$^9$ Hz/GHz/mW$^2$, with a maximum brightness of 22.0 MHz/GHz and a maximum photon-pair generation rate of 9.19 MHz. Furthermore, Franson-type two-photon interference exhibited a visibility of 98.0$\pm$0.2%, confirming time-energy entanglement. These results show that narrow bandwidth and high generation rate can be achieved simultaneously in CMOS-compatible silicon photonic sources, advancing their use in quantum repeaters.</description>

      <title>Optical diffraction neural networks assisted computational ghost imaging through dynamic scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghost imaging leverages a single-pixel detector with no spatial resolution to acquire object echo intensity signals, which are correlated with illumination patterns to reconstruct an image. This architecture inherently mitigates scattering interference between the object and the detector but sensitive to scattering between the light source and the object. To address this challenge, we propose an optical diffraction neural networks (ODNNs) assisted ghost imaging method for imaging through dynamic scattering media. In our scheme, a set of fixed ODNNs, trained on simulated datasets, is incorporated into the experimental optical path to actively correct random distortions induced by dynamic scattering media. Experimental validation using rotating single-layer and double-layer ground glass confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our scheme can also be combined with physics-prior-based reconstruction algorithms, enabling high-quality imaging under undersampled conditions. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for imaging through dynamic scattering media, which can be extended to other imaging systems.</description>

      <title>DIC Displacement Measurement Method Based on Improved White Shark Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional integer-pixel displacement search algorithm of digital image correlation method has low computational efficiency and has been gradually eliminated, and some intelligent optimization algorithms have their own strengths and weaknesses. The white shark optimizer has excellent global search capabilities. However, its calculation is cumbersome, programming complex and inefficient. In order to improve the computational efficiency of the white shark optimizer, it is improved by using the Tent map, introducing the dynamic nonlinear time factor, setting the automatic termination condition and adding the three-step search method. The improved white shark optimizer is applied to the integer-pixel displacement search. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sub-pixel displacement calculation, an improved surface fitting method is proposed by combining bicubic interpolation, improved white shark optimizer and surface fitting method. Through grayscale interpolation, the distance between the fitting points is reduced, and the accuracy of search of the surface fitting method is further improved. The performance of the improved white shark optimizer and the improved surface fitting method is tested by simulated speckle pattern. Test results revealed that the computational efficiency of the improved white shark optimizer is comparable to that of the particle swarm optimization, and the search success rate is as high as 100%. The calculation accuracy of the improved surface fitting method is comparable to that of the Newton-Raphson algorithm, but the computational efficiency is much higher than that of the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Finally, the tensile experiment of low-carbon steel is used to verify the feasibility of the improved surface fitting method in actual measurement.</description>

      <title>A 3D-integrated BiCMOS-silicon photonics high-speed receiver realized using micro-transfer printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meeting the escalating demands of data transmission and computing, driven by artificial intelligence (AI), requires not only faster optical transceivers but also advanced integration technologies that can seamlessly combine photonic and electronic components. Traditional approaches struggle to overcome the parasitic limitations arising from fabricating those components using different processes. Here, we report a novel 3D heterogeneously integrated optical receiver based on micro-transfer printing ({\mu}TP), enabling the co-integration of a compact bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) electronic chiplet (0.06 mm2) directly onto a silicon photonic integrated circuit (SiPIC). While previous {\mu}TP demonstrations have focused primarily on photonic integration, our work pioneers the direct integration of electronics and photonics, significantly enhancing performance and scalability. The resulting optical receiver achieves 224 Gb/s four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) operation, delivering -5.2 dBm optical modulation amplitude(OMA) sensitivity at a bit-error rate (BER) of 2.4 x 10-4, a record-small footprint, and an excellent power efficiency of 0.51 pJ/b. This demonstration not only showcases the potential of {\mu}TP for high-density, cost-efficient integration but also represents a critical step toward next-generation optical interconnects in the AI era.</description>

Abstract: Non-classical states of light play a fundamental role in quantum technology. From photonic quantum computers and simulators, to quantum communication and sensing, quantum states of light enable performing tasks that may outperform their best classical counterparts. Semiconductor quantum dots embedded in photonic nanostructures offer the most advanced classes of quantum light sources. Importantly, the underlying physics processes determining device performance are today fully understood, and dedicated engineering projects are currently advancing these sources towards real-world quantum technology applications. We review the performance of deterministic single-photon sources based on quantum dots in photonic crystal waveguides, the approach with the highest performance specs since it intrinsically combines suppression of leaky modes and Purcell enhancement to slow-light waveguide mode. Furthermore, we present prototype data from sources that today are commercially available and with performance metrics approaching the ideal.</description>

      <title>First Steps towards Machine Learning for Prediction and Pre-Correction in Direct Laser Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing using 2-Photon Polymerization (2PP, aka direct laser writing DLW) enables the fabrication of almost arbitrary complex 3D structures from the meso to the submicron scale. However, deviations between the anticipated target structure and the actual print often occur due to physico-chemical processes, limiting the accuracy and reliability of this technology. To minimize these deviations, we hereby present our latest research in developing different neural networks, targeting the above-mentioned aspect. Our networks are trained on several experimental as well as theoretical datasets and show good results in predicting fabrication deviations and (pre-) correcting 2.5D micro-structures. Hence, we demonstrate, that besides conventional iterative correction methods, neural networks are a promising alternative to significantly improving the output quality in DLW. Furthermore, there are no fundamental limitations to transferring this machine learning approach to other 3D printing technologies, as they all face the same challenge in terms of fidelity. To our point of view, the use of neural networks has the potential to enhance the capabilities of this technology, enabling the creation of complex structures with increased accuracy and precision in the near future.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy technique in reflected light using an additional mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of the method of magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy in reflected light (RMCD) has been developed using a simplified scheme without an analyzer, with the use of an additional mirror in the optical system and with the application of the method of phase modulation of the light wave using a photoelastic modulator. An additional mirror reflector, together with the mirror surface of the sample, forms a double mirror located between the pole pieces of a powerful laboratory electromagnet. The presence of an additional mirror leads to mixing of the amplitude ($\Delta R/R$) and phase ($\Delta \phi$) RMCD-components in the amplitudes of the signals at the first and second harmonics of the phase modulation. It is shown that the RMCD spectroscopy technique using a simplified scheme and an additional mirror requires the synchronous measurement of three electrical signals proportional to the amplitudes of the corresponding terms in the expression for the total intensity of monochromatic radiation detected by the photodetector: a constant signal $V_{dc}$ and high-frequency amplitudes $V_f$ and $V_{2f}$ at phase modulation frequencies $f$ and $2f$. The ratios $V_f/V_{dc}$ and $V_2f/Vdc$ determine a system of linear equations for $\Delta R/R$ and $\Delta \phi$ with known ellipsometric parameters $\tan\Psi$ and $\Delta$ of the additional mirror, which are found either from additional measurements using an ellipsometer or directly (in sity) using the RMCD spectrometer itself.</description>

      <title>Optical bistability of continuous-wave and multi-pulse phase transition within EDFL via low threshold saturable absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate optical bistability in an erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) using a low saturation intensity covalent organic framework (COF) saturable absorber (SA). The COF-SA satisfies the free-energy criterion for bistability, enabling switching among non-lasing, continuous-wave, and mode-locking states. Two optical bistability regions are observed, including a distinctive direct mode-locking to non-lasing transition during pump down-sweep, absent in previous EDFL studies. Stable soliton-like pulses and stepwise pulse-number hysteresis further indicate first-order phase-transition-like dynamics. These results show that low-saturation intensity SAs offer a compact route to bistability-assisted pulse formation in fiber lasers.</description>

      <title>Analytical Fresnel Treatment of Double-Slit Diffraction with Multiple Coherent Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical and numerical investigation of double-slit diffraction under coherent illumination by three plane waves: one normally incident and two symmetrically angled at plus/minus theta. By imposing an edge-zero condition on the incident field, we derive compact closed-form Fresnel expressions written solely in terms of standard Fresnel integrals. The framework generalizes straightforwardly to an arbitrary number of incident plane-wave components, enabling intuitive control of the transmitted angular spectrum through interference engineered at the aperture. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of the closed-form model and characterize the influence of slit geometry, wavelength, partial coherence, and Gaussian beam width. We also discuss experimental feasibility and highlight potential applications in apodization, structured illumination, beam shaping, and multiplexed sensing. Overall, the results show that multi-wave coherent illumination provides a simple and tunable route to tailoring diffraction patterns and generating propagation-robust field profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabry-P\'erot based photoacoustic tomography (FP-PAT) is a promising all-optical imaging modality for a wide range of preclinical and clinical applications. However, there exist several challenges in routinely applying FP-PAT in time-critical experiments. Among those, the need for spectral tuning of the laser between each scan position can severely limit the effective imaging speed. Here, we present an interrogation trajectory optimization approach which allows to increase the overall speed in a way that is independent of the type of interrogation laser used as well as the FP quality. Our approach provides a way to tackle speed degradation caused by hardware limitations and simplify the use of FP-PAT systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photons are promising candidates for quantum information technology due to their high robustness and long coherence time at room temperature. Inspired by the prosperous development of photonic computing techniques, recent research has turned attention to performing quantum machine learning on photonic platforms. Although photons possess a high-dimensional quantum feature space suitable for computation, a general understanding of how to harness it for learning tasks remains blank. Here, we establish both theoretically and experimentally a scalable advantage in quantum machine learning with multi-photon states. Firstly, we prove that the learning capacity of linear optical circuits scales polynomially with the photon number, enabling generalization from smaller training datasets and yielding lower test loss values. Moreover, we experimentally corroborate these findings through unitary learning and metric learning tasks, by performing online training on a fully programmable photonic integrated platform. Our work highlights the potential of photonic quantum machine learning and paves the way for achieving quantum enhancement in practical machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Photonic Crystal Bolometer with Ultra-Low Heat Capacity for Scalable Thermal Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-speed thermal imaging in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) is critical for applications from autonomous navigation to medical screening, yet existing uncooled detectors are fundamentally constrained. Resistive bolometers are limited by electronic noise and the parasitic thermal load of wired readouts, while state-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators require vacuum packaging to maintain the mechanical $Q$ needed for sensitivity, preventing simultaneous fast and high-sensitivity operation. Here, we introduce and demonstrate an uncooled thermal detector that addresses these challenges via an all-optical transduction mechanism. The heterogeneously integrated pixel is engineered for minimal thermal mass, combining pyrolytic carbon absorbers for broadband LWIR absorption, hollow zirconia structures for ultra-low-conductance thermal isolation -- leaving gas-mediated convection as the dominant tunable pathway -- and a silicon photonic crystal cavity that serves as a high-$Q$ optical thermometer. Operating at ambient temperature and pressure, we measure a specific detectivity of $1.1\times10^{7}$ Jones and a thermal time constant of $34~\mu \mathrm{s}$, corresponding to a speed that surpasses typical high-sensitivity uncooled technologies by an order of magnitude. While the demonstrated sensitivity is instrument-limited, our analysis shows that the device architecture itself supports a &gt;25-fold performance enhancement toward its fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited value ($3.1\times10^{8}$ Jones). Crucially, because the optical readout is pressure-insensitive, the operating point can be tuned along the speed-sensitivity trade-off. We expect this architecture to provide a general route toward scalable, high-performance thermal imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Evolving disorder in non-Hermitian lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of disorder on wave transport has been extensively studied in Hermitian systems, where static randomness gives rise to Anderson localization. In non-Hermitian lattices, static disorder can lead to peculiar transport features, including jumpy wave evolution. By contrast, much less is known about how transport is modified when the on-site disorder evolves during propagation. Here we address this problem by investigating two pertinent non-Hermitian lattice models with disorder altered at regular intervals, characterized by a finite disorder period. In lattices with symmetric couplings and complex on-site disorder, short disorder periods suppress localization and give rise to diffusion-like spreading, while longer periods allow the emergence of jumps. In Hatano-Nelson lattices with real on-site disorder, the non-Hermitian skin effect asymptotically dominates regardless of the disorder strength, while the disorder period reshapes the drift velocity and modulates its competition with Anderson localization. These results establish evolving disorder as a novel way of tuning non-Hermitian transport.</description>

      <title>TPCNet: Triple physical constraints for Low-light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement is an essential computer vision task to improve image contrast and to decrease the effects of color bias and noise. Many existing interpretable deep-learning algorithms exploit the Retinex theory as the basis of model design. However, previous Retinex-based algorithms, that consider reflected objects as ideal Lambertian ignore specular reflection in the modeling process and construct the physical constraints in image space, limiting generalization of the model. To address this issue, we preserve the specular reflection coefficient and reformulate the original physical constraints in the imaging process based on the Kubelka-Munk theory, thereby constructing constraint relationship between illumination, reflection, and detection, the so-called triple physical constraints (TPCs)theory. Based on this theory, the physical constraints are constructed in the feature space of the model to obtain the TPC network (TPCNet). Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative benchmark and ablation experiments confirm that these constraints effectively improve the performance metrics and visual quality without introducing new parameters, and demonstrate that our TPCNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.</description>

Abstract: We present a method of estimating the rate of entropy production in underdamped dynamics by decomposing it into contributions originating in different non-equilibrium effects. Specifically, a non-zero average velocity, a non-thermal width of the velocity distribution, correlations between position and velocity and non-Gaussian velocity statistics represent different ways in which the system can be out of equilibrium and each give rise to a positive contribution to the overall entropy production rate. We demonstrate that each contribution can be separately estimated from experimental trajectory data of levitated nano-particles subject to non-linear forces. We find that the majority of the entropy production rate can be attributed to the first three contributions which can be estimated from the first and second moments of the position and velocity and therefore result in a useful \enquote{Gaussian} estimate for the entropy production rate.</description>

      <title>Single-pixel imaging via data-driven and deep image prior dual networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-pixel imaging(SPI),especially when integrated with deep neural networks like deep image prior networks (DIP-Net) or data-driven networks (DD-Net), has gained considerable attention for its capability to generate high-quality reconstructed images, even in the presence of sub-sampling conditions. However, DIP-Net often requires thousands of iterations to achieve high-quality image reconstruction, and DD-Net performs optimally only when the target closely resembles the features present in its training set. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dual-network iterative optimization (SPI-DNIO) framework that combines the strengths of both DD-Net and DIP-Net. It has been demonstrated that this approach can recover high-quality images with fewer iteration steps. Furthermore, to address the challenge of SPI inputs having less effective information at low sampling rates, we have designed a residual block enriched with gradient information, which can convey details to deeper layers, thereby enhancing the deep network's learning capabilities. We have applied these techniques to both indoor experiments with active lighting and outdoor long-range experiments with passive lighting. Our experimental results confirm the exceptional reconstruction capabilities and generalization performance of the SPI-DNIO framework.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multi-Objective Wave-Momentum Shaping in Scattering Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation forces and torques are key to manipulating objects with acoustic or electromagnetic waves. An important concept in this context is the Generalized Wigner-Smith (GWS) matrix, which has previously been primarily studied for optimizing radiation forces and torques on single objects embedded inside complex scattering environments. Here, we develop a unified scattering framework that rigorously establishes this connection for arbitrary inhomogeneous, lossless electromagnetic and acoustic media, as well as for controlling multiple objects individually. Variational identities relate parametric changes of the medium to perturbations of the scattering fields, from which the GWS matrix emerges as a natural generator of radiation forces and torques. For a single object, its extremal eigenstates yield maximal force or torque along a chosen direction; for multiple objects, the same framework defines Pareto-optimal compromises among competing objectives and reveals uncertainty relations for their simultaneous optimization. This establishes a comprehensive foundation towards collective and selective manipulation of objects in complex media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pure states are usually used to observe quantum phenomena. In this study, we show that a quantum superposition of spatially displaced mixed cat states can be generated within an optical waveguide via nonparaxial unitary evolution of the initial low coherence (low purity) light beam. It is shown that highly mixed Schrodinger cat states can be observed at a well-defined propagation distance. The importance of the long-term decoherence and recoherence of the original wave packet in observing the mixed cat states is demonstrated. The Heisenberg and Schrodinger-Robertson uncertainty relations for mixed cat states are evaluated. We have demonstrated the feasibility of our method using accurate numerical simulations for the parameters of the source and optical waveguide available in practice.</description>

      <title>Accelerating mesh-based Monte Carlo simulations using contemporary graphics ray-tracing hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significance: Monte Carlo (MC) methods are the gold-standard for modeling light-tissue interactions due to their accuracy. Mesh-based MC (MMC) offers enhanced precision for complex tissue structures using tetrahedral mesh models. Despite significant speedups achieved on graphics processing units (GPUs), MMC performance remains hindered by the computational cost of frequent ray-boundary intersection tests.
  Aim: We propose a highly accelerated MMC algorithm, RT-MMC, that leverages the hardware-accelerated ray traversal and intersection capabilities of ray-tracing cores (RT-cores) on modern GPUs.
  Approach: Implemented using NVIDIA's OptiX platform, RT-MMC extends graphics ray-tracing pipelines towards volumetric ray-tracing in turbid media, eliminating the need for challenging tetrahedral mesh generation while delivering significant speed improvements through hardware acceleration. It also intrinsically supports wide-field sources without complex mesh retesselation.
  Results: RT-MMC demonstrates excellent agreement with traditional software-ray-tracing MMC algorithms while achieving 1.5x to 4.5x speedups across multiple GPU architectures. These performance gains significantly enhance the practicality of MMC for routine simulations.
  Conclusion: Migration from software- to hardware-based ray-tracing not only greatly simplifies MMC simulation workflows, but also results in significant speedups that are expected to increase further as ray-tracing hardware rapidly gains adoption. Adoption of graphics ray-tracing pipelines in quantitative MMC simulations enables leveraging of emerging hardware resources and benefits a wide range of biophotonics applications.</description>

      <title>Tunable dual-band atomic mirror based on subwavelength atomic arrays under electromagnetically induced transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays offer a powerful platform for engineering cooperative light-matter interactions and enabling quantum metasurfaces. We demonstrate that a two-dimensional array of three-level atoms operating under electromagnetically induced transparency can function as a tunable dual-band atomic mirror, where two independently controllable reflection bands emerge from the collective optical responses mediated by dipole-dipole interactions. These resonances yield dual reflection bands with asymmetric linewidths, whose spectral positions and bandwidths can be tuned through the control-field parameters, dipole orientation, incident geometry, and lattice constant. We further identify the conditions under which additional diffraction orders emerge, which delineate the operational and tunable range of the atomic mirror via its collective-mode structure. This scheme provides a fully tunable dual-band atomic mirror operating across broad frequency and angular ranges, offering a practical and experimentally accessible pathway toward reconfigurable photonic elements in atomic-array platforms at low energy levels.</description>

Abstract: We consider a quantum ring placed in a gyrotropic cavity characterized by the energy splitting between the left and right circularly polarized modes. We show that despite the absence of constant magnetic field penetrating through the ring, in the regime of the ultrastrong light matter coupling, the total current in the ground state changes discontinuously with the light matter coupling in the direct analogy with the Aharonov-Bohm ring. We consider the driven-dissipative of the system and show that the discontinuous change of the total angular momentum can be directly probed via the spectral and statical properties of the radiation emitted by the system under weak coherent drive.</description>

      <title>Unrepeated White Rabbit Time Synchronisation over a 300 km Optical Fibre Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White Rabbit (WR) technology provides a commercially-available off-the-shelf solution for time synchronisation with sub-nanosecond accuracy and picosecond-level precision over optical fibre links typically spanning tens of kilometres. Such high-performance time dissemination can support a variety of applications, including position, navigation and timing (PNT), financial transactions, metrology, as well as entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD). Demonstrations of WR over significantly longer distances remain few and far between, particularly in scenarios where intermediate amplification is unavailable, such as stretches of long-haul underwater fibre. In this work, we report the longest unrepeated deployment of WR to date, achieving time synchronisation over a 300 km (51.34 dB) single-span optical fibre link, even in highly asymmetrical configurations, with 99.86% uptime, whilst maintaining picosecond-level precision and sub-nanosecond accuracy. This was achieved through careful selection and optimisation of the components deployed at the link's end points. By leveraging standard telecom fibre and off-the-shelf hardware, our results pave the way for a scalable and standardised timing backbone for large-scale quantum networks, offering a practical route toward time distribution in future heterogeneous quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Response regimes in on-chip THz spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-chip THz spectroscopy enables quantitative measurements of the optical conductivity of sub-wavelength 2D materials by tightly confining THz fields in metallic transmission line structures interfaced to the material. However, because the probed structures are smaller than the THz wavelength, finite-size and environmental effects can strongly influence the measured response. Here, we identify the conditions under which a metallic sample exhibits a genuine Drude response and when finite-size and environmental effects must be considered. We further introduce and characterize an additional regime, the Phantom-Drude response, which mimics Drude behavior but instead originates from the superposition of multiple finite-momentum plasmonic resonances. If unrecognized, this regime can lead to misinterpretation of intrinsic material properties. We systematically show how the Phantom-Drude response can emerge and demonstrate its sensitivity to sample dimensions, transmission line geometry, material shape, and gate properties, providing practical guidelines to avoid this regime in future on-chip THz measurements.</description>

      <title>Persistence of Quantum Triality Relations in Open Qubit and Qutrit Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the complementarity among coherence (visibility), predictability, and entanglement for qubit and qutrit systems subjected to noisy quantum channels. Using the system-path entanglement framework, analytical expressions for all three quantities are derived for two- and three-slit interferometric setups. The study first establishes the validity of the triality relation in ideal conditions and then investigates its behavior under amplitude and phase damping. We find that amplitude damping redistributes coherence and population imbalance without violating complementarity, while phase damping reduces coherence but leaves predictability unchanged. These results demonstrate that the complementarity relation remains preserved even in open quantum systems, highlighting its robustness against decoherence and providing a unified analytical understanding of noisy quantum interferometry in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Petermann factor of non-Hermitian systems at exceptional points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonorthogonality of modes in open systems significantly modifies their resonant response, resulting in quantitative and qualitative deviations from Breit-Wigner resonance relations. For isolated resonances with a Lorentzian lineshape, the deviations amount to an enhancement of the resonance linewidth by the Petermann factor (PF), given by the overlap of left and right eigenmodes of the underlying effectively non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The PF diverges at exceptional points (EPs), where resonance frequencies degenerate, and right and left eigenmodes are orthogonal to each other. This divergence signifies a qualitative departure from a Lorentzian lineshape, which has gained recent attention. In this work, we extend this concept to EPs, and describe how this EP PF manifests in a variety of physical scenarios. Firstly, we identify this PF in physical terms as an enhancement of the response of a system to external or parametric perturbations. Utilizing two natural orthogonally projected reference systems based on the right and left eigenvectors, we show that each choice carries a precise geometric interpretation that naturally extends the notion of the PF for isolated resonances to EPs. The two choices can be combined into an overall EP PF, which again can be expressed in purely geometric terms. Secondly, we illuminate the geometric mechanisms that determine the size of the EP PF, by considering the role of modes participating in the degeneracy and those that remain spectrally separated. Thirdly, we design a system to study the EP PF in a specific physical setup, consisting of two microrings coupled to a waveguide with embedded semitransparent mirrors. This example shows our approach yields a more accurate spectral response strength than conventional truncation. These results complete the description of systems at EPs in the same way as the original PF does for isolated resonances.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate a quantum spin-Hall topological laser formed by an array of dielectric ring resonators endowed of saturable gain. The system preserves time-reversal symmetry, the clockwise and counter-clockwise modes in each ring resonator acting as two pseudospin states that experience opposite synthetic magnetic fields. We consider ring resonators featuring an internal S-shaped waveguide asymmetrically coupling the two pseudospin states. In spite of the non-magnetic nature of the configuration, we show that an effective breaking of reciprocity is induced by the interplay of spatial parity breaking with saturable gain and a Kerr optical non-linearity. This enables robust single-mode topological lasing even in the presence of realistic levels of backscattering.</description>

      <title>Spatially Parallel All-optical Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All-optical neural networks (AONNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for ultrafast and energy-efficient computation. These networks typically consist of multiple serially connected layers between input and output layers--a configuration we term spatially series AONNs, with deep neural networks (DNNs) being the most prominent examples. However, such series architectures suffer from progressive signal degradation during information propagation and critically require additional nonlinearity designs to model complex relationships effectively. Here we propose a spatially parallel architecture for all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs). Unlike series architecture that sequentially processes information through consecutively connected optical layers, SP-AONNs divide the input signal into identical copies fed simultaneously into separate optical layers. Through coherent interference between these parallel linear sub-networks, SP-AONNs inherently enable nonlinear computation without relying on active nonlinear components or iterative updates. We implemented a modular 4F optical system for SP-AONNs and evaluated its performance across multiple image classification benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of parallel sub-networks consistently enhances accuracy, improves noise robustness, and expands model expressivity. Our findings highlight spatial parallelism as a practical and scalable strategy for advancing the capabilities of optical neural computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Huygens' metawaveguides represent a transformative concept in photonic device engineering, enabling unprecedented control over light propagation. This study presents, for the first time, integrated Huygens'-based microring resonators and directional and contra-directional couplers, specifically designed for operation at the 1550 nm telecommunication wavelength. By leveraging the unique properties of resonant Huygens' waveguides, we demonstrate efficient evanescent directional coupling with high-Q resonators, characterized by negative group index and near-zero dispersion, which are critical for enhancing performance in compact, high-performance add-drop filters. The research further explores the implications of these novel structures on group index and group velocity dispersion, providing insights into their potential applications in nonlinear optics and quantum information technologies. Notably, the introduction of a hybrid subwavelength grating-Huygens' contra-directional coupler facilitates backward coupling between resonant and non-resonant metawaveguides, achieving a broad spectral rejection bandwidth. Our findings advance the integration of resonant metamaterials into scalable photonic platforms, laying the groundwork for innovative applications in optical communications, quantum photonics and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of a Prime-Parameterized Fibonacci Spiral-Based Optical Phased Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical phased arrays (OPAs) are a promising technology for realizing fast and on-chip non-mechanical beam steering. In this work, we propose and analyze the performance of a non-uniformly spaced antenna arrangement based on the Fibonacci Spiral. A unique prime-number-based parameterization for antenna positioning and a tunable positional-control parameter ($\alpha$) are introduced. We show that, depending on the intended application of the OPA, by adjusting $\alpha$, we can achieve $\approx$ 56,562 resolvable points with 93 antennas arranged according to the prime-parametrization. To the best of our knowledge, this result exceeds the reported values in existing literature for comparable non-redundant array configurations. We analyze the robustness of this design by evaluating the sensitivities of the three key performance metrics of an OPA: side-lobe suppression ratio (SLSR), field of view (FoV), and the far-field full width at half-maximum (FWHM), to the random disturbances in antenna positions that may occur for practical implementation on a photonic chip.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of optical frequency combs (OFCs) has revolutionised science and technology by bridging electronics and photonics, driving major advances in precision measurements, atomic clocks, spectroscopy, telecommunications, and astronomy. However, current OFC systems still require further development to enable broader adoption in fields such as communication, aerospace, defence, and healthcare. There is a growing need for compact, portable OFCs that deliver high output power, robust self-referencing, and application-specific spectral coverage. On the conceptual side, progress toward such systems is hindered by an incomplete understanding of the fundamental principles governing OFC generation in emerging devices and materials, as well as evolving insights into the interplay between soliton and mode-locking effects. This roadmap presents the vision of a diverse group of academic and industry researchers and educators from Europe, along with their collaborators, on the current status and future directions of OFC science. It highlights a multidisciplinary approach that integrates novel physics, engineering innovation, and advanced researcher training. Topics include advances in soliton science as it relates to OFCs, the extension of OFC spectra into the visible and mid-infrared ranges, metrology applications and noise performance of integrated OFC sources, new fibre-based OFC modules, OFC lasers and OFC applications in astronomy.</description>

      <title>A universal framework for nonlinear frequency combs under electro-optic modulation</title>

Abstract: Nonlinear frequency combs, including electro-optic and Kerr combs, have become central platforms for chip-scale frequency synthesis. Recent breakthroughs in strong-coupling electro-optic modulation further expanded their accessible nonlinear dynamics, unlocking new phenomena and functionalities, but the underlying foundation remains largely unexplored. Here we establish a universal theoretical and experimental framework for nonlinear combs under arbitrary electro-optic modulation by introducing a general evolution equation (GEE) that transcends the mean-field Lugiato-Lefever equation. The GEE reduces to a discrete-time Integration Hamiltonian that provides a frequency-domain formalism unifying strong-coupling electro-optic modulation with photonic synthetic dimensions. Together with a band-wave correspondence linking modulation waveforms to synthetic band structures, the formalism enables programmable spectral control. We further show compatibility between Kerr nonlinearity and strong-coupling electro-optic modulation, highlighting their cooperative dynamics. Our work provides a foundational model for strong-coupling electro-optics in nonlinear combs, opening a route toward chip-integrated, microwave-programmable comb sources for metrology, spectroscopy, and emerging photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantization of the electromagnetic fields from single atomic or molecular radiators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A framework is introduced for expressing electromagnetic (EM) potentials and fields of single atomic or molecular emitters modeled as oscillating dipoles, which follows a recently proposed method for solving inhomogeneous wave equations for arbitrary, time-dependent distributions of charge. This framework is first used to evaluate the physical implications of simplifying assumptions made in the standard approach to quantization of the EM fields and the impact of such assumptions on the results of energy and momentum quantization. Then, the exact expressions for the EM potentials and fields, in relation to the oscillating (transition) dipoles properties, afforded by the present framework are used to quantize electromagnetic fields from single emitters and restore the agreement with the well-known classical dipole radiation pattern, while maintaining the quantum mechanical description of electromagnetic radiation in terms of the probability distribution of quantum modes. Contributions of the present analysis to the understanding of photon emission from excited atoms or molecules stimulated by light or vacuum field fluctuations are highlighted, and possible experimental tests and practical applications are proposed.</description>
