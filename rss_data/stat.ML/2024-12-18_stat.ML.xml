      <title>How to Choose a Threshold for an Evaluation Metric for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure and monitor large language models (LLMs) reliably, various evaluation metrics have been proposed in the literature. However, there is little research on prescribing a methodology to identify a robust threshold on these metrics even though there are many serious implications of an incorrect choice of the thresholds during deployment of the LLMs. Translating the traditional model risk management (MRM) guidelines within regulated industries such as the financial industry, we propose a step-by-step recipe for picking a threshold for a given LLM evaluation metric. We emphasize that such a methodology should start with identifying the risks of the LLM application under consideration and risk tolerance of the stakeholders. We then propose concrete and statistically rigorous procedures to determine a threshold for the given LLM evaluation metric using available ground-truth data. As a concrete example to demonstrate the proposed methodology at work, we employ it on the Faithfulness metric, as implemented in various publicly available libraries, using the publicly available HaluBench dataset. We also lay a foundation for creating systematic approaches to select thresholds, not only for LLMs but for any GenAI applications.</description>

      <title>Adversarially robust generalization theory via Jacobian regularization for deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To obtain adversarially robust models, researchers have separately developed adversarial training and Jacobian regularization techniques. There are abundant theoretical and empirical studies for adversarial training, but theoretical foundations for Jacobian regularization are still lacking. In this study, we show that Jacobian regularization is closely related to adversarial training in that $\ell_{2}$ or $\ell_{1}$ Jacobian regularized loss serves as an approximate upper bound on the adversarially robust loss under $\ell_{2}$ or $\ell_{\infty}$ adversarial attack respectively. Further, we establish the robust generalization gap for Jacobian regularized risk minimizer via bounding the Rademacher complexity of both the standard loss function class and Jacobian regularization function class. Our theoretical results indicate that the norms of Jacobian are related to both standard and robust generalization. We also perform experiments on MNIST data classification to demonstrate that Jacobian regularized risk minimization indeed serves as a surrogate for adversarially robust risk minimization, and that reducing the norms of Jacobian can improve both standard and robust generalization. This study promotes both theoretical and empirical understandings to adversarially robust generalization via Jacobian regularization.</description>

      <title>Sequential Harmful Shift Detection Without Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for detecting distribution shifts that negatively impact the performance of machine learning models in continuous production environments, which requires no access to ground truth data labels. It builds upon the work of Podkopaev and Ramdas [2022], who address scenarios where labels are available for tracking model errors over time. Our solution extends this framework to work in the absence of labels, by employing a proxy for the true error. This proxy is derived using the predictions of a trained error estimator. Experiments show that our method has high power and false alarm control under various distribution shifts, including covariate and label shifts and natural shifts over geography and time.</description>

      <title>BOIDS: High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization via Incumbent-guided Direction Lines and Subspace Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When it comes to expensive black-box optimization problems, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a well-known and powerful solution. Many real-world applications involve a large number of dimensions, hence scaling BO to high dimension is of much interest. However, state-of-the-art high-dimensional BO methods still suffer from the curse of dimensionality, highlighting the need for further improvements. In this work, we introduce BOIDS, a novel high-dimensional BO algorithm that guides optimization by a sequence of one-dimensional direction lines using a novel tailored line-based optimization procedure. To improve the efficiency, we also propose an adaptive selection technique to identify most optimal lines for each round of line-based optimization. Additionally, we incorporate a subspace embedding technique for better scaling to high-dimensional spaces. We further provide theoretical analysis of our proposed method to analyze its convergence property. Our extensive experimental results show that BOIDS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various synthetic and real-world benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>On Model Extrapolation in Marginal Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the use of complex machine learning models continues to grow, so does the need for reliable explainability methods. One of the most popular methods for model explainability is based on Shapley values. There are two most commonly used approaches to calculating Shapley values which produce different results when features are correlated, conditional and marginal. In our previous work, it was demonstrated that the conditional approach is fundamentally flawed due to implicit assumptions of causality. However, it is a well-known fact that marginal approach to calculating Shapley values leads to model extrapolation where it might not be well defined. In this paper we explore the impacts of model extrapolation on Shapley values in the case of a simple linear spline model. Furthermore, we propose an approach which while using marginal averaging avoids model extrapolation and with addition of causal information replicates causal Shapley values. Finally, we demonstrate our method on the real data example.</description>

      <title>The AI Black-Scholes: Finance-Informed Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of option pricing, existing models are typically classified into principle-driven methods, such as solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that pricing function satisfies, and data-driven approaches, such as machine learning (ML) techniques that parameterize the pricing function directly. While principle-driven models offer a rigorous theoretical framework, they often rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as asset processes adhering to fixed stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Moreover, they can become computationally intensive, particularly in high-dimensional settings when analytical solutions are not available and thus numerical solutions are needed. In contrast, data-driven models excel in capturing market data trends, but they often lack alignment with core financial principles, raising concerns about interpretability and predictive accuracy, especially when dealing with limited or biased datasets. This work proposes a hybrid approach to address these limitations by integrating the strengths of both principled and data-driven methodologies. Our framework combines the theoretical rigor and interpretability of PDE-based models with the adaptability of machine learning techniques, yielding a more versatile methodology for pricing a broad spectrum of options. We validate our approach across different volatility modeling approaches-both with constant volatility (Black-Scholes) and stochastic volatility (Heston), demonstrating that our proposed framework, Finance-Informed Neural Network (FINN), not only enhances predictive accuracy but also maintains adherence to core financial principles. FINN presents a promising tool for practitioners, offering robust performance across a variety of market conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Surrogates in Conformal Inference of Individual Causal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) is essential for personalized decision making, yet causal inference has traditionally focused on aggregated treatment effects. While integrating conformal prediction with causal inference can provide valid uncertainty quantification for ITEs, the resulting prediction intervals are often excessively wide, limiting their practical utility. To address this limitation, we introduce \underline{S}urrogate-assisted \underline{C}onformal \underline{I}nference for \underline{E}fficient I\underline{N}dividual \underline{C}ausal \underline{E}ffects (SCIENCE), a framework designed to construct more efficient prediction intervals for ITEs. SCIENCE applies to various data configurations, including semi-supervised and surrogate-assisted semi-supervised learning. It accommodates covariate shifts between source data, which contain primary outcomes, and target data, which may include only surrogate outcomes or covariates. Leveraging semi-parametric efficiency theory, SCIENCE produces rate double-robust prediction intervals under mild rate convergence conditions, permitting the use of flexible non-parametric models to estimate nuisance functions. We quantify efficiency gains by comparing semi-parametric efficiency bounds with and without the incorporation of surrogates. Simulation studies demonstrate that our surrogate-assisted intervals offer substantial efficiency improvements over existing methods while maintaining valid group-conditional coverage. Applied to the phase 3 Moderna COVE COVID-19 vaccine trial, SCIENCE illustrates how multiple surrogate markers can be leveraged to generate more efficient prediction intervals.</description>

      <title>OpenViewer: Openness-Aware Multi-View Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-view learning methods leverage multiple data sources to enhance perception by mining correlations across views, typically relying on predefined categories. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios presents two primary openness challenges. 1) Lack of Interpretability: The integration mechanisms of multi-view data in existing black-box models remain poorly explained; 2) Insufficient Generalization: Most models are not adapted to multi-view scenarios involving unknown categories. To address these challenges, we propose OpenViewer, an openness-aware multi-view learning framework with theoretical support. This framework begins with a Pseudo-Unknown Sample Generation Mechanism to efficiently simulate open multi-view environments and previously adapt to potential unknown samples. Subsequently, we introduce an Expression-Enhanced Deep Unfolding Network to intuitively promote interpretability by systematically constructing functional prior-mapping modules and effectively providing a more transparent integration mechanism for multi-view data. Additionally, we establish a Perception-Augmented Open-Set Training Regime to significantly enhance generalization by precisely boosting confidences for known categories and carefully suppressing inappropriate confidences for unknown ones. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenViewer effectively addresses openness challenges while ensuring recognition performance for both known and unknown samples. The code is released at https://github.com/dushide/OpenViewer.</description>

      <title>Ask for More Than Bayes Optimal: A Theory of Indecisions for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selective classification frameworks are useful tools for automated decision making in highly risky scenarios, since they allow for a classifier to only make highly confident decisions, while abstaining from making a decision when it is not confident enough to do so, which is otherwise known as an indecision. For a given level of classification accuracy, we aim to make as many decisions as possible. For many problems, this can be achieved without abstaining from making decisions. But when the problem is hard enough, we show that we can still control the misclassification rate of a classifier up to any user specified level, while only abstaining from the minimum necessary amount of decisions, even if this level of misclassification is smaller than the Bayes optimal error rate. In many problem settings, the user could obtain a dramatic decrease in misclassification while only paying a comparatively small price in terms of indecisions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Subspace Matrix Recovery from Permuted Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to recover a multi-subspace matrix from permuted data: given a matrix, in which the columns are drawn from a union of low-dimensional subspaces and some columns are corrupted by permutations on their entries, recover the original matrix. The task has numerous practical applications such as data cleaning, integration, and de-anonymization, but it remains challenging and cannot be well addressed by existing techniques such as robust principal component analysis because of the presence of multiple subspaces and the permutations on the elements of vectors. To solve the challenge, we develop a novel four-stage algorithm pipeline including outlier identification, subspace reconstruction, outlier classification, and unsupervised sensing for permuted vector recovery. Particularly, we provide theoretical guarantees for the outlier classification step, ensuring reliable multi-subspace matrix recovery. Our pipeline is compared with state-of-the-art competitors on multiple benchmarks and shows superior performance.</description>

      <title>Boosting Test Performance with Importance Sampling--a Subpopulation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite empirical risk minimization (ERM) is widely applied in the machine learning community, its performance is limited on data with spurious correlation or subpopulation that is introduced by hidden attributes. Existing literature proposed techniques to maximize group-balanced or worst-group accuracy when such correlation presents, yet, at the cost of lower average accuracy. In addition, many existing works conduct surveys on different subpopulation methods without revealing the inherent connection between these methods, which could hinder the technology advancement in this area. In this paper, we identify important sampling as a simple yet powerful tool for solving the subpopulation problem. On the theory side, we provide a new systematic formulation of the subpopulation problem and explicitly identify the assumptions that are not clearly stated in the existing works. This helps to uncover the cause of the dropped average accuracy. We provide the first theoretical discussion on the connections of existing methods, revealing the core components that make them different. On the application side, we demonstrate a single estimator is enough to solve the subpopulation problem. In particular, we introduce the estimator in both attribute-known and -unknown scenarios in the subpopulation setup, offering flexibility in practical use cases. And empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on commonly used benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>A Central Limit Theorem for the permutation importance measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random Forests have become a widely used tool in machine learning since their introduction in 2001, known for their strong performance in classification and regression tasks. One key feature of Random Forests is the Random Forest Permutation Importance Measure (RFPIM), an internal, non-parametric measure of variable importance. While widely used, theoretical work on RFPIM is sparse, and most research has focused on empirical findings. However, recent progress has been made, such as establishing consistency of the RFPIM, although a mathematical analysis of its asymptotic distribution is still missing. In this paper, we provide a formal proof of a Central Limit Theorem for RFPIM using U-Statistics theory. Our approach deviates from the conventional Random Forest model by assuming a random number of trees and imposing conditions on the regression functions and error terms, which must be bounded and additive, respectively. Our result aims at improving the theoretical understanding of RFPIM rather than conducting comprehensive hypothesis testing. However, our contributions provide a solid foundation and demonstrate the potential for future work to extend to practical applications which we also highlight with a small simulation study.</description>

      <title>Dual Interpretation of Machine Learning Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning predictions are typically interpreted as the sum of contributions of predictors. Yet, each out-of-sample prediction can also be expressed as a linear combination of in-sample values of the predicted variable, with weights corresponding to pairwise proximity scores between current and past economic events. While this dual route leads nowhere in some contexts (e.g., large cross-sectional datasets), it provides sparser interpretations in settings with many regressors and little training data-like macroeconomic forecasting. In this case, the sequence of contributions can be visualized as a time series, allowing analysts to explain predictions as quantifiable combinations of historical analogies. Moreover, the weights can be viewed as those of a data portfolio, inspiring new diagnostic measures such as forecast concentration, short position, and turnover. We show how weights can be retrieved seamlessly for (kernel) ridge regression, random forest, boosted trees, and neural networks. Then, we apply these tools to analyze post-pandemic forecasts of inflation, GDP growth, and recession probabilities. In all cases, the approach opens the black box from a new angle and demonstrates how machine learning models leverage history partly repeating itself.</description>

      <title>A Conformal Approach to Feature-based Newsvendor under Model Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many data-driven decision-making problems, performance guarantees often depend heavily on the correctness of model assumptions, which may frequently fail in practice. We address this issue in the context of a feature-based newsvendor problem, where demand is influenced by observed features such as demographics and seasonality. To mitigate the impact of model misspecification, we propose a model-free and distribution-free framework inspired by conformal prediction. Our approach consists of two phases: a training phase, which can utilize any type of prediction method, and a calibration phase that conformalizes the model bias. To enhance predictive performance, we explore the balance between data quality and quantity, recognizing the inherent trade-off: more selective training data improves quality but reduces quantity. Importantly, we provide statistical guarantees for the conformalized critical quantile, independent of the correctness of the underlying model. Moreover, we quantify the confidence interval of the critical quantile, with its width decreasing as data quality and quantity improve. We validate our framework using both simulated data and a real-world dataset from the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C. Across these experiments, our proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms, reducing newsvendor loss by up to 40% on the simulated data and 25% on the real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Diffusion map particle systems for generative modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00200v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion map particle system (DMPS) for generative modeling, based on diffusion maps and Laplacian-adjusted Wasserstein gradient descent (LAWGD). Diffusion maps are used to approximate the generator of the corresponding Langevin diffusion process from samples, and hence to learn the underlying data-generating manifold. On the other hand, LAWGD enables efficient sampling from the target distribution given a suitable choice of kernel, which we construct here via a spectral approximation of the generator, computed with diffusion maps. Our method requires no offline training and minimal tuning, and can outperform other approaches on data sets of moderate dimension.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Global Feature Effects Based on Feature Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global feature effect methods, such as partial dependence plots, provide an intelligible visualization of the expected marginal feature effect. However, such global feature effect methods can be misleading, as they do not represent local feature effects of single observations well when feature interactions are present. We formally introduce generalized additive decomposition of global effects (GADGET), which is a new framework based on recursive partitioning to find interpretable regions in the feature space such that the interaction-related heterogeneity of local feature effects is minimized. We provide a mathematical foundation of the framework and show that it is applicable to the most popular methods to visualize marginal feature effects, namely partial dependence, accumulated local effects, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) dependence. Furthermore, we introduce and validate a new permutation-based interaction detection procedure that is applicable to any feature effect method that fits into our proposed framework. We empirically evaluate the theoretical characteristics of the proposed methods based on various feature effect methods in different experimental settings. Moreover, we apply our introduced methodology to three real-world examples to showcase their usefulness.</description>

      <title>Approximation Power of Deep Neural Networks: an explanatory mathematical survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey provides an in-depth and explanatory review of the approximation properties of deep neural networks, with a focus on feed-forward and residual architectures. The primary objective is to examine how effectively neural networks approximate target functions and to identify conditions under which they outperform traditional approximation methods. Key topics include the nonlinear, compositional structure of deep networks and the formalization of neural network tasks as optimization problems in regression and classification settings. The survey also addresses the training process, emphasizing the role of stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation in solving these optimization problems, and highlights practical considerations such as activation functions, overfitting, and regularization techniques. Additionally, the survey explores the density of neural networks in the space of continuous functions, comparing the approximation capabilities of deep ReLU networks with those of other approximation methods. It discusses recent theoretical advancements in understanding the expressiveness and limitations of these networks. A detailed error-complexity analysis is also presented, focusing on error rates and computational complexity for neural networks with ReLU and Fourier-type activation functions in the context of bounded target functions with minimal regularity assumptions. Alongside recent known results, the survey introduces new findings, offering a valuable resource for understanding the theoretical foundations of neural network approximation. Concluding remarks and further reading suggestions are provided.</description>

      <title>$G$-Mapper: Learning a Cover in the Mapper Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mapper algorithm is a visualization technique in topological data analysis (TDA) that outputs a graph reflecting the structure of a given dataset. However, the Mapper algorithm requires tuning several parameters in order to generate a ``nice" Mapper graph. This paper focuses on selecting the cover parameter. We present an algorithm that optimizes the cover of a Mapper graph by splitting a cover repeatedly according to a statistical test for normality. Our algorithm is based on $G$-means clustering which searches for the optimal number of clusters in $k$-means by iteratively applying the Anderson-Darling test. Our splitting procedure employs a Gaussian mixture model to carefully choose the cover according to the distribution of the given data. Experiments for synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm generates covers so that the Mapper graphs retain the essence of the datasets, while also running significantly fast.</description>

      <title>Extremal graphical modeling with latent variables via convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extremal graphical models encode the conditional independence structure of multivariate extremes and provide a powerful tool for quantifying the risk of rare events. Prior work on learning these graphs from data has focused on the setting where all relevant variables are observed. For the popular class of H\"usler-Reiss models, we propose the \texttt{eglatent} method, a tractable convex program for learning extremal graphical models in the presence of latent variables. Our approach decomposes the H\"usler-Reiss precision matrix into a sparse component encoding the graphical structure among the observed variables after conditioning on the latent variables, and a low-rank component encoding the effect of a few latent variables on the observed variables. We provide finite-sample guarantees of \texttt{eglatent} and show that it consistently recovers the conditional graph as well as the number of latent variables. We highlight the improved performances of our approach on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>One Initialization to Rule them All: Fine-tuning via Explained Variance Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned on a downstream task for a specific application. The most successful and most commonly used fine-tuning method is to update the pre-trained weights via a low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoRA introduces new weight matrices that are usually initialized at random with a uniform rank distribution across the model weights. Recent works focus on different initialization schemes or the learning of adaptive ranks during fine-tuning. Both approaches have only been investigated in isolation, resulting in slow convergence or a uniform rank distribution, in turn leading to suboptimal performance. We propose to improve LoRA by initializing the new weights in a data-driven manner by computing singular value decomposition (SVD) on minibatches of activation vectors. Then, we initialize the LoRA matrices with the obtained right-singular vectors and redistribute ranks among all weight matrices to provably store the maximum amount of information of the downstream data in the newly introduced weights. In this way, only what information to maintain or neglect during the fine-tuning process needs to be learned. We call our new method $\textbf{E}$xplained $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{A}$daptation (EVA). We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks ranging from language generation and understanding to image classification and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and achieves the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain while reducing the number of trainable parameters through rank redistribution.</description>

      <title>A Bilevel Optimization Framework for Imbalanced Data Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data rebalancing techniques, including oversampling and undersampling, are a common approach to addressing the challenges of imbalanced data. To tackle unresolved problems related to both oversampling and undersampling, we propose a new undersampling approach that: (i) avoids the pitfalls of noise and overlap caused by synthetic data and (ii) avoids the pitfall of under-fitting caused by random undersampling. Instead of undersampling majority data randomly, our method undersamples datapoints based on their ability to improve model loss. Using improved model loss as a proxy measurement for classification performance, our technique assesses a datapoint's impact on loss and rejects those unable to improve it. In so doing, our approach rejects majority datapoints redundant to datapoints already accepted and, thereby, finds an optimal subset of majority training data for classification. The accept/reject component of our algorithm is motivated by a bilevel optimization problem uniquely formulated to identify the optimal training set we seek. Experimental results show our proposed technique with F1 scores up to 10% higher than state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>SPARKLE: A Unified Single-Loop Primal-Dual Framework for Decentralized Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies decentralized bilevel optimization, in which multiple agents collaborate to solve problems involving nested optimization structures with neighborhood communications. Most existing literature primarily utilizes gradient tracking to mitigate the influence of data heterogeneity, without exploring other well-known heterogeneity-correction techniques such as EXTRA or Exact Diffusion. Additionally, these studies often employ identical decentralized strategies for both upper- and lower-level problems, neglecting to leverage distinct mechanisms across different levels. To address these limitations, this paper proposes SPARKLE, a unified Single-loop Primal-dual AlgoRithm frameworK for decentraLized bilEvel optimization. SPARKLE offers the flexibility to incorporate various heterogeneitycorrection strategies into the algorithm. Moreover, SPARKLE allows for different strategies to solve upper- and lower-level problems. We present a unified convergence analysis for SPARKLE, applicable to all its variants, with state-of-the-art convergence rates compared to existing decentralized bilevel algorithms. Our results further reveal that EXTRA and Exact Diffusion are more suitable for decentralized bilevel optimization, and using mixed strategies in bilevel algorithms brings more benefits than relying solely on gradient tracking.</description>

      <title>On Foundation Models for Dynamical Systems from Purely Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable generalization, data efficiency, and robustness properties across various domains. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of foundation models for applications in the control domain. The success of these models is enabled by large-scale pretaining on Internet-scale datasets. These are available in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, but do not exist for dynamical systems. We address this challenge by pretraining a transformer-based foundation model exclusively on synthetic data and propose to sample dynamics functions from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our pretrained model generalizes for prediction tasks across different dynamical systems, which we validate in simulation and hardware experiments, including cart-pole and Furuta pendulum setups. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned effectively to new systems to increase performance even further. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of foundation models for dynamical systems that outperform specialist models in terms of generalization, data efficiency, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Stably unactivated neurons in ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The choice of architecture of a neural network influences which functions will be realizable by that neural network and, as a result, studying the expressiveness of a chosen architecture has received much attention. In ReLU neural networks, the presence of stably unactivated neurons can reduce the network's expressiveness. In this work, we investigate the probability of a neuron in the second hidden layer of such neural networks being stably unactivated when the weights and biases are initialized from symmetric probability distributions. For networks with input dimension $n_0$, we prove that if the first hidden layer has $n_0+1$ neurons then this probability is exactly $\frac{2^{n_0}+1}{4^{n_0+1}}$, and if the first hidden layer has $n_1$ neurons, $n_1 \le n_0$, then the probability is $\frac{1}{2^{n_1+1}}$. Finally, for the case when the first hidden layer has more neurons than $n_0+1$, a conjecture is proposed along with the rationale. Computational evidence is presented to support the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Sparse Signature Coefficient Recovery via Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Central to rough path theory is the signature transform of a path, an infinite series of tensors given by the iterated integrals of the underlying path. The signature poses an effective way to capture sequentially ordered information, thanks both to its rich analytic and algebraic properties as well as its universality when used as a basis to approximate functions on path space. Whilst a truncated version of the signature can be efficiently computed using Chen's identity, there is a lack of efficient methods for computing a sparse collection of iterated integrals contained in high levels of the signature. We address this problem by leveraging signature kernels, defined as the inner product of two signatures, and computable efficiently by means of PDE-based methods. By forming a filter in signature space with which to take kernels, one can effectively isolate specific groups of signature coefficients and, in particular, a singular coefficient at any depth of the transform. We show that such a filter can be expressed as a linear combination of suitable signature transforms and demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of our approach. To conclude, we give an example use case for sparse collections of signature coefficients based on the construction of N-step Euler schemes for sparse CDEs.</description>

      <title>ST-FiT: Inductive Spatial-Temporal Forecasting with Limited Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial-temporal graphs are widely used in a variety of real-world applications. Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to extract meaningful insights from this data. However, in real-world applications, most nodes may not possess any available temporal data during training. For example, the pandemic dynamics of most cities on a geographical graph may not be available due to the asynchronous nature of outbreaks. Such a phenomenon disagrees with the training requirements of most existing spatial-temporal forecasting methods, which jeopardizes their effectiveness and thus blocks broader deployment. In this paper, we propose to formulate a novel problem of inductive forecasting with limited training data. In particular, given a spatial-temporal graph, we aim to learn a spatial-temporal forecasting model that can be easily generalized onto those nodes without any available temporal training data. To handle this problem, we propose a principled framework named ST-FiT. ST-FiT consists of two key learning components: temporal data augmentation and spatial graph topology learning. With such a design, ST-FiT can be used on top of any existing STGNNs to achieve superior performance on the nodes without training data. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ST-FiT in multiple key perspectives.</description>
