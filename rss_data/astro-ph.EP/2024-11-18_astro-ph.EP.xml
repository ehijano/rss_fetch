      <title>Assessing the detection of the Yarkovsky effect using Gaia DR3 and FPR catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of this study was to utilize the newest Gaia FPR catalogue containing ultra-precise asteroid astrometry spanning over 66 months to detect the Yarkovsky effect, a non-gravitational acceleration that affects the orbits of small asteroids. Moreover, this study examines close approaches of near-Earth asteroids by comparing orbits calculated using the Gaia data. We used the conventional least-squares orbit computation method available in the OrbFit software. We used the latest Gaia Focused Product Release, complemented by data from the Minor Planet Center and radar astrometry from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We fitted orbital parameters for 446 Near-Earth Asteroids, including the additional non-gravitational transverse acceleration to model the Yarkovsky effect. Furthermore, we compared the results obtained using different datasets: Gaia Focused Product Release and the previous Gaia Data Release 3. We detected a robust Yarkovsky effect in 43 NEAs. As expected, we found an improvement in the orbital elements uncertainty and in the signal-to-noise ratio of the Yarkovsky effect detections when using the current Gaia FPR with double the observing arc compared to the DR3 catalog. We also found nine additional reliable detections of the Yarkovsky effect when using the new Gaia FPR catalog. Including the Yarkovsky effect in the force model can be important to reliably estimate close approach distances of near-Earth asteroids. Several of the detected Yarkovsky drifts already have a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10, which is high enough for their Yarkovsky effect to be included in their reliable long-term orbital evolution, close approach, and Earth impact analysis. The final Gaia catalog may provide a much higher number of high signal-to-noise ratio detections of the Yarkovsky effect.</description>

      <title>The Exoplanet Edge: Planets Don't Induce Observable TTVs Faster than Half their Orbital Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transit timing variations (TTVs) are observed for exoplanets at a range of amplitudes and periods, yielding an ostensibly degenerate forest of possible explanations. We offer some clarity in this forest, showing that systems with a distant perturbing planet preferentially show TTVs with a dominant period equal to either the perturbing planet's period or half the perturbing planet's period. We demonstrate that planet induced TTVs are not expected with TTV periods below this exoplanet edge (lower period limit) and that systems with TTVs that fall below this limit likely contain additional mass in the system. We present an explanation for both of these periods, showing that both aliasing of the conjunction induced synodic period and the near $1:2$ resonance super-period and tidal effects induce TTVs at periods equal to either the perturber's orbit or half-orbit. We provide three examples of known systems for which the recovered TTV period induced by a distant perturbing planet is equal to the perturber's orbital period or half its orbital period. We then investigate $\textit{Kepler}$ two-planet systems with TTVs and identify 13 two-planet systems with TTVs below this TTV period lower limit -- thus potentially uncovering the gravitational influence of new planets and/or moons. We conclude by discussing how the exoplanet edge effects can be used to predict the presence of distance companion planets, in situations where TTVs are detected and where nearby companions can be ruled out by additional observations, such as radial velocity data.</description>

      <title>The democratic detrender: Ensemble-Based Removal of the Nuisance Signal in Stellar Time-Series Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, precise, and computationally efficient removal of unwanted activity that exists as a combination of periodic, quasi-periodic, and non-periodic systematic trends in time-series photometric data is a critical step in exoplanet transit analysis. Throughout the years, many different modeling methods have been used for this process, often called "detrending." However, there is no community-wide consensus regarding the favored approach. In order to mitigate model dependency, we present an ensemble-based approach to detrending via community-of-models and the $\texttt{democratic detrender}$: a modular and scalable open-source coding package that implements ensemble detrending. The $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ allows users to select from a number of packaged detrending methods (including cosine filtering, Gaussian processes, and polynomial fits) or provide their own set of detrended light curves via methods of their choosing. The $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ then combines the resulting individually detrended light curves into a single method marginalized (via median selection) light curve. Additionally, the $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ inflates the uncertainties of each time-series data point using information from the median absolute deviation between the individually detrended light curve, propagating information into the final detrended light curve about the added uncertainty due to the correctness of the underlying models.</description>

      <title>A Non-Primordial Origin for the Widest Binaries in the Kuiper Belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly one-third of objects occupying the most circular, coplanar Kuiper belt orbits (the cold classical belt) are binary, and several percent of them are "ultra-wide" binaries (UWBs): 100-km-sized companions spaced by tens of thousands of km. UWBs are dynamically fragile, and their existence is thought to constrain early Solar System processes and conditions. However, we demonstrate that UWBs can instead attain their wide architectures well after the Solar System's earliest epochs, when Neptune's orbital migration implants the modern non-cold, or "dynamic", Kuiper belt population. During this implantation, cold classical belt binaries are likely to have close encounters with many planetesimals scattered across the region, which can efficiently dissociate any existing UWBs and widen a small fraction of tighter binaries into UWB-like arrangements. Thus, today's UWBs may not be primordial and cannot be used to constrain the early Solar System as directly as previously surmised.</description>

      <title>Surface accretion as a dust retention mechanism in protoplanetary disks. I. Formulation and proof-of-concept simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetesimal formation via the streaming and gravitational instabilities of dust in protoplanetary disks requires a local enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio. Radial drift of large grains toward pressure bumps in gas disks is a plausible mechanism for achieving the required dust concentration. However, recent millimeter disk observations suggest that the maximum sizes of dust grains in these disks are considerably smaller than predicted by dust evolution models that assume sticky grains. This indicates that the grains may be more strongly coupled to the gas and hence drift more slowly than previously anticipated. In this study, we propose a new dust retention mechanism that enables an enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio in disks with slowly drifting grains. This mechanism assumes that a surface accretion flow driven by magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) winds removes disk gas while retaining the slowly drifting grains below the flow. This process is expected to occur when the timescale of gas removal is shorter than the timescale of dust radial advection. To test this, we develop a radially one-dimensional framework for the transport of gas and dust in a disk with a vertically nonuniform accretion structure. Using this framework, we simulate the growth, fragmentation, and radial transport of dust grains in surface-accreting disks. Our simulations confirm a significant enhancement of the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratio when the predicted conditions for dust retention are met. Dust retention by MHD-driven surface accretion flows may thus pave the way for planetesimal formation from poorly sticky grains.</description>

      <title>Modeling protoplanetary disk heating by planet-induced spiral shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the heating of protoplanetary disks caused by shocks associated with spiral density waves induced by an embedded planet. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the dependence of shock heating rates on various disk and planetary parameters. Our results show that the shock heating rates are primarily influenced by the planet's mass and the disk's viscosity, while being insensitive to the thermal relaxation rate and the radial profiles of the disk's surface density and sound speed. We provide universal empirical formulas for the shock heating rates produced by the primary and secondary spiral arms as a function of orbital radius, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and planet-to-star mass ratio $q$. The obtained formulas are accurate within a factor of a few for a moderately viscous and adiabatic disk with a planet massive enough that its spiral arms are strongly nonlinear. Using these universal relations, we show that shock heating can overwhelm viscous heating when the disk viscosity is low ($\alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$) and the planet is massive ($q \gtrsim 10^{-3}$). Our empirical relations for the shock heating rates are simple and can be easily implemented into radially one-dimensional models of gas and dust evolution in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional dynamical evolution of cloud particle microphysics in sub-stellar atmospheres I. Description and exploring Y-dwarf atmospheric variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding of cloud microphysics and the evolution of cloud structures in sub-stellar atmospheres remains a key challenge in the JWST era. The abundance of new JWST data necessitates models that are suitable for coupling with large-scale simulations, such as general circulation models (GCMs), in order to fully understand and assess the complex feedback effects of clouds on the atmosphere, and their influence on observed spectral and variability characteristics. We aim to develop a 2-moment, time-dependent bulk microphysical cloud model that is suitable for GCMs of sub-stellar atmospheres. We derive a set of moment equations for the particle mass distribution and develop a microphysical cloud model employing a 2-moment approach. We include homogeneous nucleation, condensation, and collisional microphysical processes that evolve the moments of a particle size distribution in time. We couple our new 2-moment scheme with the Exo-FMS GCM to simulate the evolution of KCl clouds in a Tint = 400 K, log g = 4.25 Y-dwarf atmosphere and examine the effect of cloud opacity on the atmospheric characteristics. Our results show a generally homogeneous global KCl cloud, with only slight variations occurring in the equatorial regions. The atmosphere is generally sluggish and stagnant, with near-zero vertical velocities throughout most of the atmosphere. Only very small grains ~0.01 um remain lofted in the atmosphere. Our results conform with dynamical theories for this parameter regime, with our model showing minimal (~0.2%) spectral variability at mid-infrared wavelengths. Our study demonstrates that the 2-moment bulk cloud microphysical scheme is a highly suitable method for investigating cloud characteristics and feedback in GCMs and other large scale simulations of sub-stellar atmospheres. Split moment schemes and mixed material grains will be explored in a follow up study.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Cassini Images of Spokes in Saturn's Rings: Unusual Spoke Types and Seasonal Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spokes are localized clouds of fine particles that appear over the outer part of Saturn's B ring. Over the course of the Cassini Mission, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) obtained over 20,000 images of the outer B ring, providing the most comprehensive data set for quantifying spoke properties currently available. Consistent with prior work, we find that spokes typically appear as dark features when the lit side of the rings are viewed at low phase angles, and as bright features when the rings are viewed at high phase angles or the dark side of the rings are observed. However, we also find examples of spokes on the dark side of the rings that transition between being brighter and darker than the background ring as they move around the planet. Most interestingly, we also identify spokes that appear to be darker than the background ring near their center and brighter than the background ring near their edges. These "mixed spokes" indicate that the particle size distribution can vary spatially within a spoke. In addition, we document seasonal variations in the overall spoke activity over the course of the Cassini mission using statistics derived from lit-side imaging sequences. These statistics demonstrate that while spokes can be detected over a wide range of solar elevation angles, spoke activity increases dramatically when the Sun is within 10 degrees of the ring plane.</description>

      <title>A Small Brown Dwarf in an Aligned Orbit around a Young, Fully-Convective M Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A star's spin-orbit angle can give us insight into a system's formation and dynamical history. In this paper, we use MAROON-X observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect to measure the projected obliquity of the LP 261-75 (also known as TOI-1779) system, focusing on the fully-convective M dwarf LP 261-75A and the transiting brown dwarf LP 261-75C. This is the first obliquity constraint of a brown dwarf orbiting an M dwarf and the seventh obliquity constraint of a brown dwarf overall. We measure a projected obliquity of $5^{+11}_{-10}$ degrees and a true obliquity of $14^{+8}_{-7}$ degrees for the system, meaning that the system is well-aligned and that the star is rotating very nearly edge-on, with an inclination of $90^o\,\pm\,11^o$. The system thus follows along with the trends observed in transiting brown dwarfs around hotter stars, which typically have low obliquities. The tendency for brown dwarfs to be aligned may point to some enhanced obliquity damping in brown dwarf systems, but there is also a possibility that the LP 261-75 system was simply formed aligned. In addition, we note that the brown dwarf's radius ($R_C\,=\,0.9$ R$_J$) is not consistent with the youth of the system or radius trends observed in other brown dwarfs, indicating that LP 261-75C may have an unusual formation history.</description>

      <title>Eccentricities of Close Stellar Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbits of stellar binaries are in general eccentric. This encodes information about the formation process. Here, we use thousands of main-sequence binaries from the GAIA DR3 catalog to reveal that, binaries inwards of a few AU exhibit a simple Rayleigh distribution with a mode $\sigma_e \simeq 0.30$. We find the same distribution for binaries from M to A spectral types, and from tens of days to $10^3$days (possibly extending to tens of AU).
  This observed distribution is most likely primordial. Its Rayleigh form suggests an origin in weak scattering, while its invariant mode demands a universal process. We experiment with exciting binary eccentricities by ejecting brown dwarfs, and find that the eccentricities reach an equi-partition value of $\sigma_e \simeq \sqrt{M_{\rm bd}/M_*}$. So to explain the observed mode, these brown dwarfs will have to be of order one tenth the stellar masses, and be at least as abundant in the Galaxy as the close binaries. The veracity of such a proposal remains to be tested.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the exceptionally strong timing noise of PSR J0337+1715 by a circum-ternary planet and consequences for gravity tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Timing of pulsar PSR J0337+1715 provides a unique opportunity to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) with a strongly self-gravitating object. This is due to its unique situation in a triple stellar system with two white dwarfs.
  Aims: Our previous study suggested the presence of a strong low-frequency signal in the timing residuals. We set out to model it on a longer dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy.
  Methods: Three models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small planet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are implemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of posterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic criteria.
  Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is ruled out. Achromatic red noise or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best fits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the presence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions which allows us to constrain its mass to $\sim 0.5 M_{\rm Moon}$ as well as its inclination. The latter is intriguingly coincident with a Kozai resonance. We show that a longer observation span will ultimately lead to a clear signature of the planet model due to its mutual interactions with the triple system. We produce new limits on SEP violation: $|\Delta| &lt; 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}$ or $|\Delta| &lt; 2.3\cdot 10^{-6}$ at 95\% confidence level under the planet or red-noise hypothesis, respectively. This model dependence emphasises the need for additional data and model selection. As a by-product, we estimate a rather low supernova kick velocity of $\sim 110-125 \rm km/s$, strengthening the idea that it is a necessary condition for the formation of pulsar triple systems.</description>

      <title>Permanent Capture into the Solar System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, an interesting region about the Sun in phase space is described where the permanent capture of an object, $P$, of small mass from interstellar space can occur, under the gravitational perturbation of the resultant mass of the Galaxy. $P$ is never ejected back into interstellar space and won't collide with the Sun. It cycles about the Sun for all time, asymptotically approaching the capture set. In addition to being permanently captured, $P$ is also weakly captured. A recent result in \cite{Belbruno:2024} describes this region in general. It has a fractal structure. This is applied to the permanent capture of rogue planets and other objects from interstellar space</description>

Abstract: Mid-infrared imaging of exoplanets and disks is now possible with the coronagraphs of the MIRI on the JWST. This wavelength range unveils new features of young directly imaged systems and allows us to obtain new constraints for characterizing the atmosphere of young giant exoplanets and associated disks. These observations aim to characterize the atmosphere of the planet HD 95086 b by adding mid-infrared information so that the various hypotheses about its atmospheric parameters values can be unraveled. Improved images of circumstellar disks are provided. We present the MIRI coronagraphic imaging of the system HD 95086 obtained with the F1065C, F1140, and F2300C filters at central wavelengths of 10.575, 11.3, and 23 microns, respectively. We explored the method for subtracting the stellar diffraction pattern in the particular case when bright dust emitting at short separation is present. Furthermore, we compared different methods for extracting the photometry of the planet. Using the atmospheric models Exo-REM and ATMO, we measured the atmospheric parameters of HD 95086 b. The planet HD 95086 b and the contribution from the inner disk are detected at the two shortest MIRI wavelengths F1065C and F1140C. The outer colder belt is imaged at 23 microns. The mid-infrared photometry provides better constraints on the atmospheric parameters. We evaluate a temperature of 800-1050 K, consistent with one previous hypothesis that only used NIR data. The radius measurement of 1.0-1.14 RJup is better aligned with evolutionary models, but still smaller than predicted. These observations allow us to refute the hypothesis of a warm circumplanetary disk. HD 95086 is one of the first exoplanetary systems to be revealed at mid-infrared wavelengths. This highlights the interests and challenges of observations at these wavelengths.</description>

      <title>TOI-2458 b: A mini-Neptune consistent with in situ hot Jupiter formation</title>

Abstract: We report on the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of TOI-2458 b, a transiting mini-Neptune around an F-type star leaving the main-sequence with a mass of $M_\star=1.05 \pm 0.03$ M$_{\odot}$, a radius of $R_\star=1.31 \pm 0.03$ R$_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=6005\pm50$ K, and a metallicity of $-0.10\pm0.05$ dex. By combining TESS photometry with high-resolution spectra acquired with the HARPS spectrograph, we found that the transiting planet has an orbital period of $\sim$3.74 days, a mass of $M_p=13.31\pm0.99$ M$_{\oplus}$ and a radius of $R_p=2.83\pm0.20$ R$_{\oplus}$. The host star TOI-2458 shows a short activity cycle of $\sim$54 days revealed in the HARPS S-index and H$\alpha$ times series. We took the opportunity to investigate other F stars showing activity cycle periods comparable to that of TOI-2458 and found that they have shorter rotation periods than would be expected based on the gyrochronology predictions. In addition, we determined TOI-2458's stellar inclination angle to be $i_\star\,=\,10.6_{-10.6}^{+13.3}$ degrees. We discuss that both phenomena (fast stellar rotation and planet orbit inclination) could be explained by in situ formation of a hot Jupiter interior to TOI-2458 b. It is plausible that this hot Jupiter was recently engulfed by the star. Analysis of HARPS spectra has identified the presence of another planet with a period of $P\,=\,16.55\pm0.06$ days and a minimum mass of $M_p \sin i=10.22\pm1.90$ M$_{\oplus}$. Using dynamical stability analysis, we constrained the mass of this planet to the range $M_{c} \simeq (10, 25)$ M$_{\oplus}$.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dark Matter Reach of Water Cherenkov Detectors using Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the first method for water Cherenkov detectors to constrain GeV-scale dark matter (DM) below the solar evaporation mass. While previous efforts have highlighted the Sun and Earth as DM capture targets, we demonstrate that Jupiter is a viable target. Jupiter's unique characteristics, such as its lower core temperature and significant gravitational potential, allow it to capture and retain light DM more effectively than the Sun, particularly in the mass range below 4 GeV where direct detection sensitivity diminishes. Our calculations provide the first sensitivities to GeV-scale annihilating DM within Jupiter using neutrino detectors, showing that these surpass current solar limits and direct detection results.</description>
