      <title>Score-based mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism design framework that incorporates both soft information, which can be freely manipulated, and semi-hard information, which entails a cost for falsification. The framework captures various contexts such as school choice, public housing, organ transplant and manipulations of classification algorithms. We first provide a canonical class of mechanisms for these settings. The key idea is to treat the submission of hard information as an observable and payoff-relevant action and the contractible part of the mechanism as a mapping from submitted scores to a distribution over decisions (a score-based decision rule). Each type report triggers a distribution over score submission requests and a distribution over decision rules. We provide conditions under which score-based mechanisms are without loss of generality. In other words, situations under which the agent does not make any type reports and decides without a mediator what score to submit in a score-based decision rule. We proceed to characterize optimal approval mechanisms in the presence of manipulable hard information. In several leading settings optimal mechanisms are score-based (and thus do not rely on soft information) and involve costly screening. The solution methodology we employ is suitable both for concave cost functions and quadratic costs and is applicable to a wide range of contexts in economics and in computer science.</description>

      <title>Tournament Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine ``tournament'' second-price auctions in which $N$ bidders compete for the right to participate in a second stage and contend against bidder $N+1$. When the first $N$ bidders are committed so that their bids cannot be changed in the second stage, the analysis yields some unexpected results. The first $N$ bidders consistently bid above their values in equilibrium. When bidder $N+1$ is sufficiently stronger than the first $N$, overbidding leads to an increase in expected revenue in comparison to the standard second-price auction when $N$ is large.</description>

      <title>Measures of relevance to the success of streaming platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital streaming platforms, including Twitch, Spotify, Netflix, Disney, and Kindle, have emerged as one of the main sources of entertainment with significant growth potential. Many of these platforms distribute royalties among streamers, artists, producers, or writers based on their impact. In this paper, we measure the relevance of each of these contributors to the overall success of the platform, which is information that can play a key role in revenue allocation. We perform an axiomatic analysis to provide normative foundations for three relevance metrics: the uniform, the proportional, and the subscriber-proportional indicators. The last two indicators implement the so-called pro-rata and user-centric models, which are extensively applied to distribute revenues in the music streaming market. The axioms we propose formalize different principles of fairness, stability, and non-manipulability, and are tailor-made for the streaming context. We complete our analysis with a case study that measures the influence of the 19 most-followed streamers worldwide on the Twitch platform.</description>

      <title>The social value of overreaction to information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the welfare effects of overreaction to information in the form of diagnostic expectations in markets with asymmetric information, and the effect of a simple intervention in the form of a tax or a subsidy. A large enough level of overreaction is always welfare-decreasing and can rationalize a tax on financial transactions. A small degree of overreaction to private information can both increase or decrease welfare. This is because there are two competing externalities: an information externality, due to the informational role of prices, and a pecuniary externality, due to the allocative role of prices. When the information externality prevails on the pecuniary externality, the loading on private information in agents' trades is too small compared to the welfare optimum: in this case, a small degree of overreaction is welfare-improving.</description>

      <title>SACR\'E BLEU: Self-Assessed Creator Royalties \'Enforced by Balancing Liquidity Estimation &amp; Utility (A formal definition and analysis of Ethereum Request for Comment ERC-7526)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The secondary market for Ethereum non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has resulted in over $1.8bn being paid to creators in the form of a sales tax commonly called creator royalties. This was despite royalty payments being enforced by no more than social contract alone. Predictably, such an incentive structure led to zero-royalty alternatives becoming abundant and payments dwindled. A purely programmatic solution to royalty enforcement is hampered by the prevailing NFT standard, ERC-721, which is ignorant of sale values and royalty enforcement therefore relies on (potentially dishonest) third parties. We thus introduce an incentive-compatible mechanism for which there is a single rationalisable solution, in which royalties are paid in full, while maintaining full ERC-721 compatibility. The mechanism constitutes the core of ERC-7526.</description>

      <title>Strategic Bidding in Knapsack Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Knapsack Problem a set of indivisible objects, each with different values and sizes, must be packed into a fixed-size knapsack to maximize the total value. The knapsack problem is known to be an NP-hard problem even when there is full information regarding values and sizes. In many real-world situations, however, the values of objects are private information, which adds another dimension of complexity. In this paper we examine the knapsack problem with private information by investigating three practical auctions as possible candidates for payment rules in a setup where the knapsack owner sells the space to object owners via an auction. The three auctions are the discriminatory price, the generalized second-price and the uniform-price auctions. Using a Greedy algorithm for allocating objects, we analyze bidding behavior, revenue and efficiency of these three auctions using theory, lab experiments, and AI-enriched simulations. Our results suggest that the uniform-price auction has the highest level of truthful bidding and efficiency while the discriminatory price and the generalized second-price auctions are superior in terms of revenue generation.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Information Disclosure in Optimal Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a joint design problem where a seller can design both the signal structures for the agents to learn their values, and the allocation and payment rules for selling the item. In his seminal work, Myerson (1981) shows how to design the optimal auction with exogenous signals. We show that the problem becomes NP-hard when the seller also has the ability to design the signal structures. Our main result is a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for computing the optimal joint design with at most an $\epsilon$ multiplicative loss in expected revenue. Moreover, we show that in our joint design problem, the seller can significantly reduce the information rent of the agents by providing partial information, which ensures a revenue that is at least $1 - \frac{1}{e}$ of the optimal welfare for all valuation distributions.</description>

      <title>Quantal Response Equilibrium and Rationalizability: Inside the Black Box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.16081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to connect epistemic and behavioral game theory by examining the epistemic foundations of quantal response equilibrium (QRE) in static games. We focus on how much information agents possess about the probability distributions of idiosyncratic payoff shocks, in addition to the standard assumptions of rationality and common belief in rationality. When these distributions are transparent, we obtain a solution concept called $\Delta^p$-rationalizability, which includes action distributions derived from QRE; we also give a condition under which this relationship holds true in reverse. When agents only have common belief in the monotonicity of these distributions (for example, extreme value distributions), we obtain another solution concept called $\Delta^M$-rationalizability, which includes action distributions derived from rank-dependent choice equilibrium, a parameter-free variant of QRE. Our solution concepts also provide insights for interpreting experimental and empirical data.</description>

      <title>Two-Person adversarial games are zero-sum: A resolution of the Luce-Raiffa-Aumann (LRA) conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter: (i) reformulates the theorems of Adler-Daskalakis-Papadimitriou (2009) and Raimondo (2023) on two-player adversarial games as a generalized result with a simplified proof, (ii) forges connections to work on strategically zero-sum games by Moulin-Vial (1978), and on axiomatizations of multi-linear utilities of n-person games by Fishburn-Roberts (1976, 1978). The simplification and the connections on offer give prominence to two-person zero-sum games studied by Aumann (1961), Shapley (1964) and Rosenthal (1974), and also to recent algorithmic work in computer science. We give a productive reorientation to the subject by bringing the two communities together under the rubric of adversarial games.</description>

      <title>An unexpected stochastic dominance: Pareto distributions, dependence, and diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08471v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the perhaps surprising inequality that the weighted average of independent and identically distributed Pareto random variables with infinite mean is larger than one such random variable in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance. This result holds for more general models including super-Pareto distributions, negative dependence, and triggering events, and yields superadditivity of the risk measure Value-at-Risk for these models.</description>
