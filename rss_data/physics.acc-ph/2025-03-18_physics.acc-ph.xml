      <title>Orbit-Controlled Generation of Two-color Attosecond Mode-locked Free-electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of attosecond X-ray pulses has garnered significant attention within the X-ray free-electron laser (FEL) community due to their potential for ultrafast time-resolved studies. Attosecond pulses enable the investigation of electron dynamics with unprecedented temporal resolution, opening new avenues in fields such as quantum control and ultrafast spectroscopy. In an FEL, the mode-locking technique synthesizes a comb of longitudinal modes by applying spatiotemporal shifts between the co-propagating radiation and the electron bunch. We propose a novel scheme for generating two-color attosecond mode-locked FEL pulses via orbit control in two-stage mode-locked undulators. Specifically, a chicane with a wiggler inserted in the middle generates periodic temporal-transverse modulation in the electron beam. In this configuration, the low-energy and high-energy components of the beam lase in separate undulator sections, each producing attosecond mode-locked FEL pulses. Using a representative set of realistic parameters, three-dimensional simulations show that trains of 250-attosecond soft X-ray pulses at the gigawatt level can be independently generated in each undulator section. The interval between the two pulse trains can be adjusted over a range of several hundred femtoseconds.</description>

      <title>Integration of Machine Learning-Based Plasma Acceleration Simulations into Geant4: A Case Study with the PALLAS Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the development and integration of a Machine Learning (ML)-based surrogate model, trained on Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of laser-driven plasma wakefield acceleration source of electrons, into Geant4 simulation toolkit. Our model enables the generation and tracking of plasma-accelerated beams within complete experimental setups, unifying plasma acceleration and Monte Carlo-based simulations, which significantly reduces their complexity and computational cost.
  Our implementation focuses on the PALLAS laser-plasma accelerator test facility, integrating its full experimental setup into Geant4. We describe the ML model, its integration into Geant4, and key simulation results, demonstrating the feasibility of start-to-end simulations of plasma acceleration facilities and applications within a unified framework.</description>
