      <title>NeutrSHINE: a high repetition rate ultrafast neutron source driven by SHINE electron beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrons serve as unique probes for exploring the microscopic structure of matter, with the performance of a neutron source fundamentally governing the depth of scientific exploration and the breadth of industrial applicability. To address application demands including nuclear data measurement in the ultra-high-energy region, fundamental particle physics research, highly efficient non-destructive neutron testing, and extreme environment simulation, an ultrafast neutron source driven by the 8 GeV electron beam from the Shanghai high-repetition-rate extreme light facility (SHINE) was conceptually proposed, named NeutrSHINE. Using multidisciplinary simulation tools, key neutronic parameters, thermal behavior of high-power neutron targets, and the factors affecting the time resolution of the source were analyzed. The results affirm the technical feasibility and promising application prospects of the NeutrSHINE concept.</description>

      <title>A Core Ontology for Particle Accelerators: Interoperable Data and Workflows Across Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a small, shared core ontology for particle accelerators that provides a semantic backbone for interoperable data and workflows across facilities. The ontology names key device types, signals, parameters, and regions, and relates them through explicit properties (e.g., hasSetpoint, hasReadback, partOf). Each site contributes a lightweight facility bundle, a profile that maps local conventions into the shared vocabulary plus data slices that instantiate those mappings, without renaming channel addresses or changing existing systems. Using standard W3C technologies, the approach supports both sparse and rich descriptions. We demonstrate the idea on two beamline segments at different laboratories. A single semantic query is expressed once and evaluated against both knowledge bases, returning the locally correct PVs. The ontology thereby enables not only portable workflows but also interoperable data, since measurements and catalogs are annotated with shared semantics rather than facility-specific names. The framework complements, rather than replaces, existing middle layers and lattice/data standards, and it creates a stable foundation for reusable tools and agentic workflows.</description>

      <title>Impact of local bunching factors in single-pass THz free electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In simulations for modern free-electron laser (FEL), shot noise plays a crucial role. While it is inversely proportional to the number of electrons, shot noise is typically modeled using macroparticles, whose bunching factors correspond to those of the much larger number of electrons. For short-wavelength FELs, the macroparticles are assumed to be uniform over the scale of the resonant wavelength, since shot noise dominates the initial radiation - for instance, in the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) regime. In this paper, we show that this assumption does not hold at longer wavelengths, particularly in the THz range, where the bunch current profile is not uniform over the scale of the resonant wavelength. Instead, the current profile dominates the initial bunching factors, which can be several orders of magnitude higher than shot noise. The slice-based bunching factors and bunching phases are derived for Gaussian distributions and compared with shot noise under the assumption that the current within each slice remains constant. Using the THz FEL at the photoinjector test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) as a case study, the influence of the current profile has been benchmarked through simulations under very low bunch charge, where the real number of electrons can be modeled using the Genesis1.3 code. Additional simulations with the nominal working parameters of PITZ THz FEL have been compared with experimental data, indicating better agreement when the actual current profile is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Energy recovery twin linear $e^+e^-$, $e^-e^-$ colliders (ERLC ) with high luminosities and accelerating gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09758v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the $e^+e^-$ high-energy superconducting linear collider with energy recovery (ERLC) and multiple use of beams has been proposed, using twin RF structures to avoid parasitic collisions in linacs. Such a collider can operate in either pulsed (with duty factor DF) or CW (continuous) mode, if sufficient power is available, with a luminosity of ${\cal O}(10^{36})$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at $2E_0=$250-500 GeV. In this paper, we point out that the luminosity of the ERLC operating in the pulsed mode does not depend on the accelerating gradient G (for the same total power), allowing the ERLC to operate with the highest available accelerating gradients. This is also true for the CW mode at a power significantly exceeding the threshold power for this mode. The $e^+e^-$ luminosity depends on the quality factor of cavities as $L\propto Q_0^{1/2}$. We also consider for the first time a twin $e^-e^-$ collider with energy recovery and estimate its achievable luminosity. Such an $e^-e^-$ collider is simpler than an $e^+e^-$ one. It does not require beam recycling since electrons can be produced anew each time. The $e^-e^-$ luminosity depends on the quality factor as $L\propto Q_0^{1/4}$. RF travelling-wave structures allow higher gradients and reduced thermal loading. It is shown that an ERLC with an accelerating gradient of $G=40$ MeV/m can be operated in CW mode with $L_{e^+e^-} =$ (1-2.5)\,$10^{36}$ and $L_{e^-e^-} =$ (3-7)$10^{36}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for reasonable total powers of 150 and 300 MW at $2E_0=250$ and 500 GeV, respectively. Such a machine is a promising candidate for a Higgs factory.</description>

      <title>Problems of studying $\gamma \gamma \to \gamma\gamma$ scattering at $e^+e^-$, $e^-e^-$ and $\gamma\gamma$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of elastic scattering of photons (scattering of light by light) has attracted much attention in recent years. It goes through a loop where all the charged particles contribute to the cross section. To date, this $\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$ process has been experimentally studied in the Delbr\"{u}ck scattering and splitting of photons in the Coulomb field of the nucleus, as well as at the LHC in the scattering of virtual photons in ion-ion collisions. Hopes for further study of this process are associated with high-luminosity $e^+e^-$ colliders (SuperKEKb, FCC, CEPC, ILC, CLIC) and gamma-gamma colliders based on the Compton scattering of laser photons on electrons. In this article, we show that there are some very serious background processes where the annihilation of electrons and positrons (real and virtual) produces a pair of photons flying into the detector, and the the remaining products fly away from the detector at small angles.</description>
