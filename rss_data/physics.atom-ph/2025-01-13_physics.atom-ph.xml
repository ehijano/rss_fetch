      <title>A Magneto-Optical Trap of Titanium Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize laser cooling and trapping of titanium (Ti) atoms in a mangeto-optical trap (MOT). While Ti does not possess a transition suitable for laser cooling out of its $\mathrm{3d^24s^2}$ $\mathrm{a^3F}$ ground term, there is such a transition, at an optical wavelength of $\lambda=498\mathrm{nm}$, from the long-lived $\mathrm{3d^3(^4F)4s}$ $\mathrm{a^5F_5}$ metastable state to the $\mathrm{3d^3(^4F)4p}$ $\mathrm{y^5G^o_6}$ excited state. Without the addition of any repumping light, we observe MOTs of metastable $\mathrm{^{46}Ti}$, $\mathrm{^{48}Ti}$, and $\mathrm{^{50}Ti}$, the three stable nuclear-spin-zero bosonic isotopes of Ti. While MOTs can be observed when loaded directly from our Ti sublimation source, optical pumping of ground term atoms to the $\mathrm{a^5F_5}$ state increases the loading rate by a factor of 120, and the steady-state MOT atom number by a factor of 30. At steady state, the MOT of $\mathrm{^{48}Ti}$ holds up to $8.30(26)\times10^5$ atoms at a maximum density of $1.3(4)\times10^{11}\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and at a temperature of $90(15)\mathrm{\mu K}$. By measuring the decay of the MOT upon suddenly reducing the loading rate, we place upper bounds on the leakage branching ratio of the cooling transition $(\leq2.5\times 10^{-6})$ and the two-body loss coefficient $(\leq2\times10^{-10}\mathrm{cm}^3\mathrm{s}^{-1})$. Our approach to laser cooling Ti can be applied to other transition metals, enabling a significant expansion of the elements that can be laser cooled.</description>

      <title>Rotational-hyperfine cooling of $^{205}$TlF in a cryogenic beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of CeNTREX (Cold Molecule Nuclear Time-Reversal Experiment) is to search for time-reversal symmetry violation in the thallium nucleus, by measuring the Schiff moment of $^{205}$Tl in the polar molecule thallium fluoride (TlF). CeNTREX uses a cryogenic beam of TlF with a rotational temperature of 6.3(2) K. This results in population spread over dozens of rotational and hyperfine sublevels of TlF, while only a single level is useful for the Schiff moment measurement. Here we present a protocol for cooling the rotational and hyperfine degrees of freedom in the CeNTREX beam, transferring the majority of the Boltzmann distribution into a single rotational and hyperfine sublevel by using a single ultraviolet laser and a pair of microwave beams. We achieve a factor of $20.1(4)$ gain in the population of the $J=0$, $F=0$ hyperfine sublevel of the TlF ground state.</description>

      <title>Chemistry in a cryogenic buffer gas cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic buffer gas sources are ubiquitous for producing cold, collimated molecular beams for quantum science, chemistry, and precision measurements. The molecules are typically produced by laser ablating a metal target in the presence of a donor gas, where the radical of interest emerges among the reaction products due to a barrier-free process or under thermal or optical excitation. High-barrier reactions, such as between calcium and molecular hydrogen, should be precluded. Here, we study chemical reactions between Ca and three hydrogen isotopologues H$_2$, D$_2$, and HD in a cryogenic cell with helium buffer gas. Remarkably, we observe that H$_2$ can serve as both a reactant and a buffer gas, far outperforming D$_2$ and HD. Our results demonstrate a robust method for generating cold beams of alkaline-earth-metal hydrides for laser cooling and trapping. The observations are complemented by a reaction model, yielding qualitative agreement with the experiment.</description>

      <title>The C$^1\Pi_{\mathrm{u}}$ state of potassium dimer revisited: an~extensive study by polarisation labelling spectroscopy method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarisation labelling spectroscopy technique was applied to study the C$^1\Pi_{\mathrm{u}}$ $\leftarrow$ X$^1\Sigma^{+}_{\mathrm{g}}$ band system in potassium dimer. About 1100 new rotationally resolved molecular lines were measured in the $22100-24100$~cm$^{-1}$ spectral range. Perturbations of the lowest vibrational levels of the C state were localised and their origin discussed. A set of Dunham coefficients was deduced to fit the unperturbed levels of the C$^1\Pi_{\mathrm{u}}$ state with $0 \le v \le 38$ and $18 \le J \le 101$ and the potential energy curve of the state was constructed.</description>

      <title>Theory for the Rydberg states of helium: Comparison with experiment for the $1s24p\;^1P_1$ state ($n=24$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the ionization energies of the Rydberg $^1P$ states of helium for principal quantum number $n = 24$ and higher present a new challenge to theoretical atomic physics. A long-standing obstacle to high precision atomic theory for three-body systems is a rapid loss of accuracy for variational calculations with increasing principal quantum number $n$. We show that this problem can be overcome with the use of a ``triple" basis set in Hylleraas coordinates. Nonrelativistic energies accurate to 23 significant figures are obtained with basis sets of relatively modest size (6744 terms). Relativistic and quantum electrodynamic effects are calculated, including an estimate of terms of order $m\alpha^6$ from a $1/n^3$ extrapolation, resulting in an estimated accuracy of $\pm$1 kHz. The calculated ionization energy of 5704 980.348(1) MHz is in excellent agreement with the experimental value 5704 980.312(95) MHz. These results establish the ionization energy of the $1s24p\;^1P_1$ state as an absolute point of reference for transitions to lower-lying states, and they confirm an $11\sigma$ disagreement between theory and experiment in the triplet spectrum of helium. Results are also given for the $1s24p\;^3P_J$ states in agreement with a recent experiment on the triplet Rydberg series, thereby confirming a discrepancy of of $0.468 \pm 0.055$ MHz for the ionization energy of the $1s2s\;^3S_1$ state.</description>

      <title>Plane-selective coherent manipulations of nuclear spin qubits in a three-dimensional optical tweezer array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the central challenges for a practical fault-tolerant quantum computer is scalability. A three-dimensional structure of optical tweezer arrays offers the potential for scaling up neutral atom processors. However, coherent local operations, essential for quantum error correction, have yet to be explored for this platform. Here, we demonstrate plane-by-plane initialization of nuclear spin qubits of ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$ atoms in a three-dimensional atom array and execute local coherent qubit rotations that act only on specific planes, by exploiting the plane-selective excitation of the atoms from the ${}^1S_0$ to the ${}^3P_2$ state. This plane-selective manipulation technique paves the way for quantum computing and quantum simulation in three-dimensional multilayer architectures.</description>

      <title>Variational simulation of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model on a neutral atom quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using the Variational-Quantum-Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm on a neutral atom quantum computer. We test the ground-state energy of spin systems with up to 15 spins. Two different encoding schemes are used: an individual spin encoding where each spin is represented by one qubit, and an efficient Gray code encoding scheme which only requires a number of qubits that scales with the logarithm of the number of spins. This more efficient encoding, together with zero noise extrapolation techniques, is shown to improve the fidelity of the simulated energies with respect to exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Phase Dataset for Ti and Ti-6Al-4V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Titanium and its alloys are technologically important materials that display a rich phase behaviour. In order to enable large-scale, realistic modelling of Ti and its alloys on the atomistic scale, Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are crucial, but rely on databases of atomic configurations. We report databases of such configurations that represent the {\alpha}, \b{eta}, {\omega} and liquid phases of Ti and the Ti-6Al-4V alloy, where we provide total energy, force and stress values evaluated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) using the PBE exchange-correlation functional. We have also leveraged and extended a data reduction strategy, via non-diagonal supercells, for the vibrational properties of Ti and sampling of atomic species within bulk crystalline data for Ti-6Al-4V. These configurations may be used to fit MLIP models that can accurately model the phase behaviour of Ti and Ti-6Al-4V across a broad range of thermodynamic conditions. To validate models, we assembled a set of benchmark protocols, which can be used to rapidly develop and evaluate MLIP models. We demonstrated the utility of our databases and validation tools by fitting models based on the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) and Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) frameworks.</description>

      <title>Supercharging Single-Atom Traps by Collisional Blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable arrays of trapped single atoms are an excellent platform for the simulation of many-body physics and the realisation of high-fidelity quantum gates. The confinement of atoms is often achieved with focussed laser beams acting as optical dipole-force traps that allow for both static and dynamic positioning of atoms. In these traps, light-assisted collisions -- enhancing the two-atom loss rate -- ensure that single atom occupation of traps can be realised. However, the time-averaged probability of trapping a single atom is limited to $0.5$ when loading directly from a surrounding cloud of laser-cooled atoms, preventing deterministic filling of large arrays. In this work, we demonstrate that increasing the depth of a static, optical dipole trap enables the transition from fast loading on a timescale of $2.1\,$s to an extended trap lifetime of $7.9\,$s. This method demonstrates an achievable filling ratio of $(79\pm2)\,\%$ without the need of rearranging atoms to fill vacant traps.</description>

      <title>Production and stabilization of a spin mixture of ultracold dipolar Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixtures of ultracold gases with long-range interactions are expected to open new avenues in the study of quantum matter. Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Performance of Silicon photomultipliers at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present experimental results of characterization of Silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) in a temperature range from 90~mK to 40~K. Two SiPMs, one from ONSEMI and one from Hamamatsu Photonics were tested. Operating voltage ranges, dark count rates, afterpulsing effects and photon detection efficiencies (PDE) were determined with illumination by 275 and 470~nm light fed into the cryostat via an optical fiber. A cryogenic shutter provided a true dark condition, where thermal radiation from room temperature is shielded and the thermal excitations in the chips are frozen. A second tunneling breakdown was observed at this condition, which substantially limits the operating voltage range for the temperatures 20-30 K. Below $\sim$5 K, both SiPMs recover to an operating over-voltage range of 3-5 V. We found the chips function through the entire tested temperature range, and are capable of withstanding thermal cycling with no major performance degradation.</description>
