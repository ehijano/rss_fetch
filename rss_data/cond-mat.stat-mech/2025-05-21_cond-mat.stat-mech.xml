      <title>Coarse grained descriptions of the dynamics of yielding of amorphous solids under cyclic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent computer simulations reveal several intriguing features in the evolution of properties of amorphous solids subjected to repeated cyclic shear deformation. These include the divergence of the number of cycles to reach steady states as the yielding point is approached, a non-monotonic change of properties with cycles, and the possibility of a spectrum of frozen states. Theoretical attempts to capture these properties through simple models, including the Ehrenfest model describing a random walk in a confining potential, have met partial success. Here, we show that incorporating the influence of mechanical noise through a feedback term leads to a genuine dynamical transition with characteristics reflecting those of yielding. Coarse graining the dynamics into a small number of variables leads to new insights regarding the dynamics of yielding.</description>

      <title>Entropy exchange in an inter-correlating binary quasi-classical system: Concept of entropy-bath accelerated molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter highlights the entropy exchange phenomenon in a coupled binary inter-correlating system following Haldane's non-linear statistical correlation. A unique coupling between a classical and a quantum-like system at the marginal distribution is observed. It is shown that the quantum nature of a system can arise without any self-correlation. Extending this idea, an enhanced sampling method in molecular dynamics simulation is postulated where a classical system is forced to show quantum-like behavior with the help of an entropy-bath. An entropy-bath exchanges entropy with the system to scale the potential energy distribution of the system, so that a probability upper bound at each energy level is maintained. An algorithm to implement the entropy-bath accelerated molecular dynamics simulation is discussed. Using low temperature vitreous silica as an example, the capability of such an algorithm to greatly improve sampling of the potential energy landscape under equilibrium conditions for kinetically arrested systems is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Inhomogeneous Free Bosons and Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ground-state entanglement entropy in inhomogeneous free-boson models in one spatial dimension. We develop a powerful method to extract the leading term in the entanglement scaling, based on the analytic properties of the inhomogeneous potential. This method is applicable to a broad class of models with smooth spatial inhomogeneities. As a case study, we apply this approach for a family of exactly-solvable models characterized by orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme, finding a perfect match between the numerical and analytical results.</description>

      <title>Congestion and extreme events in urban street networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Congestion and extreme events in transportation networks are emergent phenomena with significant socio-economic implications. In this work, we study congestion and extreme event properties on real urban street (planar) networks drawn from four cities and compare it with that on a regular square grid. For dynamics, we employ three variants of random walk with additional realistic transport features. In all the four urban street networks and 2D square grid and with all dynamical models, phase transitions are observed from a free flow to congested phase as a function of birth rate of vehicles. These transitions can be modified by traffic-aware routing protocols, but congestion cannot be entirely mitigated. In organically evolved street networks, we observe a semi-congested regime which has both congested and free-flow components. In the free-flow regime, the extreme event occurrence probability is larger for small degree nodes than for hubs, a feature originally observed in non-planar scale-free networks. In general, with respect to congestion and extreme events, the urban street networks and regular square grid display similar properties.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Bell sampling in Quantum Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are essential for the numerical study of large-scale quantum many-body systems, yet their utility has been significantly hampered by the difficulty in computing key quantities such as off-diagonal operators and entanglement. This work introduces Bell-QMC, a novel QMC framework leveraging Bell sampling, a two-copy measurement protocol in the transversal Bell basis. We demonstrate that Bell-QMC enables an efficient and unbiased estimation of both challenging classes of observables, offering a significant advantage over previous QMC approaches. Notably, the entanglement across all system partitions can be computed in a single Bell-QMC simulation. We implement this method within the stochastic series expansion (SSE), where we design an efficient update scheme for sampling the configurations in the Bell basis. We demonstrate our algorithm in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, extracting universal quantum features using only simple diagonal measurements. This work establishes Bell-QMC as a powerful framework that significantly expands the accessible quantum properties in QMC simulations, providing an exponential advantage over conventional QMC.</description>

      <title>Statistical field theory of equilibrium amorphous solids and the intrinsic heterogeneity distributions that characterize them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rich variety of amorphous solids are found in nature and technology, including ones formed via the vulcanization of long, flexible molecules. A special class -- those featuring a wide gap between the long timescales over which constraints in them release and the much shorter timescales over which their unconstrained freedoms relax -- exhibit states of thermodynamic equilibrium and are thus amenable to the framework of equilibrium statistical physics. The approach reviewed here is the least specific -- and thus the most general -- approach to the statistical mechanics of equilibrium amorphous solid-formers: statistical field theory. An overview is given of the key elements and results of this theory. The field of the theory is constructed to detect and diagnose the amorphous solid state. Its form turns out to be unusual, in ways that are essential for its application, so it is examined in detail, as is the form of the field theory controlling the field. What this theory can predict for the equilibrium properties of amorphous solids is then discussed, including: the transition to the amorphous solid state and the heterogeneity of the resulting solid; the impact of fluctuations on the transition and connections with percolation theory; the pattern of symmetry-breaking and the nature of the resulting elasticity; and field correlations and the information they provide. Emphasis is placed on the idea, peculiar to amorphous solids, that their equilibrium states are naturally characterized in terms of distributions that capture the intrinsic spatial heterogeneity of the thermal motions of their constituents. The theory's field has an internal structure that subtly encodes this information, via the wave-vector dependencies of the average field and its correlations. Reflections are made on the applicability of theses ideas and results to a range of amorphous solids and related systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Factorizing Interface in the Two-Dimensional Long-Range Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The factorization proposal claims that the co-dimension one "pinning defect", on which a local relevant operator is integrated, factorizes the space into two halves in general conformal field theories in the infrared limit. In this letter, we study a two-dimensional long-range Ising model at criticality with a line defect or an interface, which physically corresponds to changing the local temperature on it. We show that in the perturbative regime, it is not factorizing even in the infrared limit. An intuitive explanation of the non-factorization is that the long-range Ising model is equivalent to a local conformal field theory in higher dimensions. In this picture, the space is still connected through the "extra dimension" across the defect line.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Simulation of Generalized Langevin Equations with Non-Gaussian Orthogonal Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is a useful framework for analyzing and modeling the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of low-dimensional reaction coordinates, with its specific form determined by the choice of projection formalism. We compare parameters derived from different GLE formulations using molecular dynamics simulations of butane's dihedral angle dynamics. Our analysis reveals non-Gaussian contributions of the orthogonal force in different GLEs, being most enhanced for the Mori-GLE, where all non-linearities are relegated to the orthogonal force. We establish a simulation technique that correctly accounts for non-Gaussian orthogonal forces, which is critical for accurately predicting dihedral-angle mean first-passage times. We find that the accuracy of GLE simulations depends significantly on the chosen GLE formalism; the Mori-GLE offers the most numerically robust framework for capturing the statistical observables of the dihedral angle dynamics, provided the correct non-Gaussian orthogonal force distribution is used.</description>

      <title>Dissipative phase transition of interacting non-reciprocal fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an interacting fermionic chain in the presence of non-reciprocal gain and loss processes obtained via reservoir engineering. The interplay between unitary evolution and the two dissipative processes leads to distinct non-reciprocal signatures in the transient dynamics and the steady state. These include a transition from exponential to power-law relaxation towards a finite-density steady-state, a nonzero particle current from breaking inversion symmetry, and dynamics under open boundary conditions showing directionality and charge accumulation. Weak interactions preserve the main signatures of non-reciprocity, enriching the interacting many-body non-reciprocal phase with volume law entanglement of quantum trajectories. Upon increasing the interaction above a critical value, we find a dissipative phase transition where reciprocity is dynamically restored.</description>

      <title>Dynamical patterns and nonreciprocal effective interactions in an active-passive mixture through exact hydrodynamic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of dynamical patterns is one of the most striking features of nonequilibrium physical systems. Recent work has shown that such patterns arise generically from forces that violate Newton's third law, known as nonreciprocal interactions. These nonequilibrium phenomena are challenging for modern theories. Here, we introduce a model mixture of active (self-propelled) and passive (diffusive) particles amenable to exact mathematical analysis. We exploit state-of-the-art methods to derive exact hydrodynamic equations for the particle densities, which reveal effective nonreciprocal couplings between the active and passive species. We study the resulting collective behavior, including the linear stability of homogeneous states and phase coexistence in large systems. This reveals a novel phase diagram with the spinodal associated with active phase separation protruding through the associated binodal, heralding the emergence of dynamical steady states. We analyze these states in the thermodynamic limit of large system size, showing, for example, that sharp interfaces may travel at finite velocities, but traveling phase-separated states are forbidden. The model's mathematical tractability enables precise new conclusions beyond those available by numerical simulation of particle models or field theories.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over the Ferromagnetic Ground State in the Transverse Field Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider time evolution of order parameters and entanglement asymmetries in the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising chain. One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fixing Spins in a Quantum Annealer with Energy Rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.</description>

      <title>Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in classical many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06375v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.</description>

      <title>Potts and random cluster measures on locally regular-tree-like graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fixing $\beta \ge 0$ and an integer $q \ge 2$, consider the ferromagnetic $q$-Potts measures $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ on finite graphs ${\sf G}_n$ on $n$ vertices, with external field strength $B \ge 0$ and the corresponding random cluster measures $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_{n}$. Suppose that as $n \to \infty$ the uniformly sparse graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to an infinite $d$-regular tree ${\sf T}_{d}$, $d \ge 3$. We show that the convergence of the Potts free energy density to its Bethe replica symmetric prediction (which has been proved in case $d$ is even, or when $B=0$), yields the local weak convergence of $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_n$ and $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ to the corresponding free or wired random cluster measure, Potts measure, respectively, on ${\sf T}_{d}$. The choice of free versus wired limit is according to which has the larger Potts Bethe functional value, with mixtures of these two appearing {as limit points on} the critical line $\beta_c(q,B)$ where these two values of the Bethe functional coincide. For $B=0$ and $\beta&gt;\beta_c$, we further establish a pure-state decomposition by showing that conditionally on the same dominant color $1 \le k \le q$, the $q$-Potts measures on such edge-expander graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to the $q$-Potts measure on ${\sf T}_{d}$ with a boundary wired at color $k$.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. We present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity and localization in random and time-periodic unitary circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the growth and saturation of Krylov spread (K-) complexity under random quantum circuits. In Haar-random unitary evolution, we show that, for large system sizes, K-complexity grows linearly before saturating at a late-time value of $D/2$, where $D$ is the Hilbert space dimension, at timescales $\sim D$. Our numerical analysis encompasses two classes of random circuits: brick-wall random unitary circuits and Floquet random circuits. In brick-wall case, K-complexity exhibits dynamics consistent with Haar-random unitary evolution, while the inclusion of measurements significantly slows its growth down. For Floquet random circuits, we show that localized phases lead to reduced late-time saturation values of K-complexity, forbye we utilize these saturation values to probe the transition between thermal and many-body localized phases.</description>

      <title>Neural Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the connection between deep learning and information theory through the paradigm of diffusion models. A diffusion model converts noise into structured data by reinstating, imperfectly, information that is erased when data was diffused to noise. This information is stored in a neural network during training. We quantify this information by introducing a measure called neural entropy, which is related to the total entropy produced by diffusion. Neural entropy is a function of not just the data distribution, but also the diffusive process itself. Measurements of neural entropy on a few simple image diffusion models reveal that they are extremely efficient at compressing large ensembles of structured data.</description>

      <title>Roughening dynamics of interfaces in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of interfaces are key to understand the physics of matter. However, the study of quantum interface dynamics has remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we use large-scale Tree Tensor Network simulations to identify the dynamical signature of an interface roughening transition within the ferromagnetic phase of the 2D quantum Ising model. For initial domain wall profiles we find extended prethermal plateaus for smooth interfaces, whereas above the roughening transition the domain wall decays quickly. Our results can be readily explored experimentally in Rydberg atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics in the presence of local symmetry-breaking impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous symmetries lead to universal slow relaxation of correlation functions in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study how local symmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions using Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic non-integrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the symmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full ergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under such circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood using a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine the late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved quantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify diffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U$(1)$ and dipole conservation at late-times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of the decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these symmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization group sense, e.g., bulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both temporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that disrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only acquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in autocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with the distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically characterizes how symmetry breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in symmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Integrability and Chaos via fractal analysis of Spectral Form Factors: Gaussian approximations and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.</description>
