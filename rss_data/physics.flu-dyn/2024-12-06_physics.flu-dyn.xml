      <title>Restricted Euler dynamics in free-surface turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The small-scale velocity gradient is connected to fundamental properties of turbulence at the large scales. By neglecting the viscous and nonlocal pressure Hessian terms, we derive a restricted Euler model for the turbulent flow along an undeformed free surface and discuss the associated stable/unstable manifolds. The model is compared with the data collected by high-resolution imaging on the free surface of a turbulent water tank with negligible surface waves. The joint probability density function (PDF) of the velocity gradient invariants exhibits a distinct pattern from the one in the bulk. The restricted Euler model captures the enhanced probability along the unstable branch of the manifold and the asymmetry of the joint PDF. Significant deviations between the experiments and the prediction are evident, however, in particular concerning the compressibility of the surface flow. These results highlight the enhanced intermittency of the velocity gradient and the influence of the free surface on the energy cascade.</description>

      <title>Wall Slip Effects on Parameter Estimation for Integral-Type Viscoelastic Models: Insights from High Density Polyethylene and Thermoplastic Elastomer Melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of wall slip on parameter estimation for integral-type non-linear viscoelastic models with time-strain separable memory functions, specifically examining high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) melts. Significant wall slip was observed in HDPE under non-linear conditions, complicating the characterization of its damping function using step strain data. In contrast, TPE exhibited negligible wall slip across a wide range of strains and shear rates, facilitating successful parameterization of its damping function using the Wagner-type K-BKZ equation and enabling accurate predictions of various material functions. For HDPE, the study investigated alternative approaches to parameterize the K-BKZ equation, including the use of steady and time-dependent material functions at low deformation rates where wall slip effects are minimal. The findings underscore the challenges of estimating parameters in the presence of wall slip and propose strategies to address these challenges, particularly for materials like HDPE, where pronounced slip complicates traditional rheological characterization.</description>

      <title>Computing sessile droplet shapes on arbitrary surfaces with a new pairwise force smoothed particle hydrodynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the shape of droplets on surfaces is an important problem in the physics of fluids and has applications in multiple industries, from agrichemical spraying to microfluidic devices. Motivated by these real-world applications, computational predictions for droplet shapes on complex substrates -- rough and chemically heterogeneous surfaces -- are desired. Grid-based discretisations in axisymmetric coordinates form the basis of well-established numerical solution methods in this area, but when the problem is not axisymmetric, the shape of the contact line and the distribution of the contact angle around it are unknown. Recently, particle methods, such as pairwise force smoothed particle hydrodynamics (PF-SPH), have been used to conveniently forego explicit enforcement of the contact angle. The pairwise force model, however, is far from mature, and there is no consensus in the literature on the choice of pairwise force profile. We propose a new pair of polynomial force profiles with a simple motivation and validate the PF-SPH model in both static and dynamic tests. We demonstrate its capabilities by computing droplet shapes on a physically structured surface, a surface with a hydrophilic stripe, and a virtual wheat leaf with both micro-scale roughness and variable wettability. We anticipate that this model can be extended to dynamic scenarios, such as droplet spreading or impaction, in the future.</description>

      <title>Global drag reduction and local flow statistics in Taylor-Couette turbulence with dilute polymer additives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on the drag reduction by polymers in Taylor-Couette turbulence at Reynolds numbers ($Re$) ranging from $4\times 10^3$ to $2.5\times 10^4$. In this $Re$ regime, the Taylor vortex is present and accounts for more than 50\% of the total angular velocity flux. Polyacrylamide polymers with two different average molecular weights are used. It is found that the drag reduction rate increases with polymer concentration and approaches the maximum drag reduction (MDR) limit. At MDR, the friction factor follows the $-0.58$ scaling, i.e., $C_f \sim Re^{-0.58}$, similar to channel/pipe flows. However, the drag reduction rate is about $20\%$ at MDR, which is much lower than that in channel/pipe flows at comparable $Re$. We also find that the Reynolds shear stress does not vanish and the slope of the mean azimuthal velocity profile in the logarithmic layer remains unchanged at MDR. These behaviours are reminiscent of the low drag reduction regime reported in channel flow (Warholic et al., Exp. Fluids, vol. 27, issue 5, 1999, p. 461-472). We reveal that the lower drag reduction rate originates from the fact that polymers strongly suppress the turbulent flow while only slightly weaken the mean Taylor vortex. We further show that polymers steady the velocity boundary layer and suppress the small-scale G\"{o}rtler vortices in the near-wall region. The former effect reduces the emission rate of both intense fast and slow plumes detached from the boundary layer, resulting in less flux transport from the inner cylinder to the outer one and reduces energy input into the bulk turbulent flow. Our results suggest that in turbulent flows, where secondary flow structures are statistically persistent and dominate the global transport properties of the system, the drag reduction efficiency of polymer additives is significantly diminished.</description>

      <title>Methodology for Online Estimation of Rheological Parameters in Polymer Melts Using Deep Learning and Microfluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in biological and chemical experiments due to their cost-effectiveness for rheological estimation in fluids. However, these devices often face challenges in terms of accuracy, size, and cost. This study presents a methodology, integrating deep learning, modeling and simulation to enhance the design of microfluidic systems, used to develop an innovative approach for viscosity measurement of polymer melts. We use synthetic data generated from the simulations to train a deep learning model, which then identifies rheological parameters of polymer melts from pressure drop and flow rate measurements in a microfluidic circuit, enabling online estimation of fluid properties. By improving the accuracy and flexibility of microfluidic rheological estimation, our methodology accelerates the design and testing of microfluidic devices, reducing reliance on physical prototypes, and offering significant contributions to the field.</description>

      <title>Parametric Gaussian quadratures for Discrete Unified Gas Kinetic Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) has emerged as a promising Boltzmann solver capable of effectively capturing flow physics across all Knudsen numbers. However, simulating rarefied flows at high Knudsen numbers remains computationally demanding. This paper introduces a parametric Gaussian quadrature (PGQ) rule designed to improve the computational efficiency of DUGKS. The PGQ rule employs Gaussian functions for weighting and introduces several novel forms of higher-dimensional Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Initially, the velocity space is mapped to polar or spherical coordinates using a parameterized integral transformation method, which converts multiple integrals into repeated parametric integrals. Subsequently, Gaussian points and weight coefficients are computed based on the newly defined parametric weight functions. The parameters in PGQ allow the distribution of Gaussian points to be adjusted according to computational requirements, addressing the limitations of traditional Gaussian quadratures where Gaussian points are difficult to match the distribution of real particles in rarefied flows. To validate the proposed approach, numerical examples across various Knudsen numbers are provided. The simulation results demonstrate that PGQ offers superior computational efficiency and flexibility compared to the traditional Newton-Cotes rule and the half-range Gaussian Hermite rule, achieving computational efficiency that is tens of times higher than that of the Newton-Cotes method. This significantly enhances the computational efficiency of DUGKS and augments its ability to accurately simulate rarefied flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>On Deep-Learning-Based Closures for Algebraic Surrogate Models of Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep-learning-based closure model to address energy loss in low-dimensional surrogate models based on proper-orthogonal-decomposition (POD) modes is introduced. Using a transformer-encoder block with easy-attention mechanism, the model predicts the spatial probability density function of fluctuations not captured by the truncated POD modes. The methodology is demonstrated on the wake of the Windsor body at yaw angles of [2.5,5,7.5,10,12.5], with 7.5 as a test case. Key coherent modes are identified by clustering them based on dominant frequency dynamics using Hotelling T2 on the spectral properties of temporal coefficients. These coherent modes account for nearly 60% of the total energy while comprising less than 10% of all modes. A common POD basis is created by concatenating coherent modes from training angles and orthonormalizing the set, reducing the basis vectors from 142 to 90 without losing information. Transformers with different size on the attention layer, (64, 128 and 256), are trained to model the missing fluctuations. Larger attention sizes always improve predictions for the training set, but the transformer with an attention layer of size 256 overshoots the fluctuations predictions in the test set because they have lower intensity than in the training cases. Adding the predicted fluctuations closes the energy gap between the reconstruction and the original flow field, improving predictions for energy, root-mean-square velocity fluctuations, and instantaneous flow fields. The deepest architecture reduces mean energy error from 37% to 12% and decreases the Kullback--Leibler divergence of velocity distributions from KL=0.2 to below KL=0.026.</description>

      <title>Small-scale dynamics and structure of free-surface turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of small-scale structures in free-surface turbulence is crucial to large-scale phenomena in natural and industrial environments. Here we conduct experiments on the quasi-flat free surface of a zero-mean-flow turbulent water tank over the Reynolds number range $Re_{\lambda} = 207\textrm{--}312$. By seeding microscopic floating particles at high concentrations, the fine scales of the flow and the velocity gradient tensor are resolved. A kinematic relation is derived expressing the contribution of surface divergence and vorticity to the dissipation rate. The probability density functions of divergence, vorticity and strain-rate collapse once normalized by the Kolmogorov scales. Their magnitude displays strong intermittency and follows chi-square distributions with power-law tails at small values. The topology of high-intensity events and two-point statistics indicate that the surface divergence is characterized by dissipative spatial and temporal scales, while the high-vorticity and high-strain-rate regions are larger, long-lived, concurrent, and elongated. The second-order velocity structure functions obey the classic Kolmogorov scaling in the inertial range when the dissipation rate on the surface is considered, with a different numerical constant than in 3D turbulence. The cross-correlation among divergence, vorticity and strain-rate indicates that the surface-attached vortices are strengthened during downwellings and diffuse when those dissipate. Sources (sinks) in the surface velocity fields are associated with strong (weak) surface-parallel stretching and compression along perpendicular directions. The floating particles cluster over spatial and temporal scales larger than those of the sinks. These results demonstrate that, compared to 3D turbulence, in free-surface turbulence the energetic scales leave a stronger imprint on the small-scale quantities.</description>

      <title>MOGLI: Model for Multiphase Gas using Multifluid hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiphase gas, with hot ($\sim10^6$K) and cold ($\sim10^4$K) gas, is ubiquitous in astrophysical media across a wide range of scales. However, simulating multiphase gas has been a long-standing challenge, due to the large separation between the size of cold gas structures and the scales at which such gas impacts the evolution of associated systems. In this study, we introduce a new subgrid framework for such multiphase gas, MOGLI: Model for Multiphase Gas using Multifluid hydrodynamics, in multifluid AREPO. We develop this approach based on first principles and theoretical results from previous studies with resolved small-scale simulations, leading to a minimal number of free parameters in the formulation. We divide the interactions in the model into three sources: drag, turbulent mixing and cold gas growth. As part of the model, we also include two methods for estimating the local turbulent velocities, one using the Kolmogorov scaling, and the other using the local velocity gradients. We verify the different components of the framework through extensive comparison with benchmark single-fluid simulations across different simulation parameters, such as how resolved the cold gas is initially, the turbulent Mach number, spatial resolution, and random initialisation of turbulence. We test the complete scheme and a reduced version, with and without cold gas growth. We find a very good qualitative and quantitative agreement across the different simulation parameters and diagnostics for both local turbulent velocity estimation methods. We also reproduce behaviour like the cold gas survival criteria as an emergent property. We discuss the applications and possible extensions of MOGLI and demonstrate its capability by running a simulation which would be computationally prohibitive to run as a resolved single-fluid simulation.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for concentration-gradient-driven electrolyte transport through a 2D membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials exhibit unique properties that are promising for diverse applications, including those relevant to concentration-gradient-driven transport of electrolyte solutions through porous membranes made from these materials, such as water desalination, osmotic power, and iontronics. Here we derive general equations, and determine scaling laws in the thick and thin electric-double-layer limits, that quantify the variation of the concentration-gradient-driven flow rate, solute flux and electric current with the pore radius, surface charge density and Debye screening length for the transport of a dilute electrolyte solution through a circular aperture in an infinitesimally thin planar membrane. We also determine scaling laws for the electric-field-driven flow rate in the thin electric-double-layer limit in the same geometry. We show that these scaling laws accurately capture the scaling relationships from finite-element numerical simulations within the Debye-H\"uckel regime, and extend the theory to obtain scaling laws in the thin electric-double-layer limit that hold even when the electric potential energy is large compared with the thermal energy. These scaling laws indicate unusual behavior for concentration-gradient-driven flow in a 2D membrane that is not seen in thicker membranes, which has broad implications for liquid transport through membranes whose thickness comparable to, or smaller than, their pore size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental laws of physics are symmetric under time reversal ($T$) symmetry, but the $T$ symmetry is strongly broken in the macroscopic world. In this Perspective, I review $T$ symmetry breaking frameworks: \textit{second law of thermodynamics, multiscale energy transfer}, and \textit{open systems}. In driven dissipative nonequilibrium systems, including turbulence, the multiscale energy flux from large scales to small scales helps determine the arrow of time. In addition, open systems are often irreversible due to particle and energy exchanges between the system and the environment. Causality is another important factor that breaks the $T$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Machine learning enhanced multi-particle tracking in solid fuel combustion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle velocimetry is essential in solid fuel combustion studies, however, the accurate detection and tracking of particles in high Particle Number Density (PND) combustion scenario remain challenging. The current study advances the machine-learning approaches for precise velocity measurements of solid particles. For this, laser imaging experiments were performed for high-volatile bituminous coal particles burning in a laminar flow reactor. Particle positions were imaged using time-resolved Mie scattering. Various detection methods, including conventional blob detection and Machine Learning (ML) based You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Realtime Detection Transformer (RT-DETR) were employed and bench marked.~Particle tracking was performed using the Simple Online Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm. The results demonstrated the capability of machine learning models trained on low-PND data for prediction of high-PND data. Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) algorithm is important for the better performance of the used models. By evaluating the velocity statistics, it is found that the mean particle velocity decreases with increasing PND, primarily due to stronger particle interactions. The particle dynamics are closely related to the position of combustion zone observed in the previous study. Thus, PND is considered as the dominant factor for the particle group combustion behavior of high-volatile solid fuels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High performance computing (HPC) architectures have undergone rapid development in recent years. As a result, established software suites face an ever increasing challenge to remain performant on and portable across modern systems. Many of the widely adopted atmospheric modeling codes cannot fully (or in some cases, at all) leverage the acceleration provided by General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs), leaving users of those codes constrained to increasingly limited HPC resources. Energy Research and Forecasting (ERF) is a regional atmospheric modeling code that leverages the latest HPC architectures, whether composed of only Central Processing Units (CPUs) or incorporating GPUs. ERF contains many of the standard discretizations and basic features needed to model general atmospheric dynamics as well as flows relevant to renewable energy. The modular design of ERF provides a flexible platform for exploring different physics parameterizations and numerical strategies. ERF is built on a state-of-the-art, well-supported, software framework (AMReX) that provides a performance portable interface and ensures ERF's long-term sustainability on next generation computing systems. This paper details the numerical methodology of ERF and presents results for a series of verification and validation cases.</description>

Abstract: Accurately modeling the dynamics of high-density ratio (on the order of 100,000) two-phase flows is important for many material science and manufacturing applications. This work considers numerical simulations of molten metal oscillations in microgravity to analyze the interplay between surface tension and density ratio, a critical factor for terrestrial manufacturing applications. We present a projection-based computational framework for solving a thermodynamically-consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flows with large density ratios. The framework employs a modified version of the pressure-decoupled solver based on the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition presented in Khanwale et al. ("A projection-based, semi-implicit time-stepping approach for the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations on adaptive octree meshes," Journal of Computational Physics 475 (2023): 111874). We validate our numerical method on several canonical problems, including the capillary wave and single bubble rise problems. We also present a comprehensive convergence study to investigate the effect of mesh resolution, time-step, and interfacial thickness on droplet-shape oscillations. We further demonstrate the robustness of our framework by successfully simulating three distinct physical systems with extremely large density ratios (10,000-100,000:1), achieving results that have not been previously reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Role of Duty Cycle in Burst-Modulated Synthetic Jet Flow Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study on flow reattachment over a stalled airfoil using an array of microblowers operating as synthetic jet actuators (SJAs). The effects of burst duty cycle (DC) and blowing ratio, alongside power requirements, are examined in relation to SJA-induced vortical structures and aerodynamic performance. Results show that increasing the DC or blowing ratio can achieve the threshold momentum coefficient required for flow reattachment. While both DC and blowing ratios impact control efficacy, achieving a specific momentum coefficient generally corresponds to a consistent lift coefficient, regardless of the individual parameter values. Substantial lift improvements are observed at DCs as low as 5%, indicating that brief, high-momentum perturbations to the flow are sufficient for reattachment, resulting in significant power savings. However, analysis of the flow dynamics reveals that low-DC control strategies result in unsteady, phase-dependent flow behavior due to the induced vortices' rapid dissipation and inconsistent evolution. Higher DCs produce stronger, more persistent vortices that remain closer to the airfoil surface, leading to a more stable and effective control strategy. The study also highlights the challenge of achieving full spanwise control across the finite-span array, as even high-power strategies could not achieve a control length greater than 40% of the array's span. Additionally, a strong correlation between the lift coefficient and the suction peak pressure coefficient is observed, indicating that single-point measurements suffice for rapid assessment of control effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Identifying the onset and decay of quasi-stationary families of almost-invariant sets with an application to atmospheric blocking events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic features of dynamical systems such as almost-invariant sets and coherent sets provide crucial high-level information on how the dynamics organises phase space. We introduce a method to identify time-parameterised families of almost-invariant sets in time-dependent dynamical systems, as well as the families' emergence and disappearance. In contrast to coherent sets, which may freely move about in phase space over time, our technique focuses on families of metastable sets that are quasi-stationary in space. Our straightforward approach extends successful transfer operator methods for almost-invariant sets to time-dependent dynamics and utilises the Ulam scheme for the generator of the transfer operator on a time-expanded domain. The new methodology is illustrated with an idealised fluid flow and with atmospheric velocity data. We identify atmospheric blocking events in the 2003 European heatwave and compare our technique to existing geophysical methods of blocking diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Contrasting thermodynamic and hydrodynamic entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, using \textit{hydrodynamic entropy} we quantify the multiscale disorder in Euler and hydrodynamic turbulence. These examples illustrate that the hydrodynamic entropy is not extensive because it is not proportional to the system size. Consequently, we cannot add hydrodynamic and thermodynamic entropies, which measure disorder at macroscopic and microscopic scales, respectively. In this paper, we also discuss the hydrodynamic entropy for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and Ising spins.</description>
