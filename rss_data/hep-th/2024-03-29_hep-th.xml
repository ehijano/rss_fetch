      <title>Feynman Diagrams as Computational Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a computational graph representation of high-order Feynman diagrams in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), applicable to any combination of spatial, temporal, momentum, and frequency domains. Utilizing the Dyson-Schwinger and parquet equations, our approach effectively organizes these diagrams into a fractal structure of tensor operations, significantly reducing computational redundancy. This approach not only streamlines the evaluation of complex diagrams but also facilitates an efficient implementation of the field-theoretic renormalization scheme, crucial for enhancing perturbative QFT calculations. Key to this advancement is the integration of Taylor-mode automatic differentiation, a key technique employed in machine learning packages to compute higher-order derivatives efficiently on computational graphs. To operationalize these concepts, we develop a Feynman diagram compiler that optimizes diagrams for various computational platforms, utilizing machine learning frameworks. Demonstrating this methodology's effectiveness, we apply it to the three-dimensional uniform electron gas problem, achieving unprecedented accuracy in calculating the quasiparticle effective mass at metal density. Our work demonstrates the synergy between QFT and machine learning, establishing a new avenue for applying AI techniques to complex quantum many-body problems.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the leading ideas for the beginning of the Universe is the Hartle-Hawking `No-Boundary Proposal.' Since the Cobordism Conjecture claims that any spacetime allows for a dynamical boundary, we suggest that one may equally well consider a `Boundary Proposal'. Specifically, the corresponding euclidean instanton is a sphere with two holes around north and south pole cut out. Analogously to the Hartle-Hawking proposal, the sphere is then cut in two at the equator and half of it is dropped. The equator is glued to an expanding Lorentzian de Sitter space, implementing a beginning of the Universe with a spacelike spherical boundary at its earliest moment. This process is in principle on equal footing with the one based on the no-boundary instanton. In fact, if the Linde-Vilenkin sign choice is used, this `Boundary' creation process may even dominate. An intriguing implication arises if tensionless end-of-the-world branes, as familiar from type-IIA or M-theory, are available: Analogously to the Boundary Proposal, one may then be able to create a compact, flat torus universe from nothing, without any exponential suppression or enhancement factors.</description>

      <title>A Celestial Dual for MHV Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that a 2D CFT consisting of a central charge $c$ Liouville theory, a chiral level one, rank $N$ Kac-Moody algebra and a weight $-3/2$ free fermion holographically generate 4D MHV tree-level scattering amplitudes. The correlators of this 2D CFT give directly the 4D leaf amplitudes associated to a single hyperbolic slice of flat space. The 4D celestial amplitudes arise in a large-$N$ and semiclassical large-$c$ limit, according to the holographic dictionary, as a translationally-invariant combination of leaf amplitudes. A step in the demonstration is showing that the semiclassical limit of Liouville correlators are given by contact AdS$_3$ Witten diagrams.</description>

      <title>Exact evaluation of large-charge correlation functions in non-relativistic conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-charge master field which generates all n-point correlation functions with an insertion of large charge Q in non-relativistic conformal field theory is obtained. This field is used to compute Schr\"odinger-invariant n-point correlation functions of large-charge operators via a direct evaluation of the path integral. Conformal dimensions are found to agree with calculations based on the state-operator correspondence. The master field solution exhibits an emergent harmonic trap whose frequency is a function of the Euclidean time. The large-charge effective action with operator insertions describes a droplet of superfluid matter whose spatial size scales with the time separation of sources. The solution is used to compute Schr\"odinger symmetry breaking corrections in the large-charge effective field theory (EFT) due to a finite scattering length in the fundamental theory of fermions near unitarity. The scaling of these effects in the large-charge power counting scheme is established, and the size of the effects is quantified using input from quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the near-unitary gas, as well as from the large-N expansion at large charge.</description>

      <title>Open system dynamics in interacting quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum system that interacts with an environment generally undergoes non-unitary evolution described by a non-Markovian or Markovian master equation. In this paper, we construct the non-Markovian Redfield master equation for a quantum scalar field that interacts with a second field through a bilinear or nonlinear interaction on a Minkowski background. We use the resulting master equation to set up coupled differential equations that can be solved to obtain the equal-time two-point function of the system field. We show how the equations simplify under various approximations including the Markovian limit, and argue that the Redfield equation-based solution provides a perturbative resummation to the standard second order Dyson series result. For the bilinear interaction, we explicitly show that the Redfield solution is closer to the exact solution compared to the perturbation theory-based one. Further, the environment correlation function is oscillatory and non-decaying in this case, making the Markovian master equation a poor approximation. For the nonlinear interaction, on the other hand, the environment correlation function is sharply peaked and the Redfield solution matches that obtained using a Markovian master equation in the late-time limit.</description>

      <title>Holographic description of closed FRW cosmologies and time-dependent ER=EPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a covariant holographic entanglement entropy prescription for a class of closed FRW cosmologies, generalizing a recent holographic proposal in de Sitter space. Starting from the Bousso covariant entropy bound, we describe the location of two holographic screens associated with a pair of antipodal observers, and then state our holographic proposal. We then apply our prescription to compute the entanglement entropy of the two-screen and the single screen systems, focusing on the leading classical contributions of order $(G\hbar)^{-1}$. First, we show how the full spacetime is expected to be holographically encoded on the two screens. Second, we argue that the exterior region between the two screens behaves as an Einstein-Rosen bridge, arising from the entanglement between the holographic degrees of freedom as suggested by the ER=EPR conjecture. The entanglement between the two screens, or from the geometric point of view the area of the minimal extremal surface, varies during the cosmological evolution, hence entailing a time-dependent ER=EPR realization.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and the Unruh effect: a study of local modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.</description>

      <title>Quantum focusing conjecture in two-dimensional evaporating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum focusing conjecture (QFC) for two-dimensional evaporating black holes. The QFC is closely related to the behavior of the generalized entropy -- the sum of the area entropy for a given co-dimension two surface and the entanglement entropy for quantum fields outside the area. In the context of the black hole evaporation, the entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation is decreasing after the Page time, and therefore it is not obvious whether the QFC holds in the black hole evaporation process especially after the Page time. One of the present authors previously addressed this problem in a four-dimensional spherically symmetric dynamical black hole model and showed that the QFC is satisfied. However the background spacetime considered was approximated by the Vaidya metric, and quantum effects of matters in the semiclassical regime is not fully taken into consideration. It remains to be seen if the QFC in fact holds for exact solutions of the semiclassical Einstein equations. In this paper, we address this problem in a two-dimensional dynamical black hole of the Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius (RST) model, which allows us to solve the semiclassical equations of motion exactly. We first give a suitable definition of the quantum expansion in two-dimensions and then prove that the QFC is satisfied for evaporating black holes in the RST model with the island formation taken into account.</description>

      <title>Duality between ${\rm U}\times{\rm U}$ and ${\rm O}\times{\rm USp}$ theories from $\hat{A}_{3}=\hat{D}_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the duality between the ABJ(M) theory at Chern-Simons level $k=4$ and the orientifold ABJ theory at Chern-Simons level $k=1$ by using the $S^{3}$ partition function. The partition function can be computed using the supersymmetric localization in terms of a matrix model, and we derive an ideal Fermi gas system by applying the Fermi gas formalism to the matrix model. By using this formalism, we show that the matrix model can be embedded in the partition function of $\hat{A}_{3}$ or $\hat{D}_{3}$ quiver theories, and the equality of these quiver theories, which comes from $\hat{A}_{3}=\hat{D}_{3}$, leads to exact relations of the matrix models. These exact relations can be used to check the identification of the flavor symmetries. The perfect agreement between the matrix models also implies that no decoupled sector is needed.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Modifications of Charged Casimir Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we extend the investigation of the consequences of thermal fluctuations on the Casimir effect within the context of a traversable wormhole, recently proposed by Garattini \&amp; Faizal, arXiv:2403.15174 [gr-qc], subject to charge contributions. Specifically, our focus is on scenarios where the plates exhibit radial variation. In our analysis, we initially concentrate on the high temperature approximation, considering solely the influence of charge on the thermal Casimir wormholes. Additionally, upon incorporating Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) corrections to the Casimir energy, we obtain a new class of wormhole solutions. Notably, we establish that the flare-out condition remains consistently satisfied. Intriguingly, our findings reveal that both the charge and GUP contributions serve to further enlarge the throat's size.</description>

Abstract: {We exploit the flag and Orlik-Solomon algebra to reconstruct the intersection number of twisted cocycles and results to the bi-adjoint amplitude. Through Studying the pairing of the special flag, we find it results to Cachao-He-Yuan represention of the bi-adjoint amplitude. We identify each standard basis flag with Feynman trivalent graph, one find the geometry interpretation of Bern-Carrasco-Johansson duality discovered by Mizera is the relation of flag with a gap. By define the flag simplex, we also construct the Z-amplitude in the $\alpha^{\prime} \rightarrow 0 $ limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified dispersion relations (MDRs) provide a phenomenological approach beyond the Standard Model, intended to capture tentative nonperturbative quantum gravity effects. Here, we show how to constrain a large class of MDRs by deriving the explicit corrections they induce upon the fermion spin coupling with an external magnetic field in the Pauli equation, the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation. We complete the general theoretical analysis with explicit phenomenological examples for which the physical free parameters can be bounded by high-precision tests, in particular the ones based on the measurement of the electron anomalous magnetic moment in a Penning trap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the collective field theory description of a single free massless scalar matrix theory in 2+1 dimensions. The collective fields are given by $k$-local operators obtained by tracing a product of $k$-matrices. For $k=2$ and $k=3$ we argue that the collective field packages the fields associated to a single and two Regge trajectories respectively. We also determine the coordinate transformation between the coordinates of the collective field theory and the bulk AdS space time. This is used to verify that the bulk equations of motion holds in the collective field theory description.</description>

      <title>Doubly special relativity as a non-local quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the technical details of the discussion presented in [J.J. Relancio, L.Santamar\'ia-Sanz (2024) arXiv:2403.18772], where we establish the basis of quantum theories of the free massive scalar, the massive fermionic, and the electromagnetic fields, in a doubly special relativity scenario. This construction is based on a geometrical interpretation of the kinematics of these kind of theories. In order to describe the modified actions, we find that a higher (indeed infinite) derivative field theory is needed, from which the deformed kinematics can be read. From our construction we are able to restrict the possible models of doubly special relativity to particular bases that preserve linear Lorentz invariance. We quantize the theories and also obtain a deformed version of the Maxwell equations. We analyze the electromagnetic vector potential either for an electric point-like source and a magnetic dipole. We observe that the electric and magnetic fields do not diverge at the origin for some models described with an anti de Sitter space but do for the de Sitter one in both problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coupling constant renormalization of gauge theories with an infinite multiplet of fermions, using the zeta function method to make sense of the infinite sums over fermions. If the gauge group K is the maximal compact subgroup of a simple non-compact group G, such infinite multiplets can arise naturally, as reductions of discrete series unitary representations of G. The example K=U(1) and G=SU(1,1) will be studied in detail. Surprisingly, there are abelian gauge theories which are asymptotically free; and others that are UV finite.</description>

      <title>Superintegrability of the monomial Uglov matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a resolution to the problem of $\beta$-deforming the non-Gaussian monomial matrix models. The naive guess of substituting Schur polynomials with Jack polynomials does not work in that case, therefore, we are forced to look for another basis for superintegrability. We find that the relevant symmetric functions are given by Uglov polynomials, and that the integration measure should also be deformed. The measure appears to be related to the Uglov limit as well, when the quantum parameters $(q,t)$ go to a root of unity. The degree of the root must be equal to the degree of the potential. One cannot derive these results directly, for example, by studying Virasoro constraints. Instead, we use the recently developed techniques of $W$-operators to arrive at the root of unity limit. From the perspective of matrix models this new example demonstrates that even with a rather nontrivial integration measure one can find a superintegrability basis by studying the hidden symmetry of the moduli space of deformations.</description>

      <title>On the definition of the spin charge in asymptotically-flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a solution to a classic problem in gravitational physics consisting of defining the spin associated with asymptotically-flat spacetimes. We advocate that the correct asymptotic symmetry algebra to approach this problem is the generalized-BMS algebra $\textsf{gbms}$ instead of the BMS algebra used hitherto in the literature for which a notion of spin is generically unavailable. We approach the problem of defining the spin charges from the perspective of coadjoint orbits of $\textsf{gbms}$ and construct the complete set of Casimir invariants that determine $\textsf{gbms}$ coadjoint orbits, using the notion of vorticity for $\textsf{gbms}$. This allows us to introduce spin charges for $\textsf{gbms}$ as the generators of area-preserving diffeomorphisms forming its isotropy subalgebra. To elucidate the parallelism between our analysis and the Poincar\'e case, we clarify several features of the Poincar\'e embedding in $\textsf{gbms}$ and reveal the presence of condensate fields associated with the symmetry breaking from $\textsf{gbms}$ to Poincar\'e. We also introduce the notion of a rest frame available only for this extended algebra. This allows us to construct, from the spin generator, the gravitational analog of the Pauli--Luba\'nski pseudo-vector. Finally, we obtain the $\textsf{gbms}$ moment map, which we use to construct the gravitational spin charges and gravitational Casimirs from their dual algebra counterparts.</description>

      <title>Extremality as a Consistency Condition on Subregion Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In JT gravity coupled to a CFT, I argue without using the path integral that the entanglement wedge of a boundary region is bounded by a quantum extremal surface (QES). For any candidate not bounded by a QES, a unitary in the complement can make reconstruction within the candidate inconsistent with boundary causality. The case without islands is a direct consequence of subregion duality, and the case with islands can also be dealt with with a stronger assumption.</description>

      <title>More on Black Holes Perceiving the Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last two years the dark dimension scenario has emerged as focal point of many research interests. In particular, it functions as a stepping stone to address the cosmological hierarchy problem and provides a colosseum for dark matter contenders. We reexamine the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. We re-assess limits on the abundance of PBHs as dark matter candidates from $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from Hawking evaporation. We re-evaluate constraints from the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of the Galactic center which offer the best and most solid upper limits on the dark matter fraction composed of PBHs. The revised mass range which allows PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter is estimated to be $10^{15} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. We demonstrate that due to the constraints from $\gamma$-ray emission, quantum corrections due to the speculative memory burden effect do not modify this mass range. We also investigate the main characteristics of PBHs which are localized in the bulk. We show that PBHs localized in the bulk can make all cosmological dark matter if $10^{11} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. Finally, we comment on the black holes that could be produced if one advocates a space with two boundaries for the dark dimension.</description>

      <title>The Immortal Dyon Index Is Positive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microstates of supersymmetric black holes in asymptotically flat four-dimensional spacetime are expected to be bosonic due to the spherical symmetry of their horizons. This implies that the index counting the difference between bosonic and fermionic black hole microstates must be positive, as conjectured by Sen in arXiv:1008.4209. We show that the conjecture is satisfied by the index which counts 1/4-BPS states in N = 4 string theory forming single centered black holes, called immortal dyons. The proof relies on the relation between the indexed degeneracies and the coefficients of a family of mock modular forms, thus showing that black holes predict the sign of the Fourier coefficients of mock modular forms.</description>

      <title>(2+1)D topological phases with RT symmetry: many-body invariant, classification, and higher order edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common in condensed matter systems for reflection ($R$) and time-reversal ($T$) symmetry to both be broken while the combination $RT$ is preserved. In this paper we study invariants that arise due to $RT$ symmetry. We consider many-body systems of interacting fermions with fermionic symmetry groups $G_f = \mathbb{Z}_2^f \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, $U(1)^f \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, and $U(1)^f \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$. We show that (2+1)D invertible fermionic topological phases with these symmetries have a $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_8$, $\mathbb{Z}^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, and $\mathbb{Z}^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4$ classification, respectively, which we compute using the framework of $G$-crossed braided tensor categories. We provide a many-body $RT$ invariant in terms of a tripartite entanglement measure, and which we show can be understood using an edge conformal field theory computation in terms of vertex states. For $G_f = U(1)^f \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, which applies to charged fermions in a magnetic field, the non-trivial value of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant requires strong interactions. For symmetry-preserving boundaries, the phases are distinguished by zero modes at the intersection of the reflection axis and the boundary. Additional invariants arise in the presence of translation or rotation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Neutrino Decoupling and its Observable Imprints: Insights from Entropic-Dual Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very different processes characterize the decoupling of neutrinos to form the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) and the much later decoupling of photons from thermal equilibrium to form the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The C$\nu$B emerges from the fuzzy, energy-dependent neutrinosphere and encodes the physics operating in the early universe in the temperature range $T\sim 10\,{\rm MeV}$ to $T\sim10\,{\rm keV}$. This is the epoch where beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics may be influential in setting the light element abundances and the necessarily distorted fossil neutrino energy spectra. Here we use techniques honed in extensive CMB studies to analyze the C$\nu$B as calculated in detailed neutrino energy transport and nuclear reaction simulations. Our moment method, relative entropy, and differential visibility approach can leverage future high precision CMB and primordial abundance measurements to provide new insights into the C$\nu$B and any BSM physics it encodes. We demonstrate that the evolution of the energy spectrum of the C$\nu$B throughout the weak decoupling epoch is accurately captured in the Standard Model by only three parameters per species, a non-trivial conclusion given the deviation from thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we can interpret each of the three parameters as physical characteristics of a non-equilibrium system. The success of our compact description within the Standard Model motivates its use also in BSM scenarios. We demonstrate how observations of primordial light element abundances can be used to place constraints on the C$\nu$B energy spectrum, deriving response functions that can be applied for general C$\nu$B spectral distortions. Combined with the description of those deviations that we develop here, our methods provide a convenient and powerful framework to constrain the impact of BSM physics on the C$\nu$B.</description>

      <title>Exploring critical behavior of thermodynamic variables of the Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole in the restricted phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work delves into examining the thermodynamic properties of the four-dimensional Kerr-Newmann-AdS black hole, employing the recently proposed framework of restricted phase space thermodynamics (RPST). This approach introduces a novel set of paired thermodynamic variables: the central charge $C$ of the corresponding dual conformal field theory (CFT) and the chemical potential $\mu$. Through simple analysis, we establish fundamental relationships such as the Euler relation, Gibbs-Duhem relation, and the zeroth order homogeneity of intensive variables. Employing numerical techniques, we explore the thermodynamic processes between these conjugate variables. Our investigation reveals the first-order and second-order phase transitions across various macroscopic processes. Despite the absence of complete analytical expressions, our findings unveil striking similarities in behavior between RN-AdS and Kerr-AdS, underscoring the presence of underlying universality within the RPST formalism.</description>

      <title>Mass fluctuations in non-rotating BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of oscillations of a black-hole mass around its average value on the three-dimensional black hole geometry. Drawing on a classical framework that conceptualizes fluctuations near an event horizon as mass variations, we introduce a model where the metric of a black hole, formed from the collapse of a massive null shell, exhibits oscillatory behavior in spherical modes. This dynamic is encapsulated by a non-rotating BTZ-Vaidya solution, characterized by the black hole mass fluctuating at a resonant frequency $\omega$ and a small amplitude parameter $\mu_0$. Using a perturbative approach, solutions to the null geodesic equation are determined up to the second order in $\mu_0$. The temporal fluctuations of the event horizon's location induce alterations in the thermodynamic variables' values. Upon calculating the time-averaged values, it is observed that the mean Hawking temperature experiences a slight decrease due to these fluctuations, while the mean entropy exhibits an increase, deviating from trends observed in four- and higher-dimensional spacetimes. Further, the study delves into the influence of these fluctuations on the trajectories of null rays near the horizon, ultimately reaching the anti-de Sitter boundary at late times. The analytical computation of the general solution for the perturbed rays up to the second order underscores the novel approach of this study in examining the effects of mass oscillations on black hole thermodynamics and geometry, contributing a unique perspective to the field.</description>

      <title>Running Coupling and Running Quark Mass Effects on the Elastic Form Factors of Nucleons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the elastic electric and magnetic form factors of the proton, neutron and the charged roper resonance ($G_E^p$, $G_M^p$, $G_E^n$, $G_M^n$, $G_E^R$ and $G_M^R$) systematically in a constituent quark model. Three ingredients are crucial in this study: i) the mixing of the $|70, ^{2}8,2,0,(\frac{1}{2})^{\textmd{+}}\rangle$ and the $|56, ^{2}8,0,0,(\frac{1}{2})^{\textmd{+}}\rangle$ which produces a nonzero neutron electric form factor. ii) a running coupling constant that soften the form factors. iii) the running quark mass function, $M_q(p^2)$, which is responsible for the decreasing of the $\mu_p G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2)$ as $Q^2$ increases. The produced elastic form factors of the proton and neutron match the corresponding experiment values fairly well. Our study shows that $\mu_p G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2) \approx M_q(Q^2/9)/M_q(0)$ upto $Q^2 \approx 4 \text{GeV}^2$. We give predictions on the elactic form factors of the roper resonance, the charge and magnetic radius of the roper resonance compared with proton are $r^R_{E}/r^p_{E} \approx r^R_{M}/r^p_{M} \approx 1.5$.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Formalism: Concrete Realization of Joint Measurement for Heisenberg's Uncertainty Relation for Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that the Gaussian wave-packet formalism can serve as a concrete realization of the joint measurement of position and momentum, which is an essential element in understanding Heisenberg's original philosophy of the uncertainty principle, in line with the universal framework of error, disturbance, and their uncertainty relations developed by Lee and Tsutsui. We show that our joint measurement in the Gaussian phase space, being a Positive Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) measurement, smoothly interpolates between the projective measurements of position and momentum. We, for the first time, have obtained the Lee-Tsutsui (LT) error and the refined Lee error for the position-momentum measurement. We find that the LT uncertainty relation becomes trivial, $0=0$, in the limiting case of projective measurement of either position or momentum. Remarkably, in contrast to the LT relation, the refined Lee uncertainty relation, which assesses errors for local representability, provides a constant lower bound unaffected by these limits and is invariably saturated, for a pure Gaussian initial state. The obtained lower bound is in agreement with Heisenberg's value.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Maximum Masses of White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars, and Exotic Stars in Non-Minimal Derivative Coupling Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of astronomical observations opens the possibility of testing our current understanding of gravitational theory in the strong-field regime and probing any deviation from general relativity. We explore to what extent compact stars predicted by non-minimal derivative coupling (NMDC) gravity theory agree with observed data. We investigate white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs), and quark stars (QSs) mass and radius in various values of constant scalar $|Q_{\infty}|$ at coupling strength of $\eta=\pm1$. This study focuses on the astrophysical impacts of altering maximum masses by values of $|Q_{\infty}|$ and $\eta$. From an observational point of view, we found that WD stars are consistent with ultra-cold WD data at $|Q_{\infty}| \lesssim 0.2$. We also found that QS has a similar impact of mass-radius to NS, where the modification is more significant at higher (central) density. For NS and QS EoSs, the value $|Q_{\infty}|$ strongly alters the critical mass and might eliminate the $M-\rho_c$ turning point in the negative $\eta$ case. In that case, the sufficiently large $|Q_{\infty}|$ could predict $M&gt;2.6 M_\odot$ NS and QS, i.e., larger than GW190814 secondary counterpart. We suggest that the lower mass gap in the gravitational wave and x-ray binary mass population data might restrict the theory's $|Q_{\infty}|$.</description>

      <title>A search for super-imposed oscillations to the primordial power spectrum in Planck and SPT-3G 2018 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for super-imposed oscillations linearly or logarithmically spaced in Fourier wavenumbers in Planck and South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G) 2018 temperature and polarization data. The SPT-3G temperature and polarization data provide a new window to test these oscillations at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. We consider both models with a constant and a Gaussian modulated amplitude, which correspond to three and four additional parameters beyond power-law primordial power spectrum for the templates considered, respectively. We find that each of the four models considered can provide an improved fit to Planck data, consistently with previous findings, and to SPT-3G data, always compared to $\Lambda$CDM. For a constant amplitude of the superimposed oscillations, we find tighter constraints on the amplitude of the oscillations from the combined Planck/SPT-3G data set than in each individual data sets. When the ranges of parameters which provide a better fit to Planck and SPT-3G data overlap, as in the case of Gaussian modulated oscillations, we find a larger $\Delta \chi^2$ - $- 17 \, (-16)$ for logarithmic (linear) oscillations - in a combined Planck/SPT-3G data set than in each individual data sets. These findings will be further tested with upcoming CMB temperature and polarization measurements at high multipoles provided by ongoing ground experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized Kerr-Schild ansatz is proposed for the two metrics in bigravity which leads to linear interactions between the metrics and can be studied in the context of the double copy. By contracting the resulting spin-2 field bigravity equations of motion using Killing vector fields, we arrive to the single and zeroth copy equations for our ansatz. For the case of stationary solutions, we obtain two Maxwell and two conformally coupled equations for the single and zeroth copy respectively, and we do not have linear interactions. In the time-dependent case we obtain equations for our fields which are coupled. By decoupling these equations and at the zeroth copy level, we obtain a massless and a massive field whose mass is proportional to the Fierz-Pauli mass and depends on the interaction coefficients of the interaction potential between the metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.02409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take new algebraic and geometric perspectives on the combinatorial results recently obtained on the partition functions of critical massive gravities conjectured to be dual to Logarithmic CFTs throught the AdS$_3$/LCFT$_2$ correspondence. We show that the partition functions of logarithmic states can be expressed in terms of Schur polynomials. Subsequently, we show that the moduli space of the logarithmic states is the symmetric product $S^n \left( \mathbb{C}^2 \right)$. As the quotient of an affine space by the symmetric group, this orbifold space is shown to be described by Hilbert series that have palindromic numerators. The palindromic properties of the Hilbert series indicate that the orbifolds are Calabi-Yau, and allow for a new interpretation of the logarithmic state spaces in critical massive gravities as Calabi-Yau singular spaces.</description>

Abstract: We study the large $N$ matrix model for the index of 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills theory and its truncations to understand the dual AdS$_5$ black holes. Numerical studies of the truncated models provide insights on the black hole physics, some of which we investigate analytically with the full Yang-Mills matrix model. In particular, we find many branches of saddle points which describe the known black hole solutions. We analytically construct the saddle points dual to the small black holes whose sizes are much smaller than the AdS radius. They include the asymptotically flat BMPV black holes embedded in large AdS with novel thermodynamic instabilities.</description>

Abstract: We study supersymmetric AdS$_2\times Y_9$ solutions of 11d supergravity where $Y_9$ is an $S^7$ fibration over a Riemann surface equipped with a metric of non-constant curvature. We consider two classes of Riemann surface: the first is a spindle and the second is a topological disc. These solutions are interpreted as the near-horizon limit of M2 branes wrapped on the Riemann surface and describe the near-horizon of a 4d black hole. In the case of the topological disc there are additional flavour M2 branes smeared on a five-sphere embedded in the transverse $S^7$. We perform a full global analysis of both classes of solutions, both from a 4d and an 11d viewpoint. Finally we compute the two-dimensional Newton's constant from which we obtain a prediction for the entropy of the black hole.</description>

Abstract: We show that the partition function of the logarithmic sector of critical topologically massive gravity which represents a series expansion of composition of functions, can be expressed as a sum over rooted trees. Our work brings a connection between integrable hierarchies of mathematical physics, combinatorial Hopf algebras and rooted trees, by explaining how the $\tau$-functions of the (potential) Burgers and KP integrable hierarchies appearing in the partition function of log gravity conceal the Hopf algebra of composition of functions, known as the Fa\`a di Bruno algebra, of the same type as the celebrated Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of rooted trees and Feynman diagrams. In particular, the Hurwitz numbers appearing in the partition function arise as coefficients of isomorphism classes of rooted trees. A parallel is drawn between our findings and established results in the statistical physics literature concerning certain systems with quenched disorder on trees, associated to nonlinear partial differential equations admitting traveling wave solutions. This should be of particular interest in view of a further description of the disorder observed in log gravity.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the matching of black hole tidal responses: a systematic study of relativistic and logarithmic corrections</title>

Abstract: The worldline effective field theory (EFT) gives a gauge-invariant definition of black hole conservative tidal responses (Love numbers), dissipation numbers, and their spin-0 and spin-1 analogs. In the first part of this paper we show how the EFT allows us to circumvent the source/response ambiguity without having to use the analytic continuation prescription. The source/response ambiguity appears if Post-Newtonian (PN)corrections to external sources overlap with the response. However, these PN corrections can be clearly identified and isolated using the EFT. We illustrate that by computing static one-point functions of various external fields perturbing the four-dimensional Schwarzschild geometry. Upon resumming all relevant Feynman diagrams, we find that the PN terms that may mimic the response actually vanish for static black holes. Thus, the extraction of Love numbers from matching the EFT and general relativity (GR) calculations is completely unambiguous, and it implies that the Love numbers vanish identically for all types of perturbations. We also study in detail another type of fine tuning in the EFT, the absence of Love numbers' running. We show that logarithmic corrections to Love numbers do stem from individual loop diagrams in generic gauges, but cancel after all diagrams are summed over. In the particular cases of spin-0 and spin-2 fields the logarithms are completely absent if one uses the Kaluza-Klein metric decomposition. In the second part of the paper we compute frequency-dependent dissipative response contributions to the one-point functions using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We extract black hole dissipation numbers by comparing the one-point functions in the EFT and GR. Our results are in perfect agreement with those obtained from a manifestly gauge-invariant matching of absorption cross-sections.</description>

      <title>BPS Dendroscopy on Local $P^2$</title>

Abstract: The spectrum of BPS states in type IIA string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold famously jumps across codimension-one walls in complexified K\"ahler moduli space, leading to an intricate chamber structure. The Split Attractor Flow Conjecture posits that the BPS index $\Omega_z(\gamma)$ for given charge $\gamma$ and moduli $z$ can be reconstructed from the attractor indices $\Omega_*(\gamma_i)$ counting BPS states of charge $\gamma_i$ in their respective attractor chamber, by summing over a finite set of decorated rooted flow trees known as attractor flow trees. If correct, this provides a classification (or dendroscopy) of the BPS spectrum into different topologies of nested BPS bound states, each having a simple chamber structure. Here we investigate this conjecture for the simplest, albeit non-compact, Calabi-Yau threefold, namely the canonical bundle over the projective plane $P^2$. Since the K\"ahler moduli space has complex dimension one and the attractor flow preserves the argument of the central charge, attractor flow trees coincide with scattering sequences of rays in a two-dimensional slice of the scattering diagram in the space of stability conditions on the derived category of compactly supported coherent sheaves on $K_{P^2}$. We combine previous results on the scattering diagram of $K_{P^2}$ in the large volume slice with new results near the orbifold point $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_3$, and prove that the Split Attractor Flow Conjecture holds true on the physical slice of $\Pi$-stability conditions. In particular, while there is an infinite set of initial rays related by the group $\Gamma_1(3)$ of auto-equivalences, only a finite number of possible decompositions $\gamma=\sum_i\gamma_i$ contribute to the index $\Omega_z(\gamma)$ for any $\gamma$ and $z$, with constituents $\gamma_i$ related by spectral flow to the fractional branes at the orbifold point.</description>

Abstract: We give a probabilistic interpretation of the configurational partition function of the logarithmic sector of critical cosmological topologically massive gravity, in which the Hurwitz numbers considered in our previous works assume the role of probabilities in a distribution on cycles of permutations. In particular, it is shown that the permutations are distributed according to the Ewens sampling formula which plays a major role in the theory of partition structures and their applications to diffusive processes of fragmentation, and in random trees. This new probabilistic result together with the previously established evidence of solitons in the theory provide new insights on the instability originally observed in the theory. We argue that the unstable propagation of a seed soliton at single particle level induces the generation of fragments of defect soliton clusters with rooted tree configuration at multiparticle level, providing a disordered landscape. The Shannon information entropy of the probability distribution is then introduced as a measure of the evolution of the unstable soliton clusters generated. Finally, based on Feynman's path integral formalism on permutation symmetry in the $\lambda$-transition of liquid helium, we argue that the existence of permutation cycles in the configurational log partition function indicates the presence of Bose-Einstein condensates in log gravity.</description>

      <title>Review of the No-Boundary Wave Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the universe is treated as a quantum system, it is described by a wave function. This wave function is a function not only of the matter fields, but also of spacetime. The no-boundary proposal is the idea that the wave function should be calculated by summing over geometries that have no boundary to the past, and over regular matter configurations on these geometries. Accordingly, the universe is finite, self-contained and the big bang singularity is avoided. Moreover, given a dynamical theory, the no-boundary proposal provides probabilities for various solutions of the theory. In this sense it provides a quantum theory of initial conditions.
  This review starts with a general overview of the framework of quantum cosmology, describing both the canonical and path integral approaches, and their interpretations. After recalling several heuristic motivations for the no-boundary proposal, its consequences are illustrated with simple examples, mainly in the context of cosmic inflation. We review how to include perturbations, assess the classicality of spacetime and how probabilities may be derived. A special emphasis is given to explicit implementations in minisuperspace, to observational consequences, and to the relationship of the no-boundary wave function with string theory. At each stage, the required analytic and numerical techniques are explained in detail, including the Picard-Lefschetz approach to oscillating integrals.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tidal Response of Kerr Black Holes from Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We match scattering amplitudes in point particle effective field theory (EFT) and general relativity to extract low frequency dynamical tidal responses of rotating (Kerr) black holes to all orders in spin. In the conservative sector, we study local worldline couplings that correspond to the time-derivative expansion of the black hole tidal response function. These are dynamical (frequency-dependent) generalizations of the static Love numbers. We identify and extract couplings of three types of subleading local worldline operators: the curvature time derivative terms, the spin - curvature time derivative couplings, and quadrupole - octupole mixing operators that arise due to the violation of spherical symmetry. The first two subleading couplings are non-zero and exhibit a classical renormalization group running; we explicitly present their scheme-independent beta functions. The conservative mixing terms, however, vanish as a consequence of vanishing static Love numbers. In the non-conservative sector, we match the dissipation numbers at next-to-leading and next-to-next-to leading orders in frequency. In passing, we identify terms in the general relativity absorption probabilities that originate from tails and short-scale logarithmic corrections to the lowest order dissipation contributions.</description>

      <title>Scaling symmetry, Smarr relation, and the extended first law in lower-dimensional Lovelock gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it was discovered that lower-dimensional versions of Lovelock gravity exist as scalar-tensor theories that are examples of Horndeski gravity. We study the thermodynamics of the static black hole solutions satisfying $g_{tt}g_{rr}=-1$ in these theories up to cubic order through Euclidean methods. Considering solutions with spherical, planar and hyperbolic event horizons ($k=+1, 0, -1$), we show that the universality of the thermodynamics for planar black holes ($k=0$) and the extended 1st law that include the variation of the couplings together with their associated potentials hold also in lower dimensions. We find that in $D=4, 6$ where the 2nd- and the 3rd-order Lovelock Lagrangians are boundary terms respectively, the Smarr relation is modified since the entropy is not a homogenous function in these dimensions. We also present a derivation of the Smarr relation and its modified version based on the global scaling properties of the reduced action that is used to obtain the solutions consistently. Unlike the other hairy black hole solutions that have been analyzed before, despite the terms in the reduced action that break the scaling symmetry, the derivation still follows from a conserved Noether charge.</description>

      <title>Higher-form symmetry and chiral transport in real-time lattice $U(1)$ gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study classical lattice simulations of theories of electrodynamics coupled to charged matter at finite temperature, interpreting them using the higher-form symmetry formulation of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We compute transport coefficients using classical Kubo formulas on the lattice and show that the properties of the simulated plasma are in complete agreement with the predictions from effective field theories. In particular, the higher-form formulation allows us to understand from hydrodynamic considerations the relaxation rate of axial charge in the chiral plasma observed in previous simulations. A key point is that the resistivity of the plasma -- defined in terms of Kubo formulas for the electric field in the 1-form formulation of MHD -- remains a well-defined and predictive quantity at strong electromagnetic coupling. However, the Kubo formulas used to define the conventional conductivity vanish at low frequencies due to electrodynamic fluctuations, and thus the concept of the conductivity of a gauged electric current must be interpreted with care.</description>

      <title>AdS$_3$ Einstein Gravity and Boundary Description: Pedagogical Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the various aspects of the 3D Einstein gravity theory with a negative cosmological constant and its boundary description. We also explore its connections to CFTs, modular symmetry, and holography. It is worth noting that this particular theory is topological in nature, which means that all the physical degrees of freedom are located on the boundary. Additionally, we can derive the boundary description on a torus, which takes the form of a 2D Schwarzian theory. This observation suggests that the relevant degrees of freedom for the theory can be described using this 2D theory. Because of the renormalizability of the 3D gravity theory, one can probe the quantum regime. This suggests that it is possible to investigate quantum phenomena. Unlike the conventional CFTs, when considering the AdS$_3$ background, the boundary theory loses modular symmetry. This represents a departure from the usual behavior of CFT and is quite intriguing. The Weyl transformation induces anomaly in CFTs, and we indicate that applying this transformation to the 2D Schwarzian theory leads to similar results. Summing over all geometries with the asymptotic AdS$_3$ boundary condition is equivalent to summing over a modular group. The partition function is one-loop exact and therefore an analytical expression from the summation. This theory holds potential applications in Quantum Information and is a recurring theme in the study of holography, where gravitational theories are connected with CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using methods from the conformal bootstrap, we study the properties of Noether currents in the critical $O(n)$ loop model. We confirm that they do not give rise to a Kac-Moody algebra (for $n\neq 2$), a result expected from the underlying lack of unitarity. By studying four-point functions in detail, we fully determine the current-current OPEs, and thus obtain several structure constants with physical meaning. We find in particular that the terms $:\!J\bar{J}\!:$ in the identity and adjoint channels vanish exactly, invalidating the argument made in \cite{car93-1} that adding orientation-dependent interactions to the model should lead to continuously varying exponents in self-avoiding walks. We also determine the residue of the identity channel in the $JJ$ two-point function, finding that it coincides both with the result of a transfer-matrix computation for an orientation-dependent correlation function in the lattice model, and with an earlier Coulomb gas computation of Cardy \cite{car93}. This is, to our knowledge, one of the first instances where the Coulomb gas formalism and the bootstrap can be successfully compared.</description>

Abstract: Real time holography is studied in the context of the embedding space formalism. In the first part of this paper, we present matching conditions for on-shell integer spin fields when going from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature on AdS background. Using the BTZ black hole as an example, we discuss various ways of lifting the physical solution from the AdS surface to the whole embedding space. The BTZ propagator for higher spin field is expressed elegantly in terms of the embedding coordinates. In the second part of the paper, we develop the proposed duality between higher spin theory and vector models. We obtain a specific map between the field configurations of these two theories in real time, so called Lorentzian AdS/CFT map. We conclude by exploring the matching conditions for higher spin fields satisfying the proposed bulk quadratic action. The physical and ghost modes can be treated independently during the Wick rotation; only physical modes are considered to be external modes.</description>

Abstract: On the basis of (i) the discrete and continuous symmetries (and corresponding conserved charges), (ii) the ensuing algebraic structures of the symmetry operators and conserved charges, and (iii) a few basic concepts behind the subject of differential geometry, we show that the celebrated Friedberg-Lee-Pang-Ren (FLPR) quantum mechanical model (describing the motion of a single non-relativistic particle of unit mass under the influence of the general spatial 2D rotationally invariant potential) provides a tractable physical example for the Hodge theory within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism where the symmetry operators and conserved charges lead to the physical realizations of the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry at the algebraic level. We concisely mention the Hodge decomposition theorem in the quantum Hilbert space of states and choose the harmonic states as the real physical states of our theory. We discuss the physicality criteria w.r.t. the conserved and nilpotent versions of the (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST charges and the physical consequences that ensue from them.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate various deformations within the framework of Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs invariant field theory (BMSFT). Specifically, we explore the impact of Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) symmetry on the theory by introducing key deformations, namely, $T \overline{T}$, $JT_{\mu}$, and $\sqrt{T \overline{T}}$ deformations. In the context of generic seed theories possessing BMS symmetry, we derive the first-order correction of correlation functions using the systematic application of BMS symmetry ward identities. However, it is worth noting that higher-order corrections are intricately dependent on the specific characteristics of the seed theories. To illustrate our findings, we select the BMS free scalar and free fermion as representative seed theories. We then proceed to analytically determine the deformed action by solving the nontrivial flow equations. Additionally, we extend our analysis to include second-order deformations within these deformed theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Stokes-Mueller method to calculate the cross sections associated with multiple Compton scattering of an arbitrary two-photon system. This method is used to calculate the cross section in the scenario in which one of the maximally entangled annihilation photons undergoes intermediate Compton scattering followed by the detection of both photons using a pair of Compton polarimeters. The method accounts for potential quantum-decoherence effects caused by Compton scattering. Despite being grounded in quantum field theory, the method does not require an in-depth understanding of its typically intricate prerequisites. As a result, this method is anticipated to be accessible to a broader community of physicists and is readily applicable in Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

Abstract: Carrollian holography is supposed to describe gravity in four-dimensional asymptotically flat space-time by the three-dimensional Carrollian CFT living at null infinity. We transform superstring scattering amplitudes into the correlation functions of primary fields of Carrollian CFT depending on the three-dimensional coordinates of the celestial sphere and a retarded time coordinate. The power series in the inverse string tension is converted to a whole tower of both UV and IR finite descendants of the underlying field-theoretical Carrollian amplitude. We focus on four-point amplitudes involving gauge bosons and gravitons in type I open superstring theory and in closed heterotic superstring theory at the tree-level. We also discuss the limit of infinite retarded time coordinates, where the string world-sheet becomes celestial.</description>

Abstract: We utilize a novel method for the partial-wave unitarity recently suggested in [1] to analyse the hypergeometric Coon amplitude. In this approach we use a new type of harmonic numbers as a basis. Owing to the properties of the harmonic numbers this method bypasses lots of difficulties and can be used to derive a clear and unified form for the partial-wave coefficients. This new approach further streamlines the partial-wave unitarity analysis. As an instance, we re-derive the unitarity bounds from Regge trajectory analysis and find the new critical condition of the hypergeometric Coon amplitude. Our new method also benefits the discussion on the various limits of this amplitude. Specifically, we demonstrate the manifest positivity of super string below $d\leq10$ from our new perspective.</description>

      <title>Schur line defect correlators and giant graviton expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Schur line defect correlators in four dimensional $\mathcal N=4$ $U(N)$ SYM and their giant graviton expansion encoding finite $N$ corrections to the large $N$ limit. We compute in closed form the single giant graviton contribution to correlators with general insertions of $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS charged Wilson lines. For the 2-point function with fundamental and anti-fundamental Wilson lines, we match the result from fluctuations of two half-infinite strings ending on the giant graviton, recently proposed in arXiv:2403.11543. In particular, we prove exact factorization of the defect contribution with respect to wrapped D3 brane fluctuations representing the single giant graviton correction to the undecorated Schur index. This follows from a finite-difference representation of the Schur line defect index in terms of the index without defects, and similar factorization holds quite generally for more complicated defect configurations. In particular, the single giant graviton contribution to the 4-point function with two fundamental and two anti-fundamental lines is computed and discussed in this perspective.</description>

      <title>Fracton Self-Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fracton order describes novel quantum phases of matter that host quasiparticles with restricted mobility, and thus lies beyond the existing paradigm of topological order. In particular, excitations that cannot move without creating multiple excitations are called fractons. Here we address a fundamental open question -- can the notion of self-exchange statistics be naturally defined for fractons, given their complete immobility as isolated excitations? Surprisingly, we demonstrate how fractons can be exchanged, and show that their self-statistics is a key part of the characterization of fracton orders. We derive general constraints satisfied by the fracton self-statistics in a large class of Abelian fracton orders. Finally, we show the existence of nontrivial fracton self-statistics in some twisted variants of the checkerboard model and Haah's code, establishing that these models are in distinct quantum phases as compared to their untwisted cousins.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Deformation of an AdS Spherical Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the real-time dynamics during the spontaneous deformation of an unstable spherical black hole in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. For the initial value, the static solutions with spherical symmetry are obtained numerically, revealing the presence of a spinodal region in the phase diagram. From the linear stability analysis, we find that only the central part of such a thermodynamically unstable spinodal region leads to the emergence of a type of axial instability. To trigger the dynamical instability, an axial perturbation is imposed on the scalar field. As a result, by the fully nonlinear dynamical simulation, the spherical symmetry of the gravitational system is broken spontaneously, leading to the formation of an axisymmetric black hole.</description>

      <title>Tensor Loop Reduction via the Baikov Representation and an Auxiliary Vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00930v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple and efficient approach for the general reduction of one-loop integrals. Our method employs the introduction of an auxiliary vector and the identification of the tensor structure as an auxiliary propagator. This key insight allows us to express a wide range of one-loop integrals, encompassing both tensor structures and higher poles, in the Baikov representation. By establishing an integral-by-parts (IBP) relation, we derive a recursive formula that systematically solves the one-loop reduction problem, even in the presence of various degenerate cases. Our proposed strategy is characterized by its simplicity and effectiveness, offering a significant advancement in the field of one-loop calculations.</description>

      <title>A note on no-hair properties of static black holes in four and higher dimensional spacetimes with cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study no-hair properties of static black holes in four and higher dimensional spacetimes with a cosmological constant. For the vanishing cosmological constant case, we show a no-hair theorem and also a no-short-hair theorem under certain conditions for the energy-momentum of matter fields. For the positive cosmological constant case, we discuss conditions for hairy static black holes to exist in terms of the energy density of matter fields evaluated at the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon. For the negative cosmological constant case, we study conditions for hairy black holes by presenting a no-hair theorem in which the asymptotic structure is assumed to be determined by the true cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the dynamics of interacting vector-like dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revise the dynamics of interacting vector-like dark energy, a theoretical framework proposed to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe. By investigating the interaction between vector-like dark energy and dark matter, we analyze its effects on the cosmic expansion history and the thermodynamics of the accelerating universe. Our results demonstrate that the presence of interaction significantly influences the evolution of vector-like dark energy, leading to distinct features in its equation of state and energy density. We compare our findings with observational data and highlight the importance of considering interactions in future cosmological studies.</description>

      <title>Persistent gravitational wave observables: Nonlinearities in (non-)geodesic deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The usual gravitational wave memory effect can be understood as a change in the separation of two initially comoving observers due to a burst of gravitational waves. Over the past few decades, a wide variety of other, "persistent" observables which measure permanent effects on idealized detectors have been introduced, each probing distinct physical effects. These observables can be defined in (regions of) any spacetime where there exists a notion of radiation, such as perturbation theory off of a fixed background, nonlinear plane wave spacetimes, or asymptotically flat spacetimes. Many of the persistent observables defined in the literature have been considered only in asymptotically flat spacetimes, and the perturbative nature of such calculations has occasionally obscured deeper relationships between these observables that hold more generally. The goal of this paper is to show how these more general results arise, and to do so we focus on two observables related to the separation between two, potentially accelerated observers. The first is the curve deviation, which is a natural generalization of the displacement memory, and also contains what this paper proposes to call drift memory (previously called "subleading displacement memory") and ballistic memory. The second is a relative proper time shift that arises between the two observers, either at second order in their initial separation and relative velocity, or in the presence of relative acceleration. The results of this paper are, where appropriate, entirely non-perturbative in the curvature of spacetime, and so could be used beyond leading order in asymptotically flat spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Kerr Memory Effect at Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the memory effect due to a gravitational wave striking a Kerr black hole as seen by an observer at null infinity. This is done by working in Bondi--Sachs coordinates. It was shown by Hawking, Perry, and Strominger (HPS) that the memory effect due to a gravitational shockwave is seen as a pure BMS supertranslation from null infinity. Hence, it is of interest to compute the supertranslated Kerr solution in Bondi--Sachs coordinates. Finally, the gravitational wave is said to implant soft supertranslation hair on the event horizon of the black hole which carries superrotation charge. We will explicitly calculate the change in superrotation charge on the event horizon due to the supertranslation hair.</description>

      <title>The Wilson-Fisher Fixed point revisited: importance of the form of the cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we re-examine the Wilson Fisher fixed point. We study Wilsonian momentum space renormalization group (RG) flow for various forms of the cutoff. We show that already at order $\left(4-d\right)^{1}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the $\phi^{4}$ theory, there are changes to the position of the fixed point and the direction of irrelevant coupling parameters. We also show in a multi-flavor $\phi^{4}$ model that symmetries of the Lagrange function can be destroyed if the different flavors have different cutoffs (that is the Lagrangian can flow to a non-symmetric fixed point). Some related comments are made about a similar situation in parquet RG (pRG). In future works we will study Wilsonian RG to order $\left(4-d\right)^{2}$ and find non-universal critical exponents that depend on the cutoff.</description>
