      <title>NeRF-APT: A New NeRF Framework for Wireless Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have recently attracted significant attention in the field of wireless channel prediction, primarily due to their capability for high-fidelity reconstruction of complex wireless measurement environments. However, the ray-tracing component of NeRF-based methods faces challenges in realistically representing wireless scenarios, mainly due to the limited expressive power of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose NeRF-APT, an encoder-decoder architecture integrated within a NeRF-based wireless channel prediction framework. Our architecture leverages the strengths of NeRF-like models in learning environmental features and exploits encoder-decoder modules' capabilities for critical information extraction. Additionally, we incorporate an attention mechanism within the skip connections between encoder and decoder layers, significantly enhancing contextual understanding across layers. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on several realistic and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in wireless channel prediction.</description>

      <title>BAROC: Concealing Packet Losses in LSNs with Bimodal Behavior Awareness for Livecast Ingestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Low-Earth Orbit satellite networks (LSNs), exemplified by initiatives like \emph{Starlink}, \emph{OneWeb} and \emph{Kuiper}, has ushered in a new era of ``Internet from Space" global connectivity. Recent studies have shown that LSNs are capable of providing unprecedented download capacity and low latency to support Livecast viewing. However, Livecast ingestion still faces significant challenges, such as limited uplink capacity, bandwidth degradation, and the burst of packet loss due to frequent satellite reallocations, which cause previous recovery and adaptive solutions to be inferior under this new scenario. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth measurement study dedicated to understanding the implications of satellite reallocations, which reveals that the network status during reallocations with network anomalies exhibits a different distribution, leading to bimodal behaviors on the overall network performance. Motivated by this finding, we propose BAROC, a framework that can effectively conceal burst packet losses by combining a novel proposed MTP-Informer with bimodal behavior awareness during satellite reallocation. BAROC enhances video QoE on the server side by addressing the above challenges and jointly determining the optimal video encoding and recovery parameters. Our extensive evaluation shows that BAROC outperforms other video delivery recovery approaches, achieving an average PSNR improvement of $1.95$ dB and a maximum of $3.44$ dB, along with enhancements in frame rate and parity packet utilization. Additionally, a comprehensive ablation study is conducted to assess the effectiveness of MTP-Informer and components in BAROC.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Evaluation of Indoor LoRaWAN Environment-Aware Propagation for 6G: MLR, ANOVA, and Residual Distribution Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling path loss in indoor LoRaWAN technology deployments is inherently challenging due to structural obstructions, occupant density and activities, and fluctuating environmental conditions. This study proposes a two-stage approach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor office at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First, we implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional propagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we demonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained variance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by fitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy, Student's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models with one to five components. Our results show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual heterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly outperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward ultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows that environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network design in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.</description>

      <title>MEC Task Offloading in AIoT: A User-Centric DRL Model Splitting Inference Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), mobile edge computing (MEC) becomes an essential technology underpinning AIoT applications. However, multi-angle resource constraints, multi-user task competition, and the complexity of task offloading decisions in dynamic MEC environments present new technical challenges. Therefore, a user-centric deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model splitting inference scheme is proposed to address the problem. This scheme combines model splitting inference technology and designs a UCMS_MADDPG-based offloading algorithm to realize efficient model splitting inference responses in the dynamic MEC environment with multi-angle resource constraints. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem that integrates resource allocation, server selection, and task offloading, aiming to minimize the weighted sum of task execution delay and energy consumption. We also introduce a user-server co-selection algorithm to address the selection issue between users and servers. Furthermore, we design an algorithm centered on user pre-decision to coordinate the outputs of continuous and discrete hybrid decisions, and introduce a priority sampling mechanism based on reward-error trade-off to optimize the experience replay mechanism of the network. Simulation results show that the proposed UCMS_MADDPG-based offloading algorithm demonstrates superior overall performance compared with other benchmark algorithms in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Improving QoS Prediction in Urban V2X Networks by Leveraging Data from Leading Vehicles and Historical Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the evolution of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology and increased deployment of 5G networks and edge computing, Predictive Quality of Service (PQoS) is seen as an enabler for resilient and adaptive V2X communication systems. PQoS incorporates data-driven techniques, such as Machine Learning (ML), to forecast/predict Key Performing Indicators (KPIs) such as throughput, latency, etc. In this paper, we aim to predict downlink throughput in an urban environment using the Berlin V2X cellular dataset. We select features from the ego and lead vehicles to train different ML models to help improve the predicted throughput for the ego vehicle. We identify these features based on an in-depth exploratory data analysis. Results show an improvement in model performance when adding features from the lead vehicle. Moreover, we show that the improvement in model performance is model-agnostic.</description>

      <title>Assessing SSL/TLS Certificate Centralization: Implications for Digital Sovereignty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SSL/TLS is a fundamental technology in the network protocol stack that enables encrypted data transmission and authentication of web domains. However, the current model relies on a small number of Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide and validate certificates, thus creating a highly centralized ecosystem. In this paper, we analyze the degree of centralization of certificate provisioning from CAs in two major political groups: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) and the European Union (EU). We have found that over 75\% of certificates for both BRICS and EU domains originate from CAs based in the United States, indicating possible risks to their digital sovereignty due to the high level of external dependency. This indicates the need for nations within those groups to research alternatives to reduce the high level of dependency on foreign CAs and increase their digital autonomy.</description>

      <title>Trusted Identities for AI Agents: Leveraging Telco-Hosted eSIM Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of autonomous AI agents in enterprise and industrial environments introduces a critical challenge: how to securely assign, verify, and manage their identities across distributed systems. Existing identity frameworks based on API keys, certificates, or application-layer credentials lack the infrastructure-grade trust, lifecycle control, and interoperability needed to manage agents operating independently in sensitive contexts.
  In this paper, we propose a conceptual architecture that leverages telecom-grade eSIM infrastructure, specifically hosted by mobile network operators (MNOs), to serve as a root of trust for AI agents. Rather than embedding SIM credentials in hardware devices, we envision a model where telcos host secure, certified hardware modules (eUICC or HSM) that store and manage agent-specific eSIM profiles. Agents authenticate remotely via cryptographic APIs or identity gateways, enabling scalable and auditable access to enterprise networks and services.
  We explore use cases such as onboarding enterprise automation agents, securing AI-driven financial systems, and enabling trust in inter-agent communications. We identify current limitations in GSMA and 3GPP standards, particularly their device centric assumptions, and propose extensions to support non-physical, software-based agents within trusted execution environments. This paper is intended as a conceptual framework to open discussion around standardization, security architecture, and the role of telecom infrastructure in the evolving agent economy.</description>

      <title>Aerial Active STAR-RIS-assisted Satellite-Terrestrial Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An integration of satellites and terrestrial networks is crucial for enhancing performance of next generation communication systems. However, the networks are hindered by the long-distance path loss and security risks in dense urban environments. In this work, we propose a satellite-terrestrial covert communication system assisted by the aerial active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (AASTAR-RIS) to improve the channel capacity while ensuring the transmission covertness. Specifically, we first derive the minimal detection error probability (DEP) under the worst condition that the Warden has perfect channel state information (CSI). Then, we formulate an AASTAR-RIS-assisted satellite-terrestrial covert communication optimization problem (ASCCOP) to maximize the sum of the fair channel capacity for all ground users while meeting the strict covert constraint, by jointly optimizing the trajectory and active beamforming of the AASTAR-RIS. Due to the challenges posed by the complex and high-dimensional state-action spaces as well as the need for efficient exploration in dynamic environments, we propose a generative deterministic policy gradient (GDPG) algorithm, which is a generative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve the ASCCOP. Concretely, the generative diffusion model (GDM) is utilized as the policy representation of the algorithm to enhance the exploration process by generating diverse and high-quality samples through a series of denoising steps. Moreover, we incorporate an action gradient mechanism to accomplish the policy improvement of the algorithm, which refines the better state-action pairs through the gradient ascent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms important benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Towards a Distributed Federated Learning Aggregation Placement using Particle Swarm Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning has become a promising distributed learning concept with extra insurance on data privacy. Extensive studies on various models of Federated learning have been done since the coinage of its term. One of the important derivatives of federated learning is hierarchical semi-decentralized federated learning, which distributes the load of the aggregation task over multiple nodes and parallelizes the aggregation workload at the breadth of each level of the hierarchy. Various methods have also been proposed to perform inter-cluster and intra-cluster aggregation optimally. Most of the solutions, nonetheless, require monitoring the nodes' performance and resource consumption at each round, which necessitates frequently exchanging systematic data. To optimally perform distributed aggregation in SDFL with minimal reliance on systematic data, we propose Flag-Swap, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method that optimizes the aggregation placement according only to the processing delay. Our simulation results show that PSO-based placement can find the optimal placement relatively fast, even in scenarios with many clients as candidates for aggregation. Our real-world docker-based implementation of Flag-Swap over the recently emerged FL framework shows superior performance compared to black-box-based deterministic placement strategies, with about 43% minutes faster than random placement, and 32% minutes faster than uniform placement, in terms of total processing time.</description>

      <title>Two-Fold Byzantine Fault Tolerance Algorithm: Byzantine Consensus in Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and secure method for storing and authenticating data, rendering it well-suited for various applications such as digital currencies, supply chain management, and voting systems. However, the decentralized nature of blockchain also exposes it to vulnerabilities, particularly Byzantine faults, which arise when nodes in the network behave maliciously or encounter unexpected failures. Such incidents can result in inconsistencies within the blockchain and, in extreme scenarios, lead to a breakdown in consensus. Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithms are crafted to tackle this challenge by ensuring that network nodes can agree on the blockchain's state even in the presence of faulty or malicious nodes. To bolster the system's resilience against these faults, it is imperative to detect them within the system. However, our examination of existing literature reveals a prevalent assumption: solutions typically operate under constraints regarding the number of faulty nodes. Such constraints confine the proposed solutions to ideal environments, limiting their practical applicability. In response, we propose a novel approach inspired by social paradigms, employing a trusted and fully monitored communication sub-process to detect Byzantine nodes. Upon detection, these nodes can be either disregarded in the consensus-building process, subjected to penalties, or undergo modifications as per the system's policy. Finally, we statistically demonstrate that our approach achieves a detection probability that exceeds 95\% for Byzantine nodes. In essence, our methodology ensures that if Byzantine nodes exhibit malicious behavior, healthy nodes can identify them with a confidence level of 95\%.</description>

      <title>Balancing Costs and Utilities in Future Networks via Market Equilibrium with Externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of market equilibrium (ME) in future wireless networks, with multiple actors competing and negotiating for a pool of heterogeneous resources (communication and computing) while meeting constraints in terms of global cost. The latter is defined in a general way but is associated with energy and/or carbon emissions. In this direction, service providers competing for network resources do not acquire the latter, but rather the right to consume, given externally defined policies and regulations. We propose to apply the Fisher market model, and prove its convergence towards an equilibrium between utilities, regulatory constraints, and individual budgets. The model is then applied to an exemplary use case of access network, edge computing, and cloud resources, and numerical results assess the theoretical findings of convergence, under different assumptions on the utility function and more or less stringent constraints.</description>

      <title>Memory-efficient Sketch Acceleration for Handling Large Network Flows on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sketch-based algorithms for network traffic monitoring have drawn increasing interest in recent years due to their sub-linear memory efficiency and high accuracy. As the volume of network traffic grows, software-based sketch implementations cannot match the throughput of the incoming network flows. FPGA-based hardware sketch has shown better performance compared to software running on a CPU when handling these packets. Among the various sketch algorithms, Count-min sketch is one of the most popular and efficient. However, due to the limited amount of on-chip memory, the FPGA-based count-Min sketch accelerator suffers from performance drops as network traffic grows. In this work, we propose a hardware-friendly architecture with a variable width memory counter for count-min sketch. Our architecture provides a more compact design to store the sketch data structure effectively, allowing us to support larger hash tables and reduce overestimation errors. The design makes use of a P4-based programmable data plane and the AMD OpenNIC shell. The design is implemented and verified on the Open Cloud Testbed running on AMD Alveo U280s and can keep up with the 100 Gbit link speed.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning With LLMs Interaction For Distributed Diffusion Model Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has attracted significant attention, but two key challenges remain: maximizing subjective Quality of Experience (QoE) and improving energy efficiency, which are particularly pronounced in widely adopted Generative Diffusion Model (GDM)-based image generation services. In this paper, we propose a novel user-centric Interactive AI (IAI) approach for service management, with a distributed GDM-based AIGC framework that emphasizes efficient and cooperative deployment. The proposed method restructures the GDM inference process by allowing users with semantically similar prompts to share parts of the denoising chain. Furthermore, to maximize the users' subjective QoE, we propose an IAI approach, i.e., Reinforcement Learning With Large Language Models Interaction (RLLI), which utilizes Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered generative agents to replicate user interaction, providing real-time and subjective QoE feedback aligned with diverse user personalities. Lastly, we present the GDM-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (GDDPG) algorithm, adapted to the proposed RLLI framework, to allocate communication and computing resources effectively while accounting for subjective user traits and dynamic wireless conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that G-DDPG improves total QoE by 15% compared with the standard DDPG algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Highly Scalable LLM Clusters with Optical Interconnect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose \emph{LumosCore} to build high-bandwidth and large-scale data center networks for LLM jobs. By replacing the core-layer electrical packet switches by optical circuit switches, \emph{LumosCore} could achieves $2\times$ increase in bandwidth or $8\times$ increase in network size. We offer the detailed design of \emph{LumosCore} at both deployment stage and running stage. At deployment stage, we propose Interleaved Wiring, which is compatible with all possible logical topologies. At running stage, we design polynomial-time algorithms for GPU placement, logical topology generating and OCS reconfiguration to minimize network contention and reduce impact to scheduled jobs. We evaluate \emph{LumosCore} using both testbed experiments and large-scale simulation. Compared to traditional hybrid optical/electrical architectures, \emph{LumosCore} increases the end-to-end training throughput by up to 39.5\% on a 128-node testbed. Compared to the state-of-art Clos architectures, \emph{LumosCore} reduces the average job completion time by up to 34.1\% in a 16k simulation platform.</description>

      <title>D-LoRa: a Distributed Parameter Adaptation Scheme for LoRa Network</title>

Abstract: The deployment of LoRa networks necessitates joint performance optimization, including packet delivery rate, energy efficiency, and throughput. Additionally, multiple LoRa parameters for packet transmission must be dynamically configured to tailor the performance metrics prioritization across varying channel environments. Because of the coupling relationship between LoRa parameters and metrics, existing works have opted to focus on certain parameters or specific metrics to circumvent the intricate coupling relationship, leading to limited adaptability. Therefore, we propose D-LoRa, a distributed parameter adaptation scheme, based on reinforcement learning towards network performance. We decompose the joint performance optimization problem into multiple independent Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems with different reward functions. We have also built a comprehensive analytical model for the LoRa network that considers path loss, quasi-orthogonality of spreading factor, and packet collision. Experimental results show that our scheme can increase packet delivery rate by up to 28.8% and demonstrates superior adaptability across different performance metrics.</description>

      <title>The NIC should be part of the OS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The network interface adapter (NIC) is a critical component of a cloud server occupying a unique position. Not only is network performance vital to efficient operation of the machine, but unlike compute accelerators like GPUs, the network subsystem must react to unpredictable events like the arrival of a network packet and communicate with the appropriate application end point with minimal latency.
  Current approaches to server stacks navigate a trade-off between flexibility, efficiency, and performance: the fastest kernel-bypass approaches dedicate cores to applications, busy-wait on receive queues, etc. while more flexible approaches appropriate to more dynamic workload mixes incur much greater software overhead on the data path.
  However, we reject this trade-off, which we ascribe to an arbitrary (and sub-optimal) split in system state between the OS and the NIC. Instead, by exploiting the properties of cache-coherent interconnects and integrating the NIC closely with the OS kernel, we can achieve something surprising: performance for RPC workloads better than the fastest kernelbypass approaches without sacrificing the robustness and dynamic adaptation of kernel-based network subsystems.</description>
