      <title>Heterogeneous Graph Generation: A Hierarchical Approach using Node Feature Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs are present in various domains, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and biological networks. Unlike homogeneous graphs, heterogeneous graphs consist of multiple types of nodes and edges, each representing different entities and relationships. Generating realistic heterogeneous graphs that capture the complex interactions among diverse entities is a difficult task due to several reasons. The generator has to model both the node type distribution along with the feature distribution for each node type. In this paper, we look into solving challenges in heterogeneous graph generation, by employing a two phase hierarchical structure, wherein the first phase creates a skeleton graph with node types using a prior diffusion based model and in the second phase, we use an encoder and a sampler structure as generator to assign node type specific features to the nodes. A discriminator is used to guide training of the generator and feature vectors are sampled from a node feature pool. We conduct extensive experiments with subsets of IMDB and DBLP datasets to show the effectiveness of our method and also the need for various architecture components.</description>

      <title>CrediRAG: Network-Augmented Credibility-Based Retrieval for Misinformation Detection in Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fake news threatens democracy and exacerbates the polarization and divisions in society; therefore, accurately detecting online misinformation is the foundation of addressing this issue. We present CrediRAG, the first fake news detection model that combines language models with access to a rich external political knowledge base with a dense social network to detect fake news across social media at scale. CrediRAG uses a news retriever to initially assign a misinformation score to each post based on the source credibility of similar news articles to the post title content. CrediRAG then improves the initial retrieval estimations through a novel weighted post-to-post network connected based on shared commenters and weighted by the average stance of all shared commenters across every pair of posts. We achieve 11% increase in the F1-score in detecting misinformative posts over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments conducted on curated real-world Reddit data of over 200,000 posts demonstrate the superior performance of CrediRAG on existing baselines. Thus, our approach offers a more accurate and scalable solution to combat the spread of fake news across social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Identity Emergence in the Context of Vaccine Criticism in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the emergence of collective identity among individuals critical of vaccination policies in France during the COVID-19 pandemic. As concerns grew over mandated health measures, a loose collective formed on Twitter to assert autonomy over vaccination decisions. Using analyses of pronoun usage, outgroup labeling, and tweet similarity, we examine how this identity emerged. A turning point occurred following President Macron's announcement of mandatory vaccination for health workers and the health pass, sparking substantial changes in linguistic patterns. We observed a shift from first-person singular (I) to first-person plural (we) pronouns, alongside an increased focus on vaccinated individuals as a central outgroup, in addition to authority figures. This shift in language patterns was further reflected in the behavior of new users. An analysis of incoming users revealed that a core group of frequent posters played a crucial role in fostering cohesion and shaping norms. New users who joined during the week of Macron's announcement and continued posting afterward showed an increased similarity with the language of the core group, contributing to the crystallization of the emerging collective identity.</description>

      <title>A spatial hypergraph model where epidemic spread demonstrates clear higher-order effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a spatial hypergraph model that allows us to vary the amount of higher-order structure in the generated hypergraph. Specifically, we can vary from a model that is a pure pairwise graph into a model that is almost a pure hypergraph. We use this spatial hypergraph model to study higher-order effects in epidemic spread. We use a susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) epidemic model designed to mimic the spread of an airborne pathogen. We study three types of airborne effects that emulate airborne dilution effects. For the scenario of linear dilution, which roughly correspond to constant ventilation per person as required in many building codes, we see essentially no impact from introducing small hyperedges up to size 15 whereas we do see effects when the hyperedge set is dominated by large hyperedges. Specifically, we track the mean infections after the SIRS epidemic has run for awhile so it is in a "steady state" and find the mean is higher in the large hyperedge regime wheras it is unchanged from pairwise to small hyperedge regime.</description>

      <title>GeoLife+: Large-Scale Simulated Trajectory Datasets Calibrated to the GeoLife Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing individual human trajectory data helps our understanding of human mobility and finds many commercial and academic applications. There are two main approaches to accessing trajectory data for research: one involves using real-world datasets like GeoLife, while the other employs simulations to synthesize data. Real-world data provides insights from real human activities, but such data is generally sparse due to voluntary participation. Conversely, simulated data can be more comprehensive but may capture unrealistic human behavior. In this Data and Resource paper, we combine the benefit of both by leveraging the statistical features of real-world data and the comprehensiveness of simulated data. Specifically, we extract features from the real-world GeoLife dataset such as the average number of individual daily trips, average radius of gyration, and maximum and minimum trip distances. We calibrate the Pattern of Life Simulation, a realistic simulation of human mobility, to reproduce these features. Therefore, we use a genetic algorithm to calibrate the parameters of the simulation to mimic the GeoLife features. For this calibration, we simulated numerous random simulation settings, measured the similarity of generated trajectories to GeoLife, and iteratively (over many generations) combined parameter settings of trajectory datasets most similar to GeoLife. Using the calibrated simulation, we simulate large trajectory datasets that we call GeoLife+, where + denotes the Kleene Plus, indicating unlimited replication with at least one occurrence. We provide simulated GeoLife+ data with 182, 1k, and 5k over 5 years, 10k, and 50k over a year and 100k users over 6 months of simulation lifetime.</description>

      <title>Online Digital Investigative Journalism using SociaLens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Media companies witnessed a significant transformation with the rise of the internet, bigdata, machine learning (ML) and AI. Recent emergence of large language models (LLM) have added another aspect to this transformation. Researchers believe that with the help of these technologies, investigative digital journalism will enter a new era. Using a smart set of data gathering and analysis tools, journalists will be able to create data driven contents and insights in unprecedented ways. In this paper, we introduce a versatile and autonomous investigative journalism tool, called {\em SociaLens}, for identifying and extracting query specific data from online sources, responding to probing queries and drawing conclusions entailed by large volumes of data using ML analytics fully autonomously. We envision its use in investigative journalism, law enforcement and social policy planning. The proposed system capitalizes on the integration of ML technology with LLMs and advanced bigdata search techniques. We illustrate the functionality of SociaLens using a focused case study on rape incidents in a developing country and demonstrate that journalists can gain nuanced insights without requiring coding expertise they might lack. SociaLens is designed as a ChatBot that is capable of contextual conversation, find and collect data relevant to queries, initiate ML tasks to respond to queries, generate textual and visual reports, all fully autonomously within the ChatBot environment.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy on Trust Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study differential privacy (DP) in a multi-party setting where each party only trusts a (known) subset of the other parties with its data. Specifically, given a trust graph where vertices correspond to parties and neighbors are mutually trusting, we give a DP algorithm for aggregation with a much better privacy-utility trade-off than in the well-studied local model of DP (where each party trusts no other party). We further study a robust variant where each party trusts all but an unknown subset of at most $t$ of its neighbors (where $t$ is a given parameter), and give an algorithm for this setting. We complement our algorithms with lower bounds, and discuss implications of our work to other tasks in private learning and analytics.</description>

      <title>Parametric Graph Representations in the Era of Foundation Models: A Survey and Position</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs have been widely used in the past decades of big data and AI to model comprehensive relational data. When analyzing a graph's statistical properties, graph laws serve as essential tools for parameterizing its structure. Identifying meaningful graph laws can significantly enhance the effectiveness of various applications, such as graph generation and link prediction. Facing the large-scale foundation model developments nowadays, the study of graph laws reveals new research potential, e.g., providing multi-modal information for graph neural representation learning and breaking the domain inconsistency of different graph data. In this survey, we first review the previous study of graph laws from multiple perspectives, i.e., macroscope and microscope of graphs, low-order and high-order graphs, static and dynamic graphs, different observation spaces, and newly proposed graph parameters. After we review various real-world applications benefiting from the guidance of graph laws, we conclude the paper with current challenges and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Do LLM Agents Exhibit Social Behavior?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As LLMs increasingly take on roles in human-AI interactions and autonomous AI systems, understanding their social behavior becomes important for informed use and continuous improvement. However, their behaviors in social interactions with humans and other agents, as well as the mechanisms shaping their responses, remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework, State-Understanding-Value-Action (SUVA), to systematically analyze LLM responses in social contexts based on their textual outputs (i.e., utterances). Using canonical behavioral economics games and social preference concepts relatable to LLM users, SUVA assesses LLMs' social behavior through both their final decisions and the response generation processes leading to those decisions. Our analysis of eight LLMs -- including two GPT, four LLaMA, and two Mistral models -- suggests that most models do not generate decisions aligned solely with self-interest; instead, they often produce responses that reflect social welfare considerations and display patterns consistent with direct and indirect reciprocity. Additionally, higher-capacity models more frequently display group identity effects. The SUVA framework also provides explainable tools -- including tree-based visualizations and probabilistic dependency analysis -- to elucidate how factors in LLMs' utterance-based reasoning influence their decisions. We demonstrate that utterance-based reasoning reliably predicts LLMs' final actions; references to altruism, fairness, and cooperation in the reasoning increase the likelihood of prosocial actions, while mentions of self-interest and competition reduce them. Overall, our framework enables practitioners to assess LLMs for applications involving social interactions, and provides researchers with a structured method to interpret how LLM behavior arises from utterance-based reasoning.</description>

      <title>Five Years of COVID-19 Discourse on Instagram: A Labeled Instagram Dataset of Over Half a Million Posts for Multilingual Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The work presented in this paper makes three scientific contributions with a specific focus on mining and analysis of COVID-19-related posts on Instagram. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 500,153 Instagram posts about COVID-19 published between January 2020 and September 2024. This dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/d46p-v480, contains Instagram posts in 161 different languages as well as 535,021 distinct hashtags. After the development of this dataset, multilingual sentiment analysis was performed, which involved classifying each post as positive, negative, or neutral. The results of sentiment analysis are presented as a separate attribute in this dataset. Second, it presents the results of performing sentiment analysis per year from 2020 to 2024. The findings revealed the trends in sentiment related to COVID-19 on Instagram since the beginning of the pandemic. For instance, between 2020 and 2024, the sentiment trends show a notable shift, with positive sentiment decreasing from 38.35% to 28.69%, while neutral sentiment rising from 44.19% to 58.34%. Finally, the paper also presents findings of language-specific sentiment analysis. This analysis highlighted similar and contrasting trends of sentiment across posts published in different languages on Instagram. For instance, out of all English posts, 49.68% were positive, 14.84% were negative, and 35.48% were neutral. In contrast, among Hindi posts, 4.40% were positive, 57.04% were negative, and 38.56% were neutral, reflecting distinct differences in the sentiment distribution between these two languages.</description>

      <title>HumVI: A Multilingual Dataset for Detecting Violent Incidents Impacting Humanitarian Aid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanitarian organizations can enhance their effectiveness by analyzing data to discover trends, gather aggregated insights, manage their security risks, support decision-making, and inform advocacy and funding proposals. However, data about violent incidents with direct impact and relevance for humanitarian aid operations is not readily available. An automatic data collection and NLP-backed classification framework aligned with humanitarian perspectives can help bridge this gap. In this paper, we present HumVI - a dataset comprising news articles in three languages (English, French, Arabic) containing instances of different types of violent incidents categorized by the humanitarian sector they impact, e.g., aid security, education, food security, health, and protection. Reliable labels were obtained for the dataset by partnering with a data-backed humanitarian organization, Insecurity Insight. We provide multiple benchmarks for the dataset, employing various deep learning architectures and techniques, including data augmentation and mask loss, to address different task-related challenges, e.g., domain expansion. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/dataminr-ai/humvi-dataset.</description>
