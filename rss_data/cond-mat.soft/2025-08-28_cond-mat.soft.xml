      <title>Inverse Elastica: A Theoretical Framework for Inverse Design of Morphing Slender Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design of morphing slender structures with programmable curvature has significant applications in various engineering fields. Most existing studies formulate it as an optimization problem, which requires repeatedly solving the forward equations to identify optimal designs. Such methods, however, are computationally intensive and often susceptible to local minima issues. In contrast, solving the inverse problem theoretically, which can bypass the need for optimizations, is highly efficient yet remains challenging, particularly for cases involving arbitrary boundary conditions (BCs). Here, we develop a systematic theoretical framework, termed inverse elastica, for the direct determination of the undeformed configuration from a target deformed shape along with prescribed BCs. Building upon the classical elastica, inverse elastica is derived by supplementing the geometric equations of undeformed configurations. The framework shows three key features: reduced nonlinearity, solution multiplicity, and inverse loading. These principles are demonstrated through two representative models: an analytical solution for a two-dimensional arc and a numerical continuation study of the inverse loading of a three-dimensional helical spring. Furthermore, we develop a theory-assisted optimization strategy for cases in which the constrains of the undeformed configurations cannot be directly formulated as BCs. Using this strategy, we achieve rational inverse design of complex spatial curves and curve-discretized surfaces with varying Gaussian curvatures. Our theoretical predictions are validated through both discrete elastic rod simulations and experiments.</description>

      <title>Exotic rheology of materials with active rearrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow of biological tissues during development is controlled through the active stresses generated by cells interacting with their mechanical environment in the tissue. Many developmental processes are driven by convergence-extension flows where the tissue has an emergent negative shear modulus and viscosity. This exotic rheology is generated through active T1 transitions where rearrangements are opposite the applied stress direction. Here, we introduce a mean-field elasto-plastic model which shows convergence-extension, based on the Hebraud-Lequeux model, that includes both passive and active elastic elements with opposite stress responses. We find that the introduction of active elements profoundly changes the rheology. Beyond a threshold fraction of active elements, it gives rise to non-monotonic flow curves and negative stresses at positive strain rates. Controlled by the active fraction and the stress diffusion rate, we find both yield stress materials and fluids, with either a positive or negative yield stress or viscosity. These features are characteristic of metamaterials, and highlight how biology uses disordered, active materials with exotic rheology.</description>

      <title>LEMONS: An open-source platform to generate non-circuLar, anthropometry-based pEdestrian shapes and simulate their Mechanical interactiONS in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer a collection of videos showing simulations of pedestrian crowds made with the LEMONS software. LEMONS is an open-source computational tool designed for modelling dense crowds. The platform features an intuitive online interface, enabling users to generate 2D and 3D pedestrian crowds based on anthropometric data. Additionally, it features a C++ library that computes mechanical contacts with other agents and obstacles, and evolves the crowd's configuration. Both the online platform and the library can readily be called from Python scripts, providing users with complete flexibility to implement their own decision-making models, such as specifying the desired velocities of individuals within the crowd.__Documentation is also provided.</description>

      <title>Decoupling dynamics and crosslink stability in supramolecular hydrogels using associative exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of hydrogels that combine mechanical robustness with dynamic reconfigurability remains a fundamental challenge, as increasing crosslink dissociation rates compromise network integrity. This limitation is addressed through the incorporation of an associative crosslink exchange into DNA-based supramolecular hydrogels, enabling the decoupling of network relaxation behavior from crosslink stability. The hydrogels are constructed from enzyme-synthesized single-stranded DNA that self-assembles via hybridization between complementary domains. These crosslinks can reorganize through dissociative melting or associative strand displacement reaction, yielding networks with tunable relaxation timescales spanning over three orders of magnitude. Rheological measurements and thermodynamic modeling confirm that associative exchange facilitates efficient stress dissipation without diminishing rupture strength or thermal stability. In contrast, dissociative systems inherently trade increased dynamics with mechanical weakening. This decoupling is achieved through the implementation of a catalytic reorganization pathway governed by the composition of the sample, independently of crosslink strength. These findings establish the mechanism of reorganization as a key design parameter for engineering adaptive soft materials that combine resilience and responsiveness.</description>

      <title>Wave coarsening drives time crystallization in active solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When metals are magnetized, emulsions phase separate, or galaxies cluster, domain walls and patterns form and irremediably coarsen over time. Such coarsening is universally driven by diffusive relaxation toward equilibrium. Here, we discover an inertial counterpart - wave coarsening - in active elastic media, where vibrations emerge and spontaneously grow in wavelength, period, and amplitude, before a globally synchronized state called a time crystal forms. We observe wave coarsening in one- and two-dimensional solids and capture its dynamical scaling. We further arrest the process by breaking momentum conservation and reveal a far-from-equilibrium nonlinear analogue to chiral topological edge modes. Our work unveils the crucial role of symmetries in the formation of time crystals and opens avenues for the control of nonlinear vibrations in active materials.</description>

      <title>Anomalous tensorial properties of anisotropic 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd transport phenomena -- defined as a flux response orthogonal to an applied gradient -- have been recently observed in isotropic systems, with a multitude of proposed models and experiments to study these effects. Odd transport manifests in tensors that describe linear relations between fluxes and gradients that drive them, particularly when parity and time-reversal symmetries are broken. In this work, we identify such odd properties to be a subset of a broader class of major-symmetry-breaking behaviors, which we term ``anomalous." We develop a classification of anomalous properties described by $2^\mathrm{nd}$ and $4^\mathrm{th}$ order tensors in anisotropic 2D materials that maintain discrete rotational and reflection symmetries, characterized by the 17 wallpaper groups. To this end, we present representation theorems for these tensors, identifying which components are constrained for specific spatial symmetries and thereby allowing materials to be grouped into classes that exhibit anomalous responses or not. We focus our discussion on $2^\mathrm{nd}$ order tensors in the context of electrical resistivity and on $4^\mathrm{th}$ order tensors in the context of viscosity and elasticity. These findings are broadly applicable to the study of novel emergent material properties. To illustrate this, we discuss implications of our findings for two very different 2D materials that have recently garnered attention in condensed matter physics: knitted fabrics and twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06967v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast computational method for Hertzian contact theory is proposed. An incremental formula is introduced to calculate the ellipticity of the contact disk when two elastic bodies are in contact. This method can determine the ellipticity with good accuracy in a small number of iterations is reported. This method is also shown to be applicable from the case of a near perfect circle to the case where the major diameter is sufficiently long compared to the minor diameter.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Solvent Dynamics Drives the Formation of the Hydrated Electron in Photoexcited Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation of electrons localized mostly on specific topological defects in water's hydrogen network which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theoretical Paradigm via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: I. Generalized Mode Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale. Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques. By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions into the field-theoretic description.</description>

      <title>Inferring activity from the flow field around active colloidal particles using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active colloidal particles create flow around them due to non-equilibrium process on their surfaces. In this paper, we infer the activity of such colloidal particles from the flow field created by them via deep learning. We first explain our method for one active particle, inferring the $2s$ mode (or the stresslet) and the $3t$ mode (or the source dipole) from the flow field data, along with the position and orientation of the particle. We then apply the method to a system of many active particles. We find excellent agreements between the predictions and the true values of activity. Our method presents a principled way to predict arbitrary activity from the flow field created by active particles.</description>

      <title>Colloidal nanoparticles in cholesteric liquid crystals: Bulk properties, biaxiality and untwisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) in cholesteric liquid crystal samples in the dilute limit, in a Landau-de Gennes theoretical framework. The effects of the suspended NPs are captured by a homogenized energy, as outlined in [7]. For spatially homogeneous samples, we explicitly compute the critical points and minimizers of the modified Landau-de Gennes energy and show that the presence of NP eliminates the first-order isotropic-nematic phase transition, stabilises elusive biaxial phases over some temperature ranges, and that the symmetry of the NP boundary conditions or surface treatments dictates the bulk equilibrium phase at high temperatures. We also numerically demonstrate structural transitions from twisted helical director profiles to untwisted director profiles, in cholesteric-filled channel geometries, driven by the collective effects of the NPs and increasing temperature. These transitions are reversible upon lowering the temperature in sufficiently large domains, where thermal hysteresis can also be observed. This behaviour opens interesting avenues for tuning the optical properties of confined, nano-doped cholesteric systems.</description>

      <title>Coarsening Kinetics in Active Model B+: Macroscale and Microscale Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive numerical investigation of the coarsening kinetics of active Brownian particles modeled by the {\it Active Model B+} (AMB+). This model was introduced by Tjhung et al. [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 8}, 031080 (2018)] and is a generalization of Model B for a conserved order parameter, with two additional activity terms. These terms correspond to rotation-free current (of strength $\lambda$) and rotational current (of strength $\xi$). We find that the presence of rotational current $(\xi \neq 0)$ significantly affects growth kinetics. Depending on the parameter values, AMB+ exhibits either {\it macroscale phase separation} (MPS) or {\it microscale phase separation} ($\mu$PS). We present detailed results for the kinetics of MPS and $\mu$PS in AMB+ with critical composition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate proteins within heterogeneous cell membranes where non-equilibrium phenomena arises from spatial variations in concentration and temperature. We develop simulation methods building on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to obtain stochastic hybrid continuum-discrete descriptions which track individual protein dynamics, spatially varying concentration fluctuations, and thermal exchanges. We investigate biological mechanisms for protein positioning and patterning within membranes and factors in thermal gradient sensing. We also study the kinetics of Brownian motion of particles with temperature variations within energy landscapes arising from heterogeneous microstructures within membranes. The introduced approaches provide self-consistent models for studying biophysical mechanisms involving the drift-diffusion dynamics of individual proteins and energy exchanges and fluctuations between the thermal and mechanical parts of the system. The methods also can be used for studying related non-equilibrium effects in other biological systems and soft materials.</description>

      <title>Striking Similarities in Dynamics and Vibrations of 2D Quasicrystals and Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between structure and dynamics in two structurally distinct two-dimensional systems: a dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) and a supercooled binary liquid. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover striking dynamical similarities despite their fundamentally different structural organizations. Both systems exhibit pronounced dynamic heterogeneities, as evidenced by the cage-trapping plateaus in the mean-squared displacement and the pronounced peaks in the non-Gaussian parameter. In both cases, we observe a strong correlation between local structural order and dynamic propensity, indicating similar structure-dynamics relationships, albeit driven by distinct microscopic mechanisms. Despite these parallels, their vibrational properties diverge: the DDQC exhibits multiple peaks linked to phason dynamics, while the supercooled liquid displays a characteristic boson peak. Analysis of vibrational eigenmodes shows that both systems exhibit extended modes at low frequencies. At high frequencies, however, the DDQC maintains a higher density of topological defects, reflecting its quasi-long-range order. Finally, we contextualize these findings by comparing both systems to a square crystal. While the dynamics appears similar across all three systems, the vibrational and topological features clearly distinguish the DDQC and glass from the crystalline state. These results underscore a surprising universality in dynamical behavior across structurally diverse systems and provide new insights into how structural organization shapes motion in soft-matter systems.</description>
