      <title>The Freight Multimodal Transport Problem with Buses and Drones: An Integrated Approach for Last-Mile Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel freight multimodal transport problem with buses and drones, where buses are responsible for transporting parcels to lockers at bus stops for storage, while drones are used to deliver each parcel from the locker to the corresponding customer. The integrated bus-drone system synergistically expands drone service coverage using the bus network to ensure efficient final delivery. Minimizing the total operational costs while satisfying customer demands necessitates the joint optimization of parcel assignments and drone flights. We model the problem into a compact mixed-integer linear programming formulation and propose an integer programming formulation with exponentially many variables. To address real-world scale instances, we propose a Branch-Price-and-Benders-Cut algorithm for this non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard problem. This algorithm, integrating column generation and Benders decomposition within a Branch-and-Bound framework, is developed to obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions. Additionally, we introduce algorithmic enhancements aimed at accelerating the convergence of the algorithm. Computational experiments on instances generated from real-world bus data demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform CPLEX regarding both efficiency and solution quality. Moreover, our approaches can lead to over 6% cost savings compared to situations where we determine parcel assignments and drone flights sequentially. We evaluate the environmental advantages of integrating buses and drones, study the impact of different cost parameters in the system, and investigate the impact of the parcel locker configuration on performance. These findings provide valuable managerial insights for urban logistics managers, highlighting the potential of the integrated bus-drone system to improve traditional last-mile delivery.</description>

      <title>Contributions to conjectures in planar graphs: Induced Substructures, Treewidth, and Dominating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two of the most prominent unresolved conjectures in graph theory, the Albertson-Berman conjecture and the Matheson-Tarjan conjecture, have been extensively studied by many researchers.
  (AB) Every planar graph of order $n$ has an induced forest of order at least $\frac{n}{2}$.
  (MT) Every plane triangulation of sufficiently large order $n$ has a dominating set of cardinality at most $\frac{n}{4}$.
  Although partial results and weaker bounds than those originally conjectured have been obtained, both problems remain open. To contribute to their resolution, various generalizations and variations of the original concepts have been investigated, such as total dominating set, induced linear forests, and others. In this paper, we clarify the relations among several notions related to these two major conjectures, such as connected domination and induced outerplanar subgraphs, etc., and survey the associated conjectures. We then provide counterexamples to some of these conjectures and establish the best bounds on the gap between the maximum orders of induced subgraphs under different structural conditions. In addition, we present a general upper bound on the order of induced subgraphs in terms of treewidth, a fundamental graph invariant.</description>

      <title>Circulant TSP: Vertices of the Edge-Length Polytope and Superpolynomial Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the edge-length polytope, motivated both by algorithmic research on the Circulant Traveling Salesman Problem (Circulant TSP) and number-theoretic research related to the Buratti-Horak-Rosa conjecture. Circulant TSP is a special case of TSP whose overall complexity is a significant still-open question, and where on an input with vertices $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$, the cost of an edge $\{i, j\}$ depends only on its length $\min\{|i-j|, n-|i-j|\}$. The edge-length polytope provides one path to solving circulant TSP instances, and we show that it is intimately connected to the factorization of $n$: the number of vertices scales with $n$ whenever $n$ is prime and with $n^{3/2}$ whenever $n$ is a prime-squared, but there are a superpolynomial number of vertices whenever $n$ is a power of 2. In contrast, the more-standard Symmetric TSP Polytope has roughly $n!$ vertices. Hence, for Circulant TSP, a brute-force algorithm checking every vertex is actually efficient in some cases, based on the factorization of $n$. As an intermediate step, we give superpolynomial lower-bounds on two combinatorial sequences related to the Buratti-Horak-Rosa conjecture, which asks what combinations of edge lengths can comprise a Hamiltonian path.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Generation and Modular Embedding of High-Quality abc-Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a symbolic identity for generating integer triples $(a, b, c)$ satisfying $a + b = c$, inspired by structural features of the \emph{abc conjecture}. The construction uses powers of $2$ and $3$ in combination with modular inversion in $\mathbb{Z}/3^p\mathbb{Z}$, leading to a parametric identity with residue constraints that yield abc-triples exhibiting low radical values. Through affine transformations, these symbolic triples are embedded into a broader space of high-quality examples, optimised for the ratio $\log c / \log \operatorname{rad}(abc)$. Computational results demonstrate the emergence of structured, radical-minimising candidates, including both known and novel triples. These methods provide a symbolic and algebraic framework for controlled triple generation, and suggest exploratory implications for symbolic entropy filtering in cryptographic pre-processing.</description>

      <title>Minimality and computability of languages of G-shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the notion of strong computable type for sets in computable analysis, we define the notion of strong computable type for $G$-shifts, where $G$ is a finitely generated group with decidable word problem. A $G$-shift has strong computable type if one can compute its language from the complement of its language. We obtain a characterization of $G$-shifts with strong computable type in terms of a notion of minimality with respect to properties with a bounded computational complexity. We provide a self-contained direct proof, and also explain how this characterization can be obtained from an existing similar characterization for sets by Amir and Hoyrup, and discuss its connexions with results by Jeandel on closure spaces. We apply this characterization to several classes of shifts that are minimal with respect to specific properties. This provides a unifying approach that not only generalizes many existing results but also has the potential to yield new findings effortlessly. In contrast to the case of sets, we prove that strong computable type for G-shifts is preserved under products. We conclude by discussing some generalizations and future directions.</description>

      <title>On the integrality Gap of Small Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problems: A Polyhedral and Computational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the integrality gap of the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP) with respect to the linear relaxation given by the Asymmetric Subtour Elimination Problem (ASEP) for instances with $n$ nodes, where $n$ is small. In particular, we focus on the geometric properties and symmetries of the ASEP polytope ($P^{n}_{ASEP}$) and its vertices. The polytope's symmetries are exploited to design a heuristic pivoting algorithm to search vertices where the integrality gap is maximized. Furthermore, a general procedure for the extension of vertices from $P^{n}_{ASEP}$ to $P^{n + 1}_{ASEP}$ is defined. The generated vertices improve the known lower bounds of the integrality gap for $ 16 \leq n \leq 22$ and, provide small hard-to-solve ATSP instances.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Topological graph drawing (part III)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manuscript considers mathematical models for creating a topological drawing of a graph based on the methods of G. Ringel's vertex rotation theory. An algorithm is presented for generating a topological drawing of a flat part of a graph based on the selection of a basis for the cycle subspace C(G) using the Monte Carlo method. A steepest descent method for constructing a topological drawing of a flat subgraph is described in the manuscript. The topological drawing of a graph is constructed using a combination of the methods of vector intersection algebra developed by L. I. Rapport. Three stages of constructing a flat subgraph of a non-separable graph are described. The issues of constructing a Hamiltonian cycle based on constructing a flat subgraph are considered. A new method for constructing a Hamiltonian cycle of a graph based on the cycle graph of a flat subgraph is described.</description>

      <title>The Packing Chromatic Number of the Infinite Square Grid is 15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A packing $k$-coloring is a natural variation on the standard notion of graph $k$-coloring, where vertices are assigned numbers from $\{1, \ldots, k\}$, and any two vertices assigned a common color $c \in \{1, \ldots, k\}$ need to be at a distance greater than $c$ (as opposed to $1$, in standard graph colorings). Despite a sequence of incremental work, determining the packing chromatic number of the infinite square grid has remained an open problem since its introduction in 2002. We culminate the search by proving this number to be 15. We achieve this result by improving the best-known method for this problem by roughly two orders of magnitude. The most important technique to boost performance is a novel and surprisingly effective propositional encoding. Additionally, we developed a new symmetry-breaking method. Since both new techniques are more complex than existing techniques for this problem, a verified approach is required to trust them. We include both techniques in a proof of unsatisfiability, reducing the trusted core to the correctness of the direct encoding.</description>

      <title>Three iterations of $(d-1)$-WL test distinguish non isometric clouds of $d$-dimensional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12853v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weisfeiler--Lehman (WL) test is a fundamental iterative algorithm for checking isomorphism of graphs. It has also been observed that it underlies the design of several graph neural network architectures, whose capabilities and performance can be understood in terms of the expressive power of this test. Motivated by recent developments in machine learning applications to datasets involving three-dimensional objects, we study when the WL test is {\em complete} for clouds of euclidean points represented by complete distance graphs, i.e., when it can distinguish, up to isometry, any arbitrary such cloud. %arbitrary clouds of euclidean points represented by complete distance graphs. % How many dimensions of the Weisfeiler--Lehman test is enough to distinguish any two non-isometric point clouds in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, assuming that these point clouds are given as complete graphs labeled by distances between the points? This question is important for understanding, which architectures of graph neural networks are capable of fully exploiting the spacial structure of a point cloud.
  Our main result states that the $(d-1)$-dimensional WL test is complete for point clouds in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, for any $d\ge 2$, and that only three iterations of the test suffice. We also observe that the $d$-dimensional WL test only requires one iteration to achieve completeness.
  Our paper thus provides complete understanding of the 3-dimensional case: it was shown in previous works that 1-WL is not complete in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and we show that 2-WL is complete there. We also strengthen the lower bound for 1-WL by showing that it is unable to recognize planar point clouds in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Finally, we show that 2-WL is not complete in $\mathbb{R}^6$, leaving as an open question, whether it is complete in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ for $d = 4,5$.</description>

      <title>The Leaf Function of Penrose P2 Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a graph-theoretic problem in the Penrose P2-graphs which are the dual graphs of Penrose tilings by kites and darts. Using substitutions, local isomorphism and other properties of Penrose tilings, we construct a family of arbitrarily large induced subtrees of Penrose graphs with the largest possible number of leaves for a given number $n$ of vertices. These subtrees are called fully leafed induced subtrees. We denote their number of leaves $L_{P2}(n)$ for any non-negative integer $n$, and the sequence $\left(L_{P2}(n)\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is called the leaf function of Penrose P2-graphs. We present exact and recursive formulae for $L_{P2}(n)$, as well as an infinite sequence of fully leafed induced subtrees, which are caterpillar graphs. In particular, our proof relies on the construction of a finite graded poset of 3-internal-regular subtrees.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Network Methods for Hub-like Microservice Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Microservice Architecture is a popular architectural paradigm that facilitates flexibility by decomposing applications into small, independently deployable services. Catalogs of architectural anti-patterns have been proposed to highlight the negative aspects of flawed microservice design. In particular, the Hub-like anti-pattern lacks an unambiguous definition and detection method. Aim: In this work, we aim to find a robust detection approach for the Hub-like microservice anti-pattern that outputs a reasonable number of Hub-like candidates with high precision. Method: We leveraged a dataset of 25 microservice networks and several network hub detection techniques to identify the Hub-like anti-pattern, namely scale-free property, centrality metrics and clustering coefficient, minimum description length principle, and the approach behind the Arcan tool. Results and Conclusion: Our findings revealed that the studied architectural networks are not scale-free, that most considered hub detection approaches do not agree on the detected hubs, and that the method by Kirkley leveraging the Erdos-Renyi encoding is the most accurate one in terms of the number of detected hubs and the detection precision. Investigating further the applicability of these methods to detecting Hub-like components in microservice-based and other systems opens up new research directions. Moreover, our results provide an evaluation of the approach utilized by the widely used Arcan tool and highlight the potential to update the tool to use the normalized degree centrality of a component in the network, or for the approach based on ER encoding to be adopted instead.</description>

      <title>Centrality Change Proneness: an Early Indicator of Microservice Architectural Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the wide adoption of Microservice Architecture has required the identification of various patterns and anti-patterns to prevent Microservice Architectural Degradation. Frequently, the systems are modelled as a network of connected services. Recently, the study of temporal networks has emerged as a way to describe and analyze evolving networks. Previous research has explored how software metrics such as size, complexity, and quality are related to microservice centrality in the architectural network. This study investigates whether temporal centrality metrics can provide insight into the early detection of architectural degradation by correlating or affecting software metrics. We reconstructed the architecture of 7 releases of an OSS microservice project with 42 services. For every service in every release, we computed the software and centrality metrics. From one of the latter, we derived a new metric, Centrality Change Proneness. We then explored the correlation between the metrics. We identified 7 size and 5 complexity metrics that have a consistent correlation with centrality, while Centrality Change Proneness did not affect the software metrics, thus providing yet another perspective and an early indicator of microservice architectural degradation.</description>
