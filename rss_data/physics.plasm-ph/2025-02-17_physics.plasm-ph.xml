      <title>A Renewable Double Plasma Mirror For Petawatt-class Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional pulse contrast can be critical for ultraintense laser experiments, particularly when using solid density targets, and their use is becoming widespread. However, current plasma mirror technology is becoming inadequate for the new generation of high repetition rate, high power lasers now available. We describe a novel double plasma mirror configuration based on renewable, free standing, ultrathin liquid crystal films tested at the BELLA Petawatt Laser Center. Although operating at a repetition rate of several shots per minute, this system can be scaled to a high repetition rate exceeding 1 Hz and represents an important step towards enabling sustained, continuous operation of plasma mirrors. We demonstrate an improvement of two to three orders of magnitude in contrast and a total throughput of 80%. We present the first measurements of a beam reflected from a single or double plasma mirror system using a wavefront sensor, showing a well preserved wavefront and spatial mode. Finally, we introduce a model that predicts the total throughput through this double plasma mirror. This is the first model that accurately predicts the peak reflectivity of a plasma mirror when given the laser temporal profile.</description>

      <title>A novel computation of the linear plasma response to a resonant error field in single-fluid rotating visco-resistive MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reexamines the linear plasma response to a static resonant error field (EF) in the single-fluid rotating visco-resistive magneto-hydrodinamic (MHD). A tearing-mode stable, rotating plasma shields a resonant static EF by a current sheet at the resonant surface. This response is encapsulated within the delta prime ({\Delta}'), a quantity which measures the magnitude and phase of the current sheet. However, if EF exceeds an amplitude threshold this equilibrium breaks down and a wall-locked tearing mode is formed. Several basic aspects of the problem are addressed. First, we assess the validity of the radial Fourier transform method, commonly used to solve analytically the problem, by comparison with a completely different technique. Second, we derive a new analytical {\Delta}' global formula valid in a wide range of plasma parameters. This formula describes the {\Delta}' features much better than previous asymptotic regimes modelling. Third, we derive the EF amplitude threshold for producing a locked mode, pointing out the crucial role of the neoclassical poloidal flow damping effect. The result is almost identical to recent two-fluids outcomes, showing that the choice between single-fluid and two-fluids MHD is not crucial in this specific problem.</description>

      <title>Coupling and Acceleration of Externally Injected Electron Beams in Laser-Driven Plasma Wakefields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-stage method of laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) presents a promising approach for developing stable, full-optical, high-energy electron accelerators. By segmenting the acceleration process into several booster stages, each powered by independent laser drivers, this technique effectively mitigates challenges such as electron dephasing, pump depletion, and laser diffraction. A critical aspect of multi-stage LWFA is the nonlinear interaction between the injected electron beam and the laser-driven wakefields in the booster stage. This study investigates the injection and acceleration of external electron beams within wakefields in the booster stage using multi-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations. We provide both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the observed physical processes. Key parameters influencing charge coupling process and the resultant beam quality have been identified. Furthermore, we have examined how off-axis injection relative to the driver laser influences the acceleration process and beam quality. Our findings provide valuable insights for advancing and optimizing multi-stage plasma-based accelerators.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Turbulent Transport in Non-Stabilized Plasma at the Edge of the GOLEM Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma turbulent transport was investigated at the edge of the GOLEM tokamak. For this purpose, ion saturation current fluctuations were measured by means of Langmuir probes. Plasma stabilization was not activated during the discharges under study. Non-Gaussian behavior is observed, which indicates the presence of coherent structures. Study of the radial dependence of statistical and temporal characteristics of fluctuations allows to conclude that non-elongated blob-like structures with comparable radial and poloidal size should govern the plasma transport at the edge of the GOLEM tokamak.</description>

      <title>GREENY: A Full-F 2D Gyrofluid Reconnection Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the 2D gyrofluid magnetic reconnection code GREENY (Gyrofluid Reconnection with Extended Electromagnetic Nonlinearity). After a brief introduction to gyrofluids, magnetic reconnection, and the implemented models, we discuss the numerical framework and the algorithmic treatment of the quasi-neutrality condition and Amper\`e's law. Next, we present solver tests, conservation laws, and the influence of artificial subgrid dissipation on Harris-sheet magnetic reconnection. Finally, we show different applications, initial conditions and present example simulations.</description>

      <title>The effect of the electron's spin magnetic moment on quantum radiation in strong electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-intense laser pulses can create sufficiently strong fields to probe quantum electrodynamics effects in a novel regime. By colliding a 60 GeV electron bunch with a laser pulse focussed to the maximum achievable intensity of $10^{23}$ Wcm$^{-2}$, we can reach fields much stronger than the critical Schwinger field in the electron rest frame. When the ratio of these fields $\chi_e\gg1$ we find that the hard ($&gt;25$ \thinspace GeV) radiation from the electron has a substantial contribution from spin-light. 33% more photons are produced above this energy due to spin-light, the radiation resulting from the acceleration of the electron's intrinsic magnetic moment. This increase in high-energy photons results in 14% more positrons produced with energy above $25$ GeV. Furthermore, the enhanced photon production due to spin-light results in a 46% increase in the electron recoil radiation reaction. These observable signatures provide a potential route to observing spin-light in the strongly quantum regime ($\chi_e\gg1$) for the first time.</description>

      <title>Generation of Strong Fields with Subcritical Density Plasmas to Study the Phase Transitions of Magnetized Warm Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Warm dense matter (WDM) is a regime where Fermi degenerate electrons play an important role in the macroscopic properties of a material. Recent experiments have brought us closer to understanding unmagnetized processes in WDM, but magnetized WDM remains unexplored because kilotesla magnetic fields are required. Although there are examples of field compression generating such fields by imploding pre-magnetized targets, these existing methods give no independent control over the parameters of the magnetized plasma and result in limited laser access for sample creation and diagnosis. In this paper, numerical simulations show that kilotesla magnetic fields can be obtained by shining laser beams onto the inner surface of a cylindrical target, rather than on the outer surface. This approach relies on field compression by a low density high-temperature plasma, rather than a high-density, low-temperature plasma, used in the more conventional approach. With this novel configuration, the region of peak magnetic field is mostly free of plasma, hence other beams can reach a sample placed in the region of the peak field to form WDM and diagnose it.</description>

      <title>Computing MHD equilibria of stellarators with a flexible coordinate frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the representation of axi-symmetric plasma configurations, it is natural to use cyl. coordinates (R,Z,$\phi$), where $\phi$ is an independent coordinate. The same cyl. coordinates have also been widely used for representing 3D MHD equilibria of non-axisymmetric configurations (stellarators), with cross-sections, defined in RZ-planes, that vary over $\phi$. Stellarator equilibria have been found, however, for which cyl. coordinates are not at all a natural choice, for instance certain stellarators obtained using the near-axis expansion (NAE), defined by a magn. axis curve and its Frenet frame.
  In this contribution, we propose an alternative approach for representing the boundary in a fixed-boundary 3D MHD equil. solver, moving away from cyl. coordinates. Instead, we use planar cross-sections whose orientation is determined by a general coordinate frame (G-Frame). This frame is similar to the conventional Frenet frame, but more flexible. As an additional part of the boundary representation, it becomes an input to the equil. solve, along with the geometry of the cross-sections. We see two advantages: 1) the capability to easily represent configurations where the magn. axis is highly non-planar or even knotted 2) a reduction in the degrees of freedom needed for the boundary surface, and thus the equil. solver, enabling progress in optimization of these configurations.
  We discuss the properties of the G-Frame, starting from the conventional Frenet frame. Then we show two exemplary ways of constructing it, first from a NAE solution and also from a given boundary surface. We present the details of the implementation of the new frame in the 3D MHD equil. solver GVEC. Furthermore, we demonstrate for a highly shaped QI-optimized stellarator that far fewer degrees of freedom are necessary to find a high quality equil. solution, compared to the solution computed in cyl. coordinates.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional boundary turbulence simulations of a RFX-mod plasma in the presence of voltage biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional turbulence simulations of a RFX-mod diverted plasma are performed in the presence of a biasing electrode. The simulations show a strong suppression of turbulent transport caused by the induced $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ flow shear, which leads to the formation of an edge transport barrier with a pedestal-like structure, in qualitative agreement with RFX-mod experiments. The strong $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ flow shear turbulence suppression with edge voltage biasing is also observed in the proximity of the density limit crossing, suggesting that edge voltage biasing may allow for larger maximum achievable density values. By leveraging the simulation results, the theoretical scaling law of the edge pressure gradient length derived in Giacomin &amp; Ricci (2020) J. Plasma Phys. 86(5) is extended here to account for the $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ flow shear turbulence suppression caused by voltage biasing. The improved theoretical scaling with typical RFX-mod shearing rate values predicts a factor of two increase of the pressure gradient at the separatrix, which is comparable to RFX-mod experiments in the presence of voltage biasing. The implications of the flow shear turbulence suppression due to voltage biasing on the density limit in RFX-mod are also discussed.</description>
