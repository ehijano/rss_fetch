      <title>Cosmological impact of $\nu$DM interactions enhanced in narrow redshift ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of dark matter-neutrino ($\nu$DM) interactions on cosmological perturbations has regained attention, spurred by indications of non-zero couplings from high-multipole cosmic microwave background data, weak lensing, and Lyman-$\alpha$ observations. We demonstrate that a similar observational preference is obtained if $\nu$DM interactions are primarily enhanced during a specific epoch, $z\sim (10^4-10^5)$, leading to $&gt;3\sigma$ preference for a non-zero interaction in the combined Atacama Cosmology Telescope and cosmic shear data. This redshift-limited enhancement circumvents other cosmological and astrophysical bounds and can be achieved within a neutrino portal dark matter framework incorporating resonantly enhanced scattering rates.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Halo: Joint Model for Measurements of the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect and Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first joint analysis of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect with galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) for CMASS galaxies in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We show these complementary probes can disentangle baryons from dark matter in the outskirts of galactic halos by alleviating model degeneracies that are present when fitting to kSZ or GGL measurements alone. In our joint kSZ+GGL analysis we show that the baryon density profile is well constrained on scales from 0.3 to 50 Mpc/$h$. With our well constrained profile of the baryon density, we provide direct comparisons to simulations. For our model we find an outer slope of the baryon distribution that is shallower than predicted by some hydrodynamical simulations, consistent with enhanced baryonic feedback. We also show that not including baryons in a model for GGL can bias halo mass estimates low by $\sim 20\%$ compared to a model that includes baryons and is jointly fit to kSZ+GGL measurements. Our modelling code galaxy-galaxy lensing and kSZ (\texttt{glasz}) is publicly available at https://github.com/James11222/glasz.</description>

      <title>The Properties of Little Red Dot Galaxies in the ASTRID Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simulated counterparts of the ``Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies ($5 \leq z \leq 8$) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses ($\rm log(M_*/M_{\odot}) \geq 9.7$), and massive black holes ($\rm log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) \geq 6.8$). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii ($\rm 325\,pc \leq r_{{\rm half},*} \leq 620\,pc$), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of $23.5-25.5$. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to their host galaxies having typical dust levels and relatively high star formation rates accompanying their highly accreting black holes, resulting in their spectra being too flat.</description>

      <title>A joint analysis of 3D clustering and galaxy \times CMB-lensing cross-correlations with DESI DR1 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectroscopic data from DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) galaxies enables the analysis of 3D clustering by fitting galaxy power spectra and reconstructed correlation functions in redshift space. Given low measurements of the amplitude of structure from cosmic shear at $z\sim1$, redshift space distortions (RSD) + Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals from DESI galaxies combined with weak lensing can break degeneracies and provide a tight alternative constraint on the $z\sim1$ amplitude of structure. In this paper we perform joint analyses that combine full-shape + post-reconstruction information from the DESI DR1 BGS and LRG samples along with angular cross-correlations with Planck PR4 and ACT DR6 CMB lensing maps. We show that adding galaxy-lensing cross-correlations tightens clustering amplitude constraints, improving $\sigma_8$ uncertainties by $\sim 40\%$ over RSD+BAO alone. We also include angular galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-lensing spectra using photometric samples from the DESI Legacy Survey to further improve constraints. Our headline results are $\sigma_8 = 0.803\pm 0.017$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.3037\pm 0.0069$, and $S_8 = 0.808\pm 0.017$. Given DESI's preference for higher $\sigma_8$ compared to lower values from BOSS, we perform a catalog-level comparison of LRG samples from both surveys. We test sensitivity to dark energy assumptions by relaxing our $\Lambda$CDM prior and allowing for evolving dark energy via the $w_0-w_a$ parameterization. We find our $S_8$ constraints to be relatively unchanged despite a $~3.5\sigma$ tension with the cosmological constant model when combining with the Union3 supernova likelihood. Finally we test general relativity (GR) by allowing the gravitational slip parameter ($\gamma$) to vary, and find $\gamma = 1.17\pm0.11$ in mild ($\sim1.5\sigma$) tension with the GR value of $1.0$.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning for multifidelity simulation-based inference in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables cosmological parameter estimation when closed-form likelihoods or models are unavailable. However, SBI relies on machine learning for neural compression and density estimation. This requires large training datasets which are prohibitively expensive for high-quality simulations. We overcome this limitation with multifidelity transfer learning, combining less expensive, lower-fidelity simulations with a limited number of high-fidelity simulations. We demonstrate our methodology on dark matter density maps from two separate simulation suites in the hydrodynamical CAMELS Multifield Dataset. Pre-training on dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations reduces the required number of high-fidelity hydrodynamical simulations by a factor between $8$ and $15$, depending on the model complexity, posterior dimensionality, and performance metrics used. By leveraging cheaper simulations, our approach enables performant and accurate inference on high-fidelity models while substantially reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Flow For Extragalactic Foreground Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extragalactic foregrounds in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations are both a source of cosmological and astrophysical information and a nuisance to the CMB. Effective field-level modeling that captures their non-Gaussian statistical distributions is increasingly important for optimal information extraction, particularly given the precise and low-noise observations from current and upcoming experiments. We explore the use of Wavelet Flow (WF) models to tackle the novel task of modeling the field-level probability distributions of multi-component CMB secondaries. Specifically, we jointly train correlated CMB lensing convergence ($\kappa$) and cosmic infrared background (CIB) maps with a WF model and obtain a network that statistically recovers the input to high accuracy -- the trained network generates samples of $\kappa$ and CIB fields whose average power spectra are within a few percent of the inputs across all scales, and whose Minkowski functionals are similarly accurate compared to the inputs. Leveraging the multiscale architecture of these models, we fine-tune both the model parameters and the priors at each scale independently, optimizing performance across different resolutions. These results demonstrate that WF models can accurately simulate correlated components of CMB secondaries, supporting improved analysis of cosmological data. Our code and trained models can be found here (https://github.com/matiwosm/HybridPriorWavletFlow.git).</description>

      <title>What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial black holes or companion stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves of quasi-circular, inspiraling black hole binaries in an ultralight vector dark-matter environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted by massive black hole binaries can be affected by a variety of environmental effects, which, if detected, could inform astrophysics and cosmology. We here study how gravitational waves emitted by black holes in quasi-circular orbits are affected by the presence of an ultra-light, vector-field, dark-matter environment that is minimally coupled to the binary. This dark-matter environment induces oscillatory gravitational potentials that perturb the orbit of the binary, leaving an imprint in the binary's binding energy, and thus, on the gravitational waves emitted. We here compute the effect of this environment on the gravitational-wave phase using the stationary-phase approximation within the post-Newtonian formalism. We then perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the detectability of this environmental effect with a four-year LISA observation, focusing on vector fields with ultra-light masses in the $(10^{-19}, 10^{-16}) \; \rm{eV}$ range. We conclude that the observation of such gravitational waves with space-borne interferometers, like LISA, could yield a measurement or constraint on local, vector dark-matter environments, provided the dark-matter density is larger than roughly $10^{14} \rm{M}_\odot/{\rm{pc}}^3$.</description>

      <title>Across the Universe: Dark Matter and Galaxy Cross-Correlations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will be a ground-based Cherenkov telescope performing wide-sky surveys, ideal for anisotropy studies such as cross-correlations with tracers of the cosmic large-scale structure. Cross-correlations can shed light on high-energy $\gamma$-ray sources and potentially reveal exotic signals from particle dark matter. In this work, we investigate CTAO sensitivity to cross-correlation signals between $\gamma$-ray emission and galaxy distributions. We find that by using dense, low-redshift catalogs like 2MASS, and for integration times around 50 hours, this technique achieves sensitivities to both annihilating and decaying dark matter signals that are competitive with those from dwarf galaxy and cluster analyses.</description>

      <title>Precision Unitarity Calculations in Inflationary Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit perturbative unitarity in scalar field inflation with a nonminimal coupling, with Higgs inflation serving as the most prominent example. Although such models are phenomenologically successful, it is critical to examine whether or not unitarity violations spoil their theoretical self-consistency. The analysis of these issues has so far typically relied on order-of-magnitude estimates of scattering amplitudes, which are appropriate for generic parameters. It is not evident that these methods apply to scenarios relying on a near-critical inflationary potential, for which an interplay of both small scalar self-couplings and nonminimal couplings could partially alleviate the unitarity issues. To allow for an exploration of this possibility, we consider the full $S$-matrix for the relevant scattering processes, taking into account important phase space volume factors, leading to a precise evaluation of the cut-off scale. In the single-field case, we demonstrate that near-criticality raises the cut-off scale considerably, compared to previous estimates. In the multifield case, momentum-dependent self-interactions in the kinetic sector lower the cut-off compared to the single-field case to a value comparable to but slightly larger than previous estimates. We carefully study both the single-field and multifield cases in metric and metric-affine (Palatini) formulations of gravity, as well as introduce a new phenomenologically viable model with a canonical kinetic term and a significantly raised cut-off, and discuss the importance of background field effects.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation of the neutrino plasma: Unifying fast, slow, and collisional instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In neutrino-dense astrophysical environments, these particles exchange flavor through a coherent weak field, forming a collisionless neutrino plasma with collective flavor dynamics. Instabilities, which grow and affect the environment, may arise from neutrino-neutrino refraction alone (fast limit), vacuum energy splittings caused by masses (slow limit), or neutrino-matter scattering (collisional limit). We present a comprehensive analytical description of the dispersion relation governing these unstable modes. Treating vacuum energy splittings and collision rates as small perturbations, we construct a unified framework for fast, slow, and collisional instabilities. We classify modes into gapped, where collective excitations are already present in the fast limit but rendered unstable by slow or collisional effects, and gapless, which are purely generated by these effects. For each class, we derive approximate dispersion relations for generic energy and angle distributions, which reveal the order of magnitude of the growth rates and the nature of the instabilities without solving directly the dispersion relation. This approach confirms that slow and collisionally unstable waves generally grow much more slowly than they oscillate. Consequently, the common fast-mode approximation of local evolution within small boxes is unjustified. Even for fast modes, neglecting large-distance propagation of growing waves, as usually done, may be a poor approximation. Our unified framework provides an intuitive understanding of the linear phase of flavor evolution across all regimes and paves the way for a quasi-linear treatment of the instability's nonlinear development.</description>

      <title>Probing supermassive black hole scalarization with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories with a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant can evade no-hair theorems and allow for non-trivial scalar profiles around black holes. This coupling is characterized by a length scale $\lambda$, which, in an effective field theory perspective, sets the threshold below which deviations from General Relativity become significant. LIGO/VIRGO constraints indicate $\lambda$ is small, implying supermassive black holes should not scalarize. However, recent work suggests that scalarization can occur within a narrow window of masses, allowing supermassive black holes to scalarize, while leaving LIGO/VIRGO sources unaffected. We explore the impact of this scenario on the stochastic gravitational wave background recently observed by Pulsar Timing Arrays. We find that scalarization can alter the characteristic strain produced by circularly inspiralling SMBH binaries and that current data shows a marginal preference for a non-zero $\lambda$. However, similar signatures could arise from astrophysical effects such as orbital eccentricity or environmental interactions, emphasizing the need for improved modeling and longer observations to discriminate among the different scenarios.</description>

      <title>DESI Emission Line Galaxies: Clustering Dependence one Stellar Mass and [OII] Luminosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the projected two-point correlation functions of emission line galaxies (ELGs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) One-Percent Survey and model their dependence on stellar mass and [OII] luminosity. We select $\sim$180,000 ELGs with redshifts of $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.6$ and define 27 samples according to cuts in redshift and both galaxy properties. Following a framework that describes the conditional [OII] luminosity-stellar mass distribution as a function of halo mass, we simultaneously model the clustering measurements of all samples at fixed redshift. Based on the modeling result, most ELGs in our samples are classified as central galaxies, residing in halos of a narrow mass range with a typical median of $\sim$10$^{12.2-12.4}$ $h^{-1} M_\odot$. We observe a weak dependence of clustering amplitude on stellar mass, which is reflected in the model constraints and is likely a consequence of the 0.5-dex measurement uncertainty in the stellar mass estimates. The model shows a trend between galaxy bias and [OII] luminosity at high redshift ($1.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.6$) that is otherwise absent at lower redshifts.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR Observations of the Galaxy Cluster Abell 3667</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the hard X-ray emission from the central region of Abell 3667 using deep NuSTAR observations. While previous studies on the nature of the hard X-ray excess have been controversial, our analysis of the central region suggests that the excess is primarily thermal, best described by a two-temperature (2T) model, with the high-temperature component likely arising from merger-induced heating. This interpretation contrasts with some earlier suggestions of non-thermal emission due to inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons. Additionally, we set a lower limit on the magnetic field strength of $\sim 0.2 \, \mu$G in the central region, consistent with values found in other dynamically active clusters and compatible with those inferred from equipartition and Faraday rotation measurements. Since our study is focused on the central region of the cluster, further high-resolution observations of the outer regions will be critical to fully disentangle the thermal and non-thermal contributions to the X-ray.</description>

      <title>Multiverse Predictions for Habitability: The Habitability of Exotic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relative abundances of exotic environments provides us with (uninformed) bounds on the habitability of those environments relative to our own, on the basis that our presence here is not too atypical. For instance, since red stars outnumber yellow stars 7 to 3, we can infer that red stars must be less than 8.1 times as habitable as yellow, as otherwise our presence around a yellow star would be a statistical outlier at the level of $5\%$. In the multiverse context, the relative abundances of exotic environments can be drastically different from those in our universe, which sometimes allows us to place much stronger bounds on their relative habitability than we would get by restricting our attention to our universe. We apply this reasoning to a variety of different exotic environments: tidally locked planets, binary star systems, icy moons, rogue planets, liquids with properties different from water, and waterworlds. We find that the bounds on the relative habitability of rogue planets and waterworlds are at least an order of magnitude stronger in a multiverse context than from our universe alone. Additionally, the belief that some of water's special properties are essential for life, such as the fact that ice floats and, with some caveats, that it acts as a universal solvent, are incompatible with the multiverse hypothesis. If any of these bounds are found to be violated in the future, the multiverse hypothesis can be falsified to a high degree of confidence.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling and instabilities in singularity-free inflation from an infinite sum of curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional gravitational theories derived from an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, combined with a conformal rescaling of the metric, are equivalent to a subclass of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories that possess a single scalar degree of freedom. Under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background, the theory admits an inflationary solution that replaces the Big Bang singularity. This can be achieved by a solution where the Hubble expansion rate $H$ is equal to the time derivative of the scalar field $\dot{\phi}$. We show that the solution $H=\dot{\phi}$ suffers from a strong coupling problem, characterized by the vanishing kinetic term of linear scalar perturbations at all times. Consequently, nonlinear scalar perturbations remain uncontrolled from the onset of inflation throughout the subsequent cosmological evolution. Moreover, tensor perturbations are generally subject to Laplacian instabilities during inflation. This instability in the tensor sector also persists under background initial conditions where $H \neq \dot{\phi}$. In the latter case, both the coefficient of the kinetic term for scalar perturbations and the scalar sound speed diverge at the onset of inflation. Thus, the dominance of inhomogeneities in this theory renders the homogeneous background solution illegitimate.</description>

      <title>Inflationary power spectrum from the Lanczos algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized Lanczos algorithm can provide a universal method for constructing the wave function under the group structure of Hamiltonian. Based on this fact, we obtain an open two-mode squeezed state as the quantum origin for the curvature perturbation. In light of this wave function in the open system, we successfully develop a new method to calculate its corresponding power spectrum by using the Bogoliubov transformation. Unlike traditional approaches, we explicitly retain the Bogoliubov coefficients in terms of the squeezing amplitude \( r_k \) and the squeezing rotation angle \( \phi_k \). As a result, the power spectrum of the open two-mode squeezed state will match that of the Bunch-Davies vacuum numerically. Furthermore, the derivation of the open two-mode squeezed state relies on the second kind Meixner polynomial (equivalent to the generalized Lanczos algorithm) and the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, our research may offer a new insight into the calculation of the correlation functions through a group-theoretic perspective.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference of microlensed gravitational waves using neural spline flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When gravitational waves (GWs) propagate near massive objects, they undergo gravitational lensing that imprints lens model dependent modulations on the waveform. This effect provides a powerful tool for cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, conventional Bayesian parameter inference methods for GWs are computationally expensive, especially for lensed events with additional lens parameters, necessitating more efficient approaches. In this work, we explore the use of neural spline flows (NSFs) for posterior inference of microlensed GWs, and successfully apply NSFs to the inference of 13-dimensional lens parameters. Our results demonstrate that compared with traditional methods like Bilby dynesty that rely on Bayesian inference, the NSF network we built not only achieves inference accuracy comparable to traditional methods for the main parameters, but also can reduce the inference time from approximately 3 days to 0.8 s on average. Additionally, the network exhibits strong generalization for the spin parameters of GW sources. It is anticipated to become a powerful tool for future low-latency searches for lensed GW signals.</description>

      <title>Optimized quantum sensor networks for ultralight dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most compelling unresolved problems in fundamental physics, motivating the search for new detection approaches. We propose a network-based quantum sensor architecture to enhance sensitivity to ultralight DM fields. Each node in the network is a superconducting qubit, interconnected via controlled-Z gates in symmetric topologies such as line, ring, star, and fully connected graphs. We investigate four- and nine-qubit systems, optimizing both state preparation and measurement using a variational quantum metrology framework. This approach minimizes the quantum and classical Cramer-Rao bounds to identify optimal configurations. Bayesian inference is employed to extract the DM-induced phase shift from measurement outcomes. Our results show that optimized network configurations significantly outperform conventional GHZ-based protocols while maintaining shallow circuit depths compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. Sensitivity remains robust under local dephasing noise. These findings highlight the importance of network structure in quantum sensing and point toward scalable strategies for quantum-enhanced DM detection.</description>

      <title>Dark-matter-induced transients over cosmic time: The role of star formation history profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.</description>

      <title>Teleparallel dark energy in a nonflat universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the cosmological dynamics of teleparallel dark energy in the presence of nonzero spatial geometry. Extending previous analyses of nonminimal scalar-tensor theories in the torsion-based framework, we consider different scalar field potentials and examine the resulting background evolution and linear perturbations. Adopting a dynamical systems approach, we reformulate the field equations and constrain the model parameters via a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis combining updated datasets from Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, cosmic chronometers, and growth rate measurements. Our results suggest a mild preference for an open geometry, although all models remain consistent with a flat universe at the $1\sigma$ level. Notably, Bayesian information criteria indicate that the nonflat teleparallel scenario with a vanishing potential is strongly favored over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, all teleparallel scenarios are compatible with local determinations of the Hubble constant and exhibit better agreement with low-redshift structure formation data compared to $\Lambda$CDM. These findings highlight the potential of nonflat teleparallel gravity to address current observational tensions and motivate its further investigation as a viable alternative to standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian inference on an analytical model of the LISA massive black hole binary population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive black hole binary (MBHB) mergers will be detectable in large numbers by the Lisa Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which will thus provide new insights on how they form via repeated dark matter (DM) halo and galaxy mergers. Here we present a simple analytical model to generate a population of MBHB mergers based on a theoretical prescription that connects them to DM halo mergers. The high flexibility of our approach allows us to explore the broad and uncertain range of MBH seeding and growth mechanisms, as well as the different effects behind the interplay between MBH and galactic astrophysics. Such a flexibility is fundamental for the successful implementation and optimisation of the hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation approach that here we apply to the MBHB population of LISA for the first time. Our inferred population hyper-parameters are chosen as proxies to characterise the MBH--DM halo mass scaling relation, the occupation fraction of MBHs in DM halos and the delay between halo and MBHB mergers. We find that LISA will provide tight constraints at the lower-end of the MBH-halo scaling relation, well complementing EM observations which are biased towards large masses. Furthermore, our results suggest that LISA will constrain some features of the MBH occupation fraction at high redshift, as well as merger time delays of the order of a few hundreds of Myr, opening the possibility to constrain dynamical evolution time scales such as the dynamical friction. The analysis presented here constitutes a first attempt at developing a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach to the LISA MBHB population, opening the way for several further improvements and investigations.</description>

      <title>Multimodality in the Search for New Physics in Pulsar Timing Data and the Case of Kination-amplified Gravitational-wave Background from Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the kination-amplified inflationary gravitational-wave background (GWB) interpretation of the signal recently reported by various pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. Kination is a post-inflationary phase in the expansion history dominated by the kinetic energy of some scalar field, characterized by a stiff equation of state $w=1$. Within the inflationary GWB model, we identify two modes which can fit the current data sets (NANOGrav and EPTA) with equal likelihood: the kination-amplification (KA) mode and the ordinary, non-kination-amplification (no-KA) mode. The multimodality of the likelihood motivates a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. We analyze the free spectra of current PTA data and mock free spectra constructed with higher signal-to-noise ratios, using nested sampling. The analysis of the mock spectrum designed to be consistent with the best fit to the NANOGrav 15 yr (NG15) data successfully reveals the expected bimodal posterior for the first time while excluding the reheating mode that appears in the fit to the current NG15 data, making a case for our correct treatment of potential multimodal posteriors arising from future PTA data sets. The resultant Bayes factor is $B\equiv Z_\mathrm{no-KA}/Z_\mathrm{KA}=2.9\pm1.9$, indicating comparable statistical significance between the two modes. Given the theoretical model-building challenges of producing highly blue-tilted primordial tensor spectra, the KA mode has the advantage of requiring a less blue primordial spectrum, compared with the no-KA mode. The synergy between future cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing and laser interferometer measurements of gravitational waves will help resolve the ambiguity implied by the multimodal posterior in PTA-only searches.</description>

      <title>Calibration requirements for Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal observations -- IV. Bias and variance with time and frequency correlated residual gains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observation of multifrequency angular power spectrum of the redshifted 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuation from the neutral hydrogen holds the key to understand the structure formation and its evolution during the reionization and post-reionization era. A major challenge in observing the neutral hydrogen arises from presence of strong foreground signals in the frequency range of interest. Mitigating the direct effect of foregrounds are being addressed through various techniques in literature. An additional second order effect arises, in presence of foreground, with limited accuracy in time and frequency dependent gain calibrations. This manifests as the residual gain and bandpass error in the observed data, introduces bias and increases uncertainty in the estimates of multifrequency angular power spectrum. In this work, we present an analytic method to estimate the bias and excess uncertainty in the estimates of multifrequency angular power spectrum in presence of residual gain and bandpass errors. We use this framework to estimate the effect of these errors for detection of redshifted 21-cm emission from a redshift of $\sim 8$ with the upcoming SKA1-Low. Due to the high baseline density at the required range of angular multipoles, the SKA1-Low is found to be a tuned instrument for the redshifted 21-cm signal detection. We find that, there are scenario with residual gain and bandpass errors where there can be significant bias in these estimates. Certain foreground mitigation strategies, is expected to reduce a part of the bias. The detailed study of different aspects of gain and bandpass errors and their relative effects are discussed. We find, with assumed models of gain and bandpass errors, signal detection is possible at this redshift with $128$ hours of observations. However, to achieve this one needs to have better calibration accuracy than present day interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) model to constrain the evolution of low-redshift $(z\lesssim0.4)$ matter fluctuations by cross-correlating DESI Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) legacy imaging with the latest CMB lensing maps from Planck and ACT. Our tomographic BGS analysis finds that the evolution and amplitude of matter fluctuations align with CMB-conditioned $\Lambda$CDM predictions. When including DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements we obtain $\sigma_8 = 0.876^{+0.051}_{-0.067}$ from BGS alone. Jointly analyzing BGS and Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) cross-correlations with the same CMB lensing maps yields $\sigma_8 = 0.791\pm0.021$. As a complementary approach we isolate the galaxy magnification signal from the cross-correlation of non-overlapping BGS and LRG photometric redshift bins, ruling out the null-magnification hypothesis at $11\sigma$. For the first time, we constrain structure growth from the (finite-difference calibrated) galaxy magnification signal and find $\sigma_8=0.720\pm0.047\,\,({\rm stat.})\pm0.050\,\,({\rm sys.})$ when adopting a linear bias model and including BAO data.</description>

Abstract: Baryonic effects created by feedback processes associated with galaxy formation are an important, poorly constrained systematic effect for models of large-scale structure as probed by weak gravitational lensing. Upcoming surveys require fast methods to predict and marginalize over the potential impact of baryons on the total matter power spectrum. Here we use the FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to test a recent proposal to approximate the matter power spectrum as the sum of the linear matter power spectrum and a constant multiple, $A_{\rm mod}$, of the difference between the linear and non-linear gravity-only power spectra. We show that replacing this constant multiple with a one-parameter family of sigmoid functions of the wavenumber $k$ allows to us match the predictions of simulations with different feedback strengths for $z \leq 1, k &lt; 3~h\cdot{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, and the different cosmological models in the FLAMINGO suite. The baryonic response predicted by FLAMINGO models that use jet-like AGN feedback instead of the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback can also be reproduced, but at the cost of increasing the number of parameters in the sigmoid function from one to three. The assumption that $A_{\rm mod}$ depends only on $k$ breaks down for decaying dark matter models, highlighting the need for more advanced baryon response models when studying cosmological models that deviate strongly from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Impact of ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 for Early Dark Energy and the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The data release six of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR6) and the second data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR2) recently became available. In light of these data, we update constraints on the Early Dark Energy (EDE) resolution to the Hubble tension. While ACT DR6 does not favor EDE over the core cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM, it allows for a significantly larger maximum contribution of EDE, $f_{\rm EDE}$, in the pre-recombination era than the latest analysis of {\it Planck} NPIPE despite increased precision at small angular scales. Moreover, EDE rises the value of $H_0r_s$, improving consistency between CMB and DESI DR2 data. We find a residual tension with SH0ES of $\sim 2 \sigma$ for the combination of {\it Planck} at $\ell &lt;1000$ + ACT DR6 + lensing + Pantheon-plus + DESI DR2, a significant decrease from $3.7 \sigma$ for analyses that use NPIPE and SDSS BAO data. A profile likelihood analysis reveals significant prior-volume effects in Bayesian analyses which do not include SH$0$ES, with confidence intervals of $f_{\rm EDE}=0.09\pm 0.03$ and $H_0= 71.0\pm1.1$ km/s/Mpc. When including DESI data, the EDE model with $H_0=73$ km/s/Mpc provides a better fit than the $\Lambda$CDM model with $H_0=68.4$ km/s/Mpc. The inclusion of SH$0$ES data rises the preference well above $5\sigma$, with $\Delta\chi^2=-35.4$. Our work demonstrates that after ACT DR6 and DESI DR2, EDE remains a potential resolution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Implications of pulsar timing arrays for Gauss-Bonnet Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlated time-of-arrival measurements by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have provided a new means of constraining astrophysical or cosmological models that produce a gravitational wave (GW) background. For this work, we discuss the implications of PTA observations for Gauss-Bonnet (GB) inflationary models through the production and propagation of inflationary GWs. We show that our GB inflationary scenario is consistent with present PTA and cosmological data. A blue-tilted tensor power spectrum supported by PTAs can be naturally accommodated in GB inflation. Using observational constraints, we derive general conditions for the inflaton potential and the GB coupling function, suggesting that in GB inflation, the inflaton must climb up the potential before rolling downhill and reaching the end of inflation. We provide two concrete GB inflationary models to demonstrate the viability of this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Calibration requirement for Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal observation -- III. Bias and variance in uGMRT ELAIS-N1 field power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18306v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Power spectrum of \HI 21-cm radiation is one of the promising probes to study large scale structure of the universe and understand galaxy formation and evolution. The presence of foregrounds, that are orders of magnitude larger in the same frequency range of the redshifted 21-cm signal has been one of the largest observational challenges. The foreground contamination also hinders the calibration procedures and introduces residual calibration errors in the interferometric data. It has been shown that the calibration errors can introduce bias in the 21-cm power spectrum estimates and introduce additional systematics. In this work, we assess the efficacy of 21-cm power spectrum estimation for the uGMRT Band-3 observations of the ELAIS-N1 field. We first evaluate the statistics of the residual gain errors and perform additional flagging based on these statistics. We then use an analytical method to estimate the bias and variance in the power spectrum. We found that (a) the additional flagging based on calibration accuracy help reduce the bias and systematics in the power spectrum, (b) the majority of the systematics at the lower angular scales, $\ell &lt; 6000$, are due to the residual gain errors, (c) for the uGMRT baseline configuration and system parameters, the variance is always higher than the bias in the power spectrum estimates. Based on our analysis we observe that for an angular multipole of $\ell \sim3000$, $2000$ hours of `on source time' is required with the uGMRT to detect redshifted 21-cm signal at $3-\sigma$ significance from a redshift of $2.55$. In this work we only consider the power spectrum measurement in the plane of the sky, an assessment of residual gain statistics and its effect on multifrequency angular power spectrum estimation for the uGMRT and the SKA like telescopes will be presented in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>A Novel Test for MOND: Gravitational Lensing by Disc Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disc galaxies represent a promising laboratory for the study of gravitational physics, including alternatives to dark matter, owing to the possibility of coupling rotation curves' dynamical data with strong gravitational lensing observations. In particular, Euclid, DES and LSST are predicted to observe hundreds of thousands of gravitational lenses. Here, we investigate disc galaxy strong gravitational lensing in the MOND framework. We employ the concept of equivalent Newtonian systems within the quasi-linear MOND formulation to make use of the standard lensing formalism. We derive the phantom dark matter distribution predicted for realistic disc galaxy models and study the impact of morphological and mass parameters on the expected lensing. We find purely MONDian effects dominate the lensing and generate non-trivial correlations between the lens parameters and the lensing cross section. Moreover, we show that the standard realisation of MOND predicts a substantial increase in the number count of disc galaxy lenses compared to the dark matter-driven predictions, making it distinguishable from the latter in upcoming surveys. Finally, we argue that disc galaxy gravitational lensing, coupled to additional astronomical observations, can be used to constrain the interpolating function of MOND.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking inflation in non-minimal metric-affine gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetry-breaking inflation within the framework of metric-affine gravity. By introducing a non-minimal coupling, $\beta(\phi)\tilde{\cal R}$, between the Holst invariant and the inflaton, both small-field and large-field inflationary predictions can be brought into agreement with the latest observational constraints. Remarkably, even for sub-Planckian vacuum expectation values, appropriately chosen values of $\beta(\phi)$ enable viable inflation, a scenario previously considered unattainable.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scenario based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics: Thermodynamic constraints on a generalized cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first and second laws of thermodynamics should lead to a consistent scenario for discussing the cosmological constant problem. In the present study, to establish such a thermodynamic scenario, cosmological equations in a flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe were derived from the first law, using an arbitrary entropy $S_{H}$ on a cosmological horizon. Then, the cosmological equations were formulated based on a general formulation that includes two extra driving terms, $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$, which are usually used for, e.g., time-varying $\Lambda (t)$ cosmology and bulk viscous cosmology, respectively. In addition, thermodynamic constraints on the two terms are examined using the second law of thermodynamics, extending a previous analysis [Phys. Rev. D 99, 043523 (2019) (arXiv:1810.11138)]. It is found that a deviation $S_{\Delta}$ of $S_{H}$ from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy plays important roles in the two terms. The second law should constrain the upper limits of $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ in our late Universe. The orders of the two terms are likely consistent with the order of the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$ measured by observations. In particular, when the deviation $S_{\Delta}$ is close to zero, $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ and $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ should reduce to zero and a constant value (consistent with the order of $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$), respectively, as if a consistent and viable scenario could be obtained from thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Graviton-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversion in the presence of stochastic magnetic fields. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields that may possess nontrivial helicity, and unpolarized gravitational waves (GWs) as the initial state, we obtain expressions for the intensity and linear/circular polarizations of GWs after propagation over a finite distance. We calculate both the expectation values and variances of these observables, and find their nontrivial dependence on the typical correlation length of the magnetic field, the propagation distance, and the photon plasma mass. Our analysis reveals that an observationally favorable frequency range with narrower variance can emerge for the intensity, while a peak structure appears in the expectation value of the circular polarization when the magnetic field has nonzero helicity. We also identify a consistency relation between the GW intensity and circular polarization.</description>
