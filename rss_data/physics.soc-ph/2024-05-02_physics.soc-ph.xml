      <title>Political Stress Index of Poland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the political stress index as introduced by Goldstone (1991) and implemented by Turchin (2013), to the case study of Poland. The approach quantifies political and social unrest as a single quantity based on a multitude of economic and demographic variables. The present-day data allow us to directly apply index without the need of simulating the elite component, as was done previously. Neither model version shows appreciable unrest levels for the present, while the simulated model applied to partial historical data yields the index in remarkable agreement with the fall of communism in Poland. We next analyze the model's sensitive dependence on its parameters (the hallmark of chaos), which limits its utility and application to other countries. The original equations cannot, by construction, describe the elite fraction for longer time-periods; and we propose a modification to remedy this problem. The model still holds some predictive power, but we argue that some components should be reinterpreted if one wants to keep its dynamical equations.</description>

      <title>CoolWalks: Assessing the potential of shaded routing for active mobility in urban street networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Walking is the most sustainable form of urban mobility, but is compromised by uncomfortable or unhealthy sun exposure, which is an increasing problem due to global warming. Shade from buildings can provide cooling and protection for pedestrians, but the extent of this potential benefit is unknown. Here we explore the potential for shaded walking, using building footprints and street networks from both synthetic and real cities. We introduce a route choice model with a sun avoidance parameter $\alpha$ and define the CoolWalkability metric to measure opportunities for walking in shade. We derive analytically that on a regular grid with constant building heights, CoolWalkability is independent of $\alpha$, and that the grid provides no CoolWalkability benefit for shade-seeking individuals compared to the shortest path. However, variations in street geometry and building heights create such benefits. We further uncover that the potential for shaded routing differs between grid-like and irregular street networks, forms local clusters, and is sensitive to the mapped network geometry. Our research identifies the limitations and potential of shade for cool, active travel, and is a first step towards a rigorous understanding of shade provision for sustainable mobility in cities.</description>

      <title>Valuing maintenance strategies for fusion plants as part of a future electricity grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scheduled maintenance is likely to be lengthy and therefore consequential for the economics of fusion power plants. The maintenance strategy that maximizes the economic value of a plant depends on internal factors such as the cost and durability of the replaceable components, the frequency and duration of the maintenance blocks, and the external factors of the electricity system in which the plant operates. This paper examines the value of fusion power plants with various maintenance properties in a decarbonized United States Eastern Interconnection circa 2050. Seasonal variations in electricity supply and demand mean that certain times of year, particularly spring to early summer, are best for scheduled maintenance. Seasonality has two important consequences. First, the value of a plant can be 15% higher than what one would naively expect if value were directly proportional to its availability. Second, in some cases, replacing fractions of a component in shorter maintenance blocks spread over multiple years is better than replacing it all at once during a longer outage, even through the overall availability of the plant is lower in the former scenario.</description>

      <title>Chaotic behavior in Lotka-Volterra and May-Leonard models of biodiversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantification of chaos is a challenging issue in complex dynamical systems. In this paper, we discuss the chaotic properties of generalized Lotka-Volterra and May-Leonard models of biodiversity, via the Hamming distance density. We identified chaotic behavior for different scenarios via the specific features of the Hamming distance and the method of q-exponential fitting. We also investigated the spatial autocorrelation length to find the corresponding characteristic length in terms of the number of species in each system. In particular, the results concerning the characteristic length are in good accordance with the study of the chaotic behavior implemented in this work.</description>

      <title>Modeling pedestrian fundamental diagram based on Directional Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding pedestrian dynamics is crucial for appropriately designing pedestrian spaces. The pedestrian fundamental diagram (FD), which describes the relationship between pedestrian flow and density within a given space, characterizes these dynamics. Pedestrian FDs are significantly influenced by the flow type, such as uni-directional, bi-directional, and crossing flows. However, to the authors' knowledge, generalized pedestrian FDs that are applicable to various flow types have not been proposed. This may be due to the difficulty of using statistical methods to characterize the flow types. The flow types significantly depend on the angles of pedestrian movement; however, these angles cannot be processed by standard statistics due to their periodicity. In this study, we propose a comprehensive model for pedestrian FDs that can describe the pedestrian dynamics for various flow types by applying Directional Statistics. First, we develop a novel statistic describing the pedestrian flow type solely from pedestrian trajectory data using Directional Statistics. Then, we formulate a comprehensive pedestrian FD model that can be applied to various flow types by incorporating the proposed statistics into a traditional pedestrian FD model. The proposed model was validated using actual pedestrian trajectory data. The results confirmed that the model effectively represents the essential nature of pedestrian dynamics, such as the capacity reduction due to conflict of crossing flows and the capacity improvement due to the lane formation in bi-directional flows.</description>

      <title>Microscopic modeling of attention-based movement behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For transportation hubs, leveraging pedestrian flows for commercial activities presents an effective strategy for funding maintenance and infrastructure improvements. However, this introduces new challenges, as consumer behaviors can disrupt pedestrian flow and efficiency. To optimize both retail potential and pedestrian efficiency, careful strategic planning in store layout and facility dimensions was done by expert judgement due to the complexity in pedestrian dynamics in the retail areas of transportation hubs. This paper introduces an attention-based movement model to simulate these dynamics. By simulating retail potential of an area through the duration of visual attention it receives, and pedestrian efficiency via speed loss in pedestrian walking behaviors, the study further explores how design features can influence the retail potential and pedestrian efficiency in a bi-directional corridor inside a transportation hub.

      <title>A Unified Approach to Evaluation and Routing in Public Transport Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both evaluating the service quality of a public transport system and understanding how passengers choose between modes or routes is imperative for public transport operators, providers of competing mobility services and policy makers. However, the literature does not offer consensus on how either of these tasks should be performed, which can lead to inconsistent or counter-intuitive results. This paper provides a formal treatment on how common manifestations of public transport (route sets, timetables and line plans) can be evaluated consistently, and how passengers distribute over routes. Our main insight is that evaluation and routing are two sides of the same coin: by solving an appropriate optimization model one obtains both the quality of the route set, timetable or line plan (the optimal objective value), and the distribution of the travelers over the routes (the optimal solution itself). We further demonstrate that the framework developed in this paper enables planners to (i) improve service by taking better decisions and (ii) assess to what degree of accuracy traveler behavior should be modeled on their network, potentially avoiding investing in complicated methods that may not be necessary.</description>
