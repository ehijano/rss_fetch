      <title>On Densest $k$-Subgraph Mining and Diagonal Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Densest $k$-Subgraph (D$k$S) problem aims to find a subgraph comprising $k$ vertices with the maximum number of edges between them. A continuous reformulation of the binary quadratic D$k$S problem is considered, which incorporates a diagonal loading term. It is shown that this non-convex, continuous relaxation is tight for a range of diagonal loading parameters, and the impact of the diagonal loading parameter on the optimization landscape is studied. On the algorithmic side, two projection-free algorithms are proposed to tackle the relaxed problem, based on Frank-Wolfe and explicit constraint parametrization, respectively. Experiments suggest that both algorithms have merits relative to the state-of-art, while the Frank-Wolfe-based algorithm stands out in terms of subgraph density, computational complexity, and ability to scale up to very large datasets.</description>

      <title>Exploring the core-periphery and community structure in the financial networks through random matrix theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In finance, Random Matrix Theory (RMT) is an important tool for filtering out noise from large datasets, revealing true correlations among stocks, enhancing risk management and portfolio optimization. In this study, we use RMT to filter out noise from the full cross-correlation matrix of stock price returns for the NIFTY 200 and NIFTY 500 indices on the National Stock Exchange of India. In addition, we applied network theory tools to analyze market and sector modes as filtered correlation structures to study local interactions within financial networks. This allows us to study the very fundamental properties of networks, such as the core-periphery and the community structure of constructed networks over these filtered modes, and compare the results with the network constructed over the full cross-correlation matrix. The results suggest that the core-periphery structure is contained in the market mode, while the community structure is in the sector mode. Thus, both modes outperform the full cross-correlation in terms of capturing the essential respective structure of the network. Furthermore, we used these insights to build portfolios based on communities of the networks corresponding to the sector mode and the network corresponding to the full cross-correlation matrix. The results suggest that the portfolio constructed on the complete cross-correlation-based matrix performs better than the sector mode. These insights provide a greater understanding of RMT application in the financial market.</description>

      <title>Examining the Prevalence and Dynamics of AI-Generated Media in Art Subreddits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadly accessible generative AI models like Dall-E have made it possible for anyone to create compelling visual art. In online communities, the introduction of AI-generated content (AIGC) may impact community dynamics by shifting the kinds of content being posted or the responses to content suspected of being generated by AI. We take steps towards examining the potential impact of AIGC on art-related communities on Reddit. We distinguish between communities that disallow AI content and those without a direct policy. We look at image-based posts made to these communities that are transparently created by AI, or comments in these communities that suspect authors of using generative AI. We find that AI posts (and accusations) have played a very small part in these communities through the end of 2023, accounting for fewer than 0.2% of the image-based posts. Even as the absolute number of author-labelled AI posts dwindles over time, accusations of AI use remain more persistent. We show that AI content is more readily used by newcomers and may help increase participation if it aligns with community rules. However, the tone of comments suspecting AI use by others have become more negative over time, especially in communities that do not have explicit rules about AI. Overall, the results show the changing norms and interactions around AIGC in online communities designated for creativity.</description>

      <title>A Hate Speech Moderated Chat Application: Use Case for GDPR and DSA Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of hate speech or toxic content online is a complex and sensitive issue. While the identification itself is highly dependent on the context of the situation, sensitive personal attributes such as age, language, and nationality are rarely available due to privacy concerns. Additionally, platforms struggle with a wide range of local jurisdictions regarding online hate speech and the evaluation of content based on their internal ethical norms. This research presents a novel approach that demonstrates a GDPR-compliant application capable of implementing legal and ethical reasoning into the content moderation process. The application increases the explainability of moderation decisions by utilizing user information. Two use cases fundamental to online communication are presented and implemented using technologies such as GPT-3.5, Solid Pods, and the rule language Prova. The first use case demonstrates the scenario of a platform aiming to protect adolescents from potentially harmful content by limiting the ability to post certain content when minors are present. The second use case aims to identify and counter problematic statements online by providing counter hate speech. The counter hate speech is generated using personal attributes to appeal to the user. This research lays the groundwork for future DSA compliance of online platforms. The work proposes a novel approach to reason within different legal and ethical definitions of hate speech and plan the fitting counter hate speech. Overall, the platform provides a fitted protection to users and a more explainable and individualized response. The hate speech detection service, the chat platform, and the reasoning in Prova are discussed, and the potential benefits for content moderation and algorithmic hate speech detection are outlined. A selection of important aspects for DSA compliance is outlined.</description>

      <title>Modularity maximization and community detection in complex networks through recursive and hierarchical annealing in the D-Wave Advantage quantum processing units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic optimization has long been expected to outperform classical methods in solving NP-type problems. While this has been proven in certain experiments, its main applications still reside in academic problems where the size of the system to be solved would not represent an obstacle to any modern desktop computer. Here we develop a systematic procedure to find the global optima of the modularity function to discover community structure in complex networks solely relying on pure annealers rather than hybrid solutions. We bypass the one-hot encoding constraints by hierarchically and recursively encoding binary instances of the problem that can be solved without the need to guess the exact penalties for the Lagrange multipliers. We study the variability, and robustness of the annealer as a function of network size, directness of connections, topology, and the resolution of the communities. We show how our approach produces meaningful and at least equally optimal solutions to state-of-the-art community detection algorithms while maintaining tractable computing times. Lastly, due to its recursive nature, the annealing process returns intermediate subdivisions thus offering interpretable rather than black-box solutions. These \textit{dendrograms} can be used to unveil normal and pathological hidden hierarchies in brain networks hence opening the door to clinical workflows. Overall, this represents a first step towards an applicable practice-oriented usage of pure quantum annealing potentially bridging two segregated communities in modern science and engineering; that of network science and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Decentralised Agents in Mean-Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02766v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce networked communication to the mean-field game framework, in particular to oracle-free settings where $N$ decentralised agents learn along a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. We prove that our architecture has sample guarantees bounded between those of the centralised- and independent-learning cases. We provide the order of the difference in these bounds in terms of network structure and number of communication rounds, and also contribute a policy-update stability guarantee. We discuss how the sample guarantees of the three theoretical algorithms do not actually result in practical convergence. We therefore show that in practical settings where the theoretical parameters are not observed (leading to poor estimation of the Q-function), our communication scheme significantly accelerates convergence over the independent case (and sometimes even the centralised case), without relying on the assumption of a centralised learner. We contribute further practical enhancements to all three theoretical algorithms, allowing us to present their first empirical demonstrations. Our experiments confirm that we can remove several of the theoretical assumptions of the algorithms, and display the empirical convergence benefits brought by our new networked communication. We additionally show that the networked approach has significant advantages, over both the centralised and independent alternatives, in terms of robustness to unexpected learning failures and to changes in population size.</description>

      <title>An Approach for Addressing Internally-Disconnected Communities in Louvain Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11454v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is the problem of identifying densely connected clusters within a network. While the Louvain algorithm is commonly used for this task, it can produce internally-disconnected communities. To address this, the Leiden algorithm was introduced. This technical report introduces GSP-Louvain, a parallel algorithm based on Louvain, which mitigates this issue. Running on a system with two 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors, GSP-Louvain outperforms Leiden, NetworKit Leiden, and cuGraph Leiden by 391x, 6.9x, and 2.6x respectively, processing 410M edges per second on a 3.8B edge graph. Furthermore, GSP-Louvain improves performance at a rate of 1.5x for every doubling of threads.</description>

      <title>Is the panel fair? Evaluating panel compositions through network analysis. The case of research assessments in Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In research evaluation, the fair representation of panels is usually defined in terms of observable characteristics of scholars such as gender or affiliations. An empirical strategy is proposed for exploring hidden connections between panellists such that, despite the respect of formal requirements, the panel could be considered alike as unfair with respect to the representation of diversity of research approaches and methodologies. The case study regards the three panels selected to evaluate research in economics, statistics and business during the Italian research assessment exercises. The first two panels were appointed directly by the governmental agency responsible for the evaluation, while the third was randomly selected. Hence the third panel can be considered as a control for evaluating about the fairness of the others. The fair representation is explored by comparing the networks of panellists based on their co-authorship relations, the networks based on journals in which they published and the networks based on their affiliated institutions (universities, research centres and newspapers). The results show that the members of the first two panels had connections much higher than the members of the control group. Hence the composition of the first two panels should be considered as unfair, as the results of the research assessments.</description>
