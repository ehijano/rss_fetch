      <title>Kernel-based Equalized Odds: A Quantification of Accuracy-Fairness Trade-off in Fair Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds (EO) criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning (FRL) in supervised settings. The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence (prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as equalized odds; prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned on the prediction $\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$) and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter, thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart, $\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time, with linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for $\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds, which serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus is on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for principled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference and Learning in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: A Framework for Incorporating Explicit and Implicit Prior Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task. This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge. The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including an experimental data set.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization with Expected Improvement: No Regret and the Choice of Incumbent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven empirical success in applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected improvement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the objective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the best posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent (BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices of the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the cumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we show that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared exponential (SE) and Mat\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time that GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound or has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\'ern kernels. Our results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when practitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling feature interactions in tabular data remains a key challenge in predictive modeling, for example, as used for insurance pricing. This paper proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design, allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.</description>

      <title>Can synthetic data reproduce real-world findings in epidemiology? A replication study using tree-based generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence for synthetic data generation holds substantial potential to address practical challenges in epidemiology. However, many current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands, and complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced both quality and stability of the results.</description>

      <title>Generative AI models enable efficient and physically consistent sea-ice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sea ice is governed by highly complex, scale-invariant, and anisotropic processes that are challenging to represent in Earth system models. While advanced numerical models have improved our understanding of the sea-ice dynamics, their computational costs often limit their application in ensemble forecasting and climate simulations. Here, we introduce GenSIM, the first generative AI-based pan-Arctic model that predicts the evolution of all relevant key properties, including concentration, thickness, and drift, in a 12-hour window with improved accuracy over deterministic predictions and high computational efficiency, while remaining physically consistent. Trained on a long simulation from a state-of-the-art sea-ice--ocean system, GenSIM robustly reproduces statistics as observed in numerical models and observations, exhibiting brittle-like short-term dynamics while also depicting the long-term sea-ice decline. Driven solely by atmospheric forcings, we attribute GenSIM's emergent extrapolation capabilities to patterns that reflect the long-term impact of the ocean: it seemingly has learned an internal ocean emulator. This ability to infer slowly evolving climate-relevant dynamics from short-term predictions underlines the large potential of generative models to generalise for unseen climates and to encode hidden physics.</description>

      <title>Variable selection for minimum-variance portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods have been successfully employed in identifying variables that can predict the equity premium of individual stocks. In this paper, we investigate if ML can also be helpful in selecting variables relevant for optimal portfolio choice. To address this question, we parameterize minimum-variance portfolio weights as a function of a large pool of firm-level characteristics as well as their second-order and cross-product transformations, yielding a total of 4,610 predictors. We find that the gains from employing ML to select relevant predictors are substantial: minimum-variance portfolios achieve lower risk relative to sparse specifications commonly considered in the literature, especially when non-linear terms are added to the predictor space. Moreover, some of the selected predictors that help decreasing portfolio risk also increase returns, leading to minimum-variance portfolios with good performance in terms of Shape ratios in some situations. Our evidence suggests that ad-hoc sparsity can be detrimental to the performance of minimum-variance characteristics-based portfolios.</description>

      <title>Twin-Boot: Uncertainty-Aware Optimization via Online Two-Sample Bootstrapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes, where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation Under Heterogeneous Corruption Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.</description>

      <title>Sampling by averaging: A multiscale approach to score estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for efficient sampling from complex, unnormalised target distributions by exploiting multiscale dynamics. Traditional score-based sampling methods either rely on learned approximations of the score function or involve computationally expensive nested Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) loops. In contrast, the proposed approach leverages stochastic averaging within a slow-fast system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to estimate intermediate scores along a diffusion path without training or inner-loop MCMC. Two algorithms are developed under this framework: MultALMC, which uses multiscale annealed Langevin dynamics, and MultCDiff, based on multiscale controlled diffusions for the reverse-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Both overdamped and underdamped variants are considered, with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the desired diffusion path. The framework is extended to handle heavy-tailed target distributions using Student's t-based noise models and tailored fast-process dynamics. Empirical results across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including multimodal and high-dimensional distributions, demonstrate that the proposed methods are competitive with existing samplers in terms of accuracy and efficiency, without the need for learned models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Optimizer Stability: Momentum Adaptation of The NGN Step-size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.</description>

      <title>Hydra: A 1.6B-Parameter State-Space Language Model with Sparse Attention, Mixture-of-Experts, and Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention, chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM) memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance. We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory, Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Inference with General Missingness Patterns and Machine Learning Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained machine learning (ML) predictions have been increasingly used to complement incomplete data to enable downstream scientific inquiries, but their naive integration risks biased inferences. Recently, multiple methods have been developed to provide valid inference with ML imputations regardless of prediction quality and to enhance efficiency relative to complete-case analyses. However, existing approaches are often limited to missing outcomes under a missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) assumption, failing to handle general missingness patterns under the more realistic missing-at-random (MAR) assumption. This paper develops a novel method which delivers valid statistical inference framework for general Z-estimation problems using ML imputations under the MAR assumption and for general missingness patterns. The core technical idea is to stratify observations by distinct missingness patterns and construct an estimator by appropriately weighting and aggregating pattern-specific information through a masking-and-imputation procedure on the complete cases. We provide theoretical guarantees of asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator and efficiency dominance over weighted complete-case analyses. Practically, the method affords simple implementations by leveraging existing weighted complete-case analysis software. Extensive simulations are carried out to validate theoretical results. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on practical implications, limitations, and potential future directions.</description>

      <title>Multiply Robust Conformal Risk Control with Coarsened Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has recently received a tremendous amount of interest, leading to a wide range of new theoretical and methodological results for predictive inference with formal theoretical guarantees. However, the vast majority of CP methods assume that all units in the training data have fully observed data on both the outcome and covariates of primary interest, an assumption that rarely holds in practice. In reality, training data are often missing the outcome, a subset of covariates, or both on some units. In addition, time-to-event outcomes in the training set may be censored due to dropout or administrative end-of-follow-up. Accurately accounting for such coarsened data in the training sample while fulfilling the primary objective of well-calibrated conformal predictive inference, requires robustness and efficiency considerations. In this paper, we consider the general problem of obtaining distribution-free valid prediction regions for an outcome given coarsened training data. Leveraging modern semiparametric theory, we achieve our goal by deriving the efficient influence function of the quantile of the outcome we aim to predict, under a given semiparametric model for the coarsened data, carefully combined with a novel conformal risk control procedure. Our principled use of semiparametric theory has the key advantage of facilitating flexible machine learning methods such as random forests to learn the underlying nuisance functions of the semiparametric model. A straightforward application of the proposed general framework produces prediction intervals with stronger coverage properties under covariate shift, as well as the construction of multiply robust prediction sets in monotone missingness scenarios. We further illustrate the performance of our methods through various simulation studies.</description>

      <title>On Prior Distributions for Orthogonal Function Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel class of prior distributions for sequences of orthogonal functions, which are frequently required in various statistical models such as functional principal component analysis (FPCA). Our approach constructs priors sequentially by imposing adaptive orthogonality constraints through a hierarchical formulation of conditionally normal distributions. The orthogonality is controlled via hyperparameters, allowing for flexible trade-offs between exactness and smoothness, which can be learned from the observed data. We illustrate the properties of the proposed prior and show that it leads to nearly orthogonal posterior estimates. The proposed prior is employed in Bayesian FPCA, providing more interpretable principal functions and efficient low-rank representations. Through simulation studies and analysis of human mobility data in Tokyo, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in inducing orthogonality and improving functional component estimation.</description>

      <title>Label Uncertainty for Ultrasound Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically, estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%) confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Tensorized Multi-Task Learning for Personalized Modeling of Heterogeneous Individuals with High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations. We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation. Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks, particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the personalization of models.</description>

      <title>Investigation of D-Wave quantum annealing for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines and mitigating catastrophic forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain, and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations. A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task. On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing the function spaces defined by neural networks helps understanding the corresponding learning models and their inductive bias. While in some limits neural networks correspond to function spaces that are Hilbert spaces, these regimes do not capture the properties of the networks used in practice. Indeed, several results have shown that shallow networks can be better characterized in terms of suitable Banach spaces. However, analogous results for deep networks are limited. In this paper we show that deep neural networks define suitable reproducing kernel Banach spaces. These spaces are equipped with norms that enforce a form of sparsity, enabling them to adapt to potential latent structures within the input data and their representations. In particular, by leveraging the theory of reproducing kernel Banach spaces, combined with variational results, we derive representer theorems that justify the finite architectures commonly employed in applications. Our study extends analogous results for shallow networks and represents a step towards understanding the function spaces induced by neural architectures used in practice.</description>

      <title>Boundary Detection Algorithm Inspired by Locally Linear Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of high-dimensional data, it is often assumed that the data set possesses an underlying lower-dimensional structure. A practical model for this structure is an embedded compact manifold with boundary. Since the underlying manifold structure is typically unknown, identifying boundary points from the data distributed on the manifold is crucial for various applications. In this work, we propose a method for detecting boundary points inspired by the widely used locally linear embedding algorithm. We implement this method using two nearest neighborhood search schemes: the epsilon-radius ball scheme and the K-nearest neighbor scheme. This algorithm incorporates the geometric information of the data structure, particularly through its close relation with the local covariance matrix. We analyze the algorithm by exploring the spectral properties of the local covariance matrix, with the findings guiding the selection of key parameters. In the presence of high-dimensional noise, we propose a framework aimed at enhancing boundary detection in noisy data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the algorithm's performance with simulated examples.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian Monte Carlo: fast uncertainty estimation beyond deep ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a new method designed for Bayesian deep learning called scalable Bayesian Monte Carlo (SBMC). The method is comprised of a model and an algorithm. The model interpolates between a point estimator and the posterior. The algorithm is a parallel implementation of sequential Monte Carlo sampler (SMC$_\parallel$) or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC$_\parallel$). We collectively refer to these consistent (asymptotically unbiased) algorithms as Bayesian Monte Carlo (BMC), and any such algorithm can be used in our SBMC method. The utility of the method is demonstrated on practical examples: MNIST, CIFAR, IMDb. A systematic numerical study reveals that for the same wall-clock time as state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like deep ensembles (DE), SBMC achieves comparable or better accuracy and substantially improved uncertainty quantification (UQ)--in particular, epistemic UQ. This is demonstrated on the downstream task of estimating the confidence in predictions, which can be used for reliability assessment or abstention decisions.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06382v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable of performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. The impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself.
  We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how to quantify the creation of overconfident or intuitive responses-the signature of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.
  To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, the idealized unconstrained reasoning strictly preserves semantic content.
  By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in departures from truthfulness, semantic information conservation, revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality-we offer a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Robust Sparse Mean Estimation via Incremental Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of robust sparse mean estimation, where the goal is to estimate a $k$-sparse mean from a collection of partially corrupted samples drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. Existing estimators face two critical challenges in this setting. First, the existing estimators rely on the prior knowledge of the sparsity level $k$. Second, the existing estimators fall short of practical use as they scale poorly with the ambient dimension. This paper presents a simple mean estimator that overcomes both challenges under moderate conditions: it works without the knowledge of $k$ and runs in near-linear time and memory (both with respect to the ambient dimension). Moreover, provided that the signal-to-noise ratio is large, we can further improve our result to match the information-theoretic lower bound. At the core of our method lies an incremental learning phenomenon: we introduce a simple nonconvex framework that can incrementally learn the top-$k$ nonzero elements of the mean while keeping the zero elements arbitrarily small. Finally, we conduct a series of simulations to corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study contextual bandits in the presence of a stage-wise constraint when the constraint must be satisfied both with high probability and in expectation. We start with the linear case where both the reward function and the stage-wise constraint (cost function) are linear. In each of the high probability and in expectation settings, we propose an upper-confidence bound algorithm for the problem and prove a $T$-round regret bound for it. We also prove a lower-bound for this constrained problem, show how our algorithms and analyses can be extended to multiple constraints, and provide simulations to validate our theoretical results. In the high probability setting, we describe the minimum requirements for the action set for our algorithm to be tractable. In the setting that the constraint is in expectation, we specialize our results to multi-armed bandits and propose a computationally efficient algorithm for this setting with regret analysis. Finally, we extend our results to the case where the reward and cost functions are both non-linear. We propose an algorithm for this case and prove a regret bound for it that characterize the function class complexity by the eluder dimension.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Experiments Under Data Sparse Settings: Applications for Educational Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03999v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive experimentation is increasingly used in educational platforms to personalize learning through dynamic content and feedback. However, standard adaptive strategies such as Thompson Sampling often underperform in real-world educational settings where content variations are numerous and student participation is limited, resulting in sparse data. In particular, Thompson Sampling can lead to imbalanced content allocation and delayed convergence on which aspects of content are most effective for student learning. To address these challenges, we introduce Weighted Allocation Probability Adjusted Thompson Sampling (WAPTS), an algorithm that refines the sampling strategy to improve content-related decision-making in data-sparse environments. WAPTS is guided by the principle of lenient regret, allowing near-optimal allocations to accelerate learning while still exploring promising content. We evaluate WAPTS in a learnersourcing scenario where students rate peer-generated learning materials, and demonstrate that it enables earlier and more reliable identification of promising treatments.</description>

      <title>Faster Convergence of Riemannian Stochastic Gradient Descent with Increasing Batch Size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have theoretically analyzed the use of Riemannian stochastic gradient descent (RSGD) and found that using an increasing batch size leads to faster RSGD convergence rate than using a constant batch size not only with a constant learning rate but also with a decaying learning rate, such as cosine annealing decay and polynomial decay. The convergence rate of RSGD improves from $O(\sqrt{T^{-1}+\text{const.}})$ with a constant batch size to $O(T^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ with an increasing batch size, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations. Using principal component analysis and low-rank matrix completion tasks, we investigated, both theoretically and numerically, how increasing batch size affects computational time as measured by stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity. Increasing batch size reduces the SFO complexity of RSGD. Furthermore, our numerical results demonstrated that increasing batch size offers the advantages of both small and large constant batch sizes.</description>

      <title>Bayes Error Rate Estimation in Difficult Situations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bayes Error Rate (BER) is the fundamental limit on the achievable generalizable classification accuracy of any machine learning model due to inherent uncertainty within the data. BER estimators offer insight into the difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum requirements for "usefulness", an in-depth examination of their accuracy is conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of the estimators for real-world applications, new non-linear multi-modal test scenarios are introduced. In each scenario, 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques, results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5% range for the 95% confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is 1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the target range.</description>

      <title>Multi-Exit Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: enhancing accuracy and parsimony</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) uniquely combine high accuracy with interpretability, making them valuable for scientific modeling. However, it is unclear a priori how deep a network needs to be for any given task, and deeper KANs can be difficult to optimize and interpret. Here we introduce multi-exit KANs, where each layer includes its own prediction branch, enabling the network to make accurate predictions at multiple depths simultaneously. This architecture provides deep supervision that improves training while discovering the right level of model complexity for each task. Multi-exit KANs consistently outperform standard, single-exit versions on synthetic functions, dynamical systems, and real-world datasets. Remarkably, the best predictions often come from earlier, simpler exits, revealing that these networks naturally identify smaller, more parsimonious and interpretable models without sacrificing accuracy. To automate this discovery, we develop a differentiable "learning-to-exit" algorithm that balances contributions from exits during training. Our approach offers scientists a practical way to achieve both high performance and interpretability, addressing a fundamental challenge in machine learning for scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>TS-Insight: Visualizing Thompson Sampling for Verification and XAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19898</link>

Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) and its variants are powerful Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms used to balance exploration and exploitation strategies in active learning. Yet, their probabilistic nature often turns them into a "black box", hindering debugging and trust. We introduce TS-Insight, a visual analytics tool explicitly designed to shed light on the internal decision mechanisms of Thompson Sampling-based algorithms, for model developers. It comprises multiple plots, tracing for each arm the evolving posteriors, evidence counts, and sampling outcomes, enabling the verification, diagnosis, and explainability of exploration/exploitation dynamics. This tool aims at fostering trust and facilitating effective debugging and deployment in complex binary decision-making scenarios especially in sensitive domains requiring interpretable decision-making.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of multivariate planar curves and applications to X-ray classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in computer vision have enabled the availability of segmented images across various domains, such as medicine, where segmented radiography images play an important role in diagnosis-making. As prediction problems are common in medical image analysis, this work explores the use of segmented images (through the associated contours they highlight) as predictors in a supervised classification context. Consequently, we develop a new approach for image analysis that takes into account the shape of objects within images. For this aim, we introduce a new formalism that extends the study of single random planar curves to the joint analysis of multiple planar curves-referred to here as multivariate planar curves. In this framework, we propose a solution to the alignment issue in statistical shape analysis. The obtained multivariate shape variables are then used in functional classification methods through tangent projections. Detection of cardiomegaly in segmented X-rays and numerical experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the appeal and robustness of the proposed method.</description>
