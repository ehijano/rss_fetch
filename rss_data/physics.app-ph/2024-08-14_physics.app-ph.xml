      <title>Tunable Doping and Mobility Enhancement in 2D Channel Field-Effect Transistors via Damage-Free Atomic Layer Deposition of AlOX Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials (2DMs) have been widely investigated because of their potential for heterogeneous integration with modern electronics. However, several major challenges remain, such as the deposition of high-quality dielectrics on 2DMs and the tuning of the 2DM doping levels. Here, we report a scalable plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) process for direct deposition of a nonstoichiometric aluminum oxide (AlOX) dielectric, overcoming the damage issues associated with conventional methods. Furthermore, we control the thickness of the dielectric layer to systematically tune the doping level of 2DMs. The experimental results demonstrate successful deposition without detectable damage, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and electrical measurements. Our method enables tuning of the Dirac and threshold voltages of back-gated graphene and MoS${_2}$ field-effect transistors (FETs), respectively, while also increasing the charge carrier mobility in both device types. We further demonstrate the method in top-gated MoS${_2}$ FETs with double-stack dielectric layers (AlOX+Al${_2}$O${_3}$), achieving critical breakdown field strengths of 7 MV/cm and improved mobility compared with the back gate configuration. In summary, we present a PEALD process that offers a scalable and low-damage solution for dielectric deposition on 2DMs, opening new possibilities for precise tuning of device characteristics in heterogeneous electronic circuits.</description>

      <title>Forming and Compliance-free Operation of Low-power, Fast-switching HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ Heterostructure Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate low power, forming and compliance-free operation of a resistive memory obtained by the partial oxidation of a two-dimensional layered van-der-Waals semiconductor: hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$). Semiconductor - oxide heterostructures are achieved by low temperature ($&lt;300^{o}$C) thermal oxidation of HfS$_2$ in dry conditions, carefully controlling process parameters such as pressure, temperature and oxygen flow. The resulting HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ heterostructures are integrated between metal contacts, forming vertical crossbar devices. Forming-free, compliance-free resistive switching between two non-volatile states is demonstrated by applying voltage sweeps. By applying voltage pulses and measuring the current response in time, we show non-volatile memory operation programmable by 60ns, $&lt;$ 20pJ WRITE and ERASE operations. Multiple stable resistance states are achievable by pulse width and amplitude modulation demonstrating the capability for multi-state programming. Resistance states were retained without fail at 85$^o$C and 150$^o$C, showcasing the potential of these devices for long retention times. Using a technology computer-aided design (TCAD) tool (Synopsys Sentaurus, 2022), we explore the role of the semiconductor layer in tuning the device conductance and driving gradual resistive switching in 2D HfO$_x$ - based devices.</description>

      <title>Physics-based Analytical Modeling of CMOS Latchup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of the steady-state Kirchhoff equations within the framework of a new physics-based equivalent circuit provides explicit expressions for the holding voltage and current for the resistive mode in bi-stable CMOS structures. The resulting expressions are functions of the physical parameters (temperature, doping level of the substrate, material band gap), which makes it possible to evaluate the influence of technological factors on the latchup parameters. In particular, an explicit formula was obtained for the critical charge for single event latchup as a function of process parameters and temperature.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Particle Integration into Near-Infrared Photodetectors and Photoactivated Gas Sensors: Towards Sustainable Next-Generation Ubiquitous Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current challenges in environmental science, medicine, food chemistry as well as the emerging use of artificial intelligence for solving problems in these fields require distributed, local sensing. Such ubiquitous sensing requires components with (1) high sensitivity, (2) power efficiency, (3) miniaturizability and (4) the ability to directly interface with electronic circuitry, i.e., electronic readout of sensing signals. Over the recent years, several nanoparticle-based approaches have found their way into this field and have demonstrated high performance. However, challenges remain, such as the toxicity of many of today's narrow bandgap semiconductors for NIR detection and the high energy consumption as well as low selectivity of state-of-the-art commercialized gas sensors. With their unique light-matter interaction and ink-based fabrication schemes, plasmonic nanostructures provide potential technological solutions to these challenges, leading also to better environmental performance. In this perspective we discuss recent approaches of using plasmonic nanoparticles for the fabrication of NIR photodetectors and light-activated, energy-efficient gas sensing devices. In addition, we point out new strategies implying computational approaches for miniaturizable spectrometers, exploiting the wide spectral tunability of plasmonic nanocomposites, and for selective gas sensors, utilizing dynamic light activation. The benefits of colloidal approaches for device fabrication are discussed with regard to technological advantages and environmental aspects, which have been barely considered so far.</description>

Abstract: Gallium arsenide optical resonators have been identified as platforms for light-matter interactions ranging from optomechanics to quantum electrodynamics involving nonlinear optics. Here, we present a 5-mm-diameter whispering gallery mode resonator made of undoped gallium arsenide. The fabrication was done using single-point diamond turning followed by polishing with diamond solutions of varying grain size. The resulting resonator was optically characterized to have a quality factor of more than a million.</description>

      <title>Micro-integrated crossed-beam optical dipole trap system with long-term alignment stability for mobile atomic quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies extensively use laser light for state preparation, manipulation, and readout. For field applications, these systems must be robust and compact, driving the need for miniaturized and highly stable optical setups and system integration. In this work, we present a micro-integrated crossed-beam optical dipole trap setup, the $\mu$XODT, designed for trapping and cooling $^{87}\text{Rb}$. This fiber-coupled setup operates at $1064\,\text{nm}$ wavelength with up to $2.5\,\text{W}$ optical power and realizes a free-space crossed beam geometry. The $\mu$XODT precisely overlaps two focused beams ($w_0 \approx 33\,\mu\text{m}$) at their waists in a $45^\circ$ crossing angle, achieving a position difference $\leq 3.4\,\mu\text{m}$ and 0.998 power ratio between both beams with long-term stability. We describe the design and assembly process in detail, along with optical and thermal tests with temperatures of up to $65\,^\circ C$. The system's volume of $25\,\text{ml}$ represents a reduction of more than two orders of magnitude compared to typically used macroscopic setups, while demonstrating exceptional mechanical robustness and thermal stability. The $\mu$XODT is integrated with a $^{87}\text{Rb}$ 3D MOT setup, trapping $3 \times 10^5$ atoms from a laser-cooled atomic cloud, and has shown no signs of degradation after two years of operation.</description>

      <title>Improving the Electro-Optical Properties of MoS$_2$/rGO Hybrid Nanocomposites Using Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid systems of two-dimensional (2D) materials (such as graphene-family materials and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides) are attracting much attention due to their distinctive optoelectronic, thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties. The application perspectives of these materials in various fields further expand when enriching those with liquid crystals (LCs) primarily due to their enhanced tunability and functionality. In this study, we report on the hydrothermal synthesis of hybrid nanocomposites composed of MoS$_2$ and rGO and discuss tuning possibilities of their electro-optical properties by incorporating thermotropic LCs. In particular, we demonstrate that the incorporation of 5CB LC increases the sensitivity and charge storage efficiency of the hybrid nanocomposites. In addition, we also present the responsivity, detectivity, and response time properties of the hybrid nanocomposites of MoS$_2$/rGO, both with and without the inclusion of nematic LCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the system exhibits a 5CB-induced photocurrent switching effect. We believe the findings will open new doors for applications of these materials in optoelectronics and photonics.</description>

      <title>From photon momentum transfer to acceleration sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a typical application of photon momentum transfer, optical levitation systems are known for their ideal isolation from mechanical dissipation and thermal noise. These characters offer extraordinary potential for acceleration precision sensing and have attracted extensive attention in both fundamental and applied physics. Although considerable improvements of optical levitation accelerometers has been reported, the dynamic testing of the sensing performance remains a crucial challenge before the utilization in practical application scenarios. In this work, we present a dual-beam optical levitation accelerometer and demonstrate the test with dynamic inputs for the first time. An acceleration sensing sensitivity of $0.1\mu g$ and a measurement range of $ 1g$ are achieved. These advancements solidify the potential of optical levitation accelerometer for deployment in practical domains, including navigation, intelligent driving, and industrial automation, building a bridge between the laboratory systems and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>In-line fiber optic optofluidic sensor based on a fully open Fabry-Perot interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an all-fiber, fully open Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) cavity that is suitable for fluidic measurement applications. Fabrication of the FPI involves the alignment and bonding of three optical fiber sections using either ceramic glue or low-temperature melting glass. The fabrication procedure allows the protection of the cleaved optical fiber end faces, which serve as the two mirrors of the FPI, from damage, thus ensuring the high visibility of the FPI sensor. The FPI's complete openness permits the analyte of interest fluids to flow smoothly into the cavity and interact directly with the light, obviating the need for additional assistance. The fabrication experiment demonstrates that the fabrication procedure can readily achieve a visibility of over 20 dB. Refractive index testing indicates that the sensor exhibits a sensitivity of over 1116 nm/RIU within the range of 1.334-1.375. A comparison of temperature investigations indicates that the fully open cavity FPI fabricated by bonding with low-temperature melting glass exhibits relatively lower temperature immunity than that bonded with ceramic glue. Both have a relatively low temperature fluctuation within the temperature range of 40{\deg}C-100{\deg}C, with less than 3 nm and 4.5 nm in the over 60{\deg}C changes, respectively. Our proposed fully open FPI is an economical, robust, and simple-to-fabricate structure with the potential for mass production. This renders it an appealing option for practical optofluidics applications.</description>

      <title>Coupling Between Local and Global Oscillations in Palladium-Catalysed Methane Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between order and disorder is crucial across various fields, especially in understanding oscillatory phenomena. Periodic oscillations are frequently observed in heterogeneous catalysis, yet their underlying mechanisms need deeper exploration. Here, we investigate how periodic oscillations arise during methane oxidation catalysed by palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs), utilizing a suite of complementary operando techniques across various spatial scales. We found that reaction intensity and collective dynamic modes can be tuned by the reactant gas-flow rate. At lower gas-flow rates, we observed periodic facet reconstruction of Pd NPs correlated with repeated bubbling behaviour at the Pd/PdO interface, without evident global oscillatory responses. Conversely, at higher gas-flow rates, Pd NPs undergo chaotic transformations between metallic and oxidized states, resulting in overall oscillation. Integrating our observations at different gas-flow rates, we attributed the emergence of global oscillation to thermal coupling regulated by gas flow and connected local and global dynamics through a weak synchronization mechanism. This work demonstrates the correlations between open surfaces and interfaces, chaos and regularity, and dissipative processes and coupling behaviour. Our findings offer critical insights into the complexity behind catalytic oscillations and provide guidance for modulating oscillatory behaviours in catalytic processes, with significant implications for both science and industry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional circuit diagrams and graph-based circuit theory are used for the phase-independent circuits such as resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuits and semiconductor transistor circuits, rather than for the phase-dependent circuits such as Josephson junction circuits and quantum-phase-slip (QPS) junction circuits. To unify the analyses for both phase-independent and phase-dependent electric circuits, we develop an electromagnetic-field-based circuit theory and invent the electric-charge-flow (ECF) and the magnetic-flux-flow (MFF) diagrams to derive the general circuit equations and visualizes the dynamics of circuit devices for all kinds of electric circuits. ECF and MFF diagrams enable electric circuits to be described like the molecules composed of two kinds of atoms; they are new languages for circuit design and analysis, promising for machine-learning.</description>

      <title>Double helical plasmonic antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic double helical antennas are a means to funnel circularly polarized states of light down to the nanoscale. Here, an existing design tool for single helices is extended to the case of double helices and used to design antennas that combine large chiroptical interaction strength with highly directional light emission. Full-field numerical modeling underpins the design and provides additional insight into surface charge distributions and resonance widths. The experimentally realized double helical antennas were studied regarding their polarization-dependent transmission behavior resulting in a large and broadband dissymmetry factor in the visible range. Since the polarization of light is an important tool for implementing logic functionality in photonic and quantum photonic devices, these helices are potential building blocks for future nanophotonic circuits, but also for chiral metamaterials or phase plates.</description>
