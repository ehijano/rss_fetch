      <title>A study of the spin 1 Unruh-De Witt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of the spin 1 Unruh-De Witt detectors interacting with a relativistic scalar quantum field is presented. After tracing out the field modes, the resulting density matrix for a bipartite qutrit system is employed to investigate the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. Unlike the case of spin $1/2$, for which the effects of the quantum field result in a decreasing of the size of violation, in the case of spin $1$ both decreasing and increasing of the violation may occur. This effect is ascribed to the fact that Tsirelson's bound is not saturated in the case of qutrits.</description>

      <title>A Heterotic K\"ahler Gravity and the Distance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformations of the heterotic superpotential give rise to a topological holomorphic theory with similarities to both Kodaira-Spencer gravity and holomorphic Chern-Simons theory. Although the action is cubic, it is only quadratic in the complex structure deformations (the Beltrami differential). Treated separately, for large fluxes, or alternatively at large distances in the background complex structure moduli space, these fields can be integrated out to obtain a new field theory in the remaining fields, which describe the complexified hermitian and gauge degrees of freedom. We investigate properties of this new holomorphic theory, and in particular connections to the swampland distance conjecture in the context of heterotic string theory. In the process, we define a new type of symplectic cohomology theory, where the background complex structure Beltrami differential plays the role of the symplectic form.</description>

      <title>How the Hilbert space of two-sided black holes factorises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In AdS/CFT, two-sided black holes are described by states in the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces associated with the two asymptotic boundaries of the spacetime. Understanding how such a tensor product arises from the bulk perspective is an important open problem in holography, known as the factorisation puzzle. In this paper, we show how the Hilbert space of bulk states factorises due to non-perturbative contributions of spacetime wormholes: the trace over two-sided states with different particle excitations behind the horizon factorises into a product of traces of the left and right sides. This precisely occurs when such states form a complete basis for the bulk Hilbert space. We prove that the factorisation of the trace persists to all non-perturbative orders in $1/G_N$, consequently providing a possible resolution to the factorisation puzzle from the gravitational path integral. In the language of von Neumann algebras, our results provide strong evidence that the algebra of one-sided observables transitions from a Type II or Type III algebra, depending on whether or not perturbative gravity effects are included, to a Type I factor when including non-perturbative corrections in the bulk.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Switchback Effect II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in static patch holography proposed that quantum gravity in de Sitter space admits a dual description in terms of a quantum mechanical theory living on a timelike surface near the cosmological horizon. In parallel, geometric observables associated with the Einstein-Rosen bridge of a black hole background were suggested to compute the computational complexity of the state dual to a gravitational theory. In this work, we pursue the study of the complexity=volume and complexity=action conjectures in a Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry perturbed by the insertion of a shockwave at finite boundary times. This analysis extends previous studies that focused either on the complexity=volume 2.0 conjecture, or on the case of a shockwave inserted along the cosmological horizon. We show that the switchback effect, describing the delay in the evolution of complexity in reaction to a perturbation, is a universal feature of the complexity proposals in asymptotically de Sitter space. The geometric origin of this phenomenon is related to the causal connection between the static patches of de Sitter space when a positive pulse of null energy is inserted in the geometry.</description>

      <title>Nicolai maps for super Yang-Mills on the light cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Nicolai maps for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four and ten spacetime dimensions in the light-cone gauge, where the elimination of non-propagating degrees of freedom causes nonlocal and four-fermi interactions in the Lagrangian. The presence of the latter used to be an obstruction to the Nicolai map, which has recently been overcome at the price of quantum corrections to the map. No gauge-fixing or ghost terms arise in this formulation, since only physical transverse degrees of freedom occur. We present an explicit form of the Nicolai map to second order in the gauge coupling. In four dimensions, a `chiral' choice of the map leaves one of the two transverse gauge-field modes invariant, which forces the classical part of the map (on the other mode) to become a polynomial (quadratic in the gauge coupling, cubic in the gauge field)! In the power series expansion for the ten-dimensional map however, cancellations at each order in the coupling are systematic but incomplete, still leaving an infinite power series for the Nicolai map (on all eight transverse modes). Nevertheless, the existence of a polynomial variant is conceivable, also for the maximal ${\cal N}{=}\,4$ theory in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>On Unitarity of Bespoke Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use partial wave unitarity to constrain various bespoke four-point amplitudes. We start by constructing bespoke generalizations of the type I superstring amplitude, which we show satisfy dual resonance and have suitable high-energy limits. By analyzing the behavior of partial wave coefficients for highly massive states, we strictly rule out all bespoke amplitudes with asymptotically non-linear Regge trajectories and place constraints on the first few non-trivial parameters in asymptotically linear cases. Finally, we argue that while a large class of unitary bespoke amplitudes fails to satisfy Regge Sum Rules, there exists a smaller sub-class with a vanishing mass gap that is superpolynomially bounded.</description>

      <title>Surfaceology for Colored Yukawa Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arkani-Hamed and collaborators have recently shown that scattering amplitudes for colored theories can be expressed as integrals over combinatorial objects simply constructed from surfaces decorated by kinematic data. In this paper we extend the curve integral formalism to theories with colored fermionic matter and present a compact formula for the all-loop, all-genus, all-multiplicity amplitude integrand of a colored Yukawa theory. The curve integral formalism makes certain properties of the amplitudes manifest and repackages non-trivial numerators into a single combinatorial object. We also present an efficient formula for $L$-loop integrated amplitudes in terms of a sum over $2^L$ combinatorial determinants.</description>

      <title>The KLT kernel in twistor space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double copy relationship between Yang-Mills theory and general relativity can be stated in terms of a field theory Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) momentum kernel, which maps two colour-ordered gluon amplitudes to a graviton amplitude at tree-level. These amplitudes can also be written in compact, helicity-graded representations on twistor space which include the famous Parke-Taylor and Hodges formulae in the maximal helicity violating sector. However, a double copy formulation of these helicity-graded formulae has proved elusive. In this paper, we use graph-theoretic methods to obtain an explicit double copy representation of the tree-level, helicity graded S-matrix of general relativity in terms of a KLT-like integral kernel in twistor space. This integral kernel glues together two colour-ordered integrands for tree-level gluon scattering on twistor space to produce tree-level graviton amplitudes, and admits a chiral splitting into positive and negative helicity degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the kernel can be inverted to obtain a new formula for the tree-level S-matrix of biadjoint scalar theory, which we verify using recursion relations. We also derive extensions of this integral kernel to graviton scattering in anti-de Sitter space and self-dual radiative spacetimes, commenting on their potential double copy interpretations.</description>

      <title>Effective theory for fusion of conformal defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an effective field theory for fusion of conformal defects of any codimension in $d\geq 3$ conformal field theories. We fully solve the constraints of Weyl invariance for defects of arbitrary shape on general curved bulk manifolds and discuss the simplifications that arise for spherical defects on the conformal sphere. As applications, we study the structure of cusp anomalous dimensions in the anti-parallel lines limit and derive high-energy spin-dependent asymptotics for the one-point functions of bulk operators. We point out the potential importance of defects that break transverse rotations and initiate a classification of their Weyl anomalies.</description>

      <title>On soft factors and transmutation operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well known soft theorems state the specific factorizations of tree level gravitational (GR) amplitudes at leading, sub-leading and sub-sub-leading orders, with universal soft factors. For Yang-Mills (YM) amplitudes, similar factorizations and universal soft factors are found at leading and sub-leading orders. Then it is natural to ask if the similar factorizations and soft factors exist at higher orders. In this note, by using transformation operators proposed by Cheung, Shen and Wen, we reconstruct the known soft factors of YM and GR amplitudes, and prove the nonexistence of higher order soft factor of YM or GR amplitude which satisfies the universality.</description>

      <title>Particle production and hadronization temperature of the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the pair production, string breaking, and hadronization of a receding electron-positron pair using the bosonized version of the massive Schwinger model in quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 space-time dimensions. Specifically, we study the dynamics of the electric field in Bjorken coordinates by splitting it into a coherent field and its Gaussian fluctuations. We find that the electric field shows damped oscillations, reflecting pair production. Interestingly, the computation of the asymptotic total particle density per rapidity interval for large masses can be fitted using a Boltzmann factor, where the temperature can be related to the hadronization temperature in QCD. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of an analog quantum simulation of the massive Schwinger model using ultracold atoms, explicitly matching the potential of the Schwinger model to the effective potential for the relative phase of two linearly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between the emergence of a dilaton in gapped (confining) field theories, and the presence of either complex fixed points or instabilities in the strongly coupled dynamics in two classes of bottom-up holographic models. We demonstrate that in one of the two classes there is a critical line of first-order phase transitions (at zero temperature) that terminates at a critical point. We calculate the mass spectrum of fluctuations of the associated regular gravity backgrounds, which we interpret as bound states in the dual field theories. In proximity to the second-order phase transition, we find a parametrically light scalar state, and its composition leads us to identify it as a dilaton.</description>

      <title>First Constraints on a Pixelated Universe in Light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pixelated dark energy is a string theory scenario with a quantum mechanically stable cosmological constant. The number of pixels that make up the universe slowly increases, manifesting as a time-dependent source of dark energy. DESI has recently reported evidence for dynamical dark energy that fits within this framework. In light of this, we perform the first cosmological analysis of the pixelated model. We find that the simplest model where the pixel growth rate is constant is unable to accommodate the data, providing a comparable fit to $\Lambda$CDM; but that models where the pixel growth rate is increasing and of order the Hubble constant today are compatible. Our analysis helps to clarify the features of UV constructions of dark energy necessary to accommodate the data.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Schwarzschild Solutions in $f(R)$ Extension of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the question of how to build a class of $f(R)$ extensions of General Relativity which are compatible with solar system experiments, without making any preliminary assumption on the properties of $f$. The aim is reached by perturbatively solving the modified Einstein equations around a Schwarzschild background and retrieving a posteriori the corresponding $f(R)$. This turns out to be non analytical in $R=0$ and should be intended as the leading correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action in the low curvature limit. The parameters characterizing the $f(R)$ class are then set by constraining the corrections to four different local tests with the observations. The result is a class of $f(R)$ theories built up from a purely bottom-up approach and compatible with the local tests. At a more general level, this result can help constraining exact $f(R)$ models working in Cosmology, since it provides the correct local limit. Further developments and possible extensions of the approach to Cosmology are also discussed.</description>

      <title>(In)stability of the black hole greybody factors and ringdowns against a small-bump correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been proposed that the black hole greybody factors can be important to model ringdown spectral amplitudes. We study the stability of greybody factors against a small-bump correction in the perturbation equation. We find (I) that the greybody factor is stable in the frequency region relevant to ringdown and (II) that it is destabilized at higher frequencies, especially for a sharper bump correction. This behavior is similar to the case of higher overtones, which is also very sensitive to a small correction. We clarify this (in)stability with the WKB analysis. As the greybody factor is stable at the frequency region relevant to the main part of ringdown, we conclude that the greybody factor is suitable to model ringdown amplitude. In order to investigate a bump correction in a self-consistent manner, we consider the small-bump correction that can be realized in the general framework of effective field theory of black hole perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kasner spacetimes are exact solutions that are self-similar and of significant interest because they can describe the dynamic evolution of kinematic variables near the singularity of the Mixmaster universe. The chaotic behavior of the Mixmaster universe is related to the Kasner relations. This study investigates Kasner and Kasner-like solutions in symmetric teleparallel $f\left( Q\right) $-gravity. We consider three families of connections for the spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker. We found that Kasner-like solutions are present in the theory when the nonmetricity scalar $Q$ vanishes. Kasner-like relations are introduced only for the field equations of the connection defined in the coincidence gauge. Finally, we perform a detailed phase-space analysis to understand the dynamics of $f\left( Q\right) $-gravity in the evolution of anisotropies and the effects of different connections on this evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>

Abstract: We compute the purely local-in-time (scale-free and logarithm-free) part of the conservative dynamics of gravitationally interacting two-body systems at the fourth post-Minkowskian order, and at the thirtiest order in velocity. The gauge-invariant content of this fourth post-Minkowskian local dynamics is given in two ways: (i) its contribution to the on-shell action (for both hyperboliclike and ellipticlike motions); and (ii) its contribution to the Effective One Body Hamiltonian (in energy gauge). Our computation capitalizes on the Tutti Frutti approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{123}, no.23, 231104 (2019)], and on recent post-Minkowskian advances [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{128}, no.16, 161103 (2022)], [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{128}, no.16, 161104 (2022)], and [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{132}, no.22, 221401 (2024)].</description>

Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model considering the effects of an effective chiral chemical potential. We offer a new parametrization of the Polyakov loop potential depending on temperature and the chemical potential which, when used together with a proper regularization scheme of vacuum contributions, predicts results consistent with those from lattice simulations.</description>

Abstract: We define a map from the skein module of a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold to the ring of Laurent series in one variable with integer coefficients that satisfies two properties: its evaluation at peripheral curves coincides with the Dimofte--Gaiotto--Gukov 3d-index, and it factors through the 3d-quantum trace map associated to a suitable ideal triangulation of the manifold. The map fulfills a supersymmetry prediction of mathematical physics and is part of a conjectural 3+1 dimensional topological quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In accordance with recent progress of fracton topological phases, unusual topological phases of matter hosting fractionalized quasiparticle excitations with mobility constraints, new type of symmetry is studied -- multipole symmetry, associated with conservation of multipoles. Based on algebraic relation between dipole and global charges, we introduce a series of $(d+1)$-dimensional BF theories with $p$-form gauge fields, which admit dipole of spatially extended excitations, and study their physical properties. We elucidate that gauge invariant loops have unusual form, containing linear function of the spatial coordinate, which leads to the position dependent braiding statistics and unusual ground state degeneracy dependence on the system size. We also show that the theories exhibit a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between $p$-form and $(d-p)$-form dipole symmetries, which is canceled by an invertible theory defined in one dimensional higher via anomaly inflow mechanism.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Trace Anomaly of Supradense Matter via Neutron Star Compactness Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trace anomaly $\Delta\equiv 1/3-P/\varepsilon$ quantifies the possibly broken conformal symmetry in supradense matter under pressure $P$ at energy density $\varepsilon$. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) predicts a vanishing $\Delta$ at extremely high energy or baryon densities when the conformal symmetry is realized but its behavior at intermediate densities reachable in neutron stars (NSs) are still very uncertain. The extraction of $\Delta$ from NS observations strongly depends on the employed model for nuclear Equation of State (EOS). Based on the analytical results from perturbatively analyzing the dimensionless Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations that are further verified numerically by using $10^5$ EOSs generated randomly with a meta-model in a very broad EOS parameter space constrained by terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, here we first show that the compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ of a NS with mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ and radius $R$ scales very accurately with $\Pi_{\rm{c}}\equiv\mathrm{X}/(1+3\mathrm{X}^2+4\mathrm{X})$ where $\mathrm{X}\equiv P_{\rm{c}}/\varepsilon_{\rm{c}}$ is the ratio of pressure over energy density at NS centers. The scaling of NS compactness thus enables one to readily read off the central trace anomaly $\Delta_{\rm{c}}=1/3-\mathrm{X}$ directly from the observational data of either the mass-radius or red-shift measurements. We then demonstrate indeed that the available NS data themselves from recent X-ray and gravitational wave observations can determine model-independently the trace anomaly as a function of energy density in NS cores, providing a stringent test of existing NS models and a clear guidance in a new direction for further understanding the nature and EOS of supradense matter.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Schwinger Effect in Lead-Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe strong photoluminescence of a lead-halide perovskite driven by deep sub-gap irradiation. Using the quasi-adiabatic Landau-Dykhne approach, we interpret this observation in terms of the dynamical Schwinger effect -- tunneling ionization in strong fields. Further, the exponential sensitivity of the Schwinger effect to driving fields allows us to measure the local frozen-in fields in a nominally cubic MAPbBr$_3$ single crystal at room temperature. Finally, we demonstrate an AC analogue of biasing in our system -- the cooperation between two time-dependent fields simultaneously driving the sample. Our results (i) establish lead-halide perovskites as an excellent platform for simulating effects of strong fields on Dirac fields, (ii) contribute to the on-going discussion about inversion-breaking in MAPbBr$_3$ single crystal, and (iii) pave the way for a mid-infrared light detection with lead-halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Canonicalizing zeta generators: genus zero and genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zeta generators are derivations associated with odd Riemann zeta values that act freely on the Lie algebra of the fundamental group of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite temperature dynamical correlation functions of the magnetization operator in the one-dimensional Ising quantum field theory. Our approach is based on a finite temperature form factor series and on a Fredholm determinant representation of the correlators. While for space-like separations the Fredholm determinant can be efficiently evaluated numerically, for the time-like region it has convergence issues inherited from the form factor series. We develop a method to compute the correlation functions at time-like separations based on the analytic continuation of the space-time coordinates to complex values. Using this numerical technique, we explore all space-time and temperature regimes in both the ordered and disordered phases including short, large, and near-light-cone separations at low and high temperatures. We confirm the existing analytic predictions for the asymptotic behavior of the correlations except in the case of space-like correlations in the paramagnetic phase. For this case we derive a new closed form expression for the correlation length that has some unusual properties: it is a non-analytic function of both the space-time direction and the temperature, and its temperature dependence is non-monotonic.</description>

Abstract: We have computed superconformal partial wave for the mixed correlators involving $J$, $\phi$ and $\phi^\dagger$, where $J$ is the superconformal primary of 4D ${\mathcal N} = 2$ stress-tensor multiplet, $\phi$ and $\phi^\dagger$ are chiral and anti-chiral scalars respectively in the channel $\langle J J \phi \phi^\dagger \rangle$. We have used the superembedding formalism and computed conformal partial wave corresponding to the exchange of long multiplet using the supershadow approach. This study provides part of the ingredients necessary for the study of conformal bootstrap for mixed correlator in 4D ${\mathcal N} = 2$ superconformal field theories.</description>

Abstract: For some classical solutions $\Psi_\mathrm{sol}$ in Witten's bosonic string field theory, it was proven that energy of the solution is proportional to the Ellwood invariant $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathcal{V}\Psi_\mathrm{sol})$ with $\mathcal{V}=c\bar{c}\partial X^0\bar{\partial}X^0$. We examine the relation for solutions involving $X^0$ variables. As a result, we obtain that the relation may not hold for such solutions. Namely, there is a possibility that the energy is not proportional to the Ellwood invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massless chiral excitations can arise from the interactions between a fermion and an axion string, propagating along the string and allowing it to superconduct. The properties of these excitations, or zero modes, dictate how the string interacts with light and can thus have important phenomenological consequences. In this paper, we add a nowhere-vanishing Dirac mass for the fermion in the usual model of axion electrodynamics. We find that the zero modes exhibit an interesting phase structure in which they delocalize from the string's core as the mass increases, up until a critical value past which they disappear. We study this structure from an analytic perspective, with explicit numerical solutions, and via anomaly inflow arguments. Finally, we derive the two-dimensional effective theory of the zero mode and its interactions with the four-dimensional gauge field and show how this effective theory breaks down as the zero modes delocalize.</description>

Abstract: We show that a class of $L$-loop conformal ladder graphs correspond to twisted partition functions of free massive complex scalars in $d=2L+1$ dimensions. The graphs arise as four-point functions in certain two- and four-dimensional conformal fishnet models. The twisted thermal two-point function of the scalars is a generator of such conformal graphs for all loops. We argue that this correspondence is seeded by a system of two decoupled harmonic oscillators twisted by an imaginary chemical potential. We find a number of algebraic and differential relations among the conformal graphs which mirror the underlying free dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying complexity in quantum systems has witnessed a surge of interest in recent years, with Krylov-based measures such as Krylov complexity ($C_K$) and Spread complexity ($C_S$) gaining prominence. In this study, we investigate their interplay by considering the complexity of states represented by density matrix operators. After setting up the problem, we analyze a handful of analytical and numerical examples spanning generic two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, qubit states, quantum harmonic oscillators, and random matrix theories, uncovering insightful relationships. For generic pure states, our analysis reveals two key findings: (I) a correspondence between moment-generating functions (of Lanczos coefficients) and survival amplitudes, and (II) an early-time equivalence between $C_K$ and $2C_S$. Furthermore, for maximally entangled pure states, we find that the moment-generating function of $C_K$ becomes the Spectral Form Factor and, at late-times, $C_K$ is simply related to $NC_S$ for $N\geq2$ within the $N$-dimensional Hilbert space. Notably, we confirm that $C_K = 2C_S$ holds across all times when $N=2$. Through the lens of random matrix theories, we also discuss deviations between complexities at intermediate times and highlight subtleties in the averaging approach at the level of the survival amplitude.</description>

Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of two coupled SYK models, conjectured to be holographically dual to an eternal traversable wormhole in AdS$_2$. We consider different periodic drivings of the parameters of the system. We analyze the energy flows in the wormhole and black hole phases of the model as a function of the driving frequency. Our numerical results show a series of resonant frequencies in which the energy absorption and heating are enhanced significantly and the transmission coefficients drop, signalling a closure of the wormhole. These frequencies correspond to part of the conformal tower of states and to the boundary graviton of the dual gravitational theory. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the existence of a hot wormhole phase between the black hole and wormhole phases. When driving the strength of the separate SYK terms we find that the transmission can be enhanced by suitably tuning the driving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for analyzing finite $N$ lattice Yang-Mills theory and finite $N$ matrix models. Utilizing this framework, we examine the bootstrap approach to SU(2) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory in 2,3 and 4 dimensions. The SU(2) Makeenko-Migdal loop equations on the lattice are linear and closed exclusively on single-trace Wilson loops. This inherent linearity significantly enhances the efficiency of the bootstrap approach due to the convex nature of the problem, permitting the inclusion of Wilson loops up to length 24. The exact upper and lower margins for the free energy per plaquette, derived from our bootstrap method, demonstrate good agreement with Monte Carlo data, achieving precision within $0.1\%$ for the physically relevant range of couplings in both three and four dimensions. Additionally, our bootstrap data provides estimates of the string tension, in qualitative agreement with existing Monte Carlo computations.</description>

Abstract: We formulate scalar field theories in a curved braided $L_\infty$-algebra formalism and analyse their correlation functions using Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. We perform detailed calculations in cubic braided scalar field theory up to two-loop order and three-point multiplicity. The divergent tadpole contributions are eliminated by a suitable choice of central curvature for the $L_\infty$-structure, and we confirm the absence of UV/IR mixing. The calculations of higher loop and higher multiplicity correlators in homological perturbation theory are facilitated by the introduction of a novel diagrammatic calculus. We derive an algebraic version of the Schwinger-Dyson equations based on the homological perturbation lemma, and use them to prove the braided Wick theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we bootstrapped the 4-point correlators on the 1D celestial circle using 3D symmetries in the Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory as constraints. We find that the dual inversion property is strong enough to replace the crossing symmetry condition when bootstrapping. We also give some results about the conformal block expansion coefficients which contain the spectrum and the leading multi-OPE of this celestial CFT. Finally, we find a non-local 2-particle operator from the multi-OPE at the leading OPE. Although we studied a specific theory, the methods used are valid for general cases.</description>

      <title>Dark matter particle mass and properties and axion-like dark radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.07240v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New approaches are presented for the formation and evolution of nonlinear structures in different eras and suggest a heavy dark matter scenario with a critical particle mass of $10^{12}$GeV. Particles of this mass can have a free streaming mass equal to the particle mass and form the smallest structures among particles of any mass. In the bottom-up approach, via direct collisions, particles of this mass can form the smallest haloes (two particles) as early as $10^{-6}$s in the radiation era with a density ratio of $32\pi^2$ from the spherical collapse model. The halo mass increases to $10^8M_{\odot}$ at the matter-radiation equality, and to $10^{13}M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$. Halo growth eventually slows down due to the self-limiting effects of dark energy. In the top-down approach, the mass and energy cascades are identified that facilitate the hierarchical structure formation. A scale-independent rate of energy cascade $\varepsilon_u=10^{-7}m^2/s^3$ can be identified. The energy cascade leads to universal scalings on scales $r$, i.e. a two-thirds law for kinetic energy ($v_r^2\propto \varepsilon_u^{2/3}r^{2/3}$) and a four-thirds law for halo density ($\rho_r\propto\varepsilon_u^{2/3}G^{-1}r^{-4/3}$). By extending these scalings down to the smallest structure scale, we can estimate the particle mass $m_X=(\varepsilon_u\hbar^5G^{-4})^{1/9}=10^{12}$GeV, size $l_X=(\varepsilon_u^{-1}\hbar G)^{1/3}=10^{-13}$m, and a characteristic time $\tau_X=c^2/\varepsilon_u=10^{16}$yrs. Here $\hbar$ is the Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and c is the speed of light. The binding energy $E_X=(\varepsilon_u^5\hbar^7G^{-2})^{1/9}=10^{-9}$eV suggests a dark radiation field. The axion-like dark radiation should be produced at time $t_X=(\varepsilon_u^{-5}\hbar^2G^2)^{1/9}=10^{-6}$s with a mass of $10^{-9}$eV or a GUT scale decay constant $10^{16}$GeV and an energy density 1% of CMB photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a two-dimensional non-relativistic electron gas (TDEG) constrained on wires along a M\"{o}bius strip. We considered wires around the strip and along the transverse direction, across the width of the strip. For each direction, we investigate how the curvature modifies the electronic states and their corresponding energy spectrum. At the center of the strip, the wires around the surface form quantum rings whose spectrum depends on the strip radius $a$. For wires at the edge of the strip, the inner edge turns into the outer edge. Accordingly, the curvature yields localized states in the middle of the wire. Along the strip width, the effective potential exhibits a parity symmetry breaking leading to the localization of the bound state on one side of the strip.</description>

Abstract: A quantum-enhanced experiment, in which information is transduced from a system of interest and processed on a quantum computer, has the possibility of exponential advantage in sampling tasks over a traditional experiment, where only the measurement outcomes of projective or weak measurements are stored on a classical computer. In this work, we demonstrate that, similar to the measurement induced phase transition~(MIPT) occurring in traditional experiments, quantum-enhanced experiments can also show entanglement phase transitions. We introduce a noisy transduction operation which replaces projective measurements and acts independently on two qubits, recording the quantum state of one qubit in the measurement apparatus, while erasing the quantum state of the other qubit with the environment. We then construct a random brickwork circuit which shows an entanglement transition tuned by the rate of noisy transduction operations. Below the critical rate of noisy transduction, an extensive amount of entanglement is generated between regions of the system and apparatus, while above the critical rate, entanglement satisfies area law scaling. Our work delineates the prerequisites for quantum-enhanced experiments to manifest entanglement transitions, thereby establishing a foundational framework that connects quantum-enhanced sensing with emergent entanglement phenomena.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical resolution of the black hole singularity inspired in the minimal uncertainty approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new lapse function that simplifies the Hamiltonian constraint, describing the interior of the black hole in terms of the Ashtekar-Barbero variables, into a more straightforward form. The new Hamiltonian leads to different equations of motion than those found in the literature, but through a suitable transformation between temporal parameters, it is found that such a choice leads us to the classical solutions of the Schwarzschild metric, still preserving the physical singularity. In order to resolve this singularity, and inspired by the minimal uncertainty approach, we modify the classical algebra between the dynamic variables of the model, imposing an effective dynamics within the black hole. As a consequence, one of the dynamic variables, denoted by $p_b$, acquires a minimum value at the singularity $t=0$, and on the other hand, the variable related to the radius of the 2-sphere, $p_c$, leads to the resolution of the classical singularity of the black hole by replacing it with a bounce that connects the interior of the black hole with the interior of the white hole. This bounce occurs in the Planck-scale region, where a new event horizon manifests. Upon crossing this horizon, the nature of the interval changes from spatial to temporal outside the white hole.</description>

      <title>Collective neutrino oscillations and heavy-element nucleosynthesis in supernovae: exploring potential effects of many-body neutrino correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy astrophysical processes involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae or binary neutron star mergers, neutrinos play an important role in the synthesis of nuclides. Neutrinos in these environments can experience collective flavor oscillations driven by neutrino-neutrino interactions, including coherent forward scattering and incoherent (collisional) effects. Recently, there has been interest in exploring potential novel behaviors in collective oscillations of neutrinos by going beyond the one-particle effective or "mean-field" treatments. Here, we seek to explore implications of collective neutrino oscillations, in the mean-field treatment and beyond, for the nucleosynthesis yields in supernova environments with different astrophysical conditions and neutrino inputs. We find that collective oscillations can impact the operation of the $\nu p$-process and $r$-process nucleosynthesis in supernovae. The potential impact is particularly strong in high-entropy, proton-rich conditions, where we find that neutrino interactions can nudge an initial $\nu p$ process neutron rich, resulting in a unique combination of proton-rich low-mass nuclei as well as neutron-rich high-mass nuclei. We describe this neutrino-induced neutron capture process as the "$\nu$i process". In addition, nontrivial quantum correlations among neutrinos, if present significantly, could lead to different nuclide yields compared to the corresponding mean-field oscillation treatments, by virtue of modifying the evolution of the relevant one-body neutrino observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically study a family of loop quantizations for the classical Kruskal spacetimes using the effective description motivated from loop quantum gravity for four generic parameters, $c_o, m, \delta_b$, and $\delta_c$, where the latter two denote the polymerization parameters that capture the underlying quantum geometry. We focus on the family where polymerization parameters are constant on dynamical trajectories and of which the Ashtekar-Olmedo-Singh (AOS) and Corichi-Singh (CS) models appear as special cases. We study general features of singularity resolution in all these models due to quantum gravity effects and analytically extend the solutions across the white hole (WH) and black hole (BH) horizons to the exterior. We find that the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the Kretschmann scalar is $r^{-4}$. However, for AOS and CS models, black holes with masses greater than solar mass, the dominant term behaves as $r^{-6}$ for the size of the observable Universe and our analysis can be used to phenomenologically constrain the choice of parameters for other models. In addition, one can uniquely fix the parameter $c_o$ by requiring that the Hawking temperature at the BH horizon to the leading order be consistent with its classical value for a macroscopic BH. Assuming that the BH and WH masses are of the same order, we are able to identify a family of choices of $\delta_b$ and $\delta_c$ which share all the desired properties of the AOS model.</description>

      <title>Faster Bayesian inference with neural network bundles and new results for $f(R)$ models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last few years, there has been significant progress in the development of machine learning methods tailored to astrophysics and cosmology. We have recently applied one of these, namely, the neural network bundle method, to the cosmological scenario. Moreover, we showed that in some cases the computational times of the Bayesian inference process can be reduced. In this paper, we present an improvement to the neural network bundle method that results in a significant reduction of the computational times of the statistical analysis. The novel aspect consists of the use of the neural network bundle method to calculate the luminosity distance of type Ia supernovae, which is usually computed through an integral with numerical methods. In this work, we have applied this improvement to the Hu-Sawicki and Starobinsky $f(R)$ models. We also performed a statistical analysis with data from type Ia supernovae of the Pantheon+ compilation and cosmic chronometers. Another original aspect of this work is the different treatment we provide for the absolute magnitude of type Ia supernovae during the inference process, which results in different estimates of the distortion parameter than the ones obtained in the literature. We show that the statistical analyses carried out with our new method require lower computational times than the ones performed with both the numerical and the neural network method from our previous work. This reduction in time is more significant in the case of a difficult computational problem such as the ones addressed in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems undergo decoherence, which is responsible for the transition from quantum to classical behavior. The time scale in which decoherence takes place can be analyzed using upper limits to its rate. We examine the dynamics of open chaotic quantum systems governed by random Lindblad operators sourced from Gaussian and Ginibre ensembles with Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. In these systems, the ensemble-averaged purity decays monotonically as a function of time. This decay is governed by the decoherence rate, which is upper-bounded by the dimension of their Hilbert space and is independent of the ensemble symmetry. These findings hold upon mixing different ensembles, indicating the universal character of the decoherence rate limit. Moreover, our findings reveal that open chaotic quantum systems governed by random Lindbladians tend to exhibit the most rapid decoherence, regardless of the initial state. This phenomenon is associated with the concentration of the decoherence rate near its upper bound. Our work identifies primary features of decoherence in dissipative quantum chaos, with applications ranging from quantum foundations to high-energy physics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this analysis, we study the dynamics of quantum oscillator fields within the context of a position-dependent mass (PDM) system situated in an Einstein-Maxwell space-time, incorporating a non-zero cosmological constant. The magnetic field is aligned along the symmetry axis direction. To analyze PDM quantum oscillator fields, we introduce a modification to the Klein-Gordon equation by substituting the four-momentum vector $p_{\mu} \to \Big(p_{\mu}+i\,\eta\,X_{\mu}+i\,\mathcal{F}_{\mu}\Big)$ into the Klein-Gordon equation, where the four-vector is defibed by $X_{\mu}=(0, r, 0, 0)$, $\mathcal{F}_{\mu}=(0, \mathcal{F}_r, 0, 0)$ with $\mathcal{F}_r=\frac{f'(r)}{4\,f(r)}$, and $\eta$ is the mass oscillator frequency. The radial wave equation for the relativistic modified Klein-Gordon equation is derived and subsequently solved for two distinct cases: (i) $f(r)=e^{\frac{1}{2}\,\alpha\,r^2}$, and (ii) $f(r)=r^{\beta}$, where $\alpha \geq 0, \beta \geq 0$. The resultant energy levels and wave functions for quantum oscillator fields are demonstrated to be influenced by both the cosmological constant and the geometrical topology parameter which breaks the degeneracy of the energy spectrum. Furthermore, we observed noteworthy modifications in the energy levels and wave functions when compared to the results derived in the flat space background.</description>

      <title>Generalizing measurement-induced phase transitions to information exchange symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the conditions for quantum back action to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. Our framework explicitly uses a model of unitary evolution which couples system, apparatus and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the R\'enyi and von-Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for them. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then show how the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneously breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to the brickwork quantum-enhanced experiment introduced in an accompanying Letter [1] in the case where the unitaries are chosen from the Haar measure, and identify a distinct universality from the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT, and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.</description>

Abstract: We examine neutrino zeromode solutions on the electroweak $Z$-string and their effect on the stability of the string in the standard model and its extensions. We propose using topological invariants constructed from the momentum (and real) space topology of Green's functions, often used for investigating edge modes in condensed matter physics. We analyze the standard model and then examine type-I and type-II extensions of the neutrino sector as well as their hybrid. Based on this analysis, we also comment on proposals in the literature to stabilize the $Z$-string.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the concept of `tachyonic' scalar fields, characterized by a real negative squared `mass', in de Sitter (dS) spacetime. Through a rigorous group-theoretical analysis, we argue that labeling these fields as `tachyonic' lacks physical relevance, often leading to misinterpretations in scholarly discourse, as their `mass' parameter holds no genuine physical significance.</description>

Abstract: We investigate black holes and gravitational perturbations when both the scalar Gauss-Bonnet and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity sectors coexist in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert term, and both sectors are coupled to a single canonically normalized scalar field. The presence of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity sector allows the scalar field to possess a non-vanishing background solution, resulting in additional couplings between odd and even-type gravitational perturbations arising from the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity sector. We illustrate the impact of these even-odd gravitational couplings in gravitational perturbations around a static spherically symmetric black hole. Although the couplings between the odd and even-type gravitational perturbations are known to appear in purely tensorial gravity theories with higher curvature corrections, we demonstrate it in scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_3$ lattice gauge theory as a toy model for dense QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the $(3+1)$-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ lattice gauge theory coupled with the 2-flavor Wilson-Dirac fermion as a toy model for studying quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at nonzero density. We study its phase diagram in the space of the lattice gauge couplings $g^2$ and the quark chemical potentials $\mu$ and discuss the similarity and difference compared with anticipated behaviors of actual QCD. This model also provides a testing ground for various algorithms of the numerical Hamiltonian formalism as its Hilbert space is finite-dimensional in a finite box.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of the Cosmological Dynamics of $O(D,D)$-complete Stringy Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The massless fields in the universal NS-NS sector of string theory form $O(D, D)$ multiplets of Double Field Theory, which is a theory that provides a T-duality covariant formulation of supergravity, leading to a stringy modification of General Relativity. In this framework, it is possible to write down the extensions of the Einstein field equations and the Friedmann equations in such a way that the coupling of gravitational and matter sectors is dictated by the $O(D, D)$ symmetry universally. In this paper, we obtain the autonomous form of the $O(D, D)$-complete Friedmann equations, find the critical points and perform their stability analysis. We also include the phase portraits of the system. Cosmologically interesting cases of scalar field, radiation, and matter are separately considered and compared with the Chameleon models in a similar setting. Accelerating phases and the conditions for their existence are also given for such cases.</description>
