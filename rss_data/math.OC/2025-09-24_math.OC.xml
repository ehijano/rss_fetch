      <title>Pareto-optimal Tradeoffs Between Communication and Computation with Flexible Gradient Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses distributed optimization problems in non-i.i.d. scenarios, focusing on the interplay between communication and computation efficiency. To this end, we propose FlexGT, a flexible snapshot gradient tracking method with tunable numbers of local updates and neighboring communications in each round. Leveraging a unified convergence analysis framework, we prove that FlexGT achieves a linear or sublinear convergence rate depending on objective-specific properties--from (strongly) convex to nonconvex--and the above-mentioned tunable parameters. FlexGT is provably robust to the heterogeneity across nodes and attains the best-known communication and computation complexity among existing results. Moreover, we introduce an accelerated gossip-based variant, termed Acc-FlexGT, and show that with prior knowledge of the graph, it achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between communication and computation. Particularly, Acc-FlexGT achieves the optimal iteration complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( L/\epsilon +L\sigma ^2/\left( n\epsilon^2 \sqrt{1-\sqrt{\rho _W}} \right) \right) $ for the nonconvex case, matching the existing lower bound up to a logarithmic factor, and improves the existing results for the strongly convex case by a factor of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( 1/\sqrt{\epsilon} \right)$, where $\epsilon$ is the targeted accuracy, $n$ the number of nodes, $L$ the Lipschitz constant, $\rho_W$ the spectrum gap of the graph, and $\sigma$ the stochastic gradient variance. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Based Zero-Order Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel zeroth-order optimization algorithm based on an efficient sampling strategy. Under mild global regularity conditions on the objective function, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for the proposed method. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness, highlighting three key attributes: (i) Scalability: consistent performance in high-dimensional settings (exceeding 100 dimensions); (ii) Versatility: robust convergence across a diverse suite of benchmark functions, including Schwefel, Rosenbrock, Ackley, Griewank, L\'evy, Rastrigin, and Weierstrass; and (iii) Robustness to discontinuities: reliable performance on non-smooth and discontinuous landscapes. These results illustrate the method's strong potential for black-box optimization in complex, real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Sequential Testing Problem with Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a controlled version of the Bayesian sequential testing problem for the drift of a Wiener process, in which the observer exercises discretion over the signal intensity. This control incurs a running cost that reflects the resource demands of information acquisition. The objective is to minimize the total expected cost, combining both the expenditure on control and the loss from misclassifying the unknown drift. By allowing for a general class of loss functions and any measurable cost of control, our analysis captures a broad range of sequential inference problems. We show that when a function, determined by the cost structure, admits a global minimizer, the optimal control is constant and explicitly computable, thereby reducing our setting to a solvable optimal stopping problem. If no such minimizer exists, an optimal control does not exist either, yet the value function remains explicit. Our results thus demonstrate that full tractability can be retained even when extending sequential inference to include endogenous control over the information flow.</description>

      <title>Joint Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization in WSNs with Distributed Scaled Proximal ADMM Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative and non-cooperative localization frequently arise together in wireless sensor networks, particularly when sensor positions are uncertain and targets are unable to communicate with the network. While joint processing can eliminate the delay in target estimation found in sequential approaches, it introduces complex variable coupling, posing challenges in both modeling and optimization. This paper presents a joint modeling approach that formulates cooperative and non-cooperative localization as a single optimization problem. To address the resulting coupling, we introduce auxiliary variables that enable structural decoupling and distributed computation. Building on this formulation, we develop the Scaled Proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Joint Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization (SP-ADMM-JCNL). Leveraging the problem's structured design, we provide theoretical guarantees that the algorithm generates a sequence converging globally to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the reformulated problem and further to a critical point of the original non-convex objective function, with a sublinear rate of O(1/T). Experiments on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate that SP-ADMM-JCNL achieves accurate and reliable localization performance.</description>

      <title>Convergence, Duality and Well-Posedness in Convex Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the convex bilevel optimization problem, also known as simple bilevel programming. There are two challenges in solving convex bilevel optimization problems. Firstly, strong duality is not guaranteed due to the lack of Slater constraint qualification. Secondly, we demonstrate through an example that convergence of algorithms is not guaranteed even when usual subotimality gap bounds are present, due to the possibility of encountering super-optimal solutions. We show that strong duality (but not necessarily dual solvability) is exactly equivalent to ensuring correct asymptotic convergence of both inner and outer function values, and provide a simple condition that guarantees strong duality. Unfortunately, we also show that this simple condition is not sufficient to guarantee convergence to the optimal solution set. We draw connections to Levitin-Polyak well-posedness, and leverage this together with our strong duality equivalence to provide another condition that ensures convergence to the optimal solution set. We also discuss how our conditions have been implicitly present in existing algorithmic work.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Transferable Solution Method for Parametric Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a transferable solution method for optimal control problems with varying objectives using function encoder (FE) policies. Traditional optimization-based approaches must be re-solved whenever objectives change, resulting in prohibitive computational costs for applications requiring frequent evaluation and adaptation. The proposed method learns a reusable set of neural basis functions that spans the control policy space, enabling efficient zero-shot adaptation to new tasks through either projection from data or direct mapping from problem specifications. The key idea is an offline-online decomposition: basis functions are learned once during offline imitation learning, while online adaptation requires only lightweight coefficient estimation. Numerical experiments across diverse dynamics, dimensions, and cost structures show our method delivers near-optimal performance with minimal overhead when generalizing across tasks, enabling semi-global feedback policies suitable for real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>Integrated Prediction and Distributionally Robust Optimization for Air Traffic Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategic Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs) such as Ground Delay Programs (GDPs) play a crucial role in mitigating operational costs associated with air traf- fic demand-capacity imbalances. However, GDPs can only be planned (e.g., duration, delay assignments) with confidence if the future capacities at constrained re- sources (i.e., airports) are predictable. In reality, such future capacities are uncer- tain, and predictive models may provide predictions that are vulnerable to errors and distribution shifts. Motivated by the goal of planning optimal GDPs that are distributionally robust against airport capacity prediction errors, we study a fully integrated learning-driven optimization framework. We design a deep learning- based prediction model capable of forecasting arrival and departure capacity distributions across a network of airports. We incorporate the predictions into a distributionally robust formulation of the multi-airport ground holding program (DR- MAGHP). Our results demonstrate that DR-MAGHP can achieve up to a 15.6% improvement over the stochastic programming formulation (SP-MAGHP) under airport capacity distribution shifts. We conclude by outlining future research di- rections aimed at enhancing both the learning and optimization components of the framework.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Guided Exploration of Advanced Air Mobility Congestion Management Strategies with Stochastic Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) represents an evolution of the air transportation system by introducing low-altitude, potentially high-traffic environments. AAM operations will be enabled by both new aircraft, as well as new safety- and efficiency-critical supporting infrastructure. Published concepts of operations from both public and private sector entities establish notions such as federated management of the airspace and public-private partnerships for AAM air traffic, but there is a gap in the literature in terms of integrated tools that consider all three critical elements: AAM fleet operators (\emph{lower} layer), airspace service providers (\emph{middle} layer), and overall system governance from the legacy air navigation service provider (\emph{upper} layer). In this work, we explore modeling congestion management within the AAM setting using a bi-level optimization approach, focusing on (1) time-varying, stochastic AAM demand, (2) differing congestion management strategies, and (3) the impact of unscheduled, \enquote{pop-up} demand. We show that our bi-level formulation can be tractably solved using a Neural Network-based surrogate which returns solution qualities within 0.1-5.2\% of the optimal solution. Additionally, we show that our congestion management strategies can reduce congestion by 25.7-39.8\% when compared to the scenario of no strategies being applied. Finally, we also show that while pop-up demand degrades congestion conditions, our congestion management strategies fare better against pop-up demand than the no strategy scenario. The work herein contributes a rigorous modeling and simulation tool to help evaluate future AAM traffic management concepts and strategies.</description>

      <title>CaCuTe: Casual Cubic-Model Technique for Faster Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a local $\mathcal{O}(k^{-2})$ rate for the gradient update $x^{k+1}=x^k-\nabla f(x^k)/\sqrt{H\|\nabla f(x^k)\|}$ under a $2H$-Hessian--Lipschitz assumption. Regime detection relies on Hessian--vector products, avoiding Hessian formation or factorization. Incorporating this certificate into cubic-regularized Newton (CRN) and an accelerated variant enables per-iterate switching between the cubic and gradient steps while preserving CRN's global guarantees. The technique achieves the lowest wall-clock time among compared baselines in our experiments. In the first-order setting, the technique yields a monotone, adaptive, parameter-free method that inherits the local $\mathcal{O}(k^{-2})$ rate. Despite backtracking, the method shows superior wall-clock performance. Additionally, we cover smoothness relaxations beyond classical gradient--Lipschitzness, enabling tighter bounds, including global $\mathcal{O}(k^{-2})$ rates. Finally, we generalize the technique to the stochastic setting.</description>

      <title>Kernel Variational Inference Flow for Nonlinear Filtering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel particle flow for sampling called kernel variational inference flow (KVIF). KVIF do not require the explicit formula of the target distribution which is usually unknown in filtering problem. Therefore, it can be applied to construct filters with higher accuracy in the update stage. Such an improvement has theoretical assurance. Some numerical experiments for comparison with other classical filters are also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Verification and Synthesis of Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions (DTCBFs) have recently attracted interest for guaranteeing safety and synthesizing safe controllers for discrete-time dynamical systems. This paper addresses the open challenges of verifying candidate DTCBFs and synthesizing DTCBFs for general nonlinear discrete-time systems with input constraints and arbitrary safe sets. In particular, we propose a branch-and-bound method, inspired by the $\alpha$BB algorithm, for the verification of candidate DTCBFs in both cases, whether a corresponding control policy is known or unknown. We prove that this method, in a finite number of iterations, either verifies a given candidate function as a valid DTCBF or falsifies it by providing a counterexample (within predefined tolerances). As a second main contribution, we propose a novel bilevel optimization approach to synthesize a DTCBF and a corresponding control policy in finite time. This involves determining the unknown coefficients of a parameterized DTCBF and a parameterized control policy. Furthermore, we introduce various strategies to reduce the computational burden of the bilevel approach. We also demonstrate our methods using numerical case studies.</description>

      <title>Learning When to Restart: Nonstationary Newsvendor from Uncensored to Censored Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonstationary newsvendor problems under nonparametric demand models and general distributional measures of nonstationarity, addressing the practical challenges of unknown degree of nonstationarity and demand censoring. We propose a novel distributional-detection-and-restart framework for learning in nonstationary environments, and instantiate it through two efficient algorithms for the uncensored and censored demand settings. The algorithms are fully adaptive, requiring no prior knowledge of the degree and type of nonstationarity, and offer a flexible yet powerful approach to handling both abrupt and gradual changes in nonstationary environments. We establish a comprehensive optimality theory for our algorithms by deriving matching regret upper and lower bounds under both general and refined structural conditions with nontrivial proof techniques that are of independent interest. Numerical experiments using real-world datasets, including nurse staffing data for emergency departments and COVID-19 test demand data, showcase the algorithms' superior and robust empirical performance. While motivated by the newsvendor problem, the distributional-detection-and-restart framework applies broadly to a wide class of nonstationary stochastic optimization problems. Managerially, our framework provides a practical, easy-to-deploy, and theoretically grounded solution for decision-making under nonstationarity.</description>

      <title>Bound tightening in lifted formulations: (sub)solver-dependent impact on performance in RLT-based algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore a relevant aspect of the interplay between two core elements of global optimization algorithms for nonconvex nonlinear programming problems, which we believe has been overlooked by past literature. The first one is the reformulation of the original problem, which requires the introduction of auxiliary variables with the goal of defining convex relaxations that can be solved both reliably and efficiently on a node-by-node basis. The second one, bound tightening or, more generally, domain reduction, allows to reduce the search space to be explored by the branch-and-bound algorithm. We are interested in the performance implications of propagating the bounds of the original variables to the auxiliary ones in the lifted space: does this propagation reduce the overall size of the tree? does it improve the efficiency at solving the node relaxations? To better understand the above interplay, we focus on the reformulation-linearization technique for polynomial optimization. In this setting we are able to obtain a theoretical result on the implicit bounds of the auxiliary variables in the RLT relaxations, which sets the stage for the ensuing computational study, whose goal is to assess to what extent the performance of an RLT-based algorithm may be affected by the decision to explicitly propagate the bounds on the original variables to the auxiliary ones.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Robust Nonlinear MPC via Disturbance Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots must satisfy safety-critical state and input constraints despite disturbances and model mismatch. We introduce a robust model predictive control (RMPC) formulation that is fast, scalable, and compatible with real-time implementation. Our formulation guarantees robust constraint satisfaction, input-to-state stability (ISS) and recursive feasibility. The key idea is to decompose the uncertain nonlinear system into (i) a nominal nonlinear dynamic model, (ii) disturbance-feedback controllers, and (iii) bounds on the model error. These components are optimized jointly using sequential convex programming. The resulting convex subproblems are solved efficiently using a recent disturbance-feedback MPC solver. The approach is validated across multiple dynamics, including a rocket-landing problem with steerable thrust. An open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/antoineleeman/robust-nonlinear-mpc.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to the Data-Driven Output-Based LQR Problem of Continuous-Time Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising method for constructing a data-driven output-feedback control law involves the construction of a model-free observer. The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) optimal control policy can then be obtained by both policy-iteration (PI) and value-iteration (VI) algorithms. However, this method requires some unknown parameterization matrix to be of full row rank and needs to solve a sequence of high dimensional linear equations for either PI or VI algorithm. In this paper, we first show that this matrix is of full row rank under the standard controllability assumption of the plant, thus removing the main hurdle for applying this method. Then we further modify the existing method by defining an ancillary system whose LQR solution will lead to a data-driven output-feedback control law. By this new method, the rank condition of the unknown parameterization matrix is not needed any more. Moreover, we derive a new sequence of linear equations for either PI or VI algorithm whose number of unknown variables is significantly less than that of the existing PI or VI algorithm, thus not only improving the computational efficiency but also relaxing the solvability conditions of the existing PI or VI algorithm. Further, since the existing PI or VI algorithm only applies to the case where some Riccati equation admits a unique positive definite solution, we prove that both the PI algorithm and the VI algorithm in the literature can be generalized to the case where the Riccati equation only admits a unique positive semi-definite solution.</description>

      <title>Entropy Regularization in Mean-Field Games of Optimal Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mean-field games of optimal stopping (OS-MFGs) and introduce an entropy-regularized framework to enable learning-based solution methods. By utilizing randomized stopping times, we reformulate the OS-MFG as a mean-field game of singular stochastic controls (SC-MFG) with entropy regularization. We establish the existence of equilibria and prove their stability as the entropy parameter vanishes. Fictitious play algorithms tailored for the regularized setting are introduced, and we show their convergence under both Lasry-Lions monotonicity and supermodular assumptions on the reward functional. Our work lays the theoretical foundation for model-free learning approaches to OS-MFGs.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Policy Mirror Descent with Temporal Difference Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy mirror descent (PMD) is a general policy optimization framework in reinforcement learning, which can cover a wide range of typical policy optimization methods by specifying different mirror maps. Existing analysis of PMD requires exact or approximate evaluation (for example unbiased estimation via Monte Carlo simulation) of action values solely based on policy. In this paper, we consider policy mirror descent with temporal difference evaluation (TD-PMD). It is shown that, given the access to exact policy evaluations, the dimension-free $O(1/T)$ sublinear convergence still holds for TD-PMD with any constant step size and any initialization. In order to achieve this result, new monotonicity and shift invariance arguments have been developed. The dimension free $\gamma$-rate linear convergence of TD-PMD is also established provided the step size is selected adaptively. For the two common instances of TD-PMD (i.e., TD-PQA and TD-NPG), it is further shown that they enjoy the convergence in the policy domain. Additionally, we investigate TD-PMD in the inexact setting and give the sample complexity for it to achieve the last iterate $\varepsilon$-optimality under a generative model, which improves the last iterate sample complexity for PMD over the dependence on $1/(1-\gamma)$.</description>

      <title>On the Boundary of the Robust Admissible Set in State and Input Constrained Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonlinear control systems subject to bounded disturbances and to both state and input constraints. We introduce the definition of robust admissible set - the set of all initial states from which the state and input constraints can be satisfied for all times against all admissible disturbances. We focus on its boundary that can be decomposed into the usable part on the state constraint boundary and the barrier, interior to the state constraints. We show that, at the intersection of these two components, the boundary of the admissible set must be tangent to the state constraints and separate the interior of the robust admissible set and its complement. Moreover, we prove that the barrier must satisfy a saddle-point principle on a Hamiltonian, in the spirit of Pontryagin's maximum principle, thus providing a direct computational tool. Lastly, we illustrate our results by calculating the robust admissible set for an adaptive cruise control example.</description>

      <title>Solving Sparse MIQCQPs: Application to the Unit Commitment Problem with ACOPF Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs arise in a variety of applications, particularly in energy, water, and gas systems, where discrete decisions interact with nonconvex quadratic constraints. These problems are computationally challenging due to the combination of combinatorial complexity and nonconvexity, often rendering traditional exact methods ineffective for large-scale instances. In this paper, we propose a solution framework for sparse MIQCQPs that integrates semidefinite programming relaxations with chordal decomposition techniques to exploit both term and correlative sparsity. By leveraging problem structure, we significantly reduce the size of the semidefinite constraints into smaller, tractable blocks, improving the scalability of the relaxation and the overall branch-and-bound procedure. We evaluate our framework on the Unit Commitment problem with AC Optimal Power Flow constraints to show that our method produces strong bounds and high-quality solutions on standard IEEE test cases up to 118 buses, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability in solving MIQCQPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a game involves many agents or when communication between agents is not possible, it is useful to resort to distributed learning where each agent acts in complete autonomy without any information on the other agents' situations. Perturbation-based algorithms have already been used for such tasks. We propose some improvements based on practical observations to improve the performance of these algorithms. We show that the introduction of these changes preserves their theoretical convergence properties towards states that maximize the average reward and improve them in the case where optimal states exist. Moreover, we show that these algorithms can be made robust to the addition of randomness to the rewards, achieving similar convergence guarantees. Finally, we discuss the possibility for the perturbation factor of the algorithm to decrease during the learning process, akin to simulated annealing processes.</description>

      <title>Clapping: Removing Per-sample Storage for Pipeline Parallel Distributed Optimization with Communication Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pipeline-parallel distributed optimization is essential for large-scale machine learning but is challenged by significant communication overhead from transmitting high-dimensional activations and gradients between workers. Existing approaches often depend on impractical unbiased gradient assumptions or incur sample-size memory overhead. This paper introduces Clapping, a Communication compression algorithm with LAzy samPling for Pipeline-parallel learnING. Clapping adopts a lazy sampling strategy that reuses data samples across steps, breaking sample-wise memory barrier and supporting convergence in few-epoch or online training regimes. Clapping comprises two variants including Clapping-FC and Clapping-FU, both of which achieve convergence without unbiased gradient assumption, effectively addressing compression error propagation in multi-worker settings. Numerical experiments validate the performance of Clapping across different learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Adaptive Robust Stochastic Optimization Model for the Design of a Photovoltaic Battery Energy Storage System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future energy projections and their inherent uncertainty play a key role in the design of photovoltaic-battery energy storage systems (PV-BESS) for household use. In this study, both stochastic and robust optimization techniques are simultaneously integrated into a Hybrid Adaptive Robust-Stochastic Optimization (HARSO) model. Uncertainty in future PV generation is addressed using a stochastic approach, while uncertainty in power demand is handled through robust optimization. To solve the tri-level structure emerging from the hybrid approach, a Column-and-Constraint Generation (CCG) algorithm is implemented. The model also accounts for battery degradation by considering multiple commercially available battery chemistries, enabling a more realistic evaluation of long-term system costs and performance. To demonstrate its applicability, the model is applied to a case study involving the optimal design of a PV-BESS system for a household in Spain. The empirical analysis includes both first-life (FL) and second-life (SL) batteries with different chemistries, providing a comprehensive evaluation of design alternatives under uncertainty. Results indicate that the optimal solution is highly dependent on the level of robustness considered, leading to a shift in design strategy. Under less conservative settings, robustness is achieved by increasing battery capacity, while higher levels of conservatism favor expanding PV capacity to meet demand.</description>

      <title>A Weighted Gradient Tracking Privacy-Preserving Method for Distributed Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the privacy-preserving distributed optimization problem, aiming to protect agents' private information from potential attackers during the optimization process. Gradient tracking, an advanced technique for improving the convergence rate in distributed optimization, has been applied to most first-order algorithms in recent years. We first reveal the inherent privacy leakage risk associated with gradient tracking. Building upon this insight, we propose a weighted gradient tracking distributed privacy-preserving algorithm, eliminating the privacy leakage risk in gradient tracking using decaying weight factors. Then, we characterize the convergence of the proposed algorithm under time-varying heterogeneous step sizes. We prove the proposed algorithm converges precisely to the optimal solution under mild assumptions. Finally, numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness through a classical distributed estimation problem and the distributed training of a convolutional neural network.</description>

      <title>Tensor Train Completion from Fiberwise Observations Along a Single Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor completion is an extension of matrix completion aimed at recovering a multiway data tensor by leveraging a given subset of its entries (observations) and the pattern of observation. The low-rank assumption is key in establishing a relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The low-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical optimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly (in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization approach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform observations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern exhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient algorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging this structure. This work shows how to use only standard linear algebra operations to compute the tensor train decomposition of a specific type of ``fiber-wise" observed tensor, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a single specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the usual entry-wise observations. From an application viewpoint, this setting is relevant when it is easier to sample or collect a multiway data tensor along a specific mode (e.g., temporal). The proposed completion method is fast and is guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. Through numerical experiments, we showcase interesting applications and use cases that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Introducing a novel Location-Assignment Algorithm for Activity-Based Transport Models: CARLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces CARLA (spatially Constrained Anchor-based Recursive Location Assignment), a recursive algorithm for assigning secondary or any activity locations in activity-based travel models. CARLA minimizes distance deviations while integrating location potentials, ensuring more realistic activity distributions. The algorithm decomposes trip chains into smaller subsegments, using geometric constraints and configurable heuristics to efficiently search the solution space. Compared to a state-of-the-art relaxation-discretization approach, CARLA achieves significantly lower mean deviations, even under limited runtimes. It is robust to real-world data inconsistencies, such as infeasible distances, and can flexibly adapt to various priorities, such as emphasizing location attractiveness or distance accuracy. CARLA's versatility and efficiency make it a valuable tool for improving the spatial accuracy of activity-based travel models and agent-based transport simulations. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/tnoud/carla.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagonal linear networks are neural networks with linear activation and diagonal weight matrices. Their theoretical interest is that their implicit regularization can be rigorously analyzed: from a small initialization, the training of diagonal linear networks converges to the linear predictor with minimal 1-norm among minimizers of the training loss. In this paper, we deepen this analysis showing that the full training trajectory of diagonal linear networks is closely related to the lasso regularization path. In this connection, the training time plays the role of an inverse regularization parameter. Both rigorous results and simulations are provided to illustrate this conclusion. Under a monotonicity assumption on the lasso regularization path, the connection is exact while in the general case, we show an approximate connection.</description>

Abstract: A detailed analysis of the diffusive Stochastic Master Equation (SME) for qubit/cavity systems with dispersive coupling is provided. This analysis incorporates classical input signals and output signals (measurement outcomes through homodyne detection). The dynamics of the qubit/cavity density operator is shown to converge exponentially towards a slow invariant manifold, parameterized via a time-varying deterministic Kraus map by the density operator of a fictitious qubit. This fictitious qubit is governed by a SME incorporating the classical input/output signals. Extension where the qubit is replaced by any qudit dispersively coupled to an arbitrary set of modes with collective input/output classical signals.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes central limit theorems for Polyak-Ruppert averaged Q-learning under asynchronous updates. We present a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, where the convergence rate in Wasserstein distance explicitly reflects the dependence on the number of iterations, state-action space size, the discount factor, and the quality of exploration. In addition, we derive a functional central limit theorem, showing that the partial-sum process converges weakly to a Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>A Weighted Least Squares Error Hetero-functional Graph State Estimator of the American Multi-modal Energy System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, global climate change demands a host of changes across at least four critical energy infrastructures: the electric grid, the natural gas system, the oil system, and the coal system. In the context of the United States, this paper refers to this system-of-systems as ``The American Multi-Modal Energy System (AMES)". These combined changes necessitate an understanding of the AMES interdependencies, both structurally and behaviorally, to develop and enact effective policies. This work focuses on behavioral analysis methods to provide examples of how to analyze system behavior and the critical matter and energy flows through the system. Building upon past works, two regions of the AMES are modeled, and their behavior is analyzed using Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT). More specifically, the work presents a weighted least square error state estimation model of the AMES. State estimation has played a major role in the operation and development of the American Electric Power System. This work extends the state estimation analysis beyond the single-operand electric grid environment into the heterogeneous environment of the AMES. Employing a data-driven and model-based systems engineering approach in combination with HFGT, a Weighted Least Squares Error Hetero-functional Graph State Estimation (WLSEHFGSE) optimization program is developed to estimate the optimal flows of mass and energy through the AMES. This work is the first to integrate state estimation methods with HFGT. Furthermore, it demonstrates how such a WLSEHFGSE recovers the mass and energy flows in a system-of-systems like the AMES with asset-level granularity.</description>

      <title>A failure mode dependent continuum damage model for laminated composites with optimized model parameters : Application to curved beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, a failure mode dependent and thermodynamically consistent continuum damage model with polynomial-based damage hardening functions is proposed for continuum damage modeling of laminated composite panels. The damage model parameters are characterized based on all uniaxial/shear experimental stress-strain curves. Steepest descent optimization algorithm is used to minimize the difference between model predicted and experimental stress-strain curves to get the optimzed model parameters. The fully characterized damage evolution equations are used for damage prediction of a moderately thick laminated composite curved beam modeled using first-order shear deformation theory. Finite element method with load control is used to get the non-linear algebraic equations which are solved using Newton Raphson method. The developed model is compared with the existing failure mode dependent and failure mode independent damage models. The results depict the efficacy of the proposed model to capture non-linearity in the load vs deflection curve due to stiffness degradation and different damage in tension andcompression consistent with uniaxial/shear stress-strain response and strength properties of the material, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the performance of policy gradient in multitask linear quadratic regulation (LQR), where the system and cost parameters differ across tasks. The main goal of multitask LQR is to find a controller with satisfactory performance on every task. Prior analyses on relevant contexts fail to capture closed-loop task similarities, resulting in conservative performance guarantees. To account for such similarities, we propose bisimulation-based measures of task heterogeneity. Our measures employ new bisimulation functions to bound the cost gradient distance between a pair of tasks in closed loop with a common stabilizing controller. Employing these measures, we derive suboptimality bounds for both the multitask optimal controller and the asymptotic policy gradient controller with respect to each of the tasks. We further provide conditions under which the policy gradient iterates remain stabilizing for every system. For multiple random sets of certain tasks, we observe that our bisimulation-based measures improve upon baseline measures of task heterogeneity dramatically.</description>

      <title>DRAG: Distributed Resource Allocation Games over Multiple Interacting Coalitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite many distributed resource allocation (DRA) algorithms have been reported in literature, it is still unknown how to allocate the resource optimally over multiple interacting coalitions. One major challenge in solving such a problem is that, the relevance of the decision on resource allocation in a coalition to the benefit of others may lead to conflicts of interest among these coalitions. Under this context, a new type of multi-coalition game is formulated in this paper, termed as resource allocation game, where each coalition contains multiple agents that cooperate to maximize the coalition-level benefit while subject to the resource constraint described by a coupled equality. Inspired by techniques such as variable replacement, gradient tracking and leader-following consensus, two new kinds of DRA algorithms are developed respectively for the scenarios where the individual benefit of each agent explicitly depends on the states of itself and some agents in other coalitions, and on the states of all the game participants. It is shown that the proposed algorithms can converge linearly to the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the multi-coalition game while satisfying the resource constraint during the whole NE-seeking process. Finally, the validity of the present allocation algorithms is verified by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Contributions on complexity bounds for Deterministic Partially Observed Markov Decision Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (Mdps) form a versatile framework used to model a wide range of optimization problems. The Mdp model consists of sets of states, actions, time steps, rewards, and probability transitions. When in a given state and at a given time, the decision maker's action generates a reward and determines the state at the next time step according to the probability transition function. However, Mdps assume that the decision maker knows the state of the controlled dynamical system. Hence, when one needs to optimize controlled dynamical systems under partial observation, one often turns toward the formalism of Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (Pomdp). Pomdps are often untractable in the general case as Dynamic Programming suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Instead of focusing on the general Pomdps, we present a subclass where transitions and observations mappings are deterministic: Deterministic Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (Det-Pomdp). That subclass of problems has been studied by (Littman, 1996) and (Bonet, 2009). It was first considered as a limit case of Pomdps by Littman, mainly used to illustrate the complexity of Pomdps when considering as few sources of uncertainties as possible. In this paper, we improve on Littman's complexity bounds. We then introduce and study an even simpler class: Separated Det-Pomdps and give some new complexity bounds for this class. This new class of problems uses a property of the dynamics and observation to push back the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Expected Optimal Distances of Random Bipartite Matching in $D$-dimensional Spaces: Approximate Formulas and Applications to Mobility Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although many well-known algorithms can solve each bipartite matching problem instance efficiently, it remains an open question how one could estimate the expected optimal matching distance for arbitrary numbers of randomly distributed vertices in $D$-dimensional spaces (referred to as a random bipartite matching problem, or RBMP). This paper proposes a comprehensive modeling framework that yields closed-form approximate formulas for estimating the expected optimal matching cost across three interrelated but increasingly complex versions of RBMPs: (i) RBMP-I, where edge costs are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.); (ii) RBMP-S, where edge costs represent distances between vertices uniformly distributed on the surface of a hyper-sphere in a $D$-dimensional Euclidean space; and (iii) RBMP-B, where the vertices are uniformly distributed in a hyper-ball within a $D$-dimensional L$^p$ metric space. A series of Monte-Carlo simulation experiments are conducted to verify the accuracy of the proposed formulas under varying parameter combinations. These proposed distance estimates could be key for strategic performance evaluation and resource planning in a wide variety of application contexts. As an illustration, we focus on on-demand mobility services (e.g., e-hailing taxi system). We show how the proposed distance formulas provide a theoretical foundation for the empirically assumed Cobb-Douglas matching function in the field, and reveal conditions under which it can work well. Our formulas can also be easily incorporated into optimization models to select on-demand mobility operation strategies (e.g., whether newly arriving customers shall be instantly matched or pooled into a batch for matching). Agent-based simulations are conducted to verify the predicted performance of the demand pooling strategy for two types of e-hailing taxi systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an inertial variant of the strongly convergent inexact proximal-point (PP) method of Solodov and Svaiter (2000) for monotone inclusions. We prove strong convergence of our main algorithm under less restrictive assumptions on the inertial parameters when compared to previous analysis of inertial PP-type algorithms, which makes our method of interest even in finite-dimensional settings. We also performed an iteration-complexity analysis and applied our main algorithm to variational inequalities for monotone operators, obtaining strongly convergent (inertial) variants of Korpolevich's extragradient, forward-backward and Tseng's modified forward-backward methods. Preliminary numerical experiments indicate that our strongly convergent variant of Tseng's modified forward-backward method performs well on certain matrix game problems.</description>

      <title>On Min-Max Robust Data-Driven Predictive Control Considering Non-Unique Solutions to Behavioral Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct data-driven control methods are known to be vulnerable to uncertainty in stochastic systems. In this paper, we propose a new robust data-driven predictive control (DDPC) framework to tackle the uncertainty in dynamic systems. By analyzing non-unique solutions to behavioral representation, we first shed light on the lack of robustness in subspace predictive control (SPC) as well as the projection-based regularized DDPC. This inspires us to construct an uncertainty set that includes admissible output trajectories deviating to some extent from nominal predictions from the subspace predictor and develop a min-max robust formulation of DDPC that endows control sequences with robustness against such unknown deviations. We establish its performance guarantees under bounded additive noise and develop convex reformulations of the min-max problem. To mitigate the conservatism of robust design, a feedback robust DDPC scheme is further proposed by incorporating an affine feedback policy, with performance guarantees and tractable reformulations derived. Simulation studies show that the proposed method effectively robustifies SPC and outperforms projection-based regularizer.</description>

Abstract: This study focuses on optimizing species release $S_2$ to control species population $S_1$ through impulsive release strategies. We investigate the conditions required to remove species $S_1$, which is equivalent to the establishment of $S_2$. The research includes a theoretical analysis that examines the positivity, existence, and uniqueness of solutions, the conditions ensuring global stability, and a sufficient condition for controlling the $S_1$-free solution. In addition, we formulate an optimal control problem to maximize the effectiveness of $S_2$ releases, manage the population of $S_1$, and minimize the costs associated with this intervention strategy. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the proposed theories and allow visualization of population dynamics under various release scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimization foundations of deep linear networks have recently received significant attention. However, due to their inherent non-convexity and hierarchical structure, analyzing the loss functions of deep linear networks remains a challenging task. In this work, we study the local geometric landscape of the regularized squared loss of deep linear networks around each critical point. Specifically, we derive a closed-form characterization of the critical point set and establish an error bound for the regularized loss under mild conditions on network width and regularization parameters. Notably, this error bound quantifies the distance from a point to the critical point set in terms of the current gradient norm, which can be used to derive linear convergence of first-order methods. To support our theoretical findings, we conduct numerical experiments and demonstrate that gradient descent converges linearly to a critical point when optimizing the regularized loss of deep linear networks.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-like Stability Inequality with an Asymmetric Matrix and Application to Suboptimal LQ Control Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11556v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lyapunov inequality is an indispensable tool for stability analysis in linear control theory. It provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of an autonomous linear-time invariant system in terms of the existence of a symmetric positive-definite Lyapunov matrix. This work proposes a new variant of this inequality in which the constituent Lyapunov matrix is allowed to be asymmetric. After analysing the properties of the proposed inequality for a class of matrices, we derive new results for the stabilisation of linear systems. Subsequently, we utilize the developed results to obtain sufficient conditions for the suboptimal linear quadratic control design problem, where addition to having an asymmetric Lyapunov matrix, which serves as a design matrix for this problem, we provide a characterization of the cost associated with the computed stabilizing suboptimal control laws by deriving an expression for the upper bound on cost in terms of the initial conditions of the system. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed results using two numerical examples- one for suboptimal control design for a linear time-invariant system and another for the consensus (state-agreement) protocol design for a multi-agent system where-in we see how the asymmetry of the design matrix emerges as an inherent requirement for the problem.</description>

      <title>On exactness of SDP relaxation for the maximum cut problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05200v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) provides a powerful relaxation of the maximum cut problem. For a graph $\mathcal{G}$ with rational weights, the decision problem of whether this relaxation is exact is known to be $NP$-complete since Delorme-Poljak (1993), but its complexity was unresolved for unweighted graphs. In this work, we extend the $NP$-completeness result for unweighted graphs. We then investigate and present a few classes of graphs, which we call exact graphs, for which the semidefinite relaxation of the maximum cut problem is exact. For each exact graph class, we determine the optimal objective value by explicitly constructing a maximum cut and then prove uniqueness of the exact solution for two of these classes. We complement these findings by showing that lexicographic products preserve exactness whenever the first factor is exact, with rank-$r$ solutions extending accordingly, and that a graph is exact if and only if when all of its splits are exact, with splitting also preserving the rank of optimal solutions. Addressing two open problems posed by Mirka and Williamson (2024), we demonstrate via counterexamples that exact semidefinite relaxations can admit higher-rank optimal solutions beyond the convex hull of rank-1 reference solutions. We then explain this phenomenon by proving the existence of rank-$(n-1)$ optimal solutions for particular classes of graphs. Finally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions under which the corresponding solution to exact relaxation is unique for particular classes of complete graphs and complete $k$-partite graphs.</description>

      <title>On the Linear Speedup of the Push-Pull Method for Decentralized Optimization over Digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear speedup property is essential for demonstrating the advantage of distributed algorithms over their single-node counterparts. In this paper, we study the stochastic Push-Pull method, a widely adopted decentralized optimization algorithm over directed graphs (digraphs). Unlike methods that rely solely on row-stochastic or column-stochastic mixing matrices, Push-Pull avoids nonlinear correction and has shown superior empirical performance across a variety of settings. However, its theoretical analysis remains challenging, and the linear speedup property has not been generally establishe--revealing a significant gap between empirical success and limited theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel analysis framework and prove that Push-Pull achieves linear speedup over arbitrary strongly connected digraphs. Our results provide the comprehensive theoretical understanding for stochastic Push-Pull, aligning its theory with empirical performance. Code: https://github.com/pkumelon/PushPull.</description>

Abstract: We introduce cuPDLPx, a further enhanced GPU-based first-order solver for linear programming. Building on the recently developed restarted Halpern PDHG for LP, cuPDLPx incorporates a number of new techniques, including a new restart criterion and a PID-controlled primal weight update. These improvements are carefully tailored for GPU architectures and deliver substantial computational gains. Across benchmark datasets, cuPDLPx achieves 2.5x-5x speedups on MIPLIB LP relaxations and 3x-6.8x on Mittelmann's benchmark set, with particularly strong improvements in high-accuracy and presolve-enabled settings. The solver is publicly available at https://github.com/MIT-Lu-Lab/cuPDLPx.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a zeroth-order particle algorithm for the global optimization of a non-convex function, focusing on a variant of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) with small but fixed noise intensity. Unlike most previous studies restricted to finite horizons, we investigate its long-time behavior with fixed parameters. In the mean-field limit, a quantitative Laplace principle shows exponential convergence to a neighborhood of the minimizer x * . For finitely many particles, a block-wise analysis yields explicit error bounds: individual particles achieve long-time consistency near x * , and the global best particle converge to x * . The proof technique combines a quantitative Laplace principle with block-wise control of Wasserstein distances, avoiding the exponential blow-up typical of Gr{\"o}nwall-based estimates.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotone Trust-Region Methods for Optimization of Set-Valued Mapping of Finite Cardinality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-monotone trust-region methods are known to provide additional benefits for scalar and multi-objective optimization, such as enhancing the probability of convergence and improving the speed of convergence. For optimization of set-valued maps, non-monotone trust-region methods have not yet been explored and investigated to see if they show similar benefits. Thus, in this article, we propose two non-monotone trust-region schemes--max-type and average-type for set-valued optimization. Using these methods, the aim is to find \emph{K}-critical points for a non-convex unconstrained set optimization problem through vectorization and oriented-distance scalarization. The main modification in the existing trust region method for set optimization occurs in reduction ratios, where max-type uses the maximum over function values from the last few iterations, and avg-type uses an exponentially weighted moving average of successive previous function values till the current iteration. Under appropriate assumptions, we show the global convergence of the proposed methods. To verify their effectiveness, we numerically compare their performance with the existing trust region method, steepest descent method, and conjugate gradient method using performance profile in terms of three metrics: number of non-convergence, number of iterations, and computation time.</description>

Abstract: When applying nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), the rank parameter is generally unknown. This rank, called the nonnegative rank, is usually estimated heuristically since computing its exact value is NP-hard. In this work, we propose an approximation method to estimate the rank on-the-fly while solving NMF. We use the sum-of-norm (SON), a group-lasso structure that encourages pairwise sim- ilarity, to reduce the rank of a factor matrix when the initial rank is overestimated. On various datasets, SON-NMF can reveal the correct nonnegative rank of the data without prior knowledge or parameter tuning. SON-NMF is a nonconvex, nonsmooth, non-separable, and non-proximable problem, making it nontrivial to solve. First, since rank estimation in NMF is NP-hard, the proposed approach does not benefit from lower computational com- plexity. Using a graph-theoretic argument, we prove that the complexity of SON- NMF is essentially irreducible. Second, the per-iteration cost of algorithms for SON-NMF can be high. This motivates us to propose a first-order BCD algorithm that approximately solves SON-NMF with low per-iteration cost via the proximal average operator. SON-NMF exhibits favorable features for applications. Besides the ability to automatically estimate the rank from data, SON-NMF can handle rank-deficient data matrices and detect weak components with small energy. Furthermore, in hyperspectral imaging, SON-NMF naturally addresses the issue of spectral variability.</description>

      <title>Operator Splitting Covariance Steering for Safe Stochastic Nonlinear Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm for solving distribution steering problems featuring nonlinear dynamics and chance constraints. Covariance steering (CS) is an emerging methodology in stochastic optimal control that poses constraints on the first two moments of the state distribution -- thereby being more tractable than full distributional control. Nevertheless, a significant limitation of current approaches for solving nonlinear CS problems, such as sequential convex programming (SCP), is that they often generate infeasible or poor results due to the large number of constraints. In this paper, we address these challenges, by proposing an operator splitting CS approach that temporarily decouples the full problem into subproblems that can be solved in parallel. This relaxation does not require intermediate iterates to satisfy all constraints simultaneously prior to convergence, which enhances exploration and improves feasibility in such non-convex settings. Simulation results across a variety of robotics applications verify the ability of the proposed method to find better solutions even under stricter safety constraints than standard SCP. Finally, the applicability of our framework on real systems is also confirmed through hardware demonstrations</description>

      <title>Representative Action Selection for Large Action Space Meta-Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a subset from a large action space shared by a family of bandits, with the goal of achieving performance nearly matching that of using the full action space. We assume that similar actions tend to have related payoffs, modeled by a Gaussian process. To exploit this structure, we propose a simple epsilon-net algorithm to select a representative subset. We provide theoretical guarantees for its performance and compare it empirically to Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound.</description>

      <title>A generalized global Hartman-Grobman theorem for asymptotically stable semiflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21401v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kvalheim and Sontag provided a generalized global Hartman-Grobman theorem for equilibria under asymptotically stable continuous vector fields. By leveraging topological properties of Lyapunov functions, their theorem works without assuming hyperbolicity. We extend their theorem to a class of possibly discontinuous vector fields, in particular, to vector fields generating asymptotically stable semiflows.</description>

      <title>Impossibility Results of Card-Based Protocols via Mathematical Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces mathematical optimization as a new method for proving impossibility results in the field of card-based cryptography. While previous impossibility proofs were often limited to cases involving a small number of cards, this new approach establishes results that hold for a large number of cards. The research focuses on single-cut full-open (SCFO) protocols, which consist of performing one random cut and then revealing all cards. The main contribution is that for any three-variable Boolean function, no new SCFO protocols exist beyond those already known, under the condition that all additional cards have the same color. The significance of this work is that it provides a new framework for proving impossibility results and delivers a proof that is valid for any number of cards, as long as all additional cards have the same color.</description>
