      <title>Small-Mass Asymptotics of Massive Point Vortex Dynamics in Bose--Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an asymptotic analysis of the massive point vortex dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensates in the small-mass limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We show that the orthogonal projection of the massive dynamics to a certain subspace $\mathcal{K}$ (called kinematic subspace) in the phase space yields the standard massless vortex dynamics or the Kirchhoff equations. We show that the massless dynamics is the zeroth-order approximation to the massive equation as $\varepsilon \to 0$, and also derive a first-order correction to the zeroth-order massless dynamics. The massive dynamics near $\mathcal{K}$ is well approximated by the corresponding massless dynamics. In fact, our main result proves that the massive dynamics starting in $\mathcal{K}$ stays $O(\varepsilon)$-close to $\mathcal{K}$ for short time. On the other hand, the massive dynamics starting outside $\mathcal{K}$ exhibits an oscillatory initial layer due to its inertia and deviates significantly from the massless dynamics. We also perform an asymptotic analysis with a rescaled time to derive the inner approximation to capture the initial layer. The 0th-order inner equations are exactly solvable, and the 1st-order inner equations can be solved by quadrature. The combined inner approximation captures the initial oscillatory layer of the massive dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of distinct exact mobility edges in a quasiperiodic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility edges (MEs) constitute the energies separating the localized states from the extended ones in disordered systems. Going beyond this conventional definition, recent proposal suggests for an ME which separates the localized and multifractal states in certain quasiperiodic systems - dubbed as the anomalous mobility edges (AMEs). In this study, we propose an exactly solvable quasiperiodic system that hosts both the conventional and anomalous mobility edges under proper conditions. We show that with increase in quasiperiodic disorder strength, the system first undergoes a delocalization to localization transition through an ME of conventional type. Surprisingly, with further increase in disorder, we obtain that a major fraction of the localized states at the middle of the spectrum turn multifractal in nature. Such unconventional behavior in the spectrum results in two AMEs, which continue to exist even for stronger quasiperiodic disorder. We numerically obtain the signatures of the coexisting MEs complement it through analytical derivation using Avila's global theory. In the end we provide important signatures from the wavepacket dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: U(1) non-linear sigma models (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase are studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations with finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.</description>

      <title>Entanglement cones and horizons in analogue cosmological production of Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although gravitational particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of gravitational particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of gravitational particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of fermion condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics. We use the entanglement contour as a tool to analyze the spatio-temporal causal structure of particle production, showing how it can account for the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifest through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement in this analogue cQFT.</description>

      <title>Finite-size effects in two-photon correlations of exciton Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accessing two-photon statistics via Hunbary Brown and Twiss (HBT)-type measurements is essential for investigations of excitonic Bose-condensates. In this paper we make use of quantum hydrodynamics in order to study the finite-size impact on the two-photon emission intensity of a 2D condensate of excitons. We use the developed approach to calculate the two-photon decay time of exciton condensate in GaAs quantum wells and MoS$_2$ bilayers. We demonstrate that the registered signal scales on the sample size in a qualitatively different manner than the Bogoliubov theory predicts.</description>

      <title>Spectral Signatures of Vibronic Coupling in Trapped Cold Ionic Rydberg Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atoms and ions confined with electric and optical fields form the basis of many current quantum simulation and computing platforms. When excited to high-lying Rydberg states, long-ranged dipole interactions emerge which strongly couple the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom through state-dependent forces. This vibronic coupling and the ensuing hybridization of internal and external degrees of freedom manifest through clear signatures in the many-body spectrum. We illustrate this by considering the case of two trapped Rydberg ions, for which the interaction between the relative vibrations and Rydberg states realizes a quantum Rabi model. We proceed to demonstrate that the aforementioned hybridization can be probed by radio frequency spectroscopy and discuss observable spectral signatures at finite temperatures and for larger ion crystals.</description>
