      <title>Noise resilience of deterministic analog combinatorial optimization solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several continuous dynamical systems have recently been proposed as special-purpose analog computers designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as $k$-SAT or the Ising problem. While combinatorial optimization problems are known to be NP-hard, and thus scale, in the worst case, exponentially with the problem size, these analog solvers promise substantial speed-up and scaling advantages in finding the solution. The underlying algorithms, which can be cast in the form of differential equations, generically involve highly chaotic dynamics and thus assume that the system variables can be processed with, in principle, arbitrary precision. However, both actual physical systems as well as finite digital machines, which are used to virtually emulate the dynamics, can process the evolution only with finite precision, be it because of intrinsic noise or because of limited precision in number representation. We investigate the impact of such noise on the solution-finding capability. To this end, we focus on two representative analog solvers, designed to address the Ising problem and the $k$-SAT problem, respectively. Our numerical analysis reveals that the ability of these algorithms to find solutions exhibits a threshold behavior under the addition of noise, where the solution-finding capability remains mostly uncompromised below a noise threshold, while it rapidly deteriorates above the threshold. As we show, these noise tolerance thresholds decrease with the problem size, following an approximate algebraic scaling. This allows us to infer principal limits on the problem sizes that can be efficiently tackled with these solvers under given noise levels.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition and Diffusion in an Adiabatic Bouncer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines anomalous diffusion and dynamical phase transitions in a nonlinear bouncer model with short-range interactions leading to velocity-dependent (adiabatic) collisions. By varying a control parameter, transitions between superdiffusion, normal diffusion, subdiffusion, and complete dynamical freezing are observed. The phase behavior is characterized via scaling laws and critical exponents, providing a robust framework for understanding the underlying dynamics.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Coexistence Regions in the GRHT Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRHT map refers to a planar map which showcases the coexistence of infinitely many stable periodic orbits via the phenomenon of Globally Resonant Homoclinic Tangencies. This paper investigates the geometric properties of coexistence regions in the case of codimension-three scenario. We introduce parameters into the non-invertible GRHT map to understand the unfolding behavior of the GRHT. Near the infinite coexistence regions, there exists series of codimension-one saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcations. The most common overlapping region in the parameter space reveals the parameters with which there can be coexisting periodic orbits. Various slices of parameter space are considered to understand the coexistence regions in two-dimensional parameter space. We show that the parameter region of coexistence are polygons and are convex sets. We develop an algorithm that detects the number of vertices of the most common overlapping regions via optimization techniques. We study the variation of the number of vertices and area of the most common overlapping region with the variation in parameters of the map. It illustrates that when the number of coexisting stable periodic orbits increase, the area of the most common overlapping region decreases. Moreover the number of vertices of the most common overlapping region increases as the number of coexisting stable periodic orbits increases. We also explore the variation of the area and the number of vertices of the most common overlapping region with the simultaneous variation of two parameters of the GRHT map. It reveals that the variation in the number of vertices of the most common overlapping region is not trivial and varies in a highly nonlinear fashion illustrating the geometric complexity of the coexisting regions of stable periodic orbits in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Bio-inspired learning algorithm for time series using Loewner equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though the relationship between the theoretical statistical physics and machine learning techniques has been a well-discussed topic, the studies on the mechanism of learning inspired by the biological system are still developing. In this study, we investigate the application methods of Loewner equation to the learning algorithm particularly focusing on its statistical-mechanical aspects. We suggest two simple methods of learning of one-dimensional time series based on the unique encoding property of the discrete Loewner evolution. The first one is the Gaussian process (GP) regression using the normality of the distribution of Loewner driving force corresponding to the curve composed from the time series. The second one is the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) for the time series, which is derived from the Loewner theory, measuring the sensitivity of the nonlinear dynamics under the small perturbation. These methods were numerically tested dealing with the neuronal dynamics generated by the leaky integrate-and-fire model. In addition, we discuss the similarity between the mapping mechanism of the present method and the structure of biological information processing from a point of view of self-organization system theory.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely studied, revealing several types of chimeras. Most cases involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction, modeled via networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the non-reciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the one resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>

      <title>Quantized local reduced-order modeling in time (ql-ROM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporally chaotic systems, such as the solutions of some nonlinear partial differential equations, are dynamical systems that evolve toward a lower dimensional manifold. This manifold has an intricate geometry with heterogeneous density, which makes the design of a single (global) nonlinear reduced-order model (ROM) challenging. In this paper, we turn this around. Instead of modeling the manifold with one single model, we partition the manifold into clusters within which the dynamics are locally modeled. This results in a quantized local reduced-order model (ql-ROM), which consists of (i) quantizing the manifold via unsupervised clustering; (ii) constructing intrusive ROMs for each cluster; and (iii) seamlessly patch the local models with a change of basis and assignment functions. We test the method on two nonlinear partial differential equations, i.e., the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and 2D Navier-Stokes equations (Kolmogorov flow), across bursting, chaotic, quasiperiodic, and turbulent regimes. The local models are built via Galerkin projection onto the local principal directions, which are centered on the cluster centroids. The dynamics are modeled by switching a local ROM based on the cluster proximity. The proposed ql-ROM framework has three advantages over global ROMs (g-ROMs): (i) numerical stability, (ii) improved short-term prediction accuracy in time, and (iii) accurate prediction of long-term statistics, such as energy spectra and probability distributions. The computational overhead is minimal with respect to g-ROMs. The proposed framework retains the interpretability and simplicity of intrusive projection-based ROMs, whilst overcoming their limitations in modeling complex, high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking Nonlinear Regulator with Concurrent Uncertainties in Exosystems and Control Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07106v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a non-adaptive control solution framework to the practical output regulation problem (PORP) for a class of nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters, unknown control directions and uncertain exosystem dynamics. The concurrence of the unknown control directions and uncertainties in both the system dynamics and the exosystem pose a significant challenge to the problem. In light of a nonlinear internal model approach, we first convert the robust PORP into a robust non-adaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral Input-to-State Stable (iISS) inverse dynamics. By employing an extremum-seeking control (ESC) approach, the construction of our solution method avoids the use of Nussbaum-type gain techniques to address the robust PORP subject to unknown control directions with time-varying coefficients. The stability of the non-adaptive output regulation design is proven via a Lie bracket averaging technique where uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed. As a result, both the estimation and tracking errors converge to zero exponentially, provided that the frequency of the dither signal goes to infinity. Finally, a simulation example with unknown coefficients is provided to exemplify the validity of the proposed control solution frameworks.</description>
