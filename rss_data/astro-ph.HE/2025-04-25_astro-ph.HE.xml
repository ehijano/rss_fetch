      <title>GRMHD simulations of variabilities in X-ray binaries as transitions in magnetic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using high-resolution general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we investigate accretion flows around spinning black holes and identify three distinct accretion states. Our results naturally explain some of the complex phenomenology observed across the black hole mass spectrum. The magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state, characterized by strong magnetic fields (plasma-$\beta &lt;&lt; 1$), exhibits powerful jets (of power $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$), highly variable accretion, and significant sub-Keplerian motion. On the other hand, weakly magnetized disks (plasma-$\beta &gt;&gt; 1$), known as the standard and normal evolution (SANE) state, show steady accretion with primarily thermal winds. An intermediate state bridges the gap between MAD and SANE regimes, with moderate magnetic support (plasma-$\beta \sim 1$) producing mixed outflow morphologies and complex variability. This unified framework explains the extreme variability of GRS 1915+105, the steady jets of Cyg X-1, and the unusually high luminosities (even super-Eddington based on stellar mass black hole) of HLX-1 without requiring super-Eddington mass accretion rates. Our simulations reveal a hierarchy of timescales that explain the rich variety of variability patterns, with magnetic processes driving transitions between states. Comparing two with three dimensional simulations demonstrates that while quantitative details differ, the qualitative features distinguishing different accretion states remain robust. The outflow power and variability follow a fundamental scaling relation with mass determined by the magnetic field configuration, demonstrating how similar accretion physics operates from stellar-mass X-ray binaries (XRBs) to intermediate mass black hole sources. This could be extrapolated further to supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>The First Photometric Evidence of a Transient/Variable Source at z&gt;5 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered 79 transients out to $z$$\sim$4.8 through the JADES Transient Survey (JTS), but the JTS did not find any $z$$&gt;$5 transients. Here, we present the first photometric evidence of a $z$$&gt;$5 transient/variable source with JWST. The source, AT 2023adya, resides in a $z_{\mathrm{spec}}$$=$5.274 galaxy in GOODS-N, which dimmed from $m_{\rm F356W}$$=$26.05$\pm$0.02 mag to 26.24$\pm$0.02 mag in the rest-frame optical over approximately two rest-frame months, producing a clear residual signal in the difference image ($m_{\rm F356W}$$=$28.01$\pm$0.17 mag; SN$_\mathrm{var}$$=$6.09) at the galaxy center. Shorter-wavelength bands (F090W/F115W) show no rest-frame ultraviolet brightness change. Based on its rest-frame V-band absolute magnitude of M$_\mathrm{V}$$=$$-$18.48 mag, AT 2023adya could be any core-collapse supernova (SN) subtype or an SN Ia. However, due to low SN Ia rates at high redshift, the SN Ia scenario is unlikely. Alternatively, AT 2023adya may be a variable active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, the JWST NIRCam/Grism spectrum shows no broad H$\alpha$ emission line (FWHM$=$130$\pm$26 km s$^{-1}$), disfavoring the variable AGN scenario. It is also unlikely that AT 2023adya is a tidal disruption event (TDE) because the TDE models matching the observed brightness changes have low event rates. Although it is not possible to determine AT 2023adya's nature based on the two-epoch single-band photometry alone, this discovery indicates that JWST can push the frontier of transient/variable science past $z$$=$5 and towards the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <title>Black hole-accretion disk collision in general relativity: Axisymmetric simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent discoveries of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions, we revisit the collision of a black hole and an accretion disk. Assuming that they are orbiting a supermassive black hole in orthogonal orbits, we perform a general relativistic simulation of the collision, varying the relative velocity $V_0$ from $0.032c$ to $0.2c$ (where $c$ is the speed of light) with a variety of disk thickness and a realistic local density profile for the disk. Our findings indicate that the mass of the outflow matter from the disk, $m_{\rm ej}$, is slightly less than the expected value. Meanwhile, the typical energy associated with this outflow $E_{\rm ej}$ is $\sim m_{\rm ej}V_0^2$. Thus, the predicted peak luminosity from disk flares is approximately equal to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole, whereas the peak time and duration of the flares, which are $\propto m_{\rm ej}^{1/2}$, are shorter than that previously believed. We also demonstrate that the property of the outflow matter induced by the incoming and outgoing stages of the black hole collision is appreciably different. We find that a high mass accretion rate onto the black hole from the disk persists for a timescale of $\sim 10^6$ Schwarzschild time of the black hole after the collision for $V_0/c \lesssim 0.1$, making this long-term accretion onto the black hole the dominant emission process for black hole-disk collision events. Implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Hunting Star-Forming Galaxies in the Gamma-Ray Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Star-forming galaxies emit {\gamma}rays with relatively low luminosity, but the study of their emission is no less captivating. While it is known that their {\gamma}-ray luminosity in the GeV band is strongly linked to their star formation, the origin of their emission at higher energies remains uncertain due to limited observations. Aims. Our aim is to assemble the largest possible sample of star-forming galaxies with potential detectability by the new-generation of Cherenkov telescopes. Methods. To achieve this, we compile a comprehensive sample of galaxies, including those previously detected by Fermi-LAT in the GeV energy range as well as a larger sample of star-forming galaxies in the Local Volume that have been cataloged in the near-infrared band. We estimate their {\gamma}-ray flux assuming a proportional relationship with their star formation rate, and then select the brightest candidates. The predicted spectra in the TeV band are derived using a simple empirical model normalized to the star formation rate and a model based on extrapolating the latest Fermi-LAT data to higher energies. The ground-based detectability of {\gamma}-ray emission from these sources is assessed through a comparison to the most recent instrument response functions. Results. Our investigation reveals that almost a dozen star-forming galaxies may be detectable by upcoming {\gamma}-ray telescopes. Conclusions. The observation of numerous star-forming galaxies in the TeV band is a fundamental piece of the panchromatic puzzle for understanding the physics inside these galaxies. The significant increase in the number of galaxies that can be studied in detail in the near future, particularly with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, promises a major step forward in the study of the conditions of acceleration and transport of cosmic rays in nearby extragalactic environments.</description>

      <title>An extremely soft and weak fast X-ray transient associated with a luminous supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), including their subclasses of low-luminosity GRBs (LL-GRBs) and X-ray flashes (XRFs) characterized by low spectral peak energies, are known to be associated with broad-lined Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL), which result from the core collapse of massive stars that lose their outer hydrogen and helium envelopes. However, the soft and weak end of the GRB/XRF population remains largely unexplored, due to the limited sensitivity to soft X-ray emission. Here we report the discovery of a fast X-ray transient, EP250108a, detected by the Einstein Probe (EP) in the soft X-ray band at redshift $z = 0.176$, which was followed up by extensive multiband observations. EP250108a shares similar X-ray luminosity as XRF\,060218, the prototype of XRFs, but it extends GRBs/XRFs down to the unprecedentedly soft and weak regimes, with its $E_{\rm peak} \lesssim 1.8\,\mathrm{keV}$ and $E_{\rm iso} \lesssim 10^{49}\, \mathrm{erg}$, respectively. Meanwhile, EP250108a is found to be associated with SN\,2025kg, one of the most luminous and possibly magnetar-powered SNe Ic-BL detected so far. Modeling of the well-sampled optical light curves favors a mildly relativistic outflow as the origin of this event. This discovery demonstrates that EP, with its unique capability, is opening a new observational window into the diverse outcomes of death of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Sub-Day Timescale X-ray Spectral Variability of the TeV Blazars Mrk 421 and 1ES 1959+650</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-ray spectra ($0.7-20$ keV) of two high synchrotron-peaked blazars Mrk 421 and 1ES 1959+650 from simultaneous observations by the SXT and LAXPC instruments onboard \textit{AstroSat} and the \textit{Swift}-XRT during multiple intervals in 2016-19. The spectra of individual epochs are satisfactorily fitted by the log-parabola model. We carry out time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy using the \textit{AstroSat} data with a time resolution of $\sim$10 ks at all epochs, and study the temporal evolution of the best-fit spectral parameters of the log-parabola model. The energy light curves, with duration ranging from $0.5-5$ days, show intra-day variability and change in brightness states from one epoch to another. We find that the variation of the spectral index ($\alpha$) at hours to days timescale has an inverse relation with the energy flux and the peak energy of the spectrum, which indicates a harder-when-brighter trend in the blazars. The variation of curvature ($\beta$) does not follows a clear trend with the flux and has an anti-correlation with $\alpha$. Comparison with spectral variation simulated using a theoretical model of time variable nonthermal emission from blazar jets shows that radiative cooling and gradual acceleration of emitting particles belonging to an initial simple power-law energy distribution can reproduce most of the variability patterns of the spectral parameters at sub-day timescales.</description>

      <title>The Search for Stable Nickel: Investigating the Origins of Type Ia Supernovae with Late-time NIR Spectroscopy from the Carnegie Supernova Project-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Producing stable $^{58}$Ni in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) requires sufficiently high density conditions that are not predicted for all origin scenarios, so examining the distribution of $^{58}$Ni using the NIR [Ni II] 1.939 $\mu$m line may observationally distinguish between possible progenitors and explosion mechanisms. We present 79 telluric-corrected NIR spectra of 22 low-redshift SNe Ia from the Carnegie Supernova Project-II ranging from +50 to +505 days, including 31 previously unpublished spectra. We introduce the Gaussian Peak Ratio, a detection parameter that confirms the presence of the NIR [Ni II] 1.939 $\mu$m line in 8 SNe in our sample. Non-detections occur at earlier phases when the NIR Ni line has not emerged yet or in low signal-to-noise spectra yielding inconclusive results. Subluminous 86G-like SNe Ia show the earliest NIR Ni features around ~+50 days, whereas normal-bright SNe Ia do not exhibit NIR Ni until ~+150 days. NIR Ni features detected in our sample have low peak velocities ($v$~1200 km/s) and narrow line widths ($\leq$ 3500 km/s), indicating stable $^{58}$Ni is centrally located. This implies high density burning conditions in the innermost regions of SNe Ia and could be due to higher mass progenitors (i.e. near-$M_{ch}$). NIR spectra of the nearly two dozen SNe Ia in our sample are compared to various model predictions and paired with early-time properties to identify ideal observation windows for future SNe Ia discovered by upcoming surveys with Rubin-LSST or the Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT discovers a jet-driven bow shock near GRS 1915+105. How an invisible large-scale jet sculpts a microquasar's environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes, both supermassive and stellar-mass, impact the evolution of their surroundings on a large range of scales. While the role of supermassive black holes is well studied, the effects of stellar-mass black holes on their surroundings, particularly in inducing structures in the interstellar medium (ISM), remain under explored.
  This study focuses on the black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, renowned for its active jets, and the primary aim is to unveil and characterise the impact of GRS 1915+105 on its environment by identifying structures induced by jet-ISM interaction. Methods: We observed GRS 1915+105 with MeerKAT for a total exposure time of 14~hr, and we obtained the deepest image of GRS 1915+105 to date. Using a previously proposed self-similar model for large-scale jets, we inferred the properties of both the jets and the ISM, providing insights into the jet-ISM interaction site.
  Our observations revealed a bow shock structure near GRS 1915+105, likely induced by a jet interacting with the ISM and blowing an overpressured cavity in the medium. We constrained the ISM density to 100--160 particles\,cm$^{-3}$ while assuming a temperature range of 10$^4$--10$^6$\,K, which implies a bow shock expansion velocity of $20\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}&lt;\dot{L} &lt;\,360\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$. We estimate that the jet responsible for the formation of the bow shock has an age between 0.09 and 0.22 Myr, and the time-averaged energy rate Conclusions: Our results confirm that in stellar-mass black holes, the energy dissipated through jets can be comparable to the accretion energy, and through the interaction of the jet with the ISM, such energy is transferred back to the environment.
  This feedback mechanism mirrors the powerful influence of supermassive black holes on their environments, underscoring the significant role a black hole's activity has in shaping its surroundings.</description>

      <title>Detection and Characterization of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Seyfert Galaxy NGC 4151</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to detect and characterize quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) signals in X-ray observations of NGC 4151. We employed the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) methods for our analysis. QPO signals with frequencies of 5.91 $\times 10^{-4}$ Hz and 5.68 $\times 10^{-4}$ Hz were detected in observations conducted by Chandra (ObsID 7830) in 2007 and XMM-Newton (ObsID 0761670301) in 2015, with confidence levels of 3.7 $\sigma$ and 3.3 $\sigma$, respectively. These signals are the first to be independently observed by two different telescopes over an eight-year period with closely matched frequencies. Most notably, the combined confidence level of the QPO signals from these two independent observations reaches an exceptional 5.2 $\sigma$, which is rare in astrophysical research and significantly strengthens our conviction in the authenticity of these signals. A detailed analysis of the observational data suggests that these QPO signals may be correlated with the properties of the central supermassive black hole. Additionally, spectral analysis of the observational data revealed no significant spectral differences between the QPO and non-QPO segments. These findings provide new insights into the X-ray variability mechanisms of the central black hole in NGC 4151 and offer a novel perspective for black hole mass estimation.</description>

      <title>Prospective sensitivity of CTA on detection of evaporating primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the lifetime of a black hole decreases, the energy of the Hawking radiation it emits increases, ultimately culminating in its disappearance through a powerful burst of gamma rays. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with an initial mass of $\sim 5\times10^{14}$ g, their lifespans are expected to end in the present epoch. Detecting such PBH bursts would provide compelling evidence of their existence. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) has the potential to observe these bursts at the high-energy end of the gamma-ray spectrum. To investigate this possibility, we conduct a study to evaluate the sensitivity of CTA to the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest that during a 5-year observational campaign, CTA could exclude a local burst rate density exceeding $\sim 36\ \mathrm{pc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which represents an improvement of one order of magnitude over the upper limit set by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). In addition, we propose an observation strategy optimized for detecting PBH bursts.</description>

      <title>New insights on supernova remnants and HII regions in M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearby (d=3.6 Mpc) starburst galaxy M82 has been studied for several decades by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) networks such as e-MERLIN and the European VLBI Network (EVN). The numerous supernova remnants (SNRs), HII regions and other exotic transients make it a perfect laboratory for studying stellar evolution and the interstellar medium (ISM). Its proximity provides a linear resolution of 17 pc/arcsec, enabling decadal-time-scale variability and morphology studies of the tens of compact radio sources. In this proceedings, we describe new techniques developed in the last ten years that provide deeper, more robust imaging, enable in-band spectral index mapping, and allow wider fields of view to be imaged to find new radio sources.</description>

      <title>EP250108a/SN 2025kg: A Broad-Line Type Ic Supernova Associated with a Fast X-ray Transient Showing Evidence of Extended CSM Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical, radio, and X-ray observations of EP250108a/SN 2025kg, a broad-line Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) accompanying an Einstein Probe (EP) fast X-ray transient (FXT) at $z=0.176$. EP250108a/SN 2025kg possesses a double-peaked optical light curve and its spectrum transitions from a blue underlying continuum to a typical SN Ic-BL spectrum over time. We fit a radioactive decay model to the second peak of the optical light curve and find SN parameters that are consistent with the SNe Ic-BL population, while its X-ray and radio properties are consistent with those of low-luminosity GRB (LLGRB) 060218/SN 2006aj. We explore three scenarios to understand the system's multi-wavelength emission -- (a) SN ejecta interacting with an extended circumstellar medium (CSM), (b) the shocked cocoon of a collapsar-driven jet choked in its stellar envelope, and (c) the shocked cocoon of a collapsar-driven jet choked in an extended CSM. All three models can explain the optical light curve and are also consistent with the radio and X-ray observations. We favor models (a) and (c) because they self-consistently explain both the X-ray prompt emission and first optical peak, but we do not rule out model (b). From the properties of the first peak in models (a) and (c), we find evidence that EP250108a/SN 2025kg interacts with an extended CSM, and infer an envelope mass $M_{\rm e} \sim 0.1\,\rm M_\odot$ and radius $R_{\rm e} \sim 4 \times 10^{13}$ cm. EP250108a/SN 2025kg's multi-wavelength properties make it a close analog to LLGRB 060218/SN 2006aj, and highlight the power of early follow-up observations in mapping the environments of massive stars prior to core collapse.</description>

      <title>A non-uniform metal distribution in the ram-pressure stripped M86 group of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical enrichment of X-ray-emitting hot halos has primarily been studied in closed-box galaxy clusters. Investigating the metal content of lower-mass, open systems can serve as a valuable tracer for understanding their dynamical history and the extent of chemical enrichment mechanisms in the Universe. In this context, we use an 85.6 ks XMM-Newton observation to study the spatial distribution of the abundance ratios of Mg, Si, and S with respect to Fe in the hot gas of the ram-pressure-stripped M86, which has undergone morphological transformations. We report that the chemical composition in the M86 galaxy core is more similar to the rest of the hot gaseous content of the Universe than to its stellar population. This result indicate that even extreme supersonic ram-pressure is insufficient to strip the inner part of a galaxy of its hot atmosphere. Comparison with other galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping suggests that stripping the "primordial" atmosphere of a galaxy requires a combination of ram-pressure stripping and strong radio-mechanical AGN activity. The X-ray emission structures within M86, the plume and the tail, are found to be relatively isothermal. We observe that the Mg/Fe ratio in the plume is $3.3\sigma$ higher than in the M86 galaxy core and is consistent with that in the M86 group outskirts and the Virgo ICM, suggesting that the plume might originate from the low-entropy group gas due to a galaxy-galaxy collision rather than from the ram-pressure stripping of the dense galaxy core.</description>

      <title>Quantifying jet-interstellar medium interactions in Cyg X-1: Insights from dual-frequency bow shock detection with MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion and outflows are astrophysical phenomena observed across a wide range of objects, from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. Developing a complete picture of these processes requires complementary studies across this full spectrum of jet-launching sources. Jet-interstellar medium (ISM) interaction sites near black hole X-ray binaries provide unique laboratories to study jet energetics. This work aims to detect and characterise the bow shock near one black hole X-ray binary, Cyg X-1, and then use this bow shock structure to parametrise the properties of the jet launched by Cyg X-1 over its lifetime. We used the MeerKAT radio telescope to investigate the bow shock structure formed by the interaction between the jets of Cyg X-1 and the ISM. We successfully detect the bow shock north of Cyg X-1 in the L and S bands and report its size and brightness. We present the spectral index distribution across the bow shock, which is in the range -0.9 to 0.4, with an error distribution (0.6 to 1.5) that peaks at unity. We determine that the unshocked ISM density is 6-7 cm^-3 for a temperature range of 10^4 to 3*10^6 K. This temperature range suggests that the velocity of the bow shock is 21 km/s to 364 km/s. The age of the Cyg X-1 jet responsible for the bow shock is 0.04 to 0.3 Myr, and the power of the jet is constrained to 2*10^31 ergs/s to 10^35 ergs/s. We also detect new morphological features of the bow shock in the S-band image. The comparison of archival H_alpha maps with the new radio observations hints at different regions of emission, different temperature ranges, and different ISM densities. The spectral index suggests a consistent emission origin across the structure. The ISM density around Cyg X-1 is on the higher end for Galactic environments, and our results indicate a lower jet energy transport rate than prior estimates.</description>

      <title>Flux tube clustering from magnetic coupling of adjacent type-I and -II superconductors in a neutron star: persistent gravitational radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adjacent type-I and -II proton superconductors in a rotation-powered pulsar are predicted to exist in a metastable state containing macroscopic and quantized flux tubes, respectively. Previous studies show that the type-I and -II regions are coupled magnetically, when macroscopic flux tubes divide dendritically into quantized flux tubes near the type-I-II interface, through a process known as flux branching. The studies assume that the normal-superconducting boundary is sharp, and the quantized flux tubes do not repel mutually. Here the sharp-interface approximation is refined by accounting for magnetic repulsion. It is found that flux tubes in the same flux tree cluster with a minimum-energy separation two to seven times less than that of isolated flux tubes. Neutron vortices pin and cluster about flux trees. We find that the maximum characteristic wave strain $h_0$ of the current quadrupole gravitational radiation emitted by a rectilinear array of clustered vortices exceeds by $(1+N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ the strain $h_0 \sim 10^{-32}(f/30 {\rm Hz})^{5/2} (D/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$ emitted by uniformly distributed vortices, where $N_{\rm v,t}$ is the mean number of pinned vortices per flux tree, $f$ is the star's spin frequency, and $D$ is the star's distance from Earth. The factor $(1 + N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ brings $h_0$ close to the sensitivity limit of the current generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors under certain circumstances, specifically when flux branching forms relatively few (and hence relatively large) flux trees.</description>

      <title>The black hole - pair instability boundary for high stellar rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pair Instability (PI) boundary is crucial for understanding heavy merging Black Holes (BHs) and the second mass gap's role in galactic chemical evolution. So far, no works have critically and systematically examined how rotation and mass loss affect the PI boundary or BH masses below it. Rapid rotation significantly alters stellar structure and mass loss, which is expected to have significant effects on the evolution of stellar models. We have previously derived a critical core mass independent of stellar evolution parameters, finding the BH (Pulsational) PI boundary at $M_{ CO, crit} = 36.3 M_\odot$ for a carbon-oxygen (CO) core. Using MESA, we model massive stars around the PI boundary for varying rotation rates and metallicities. We implement mechanical mass loss in MESA, studying its effects on massive stars in low-metallicity environments. Below $1/100$th $Z_\odot$, mechanical mass loss dominates over radiative winds. We check the BH-PI boundary for rapid rotators to confirm our critical core mass criterion and derive model fits describing rotation's impact on core and final masses. Fast rotators reach a point (typically $\Omega / \Omega_{crit} \approx 0.6$) where the entire star becomes chemically homogeneous, evolving like a stripped star. This lowers the maximum BH mass before PI to its critical core mass of $M_{CO, crit} = 36.3 M_\odot$, aligning with the bump feature in the BH mass distribution observed by LIGO/VIRGO.</description>

      <title>Ringdown mode amplitudes of precessing binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a binary black-hole merger encodes key information about the remnant properties and provides a direct probe of the strong-field regime of General Relativity. While quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times are well understood within black-hole perturbation theory, their excitation amplitudes remain challenging to model, as they depend on the merger phase. The complexity increases for precessing black-hole binaries, where multiple emission modes can contribute comparably to the ringdown. In this paper, we investigate the phenomenology of precessing binary black hole ringdowns using the SXS numerical relativity simulations catalog. Precession significantly impacts the ringdown excitation amplitudes and the related mode hierarchy. Using Gaussian process regression, we construct the first fits for the ringdown amplitudes of the most relevant modes in precessing systems.</description>

      <title>A Sandwich Model for Changing-Look AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral variability of changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) occurred on timescales of years to tens of years, posing a significant challenge to the standard thin disk model. In this work, we propose a sandwich model, including an optically thick disk in the mid-plane (Disk 1) and two disks of low effective optical depth on both sides (Disk 2). These two types of disks are coupled with magnetic fields, which allow viscous torque interaction between them. As a consequence, the radial velocity of Disk 1 can increase by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the standard thin disk, leading to an equivalent decrease in the accretion timescale. Therefore, such a sandwich model can account for the rapid variability in CL-AGNs. In addition, we also discuss the influence of the magnetic pressure on Disk 2. When Disk 2 is dominated by the magnetic pressure, it resembles a "warm corona", which is responsible for the soft X-ray excess.</description>

      <title>Atemporality from Conservation Laws of Physics in Lorentzian-Euclidean Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results have shown that singularities can be avoided from the general relativistic standpoint in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes by means of the transition from a Lorentzian to an Euclidean region where time loses its physical meaning and becomes imaginary. This dynamical mechanism, dubbed ``atemporality'', prevents the emergence of black hole singularities and the violation of conservation laws. In this paper, the notion of atemporality together with a detailed discussion of its implications is presented from a philosophical perspective. The main result consists in showing that atemporality is naturally related to conservation laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave data from advanced-era interferometric detectors consists of background Gaussian noise, frequent transient artefacts, and rare astrophysical signals. Multiple search algorithms exist to detect the signals from compact binary coalescences, but their varying performance complicates interpretation. We present a machine learning-driven approach that combines results from individual pipelines and utilises conformal prediction to provide robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification. Using simulations, we demonstrate improved detection efficiency and apply our model to GWTC-3, enhancing confidence in multi-pipeline detections, such as the sub-threshold binary neutron star candidate GW200311_103121.</description>

      <title>The stellar corona-chromosphere connection. A comprehensive study of X-ray and Ca II IRT fluxes from eROSITA and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar activity can be observed at different wavelengths in a variety of different activity indicators. We investigated the correlation between coronal and chromospheric emissions by combining X-ray data from stars detected in the eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS1 and eRASS:5) with Ca II infrared triplet (IRT) activity indices as published in the third Gaia data release (Gaia DR3). We specifically studied 24 300 and 43 200 stellar sources with reliable Ca II IRT measurement and X-ray detection in eRASS1 and eRASS:5, which is by far the largest stellar sample available so far. The largest detection fraction is obtained for highly active sources and stars of a late spectral type, while F-type and less active stars (as measured in the Ca II IRT) remain mostly undetected in X-rays. Also, the correlation is the strongest for late-type sources, while F-type stars show a rather weak correlation between the X-ray to bolometric flux ratio and the Ca II IRT activity index. The relation between the X-ray and Ca II IRT surface fluxes changes with the fractional X-ray flux without showing two separated branches as described in previous studies. For fast rotators, both activity indicators saturate at a similar Rossby number and the X-ray to bolometric flux ratio decreases faster than the IRT index for slower rotating stars. As a consequence, the ratio between X-ray and IRT fluxes is constant in the saturation regime and decreases for slow rotators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The public release of data from the LIGO and Virgo detectors has enabled the identification of potential gravitational wave signals by independent teams using alternative methodologies. In addition to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration's GWTC-3 catalogue there have been several additional works claiming the detection of signals in the data from the first three observing runs. In this paper we present an analysis of these new signals using the same analysis workflow which was used to generate the GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 catalogues published by the LVK, matching the analysis configuration as closely as possible, and we provide our parameter estimation results in a format comparable to those of the GWTC-3 data release. We also include a discussion of the workflow developed for this analysis.</description>

      <title>Probing Stellar Clusters from Gaia DR2 as Galactic PeVatrons: I -- Expected Gamma-ray and Neutrino Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young &amp; massive stellar clusters (SCs) are a potential source of galactic cosmic rays up to very high energies as a result of two possible acceleration scenarios. Collective stellar winds from massive member stars form a wind-blown bubble with a termination shock at which particle acceleration to PeV energies may occur. Furthermore, shock acceleration may occur at SNRs expanding inside the bubble. By applying a model of cosmic ray acceleration at both the wind termination shock and SNR shocks to the catalog of known SCs derived from Gaia DR2, we aim to identify the most promising targets to search for evidence of PeVatron activity. Predictions for the secondary fluxes of gamma-ray and neutrino emission are derived based on particle acceleration at the collective wind TS and the subsequent hadro-nuclear interactions with the surrounding medium. Predictions from our modelling under baseline and optimistic scenarios are compared to data, finding consistent results. We estimate the detection prospects for future gamma-ray and neutrino experiments. We find that degree-scale angular sizes of the wind-blown bubbles are typical, that may pose a challenge for experimental detection. A shortlist of the most promising candidates is identified, with an anticipated flux range. Of order 10 SCs may be detectable with future facilities, and 1-3 could be currently operating as PeVatrons. Among these, three gamma-ray detected SCs have data that our model can consistently describe. Several further as-yet-undetected SCs offer promising targets for future observations, although the flux range allowed by our model can be large (&gt; factor 10). The large angular size of the wind-blown bubble may lead to low surface brightness emission, worsening the problem of source confusion. Nevertheless, we discuss how further work will help to constrain SCs as PeVatron candidates. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Follow-up to Gravitational Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)</title>

Abstract: The Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) is expected to fly in 2030 and will have the opportunity -- and the rapid near/far ultraviolet (UV) capabilities -- to glean unprecedented insight into the bright UV emission present in kilonovae like that of AT 170817gfo, the electromagnetic counterpart to binary neutron star merger GW170817. To do so, it will need to perform prompt target-of-opportunity observations following detection of binary neutron star mergers by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational observatories. We present initial simulations to develop UVEX target-of-opportunity strategies for such events and provide the community with detailed initial estimates of the prospects for and characteristics of UVEX target-of-opportunity observations following gravitational-wave events, considering fiducial scenarios for the fifth and sixth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs. Additionally, in light of the relatively few binary neutron star mergers observed since GW170817, we consider variant target-of-opportunity strategies for UVEX to maximize scientific gain in the case of a lowered binary neutron star merger rate.</description>

      <title>Resonances of compressible stars in precessing orbits around a spinning black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper, we reported the presence of a new resonance of an incompressible star orbiting a spinning black hole and showed that it can set in before the tidal disruption limit if the star has an inclined spherical orbit around the black hole. Using the affine model developed by Carter and Luminet, we extend our result to the stars with polytropic equations of state. We give further credence to the result previously given. We also derive the formula for the growth rate of the resonant motion, which is useful for checking the results of hydrodynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Probing thermonuclear bursts and X-ray reflection features in Aql X-1 during 2024 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the broadband timing and spectral properties of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Aql X-1 during the 2024 outburst with NICER, NuSTAR, and Swift observatories. We detected six thermonuclear X-ray bursts during the NICER and NuSTAR observations, with the observed X-ray burst profiles exhibiting a strong energy dependence. The time-resolved burst spectra indicate the presence of soft excess during the burst, which can be modeled by using a variable persistent emission method ($f_a$ method), or the relxillNS reflection model. We found that the reflection model can contribute $\sim$20% of total emission as observed during the NICER burst. The reflection and blackbody component fluxes are strongly correlated as observed during a burst. The excess emission is possible due to the enhanced mass accretion rate to the neutron star due to the Poynting-Rodertson drag and a fraction of burst emission may be reflected from the disk. The bursts did not show photospheric radius expansion during the peak. Moreover, we examined the burst-free accretion emission in the broadband range with NuSTAR, NICER, and Swift at two epochs of the outburst. The persistent emission showed X-ray reflection feature, which can be well modeled with the relativistic reflection model relxillCp. The inner disk radius (R$_{in}$) is found to be nearly 22 and 10 times $\rm R_{g}$ for two observations, respectively. Assuming that the inner disk is truncated at the magnetospheric radius, the magnetic field strength at the poles of the neutron star is estimated to be $(0.6-1.9) \times 10^9$ G.</description>

      <title>GRB Timing: Decoding the Hidden Slow Jets in GRB 060729</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are luminous stellar explosions characterized by the ejection of relativistic jets. This work proposes a novel paradigm to study these GRB jets. By analyzing the timing information of prompt pulses and X-ray flares, in conjunction with the multi-wavelength afterglow observations, we identify three distinct jets in the extraordinary GRB 060729, with initial bulk Lorentz factors ranging from approximately 20 to 80, smaller than typical values of $&gt; 100$. These three jets undergo two successive collisions, producing the observed pair of X-ray flares. Following these interactions, the system evolves into a fast, narrow jet and a slower, hollow jet that continues to propagate in the circumburst medium, evidenced by the notable twin bumps observed in the X-ray and optical afterglow of GRB 060729. Our findings demonstrate that the timing of the early emission enables us to measure the velocities of the GRB jets. The proposed paradigm enhances our understanding of jet dynamics and shock interactions and serves as a powerful tool for probing the physics of the central engine with the expanded sample in the current golden era of GRB research.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Constraints on the Flux of Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of a $\simeq220$~PeV muon neutrino by the KM3NeT neutrino telescope offers an unprecedented opportunity to probe the Universe at extreme energies. We analyze the origin of this event under three scenarios, viz., a transient point source, a diffuse astrophysical emission, and line-of-sight interaction of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECR; $E \gtrsim 0.1$~EeV). Our analysis includes the flux from both a KM3NeT-only fit and a joint fit, incorporating data from KM3NeT, IceCube, and Pierre Auger Observatory. If the neutrino event originates from transients, it requires a new population of transient that is energetic, gamma-ray dark, and more abundant than known ones. In the framework of diffuse astrophysical emission, we compare the required local UHECR energy injection rate at $\gtrsim4$ EeV, assuming a proton primary, with the rate derived from the flux measurements by Auger. This disfavors the KM3NeT-only fit at all redshifts, while the joint fit remains viable for $z\gtrsim 1$, based on redshift evolution models of known source populations. For cosmogenic origin from point sources, our results suggest that the luminosity obtained at redshifts $z \lesssim 1$ from the joint fit is compatible with the Eddington luminosity of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Are Kronberger 80 and/or Kronberger 82 regions PeVatron candidates for LHAASO J2108+5157?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy gamma rays have been detected in the region of LHAASO~J2108+5157 by the Fermi--LAT, HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A observatories. Cygnus~OB2 in Cygnus--X has been confirmed as the first strong stellar cluster PeVatron in our Galaxy. Thus, the star--forming regions Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82, located in the field of LHAASO~J2108+5157, are analyzed to evaluate their stellar population and potential as associated PeVatron candidates. A distance of 10~kpc is adopted for Kronberger~80, while $\sim$1.6~kpc is estimated for Kronberger~82. Based on stellar densities, we report that their cluster radii are 2.5$\arcmin$ and 2.0$\arcmin$, while IR photometry reveals poor stellar content in massive O-type stars in both cases. From optical data, the estimation of cluster ages are 5--12.6~Myr and $\lesssim$ 5~Myr, respectively. We conclude that, in contrast to the stellar content of Cygnus~OB2, it is unlikely that Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82 are PeVatrons associated with LHAASO~J2108+5157. The presence of a PeVatron in this region remains a mystery, but we confirm that the two Kronberger regions are star--forming regions undergoing formation rather than evolution.</description>

      <title>Search for Quantum Gravity Using Astrophysical Neutrino Flavour with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.04654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Along their long propagation from production to detection, neutrino states undergo quantum interference which converts their types, or flavours. High-energy astrophysical neutrinos, first observed by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, are known to propagate unperturbed over a billion light years in vacuum. These neutrinos act as the largest quantum interferometer and are sensitive to the smallest effects in vacuum due to new physics. Quantum gravity (QG) aims to describe gravity in a quantum mechanical framework, unifying matter, forces and space-time. QG effects are expected to appear at the ultra-high-energy scale known as the Planck energy, $E_{P}\equiv 1.22\times 10^{19}$~giga-electronvolts (GeV). Such a high-energy universe would have existed only right after the Big Bang and it is inaccessible by human technologies. On the other hand, it is speculated that the effects of QG may exist in our low-energy vacuum, but are suppressed by the Planck energy as $E_{P}^{-1}$ ($\sim 10^{-19}$~GeV$^{-1}$), $E_{P}^{-2}$ ($\sim 10^{-38}$~GeV$^{-2}$), or its higher powers. The coupling of particles to these effects is too small to measure in kinematic observables, but the phase shift of neutrino waves could cause observable flavour conversions. Here, we report the first result of neutrino interferometry~\cite{Aartsen:2017ibm} using astrophysical neutrino flavours to search for new space-time structure. We did not find any evidence of anomalous flavour conversion in IceCube astrophysical neutrino flavour data. We place the most stringent limits of any known technologies, down to $10^{-42}$~GeV$^{-2}$, on the dimension-six operators that parameterize the space-time defects for preferred astrophysical production scenarios. For the first time, we unambiguously reach the signal region of quantum-gravity-motivated physics.</description>

      <title>Systematic biases due to waveform mismodeling in parametrized post-Einsteinian tests of general relativity: The impact of neglecting spin precession and higher modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the robustness of parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) tests of General Relativity (GR) with gravitational waves, due to waveform inaccuracy. In particular, we determine the properties of the signal -- signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and source parameters -- such that we are led to falsely identify a ppE deviation in the post-Newtonian (PN) inspiral phase at -1PN, 1PN, or 2PN order, due to neglecting spin precession or higher models in the recovery model. To characterize the statistical significance of the biases, we compute the Bayes factor between the ppE and GR models, and the fitting factor of the ppE model. For highly-precessing, edge-on signals, we find that mismodeling the signal leads to a significant systematic bias in the recovery of the ppE parameters, even at an SNR of 30. However, these biased inferences are characterized by a significant loss of SNR and a weak preference for the ppE model. At a higher SNR, the biased inferences display a strong preference for the ppE model and a significant loss of SNR. For edge-on signals containing asymmetric masses, at an SNR of 30, we find that excluding higher modes does not impact the ppE tests as much as excluding spin precession. Our analysis, therefore, identifies the spin-precessing and mass-asymmetric systems for which parametrized tests of GR are robust. With a toy model and using the linear signal approximation, we illustrate these regimes of bias and characterize them by obtaining bounds on the ratio of systematic to statistical error and the effective cycles incurred due to mismodeling. As a by-product of our analysis, we connect various measures and techniques commonly used to estimate systematic errors -- linear-signal approximation, Laplace approximation, fitting factor, effective cycles, and Bayes factor -- that apply to all studies of systematic uncertainties in gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

Abstract: According to the asymptotically safe gravity, black holes may have characteristics different from those described according to general relativity if the running of the gravitational constant coupling happens at low energies. Particularly, they should be more compact, with a smaller event horizon, which in turn affects the other quantities dependent on it, like the photon ring and the size of the innermost stable circular orbit. We decided to test the latter hypothesis by searching in the literature for observational measurements of the inner radius of the accretion disk around stellar-mass black holes. We selected the smallest values measured when the disk was in high/soft state, made them homogeneous by taking into account the most recent and more reliable values of mass, spin, viewing angle, and distance from the Earth, and compared with the expectations of the Kerr metric. We do not find any significant deviation. Some doubtful cases can be easily understood as due to specific states of the object during the observation or instrumental biases.</description>

      <title>Masquerading hybrid stars with dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of dark matter on hybrid stars. Using a two-fluid approach, where normal and dark matter components interact only gravitationally, we explore how dark matter can trigger the appearance of quark matter in neutron stars for unprecedented low masses. Our findings reveal that dark matter increases the central pressure of neutron stars, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid stars with quark cores even at very low compact star masses. The critical mass for the appearance of quark matter decreases with increasing dark matter content. We introduce the concept of "masquerading hybrid stars", where dark matter admixed stars exhibit similar mass-radius relations to purely hadronic stars, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on these parameters. Additionally, we identify a unique class of objects termed "dark oysters", characterized by a large dark matter halo and a small normal matter core, highlighting the diverse structural possibilities for compact stars influenced by dark matter.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial black hole abundance with Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter and they have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges. However, PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}$ - $10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter. In this work, we use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBHs within the mass range of $2\times10^{16}$ - $5\times10^{17}$ g. Our analysis explores three scenarios: directly using observational data, incorporating the astrophysical background model (ABM), and employing the power-law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Our results indicate that although Insight-HXMT does not have an advantage in the first two scenarios, when considering the power-law model, its exceptional sensitivity in the hard X-ray regime and sufficiently high upper energy limit significantly strengthen the constraints on PBHs with masses greater than $10^{17}$ g compared to previous limits. Furthermore, the exclusion limit for PBHs as dark matter has reached $4\times10^{17}$ g, which is comparable to the current threshold.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the derivation of a well-defined $D\to4$ limit for 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity coupled to a scalar field, there has been considerable interest in testing it as an alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Past work has shown that this theory hosts interesting compact star solutions which are smaller in radius than a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass in general relativity (GR), though the stability of such objects has been subject to question. In this paper we solve the equations for radial perturbations of neutron stars in the 4DEGB theory with Skyrme Lyon (SLy)/Brussels-Montreal Skyrme functionals (BSk) class equations of state (EOSs), along with the M\"uller-Serot (MS2) EOS, and show that the coincidence of stability and maximum mass points in GR is still present in this modified theory, with the interesting additional feature of solutions re-approaching stability near the black hole solution on the mass-radius diagram. Besides this, as expected from past work, we find that larger values of the 4DEGB coupling $\alpha$ tend to increase the mass of neutron stars of the same radius (due to a larger $\alpha$ weakening gravity) and move the maximum mass points of the solution branches closer to the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>The observation image of a soliton boson star illuminated by various accretions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the observable signatures of solitonic boson stars by employing ray-tracing simulations, with celestial spheres and thin accretion disks serving as illumination sources. By numerically fitting the metric form, we solve the geodesic equation for photons under the influence of the soliton potential, enabling us to simulate the optical appearance of the soliton boson star in two distinct regimes. In the weak coupling case (larger value of coupling parameter $\alpha$) with an initial scalar field $\psi_0$, the images on the screen predominantly show direct and lensed images, where $\psi_0$ and $\alpha$ modulate the image region size while the observation inclination $\theta$ controls morphological asymmetry. In the case of strong coupling (small value of $\alpha$), the images on the screen show a nested sub-annulus within the Einstein ring in the celestial model, whereas thin disk accretion models reveal higher-order lensing images indicative that photons are capable of orbiting the equatorial plane of the boson star multiple times. We also analyze how the effective potential and redshift factor depend on the correlation parameter. At low inclination($\theta&lt;30^{\circ})$, the redshift is the dominant effect, the image is characterized by a dim central cavity enclosed by a bright ring. At high inclination ($\theta&gt;60^{\circ})$, the Doppler effect becomes more pronounced, resulting in a substantial brightness disparity between the left and right sides of the optical image. These findings offer robust theoretical underpinnings for differentiating solitonic boson stars from black holes via high-resolution astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Lens Caustics with Gravitational Waves: A Uniform Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near fold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA), focusing on binary mass lenses - axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave methods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due to highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate description of the wave field near folds, resolving the breakdown of Geometrical Optics at caustics and improving upon Transitional Asymptotics - based on Airy function approximations - which lack global validity. Central to our approach is the concept of the caustic width, $d_c$, a characteristic length scale defining the region where diffraction significantly alters wave propagation. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the gravitational wavelength as ~ $ \lambda^{2/3}$ and inversely with the redshifted lens mass as ~ $ M_{Lz}^{-2/3}$. The wave amplification near the fold grows as ~ $ d_c^{-1/4}$, substantially enhancing the signal and potentially playing a key role in the detection of gravitational waves lensed near caustics. Notably, for lens masses below the galactic scale, the caustic width for gravitational waves is not negligible compared to the Einstein radius - as it is in electromagnetic lensing - making the UA essential for accurately capturing wave effects.</description>
