      <title>FSM Builder: A Tool for Writing Autograded Finite Automata Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata (DFAs and NFAs) are abstract models of computation commonly taught in introductory computing theory courses. These models have important applications (such as fast regular expression matching), and are used to introduce formal language theory. Undergraduate students often struggle with understanding these models at first, due to the level of abstraction. As a result, various pedagogical tools have been developed to allow students to practice with these models. We introduce the FSM Builder, a new pedagogical tool enabling students to practice constructing DFAs and NFAs with a graphical editor, giving personalized feedback and partial credit. The algorithms used for generating these are heavily inspired by previous works. The key advantages to its competitors are greater flexibility and scalability. This is because the FSM Builder is implemented using efficient algorithms from an open source package, allowing for easy extension and question creation. We discuss the implementation of the tool, how it stands out from previous tools, and takeaways from experiences of using the tool in multiple large courses. Survey results indicate the interface and feedback provided by the tool were useful to students.</description>

      <title>Mahler equations for Zeckendorf numeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define generalised equations of Z-Mahler type, based on the Zeckendorf numeration system. We show that if a sequence over a commutative ring is Z-regular, then it is the sequence of coefficients of a series which is a solution of a Z-Mahler equation. Conversely, if the Z-Mahler equation is isolating, then its solutions define Z-regular sequences. This is a generalisation of results of Becker and Dumas. We provide an example to show that there exist non-isolating Z-Mahler equations whose solutions do not define Z-regular sequences. Our proof yields a new construction of weighted automata that generate classical q-regular sequences.</description>

      <title>Orbit-Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces and Weighted Register Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02438v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of vector spaces spanned by orbit-finite sets. Using this theory, we give a decision procedure for equivalence of weighted register automata, which are the common generalization of weighted automata and register automata for infinite alphabets. The algorithm runs in exponential time, and in polynomial time for a fixed number of registers. As a special case, we can decide, with the same complexity, language equivalence for unambiguous register automata, which improves previous results in three ways: (a) we allow for order comparisons on atoms, and not just equality; (b) the complexity is exponentially better; and (c) we allow automata with guessing.</description>
