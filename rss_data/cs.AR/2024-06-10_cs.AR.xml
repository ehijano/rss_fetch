      <title>A 2.5-nA Area-Efficient Temperature-Independent 176-/82-ppm/{\deg}C CMOS-Only Current Reference in 0.11-$\mu$m Bulk and 22-nm FD-SOI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications require nW-power current references that are robust to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations, to maintain the performance of IoT sensor nodes in a wide range of operating conditions. However, nA-range current references are rarely area-efficient due to the use of large gate-leakage transistors or resistors, which occupy a significant silicon area at this current level. In this paper, we introduce a nA-range constant-with-temperature (CWT) current reference, relying on a self-cascode MOSFET (SCM) biased by a four-transistor ultra-low-power voltage reference through a single-transistor buffer. The proposed reference includes a temperature coefficient (TC) calibration mechanism to maintain performance across process corners. In addition, as the proposed design relies on the body effect, it has been fabricated and measured in 0.11-$\mu$m bulk and 22-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) to demonstrate feasibility in both technology types. On the one hand, the 0.11-$\mu$m design consumes a power of 16.8 nW at 1.2 V and achieves a 2.3-nA current with a line sensitivity (LS) of 2.23 %/V at 25{\deg}C and a TC of 176 ppm/{\deg}C at 1.2 V from -40 to 85{\deg}C. On the other hand, the 22-nm design consumes a power of 16.3 nW at 1.5 V and achieves a 2.5-nA current with a 1.53-%/V LS at 25{\deg}C and an 82-ppm/{\deg}C TC at 1.5 V from -40 to 85{\deg}C. Thanks to their simple architecture, the proposed references achieve a silicon area of 0.0106 mm$^2$ in 0.11 $\mu$m and 0.0026 mm$^2$ in 22 nm without compromising other figures of merit, and are thus competitive with state-of-the-art CWT references operating in the same current range.</description>

      <title>Mexican Computers: A Brief Technical and Historical Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the microprocessor in the early 1970s allowed the design of computers that did not require the substantial economic resources possessed by large computer companies of that era. Shortly after this event, a variety of computers based on microprocessors appeared in the United States and other developed countries. Unlike in those countries, where small and large companies developed most personal computers, in Mexico, the first microprocessor-based computers were designed within academic institutions. It is little known that Mexican computers of that era include a variety of systems ranging from purpose-specific research and teaching-oriented computers to high-performance personal computers. The goal of this article is to describe in detail some of these Mexican computers designed between the late 1970s and mid-1980s.</description>

      <title>PolyLUT-Add: FPGA-based LUT Inference with Wide Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FPGAs have distinct advantages as a technology for deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) at the edge. Lookup Table (LUT) based networks, where neurons are directly modelled using LUTs, help maximize this promise of offering ultra-low latency and high area efficiency on FPGAs. Unfortunately, LUT resource usage scales exponentially with the number of inputs to the LUT, restricting PolyLUT to small LUT sizes. This work introduces PolyLUT-Add, a technique that enhances neuron connectivity by combining $A$ PolyLUT sub-neurons via addition to improve accuracy. Moreover, we describe a novel architecture to improve its scalability. We evaluated our implementation over the MNIST, Jet Substructure classification and Network Intrusion Detection benchmark and found that for similar accuracy, PolyLUT-Add achieves a LUT reduction of $1.3-7.7\times$ with a $1.2-2.2\times$ decrease in latency.</description>

      <title>The Case for Replication-Aware Memory-Error Protection in Disaggregated Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disaggregated memory leverages recent technology advances in high-density, byte-addressable non-volatile memory and high-performance interconnects to provide a large memory pool shared across multiple compute nodes. Due to higher memory density, memory errors may become more frequent. Unfortunately, tolerating memory errors through existing memory-error protection techniques becomes impractical due to increasing storage cost. This work proposes replication-aware memory-error protection to improve storage efficiency of protection in data-centric applications that already rely on memory replication for performance and availability. It lets such applications lower protection storage cost by weakening the protection of each individual replica, but still realize a strong protection target by relying on the collective protection conferred by multiple replicas.</description>

      <title>HyperSense: Hyperdimensional Intelligent Sensing for Energy-Efficient Sparse Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introducing HyperSense, our co-designed hardware and software system efficiently controls Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) modules' data generation rate based on object presence predictions in sensor data. Addressing challenges posed by escalating sensor quantities and data rates, HyperSense reduces redundant digital data using energy-efficient low-precision ADC, diminishing machine learning system costs. Leveraging neurally-inspired HyperDimensional Computing (HDC), HyperSense analyzes real-time raw low-precision sensor data, offering advantages in handling noise, memory-centricity, and real-time learning. Our proposed HyperSense model combines high-performance software for object detection with real-time hardware prediction, introducing the novel concept of Intelligent Sensor Control. Comprehensive software and hardware evaluations demonstrate our solution's superior performance, evidenced by the highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) and sharpest Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve among lightweight models. Hardware-wise, our FPGA-based domain-specific accelerator tailored for HyperSense achieves a 5.6x speedup compared to YOLOv4 on NVIDIA Jetson Orin while showing up to 92.1% energy saving compared to the conventional system. These results underscore HyperSense's effectiveness and efficiency, positioning it as a promising solution for intelligent sensing and real-time data processing across diverse applications.</description>

      <title>TOP: Towards Open &amp; Predictable Heterogeneous SoCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring predictability in modern real-time Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) is an increasingly critical concern for many application domains such as automotive, robotics, and industrial automation. An effective approach involves the modeling and development of hardware components, such as interconnects and shared memory resources, to evaluate or enforce their deterministic behavior. Unfortunately, these IPs are often closed-source, and these studies are limited to the single modules that must later be integrated with third-party IPs in more complex SoCs, hindering the precision and scope of modeling and compromising the overall predictability. With the coming-of-age of open-source instruction set architectures (RISC-V) and hardware, major opportunities for changing this status quo are emerging. This study introduces an innovative methodology for modeling and analyzing State-of-the-Art (SoA) open-source SoCs for low-power cyber-physical systems. Our approach models and analyzes the entire set of open-source IPs within these SoCs and then provides a comprehensive analysis of the entire architecture. We validate this methodology on a sample heterogenous low-power RISC-V architecture through RTL simulation and FPGA implementation, minimizing pessimism in bounding the service time of transactions crossing the architecture between 28% and 1%, which is considerably lower when compared to similar SoA works.</description>
