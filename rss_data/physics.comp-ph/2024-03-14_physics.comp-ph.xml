      <title>Sparse Data Structures for Efficient State-to-State Kinetic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-fidelity entry simulations can be enabled by integrating finer thermo-chemistry models into compressible flow physics. One such class of models are State-to-State (StS) kinetics, which explicitly track species populations among quantum energy levels. StS models can represent thermo-chemical non-equilibrium effects that are hardly captured by standard multi-temperature models. However, the associated increase in computational cost is dramatic. For implicit solution techniques that rely on standard block-sparse representations of the Jacobian, both the spatial complexity and the temporal complexity grow quadratically with respect to the number of quantum levels represented. We introduce a more efficient way to represent the Jacobian arising in first-order implicit simulations for compressible flow physics coupled with StS models. The key idea is to recognize that the density of local blocks of the Jacobian comes from rank-one updates that can be managed separately. This leads to a new Jacobian structure, consisting of a fully-sparse matrix and block-wise rank-one updates, whose overall complexity grows linearly with the number of quantum levels. This structure also brings forth a potentially faster variation of the block-Jacobi preconditioning algorithm by leveraging the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury inversion formula.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Partial Wave Analysis Code Generator (PWACG) that automatically generates high-performance partial wave analysis codes. This is achieved by leveraging the JAX automatic differentiation library and the jinja2 template engine. The resulting code is constructed using the high-performance API of JAX, and includes support for the Newton's Conjugate Gradient optimization method, as well as the full utilization of parallel computing capabilities offered by GPUs. By harnessing these advanced computing techniques, PWACG demonstrates a significant advantage in efficiently identifying global optimal points compared to conventional partial wave analysis software packages.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thermal transport and high thermoelectric performance of Cu-based vanadate CuVO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric (TE) conversion technology, capable of transforming heat into electricity, is critical for sustainable energy solutions. Many promising TE materials contain rare or toxic elements, so the development of cost-effective and eco-friendly high-performance TE materials is highly urgent. Herein, we explore the thermal transport and TE properties of transition metal vanadate CuVO3 by using first-principles calculation. On the basis of unified theory of heat conduction, we uncover the hierarchical thermal transport feature in CuVO3, where wave-like tunneling makes a significant contribution to the lattice thermal conductivity (\k{appa}l) and result in the anomalously weak temperature dependence of \k{appa}l. This is primarily attributable to the complex phononic band structure caused by the heterogeneity of Cu-O and V-O bonds. Simultaneously, we report a high power factor of 5.45 mW K-2 m-1 realized in hole-doped CuVO3, which arises from a high electrical conductivity and a large Seebeck coefficient enabled by the multiple valleys and large electronic density of states near the valence band edge. Impressively, the low \k{appa}l and the high power factor make p-typed CuVO3 have ZT of up to 1.39, with the excellent average ZT above 1.0 from 300 to 600 K, which is superior to most reported Cu-based TE materials. Our findings suggest that CuVO3 compound is promising candidate for energy conversion applications in innovative TE devices.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Quantum Subspace Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an iterative generalisation of the quantum subspace expansion algorithm used with a Krylov basis. The iterative construction connects a sequence of subspaces via their lowest energy states. Diagonalising a Hamiltonian in a given Krylov subspace requires the same quantum resources in both the single step and sequential cases. We propose a variance-based criterion for determining a good iterative sequence and provide numerical evidence that these good sequences display improved numerical stability over a single step in the presence of finite sampling noise. Implementing the generalisation requires additional classical processing with a polynomial overhead in the subspace dimension. By exchanging quantum circuit depth for additional measurements the quantum subspace expansion algorithm appears to be an approach suited to near term or early error-corrected quantum hardware. Our work suggests that the numerical instability limiting the accuracy of this approach can be substantially alleviated beyond the current state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a closure model for computational fluid dynamics, referred to as the Building-block Flow Model (BFM). The foundation of the model rests on the premise that a finite collection of simple flows encapsulates the essential physics necessary to predict more complex scenarios. The BFM is implemented using artificial neural networks and introduces five unique advancements within the framework of large-eddy simulation: (1) It is designed to predict multiple flow regimes (wall turbulence under zero, favorable, adverse mean-pressure-gradient, and separation); (2) It unifies the closure model at solid boundaries (i.e., the wall model) and the rest of the flow (i.e., the subgrid-scale model) into a single entity; (3) It ensures consistency with numerical schemes and gridding strategy by accounting for numerical errors; (4) It is directly applicable to arbitrary complex geometries; (5) It can be scaled up to model additional flow physics in the future if needed (e.g., shockwaves and laminar-to-turbulent transition). The BFM is utilized to predict key quantities of interest in turbulent channel flows, a Gaussian bump, and an aircraft in a landing configuration. In all cases, the BFM demonstrates similar or superior capabilities in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to previous state-of-the-art closure models.</description>

      <title>Temperature and Tautomeric Effects in High-Resolution Oxygen 1s X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Purines and Pyrimidines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purines and pyrimidines, crucial building blocks in biological systems, have attracted significant interest across molecular physics, biochemistry, pharmacology, and chemistry. Extensive spectroscopies have been employed for characterization, while the temperature and potential tautomeric effects can complicate the interpretation of underlying physics and chemistry. Here, we conducted first-principles simulations to analyze the vibrationally-resolved O1s X-ray photoelectron spectra of 6 common biomolecules at different temperatures, comprising 3 purine (xanthine, caffeine, and hypoxanthine) and 3 pyrimidine (thymine, 5F-uracil, and uracil) derivatives, and the tautomeric effect of hypoxanthine at varying temperatures. Using both time-independent (TI) and time-dependent (TD) methods under the Franck-Condon approximation, we obtained theoretical spectra that exhibited excellent agreement with experiments. Our analysis of these systems, all featuring carbonyl oxygens, unveiled distinctive characteristics of oxygen in N-CO-N (O2) compared to that within a N-CO-C structure (O1), showcasing higher O1s binding energy and total vibrational reorganization energy. We observed small differences in the zero-point vibration energies between the core-ionized and ground states, indicating a weak Duschinsky rotation effect. We consistently found that O1s ionization resulted in elongation of the O*=C bond length. The TI method facilitated the assignment of experimental spectra to different atoms or tautomers, where the atom-specific vibronic profiles of all 6 molecules exhibited similarity, with the 0-2 transitions dominating. TD enabled a more comprehensive exploration of the temperature effect, and the tautomeric effect of hypoxanthine by incorporating the Boltzmann population ratios of tautomers. We observed significant temperature dependence in the vibronic features present in these spectra.</description>

      <title>Effects of Structural Variations to X-ray Absorption Spectra of g-C$_3$N$_4$: Insights from DFT and TDDFT Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely employed for structure characterization of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C$_3$N$_4$) and its composites. Nevertheless, even for pure g-C$_3$N$_4$, discrepancies in energy and profile exist across different experiments, which can be attributed to variations in structures arising from diverse synthesis conditions and calibration procedures. Here, we conducted a theoretical investigation on XAS of three representative g-C$_3$N$_4$ structures (planar, corrugated, and micro-corrugated) optimized with different strategies, to understand the structure-spectroscopy relation. Different methods were compared, including density functional theory (DFT) with the full (FCH) or equivalent (ECH) core-hole approximation, as well as the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). FCH was responsible for getting accurate absolute absorption energy; while ECH and TDDFT aided in interpreting the spectra, through ECH-state canonical molecular orbitals (ECH-CMOs) and natural transition orbitals (NTOs), respectively. With each method, the spectra at the three structures show evident differences, which can be correlated to different individual experiments or in between. Our calculations explained the structural reason behind the spectral discrepancies among different experiments. Moreover, profiles predicted by these methods also displayed consistency, so their differences can be used as a reliable indicator of their accuracy. Both ECH-CMOs and NTO particle orbitals led to similar graphics, validating their applicability in interpreting the transitions. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the structure-XAS relation for g-C$_3$N$_4$, provides concrete explanations for the spectral differences reported in various experiments, and offers insight for future structure dynamical and transient X-ray spectral analyses.</description>

      <title>An FFT based approach to account for elastic interactions in OkMC: Application to dislocation loops in iron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object kinetic Montecarlo (OkMC) is a fundamental tool for modeling defect evolution in volumes and times far beyond atomistic models. The elastic interaction between defects is classically considered using a dipolar approximation but this approach is limited to simple cases and can be inaccurate for large and close interacting defects. In this work a novel framework is proposed to include "exact" elastic interactions between defects in OkMC valid for any type of defect and anisotropic media. In this method, the elastic interaction energy of a defect is computed by volume integration of its elastic strain multiplied by the stress created by all the other defects, being both fields obtained numerically using a FFT solver. The resulting interaction energies reproduce analytical elastic solutions and show the limited accuracy of dipole approaches for close and large defects.
  The OkMC framework proposed is used to simulate the evolution in space and time of self-interstitial atoms and dislocation loops in iron. It is found that including the anisotropy has a quantitative effect in the evolution of all the type of defects studied. Regarding dislocation loops, it is observed that using the "exact" interaction energy result in higher interactions than using the dipole approximation for close loops.</description>

      <title>A simple reconstruction method to infer nonreciprocal interactions and local driving in complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-based inference of directed interactions in complex dynamical systems is a problem common to many disciplines of science. In this work, we study networks of spatially separate dynamical entities, which could represent physical systems that interact with each other by reciprocal or nonreciprocal, instantaneous or time-delayed interactions. We present a simple approach that combines Markov state models with directed information-theoretical measures for causal inference that can accurately infer the underlying interactions from noisy time series of the dynamical system states alone. Remarkably, this is possible despite the built-in simplification of a Markov assumption and the choice of a very coarse discretization at the level of probability estimation. Our test systems are an Ising chain with nonreciprocal coupling imposed by local driving of a single spin, and a system of delay-coupled linear stochastic processes. Stepping away from physical systems, the approach infers cause-effect relationships, or more generally, the direction of mutual or one-way influence. The presented method is agnostic to the number of interacting entities and details of the dynamics, so that it is widely applicable to problems in various fields.</description>

      <title>Noise-aware neural network for stochastic dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of system-environment coupling, classical complex systems undergo stochastic dynamics, where rich phenomena can emerge at large spatio-temporal scales. To investigate these phenomena, numerical approaches for simulating stochastic dynamics are indispensable and can be computationally expensive. In light of the recent fast development in machine learning techniques, here, we establish a generic machine learning approach to simulate the stochastic dynamics, dubbed the noise-aware neural network (NANN). One key feature of this approach is its ability to generate the long-time stochastic dynamics of complex large-scale systems by just training NANN with the one-step dynamics of smaller-scale systems, thus reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, this NANN based approach is quite generic. Case-by-case special design of the architecture of NANN is not necessary when it is employed to investigate different stochastic complex systems. Using the noisy Kuramoto model and the Vicsek model as concrete examples, we demonstrate its capability in simulating stochastic dynamics. We believe that this novel machine learning approach can be a useful tool in investigating the large spatio-temporal scaling behavior of complex systems subjected to the influences of the environmental noise.</description>

      <title>A general-purpose neural network potential for Ti-Al-Nb alloys towards large-scale molecular dynamics with ab initio accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High Nb-containing TiAl alloys exhibit exceptional high-temperature strength and room-temperature ductility, making them widely used in hot-section components of automotive and aerospace engines. However, the lack of accurate interatomic interaction potentials for large-scale modeling severely hampers a comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanism of Ti-Al-Nb alloys and the development of strategies to enhance the mechanical properties. Here, we develop a general-purpose machine-learned potential (MLP) for the Ti-Al-Nb ternary system by combining the neural evolution potentials framework with an active learning scheme. The developed MLP, trained on extensive first-principles datasets, demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting various lattice and defect properties, as well as high-temperature characteristics such as thermal expansion and melting point for TiAl systems. Notably, this potential can effectively describe the key effect of Nb doping on stacking fault energies and formation energies. Of practical importance is that our MLP enables large-scale molecular dynamics simulations involving tens of millions of atoms with ab initio accuracy, achieving an outstanding balance between computational speed and accuracy. These results pave the way for studying micro-mechanical behaviors in TiAl lamellar structures and developing high-performance TiAl alloys towards applications at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Denoising to Non-Equilibrium Structures Improves Equivariant Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions of atoms such as forces in 3D atomistic systems is fundamental to many applications like molecular dynamics and catalyst design. However, simulating these interactions requires compute-intensive ab initio calculations and thus results in limited data for training neural networks. In this paper, we propose to use denoising non-equilibrium structures (DeNS) as an auxiliary task to better leverage training data and improve performance. For training with DeNS, we first corrupt a 3D structure by adding noise to its 3D coordinates and then predict the noise. Different from previous works on denoising, which are limited to equilibrium structures, the proposed method generalizes denoising to a much larger set of non-equilibrium structures. The main difference is that a non-equilibrium structure does not correspond to local energy minima and has non-zero forces, and therefore it can have many possible atomic positions compared to an equilibrium structure. This makes denoising non-equilibrium structures an ill-posed problem since the target of denoising is not uniquely defined. Our key insight is to additionally encode the forces of the original non-equilibrium structure to specify which non-equilibrium structure we are denoising. Concretely, given a corrupted non-equilibrium structure and the forces of the original one, we predict the non-equilibrium structure satisfying the input forces instead of any arbitrary structures. Since DeNS requires encoding forces, DeNS favors equivariant networks, which can easily incorporate forces and other higher-order tensors in node embeddings. We study the effectiveness of training equivariant networks with DeNS on OC20, OC22 and MD17 datasets and demonstrate that DeNS can achieve new state-of-the-art results on OC20 and OC22 and significantly improve training efficiency on MD17.</description>

      <title>Strain-driven phonon topological phase transition impedes thermal transport in titanium monoxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological phonon states in crystalline materials have attracted significant research interests due to their importance for fundamental physical phenomena, yet their implication on phonon thermal transport remains largely unexplored. Here, we use density functional theory calculations and symmetry analyses to explore topological phonon phase transitions under uniaxial strains and their tuning effects on thermal transport in titanium monoxide (TiO). Our calculation shows that application of 10% tension significantly diminishes lattice thermal conductivity of TiO by 77% and 66% along the a and c axes, respectively, at room temperature. This suppression is found to result largely from the breaking of symmetry protected degeneracy of acoustic branches, which induces a substantial enhancement of phonon scattering phase space due to the easier fulfillment of scattering selection rules. Our study provides evidence for the importance of phononic band topology in modulating thermal conductivity and offers a promising route towards controlling solid-state heat transport.</description>

      <title>Zero Coordinate Shift: Whetted Automatic Differentiation for Physics-informed Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a critical step in physics-informed machine learning, required for computing the high-order derivatives of network output w.r.t. coordinates of collocation points. In this paper, we present a novel and lightweight algorithm to conduct AD for physics-informed operator learning, which we call the trick of Zero Coordinate Shift (ZCS). Instead of making all sampled coordinates as leaf variables, ZCS introduces only one scalar-valued leaf variable for each spatial or temporal dimension, simplifying the wanted derivatives from "many-roots-many-leaves" to "one-root-many-leaves" whereby reverse-mode AD becomes directly utilisable. It has led to an outstanding performance leap by avoiding the duplication of the computational graph along the dimension of functions (physical parameters). ZCS is easy to implement with current deep learning libraries; our own implementation is achieved by extending the DeepXDE package. We carry out a comprehensive benchmark analysis and several case studies, training physics-informed DeepONets to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) without data. The results show that ZCS has persistently reduced GPU memory consumption and wall time for training by an order of magnitude, and such reduction factor scales with the number of functions. As a low-level optimisation technique, ZCS imposes no restrictions on data, physics (PDE) or network architecture and does not compromise training results from any aspect.</description>

Abstract: Directional wavelet dictionaries are hierarchical representations which efficiently capture and segment information across scale, location and orientation. Such representations demonstrate a particular affinity to physical signals, which often exhibit highly anisotropic, localised multiscale structure. Many physically important signals are observed over spherical domains, such as the celestial sky in cosmology. Leveraging recent advances in computational harmonic analysis, we design new highly distributable and automatically differentiable directional wavelet transforms on the $2$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ and $3$-dimensional ball $\mathbb{B}^3 = \mathbb{R}^+ \times \mathbb{S}^2$ (the space formed by augmenting the sphere with the radial half-line). We observe up to a $300$-fold and $21800$-fold acceleration for signals on the sphere and ball, respectively, compared to existing software, whilst maintaining 64-bit machine precision. Not only do these algorithms dramatically accelerate existing spherical wavelet transforms, the gradient information afforded by automatic differentiation unlocks many data-driven analysis techniques previously not possible for these spaces. We publicly release both S2WAV and S2BALL, open-sourced JAX libraries for our transforms that are automatically differentiable and readily deployable both on and over clusters of hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs &amp; TPUs).</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Symmetry-Protected Topological Matter on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control of topological edge modes is desirable for encoding quantum information resiliently against external noise. Their implementation on quantum hardware, however, remains a long-standing problem due to current limitations of circuit depth and noise, which grows with the number of time steps. By utilizing recently developed constant-depth quantum circuits in which the circuit depth is independent of time, we demonstrate successful long-time dynamics simulation of bulk and surface modes in topological insulators on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, which exhibits robust signatures of localized topological modes. We further identify a class of one-dimensional topological Hamiltonians that can be readily simulated with NISQ hardware. Our results provide a pathway towards stable long-time implementation of interacting many-body systems on present day quantum processors.</description>
