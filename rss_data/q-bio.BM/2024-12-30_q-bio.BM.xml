      <title>Biology Instructions: A Dataset and Benchmark for Multi-Omics Sequence Understanding Capability of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have already demonstrated their formidable capabilities in general domains, ushering in a revolutionary transformation. However, exploring and exploiting the extensive knowledge of these models to comprehend multi-omics biology remains underexplored. To fill this research gap, we first introduce Biology-Instructions, the first large-scale multi-omics biological sequences-related instruction-tuning dataset including DNA, RNA, proteins, and multi-molecules, designed to bridge the gap between large language models (LLMs) and complex biological sequences-related tasks. This dataset can enhance the versatility of LLMs by integrating diverse biological sequenced-based prediction tasks with advanced reasoning capabilities, while maintaining conversational fluency. Additionally, we reveal significant performance limitations in even state-of-the-art LLMs on biological sequence-related multi-omics tasks without specialized pre-training and instruction-tuning. We further develop a strong baseline called ChatMultiOmics with a novel three-stage training pipeline, demonstrating the powerful ability to understand biology by using Biology-Instructions. Biology-Instructions and ChatMultiOmics are publicly available and crucial resources for enabling more effective integration of LLMs with multi-omics sequence analysis.</description>

      <title>ViDTA: Enhanced Drug-Target Affinity Prediction via Virtual Graph Nodes and Attention-based Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-target interaction is fundamental in understanding how drugs affect biological systems, and accurately predicting drug-target affinity (DTA) is vital for drug discovery. Recently, deep learning methods have emerged as a significant approach for estimating the binding strength between drugs and target proteins. However, existing methods simply utilize the drug's local information from molecular topology rather than global information. Additionally, the features of drugs and proteins are usually fused with a simple concatenation operation, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we proposed ViDTA, an enhanced DTA prediction framework. We introduce virtual nodes into the Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based drug feature extraction network, which acts as a global memory to exchange messages more efficiently. By incorporating virtual graph nodes, we seamlessly integrate local and global features of drug molecular structures, expanding the GNN's receptive field. Additionally, we propose an attention-based linear feature fusion network for better capturing the interaction information between drugs and proteins. Experimental results evaluated on various benchmarks including Davis, Metz, and KIBA demonstrate that our proposed ViDTA outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>DiffPaSS -- High-performance differentiable pairing of protein sequences using soft scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying interacting partners from two sets of protein sequences has important applications in computational biology. Interacting partners share similarities across species due to their common evolutionary history, and feature correlations in amino acid usage due to the need to maintain complementary interaction interfaces. Thus, the problem of finding interacting pairs can be formulated as searching for a pairing of sequences that maximizes a sequence similarity or a coevolution score. Several methods have been developed to address this problem, applying different approximate optimization methods to different scores. We introduce DiffPaSS, a differentiable framework for flexible, fast, and hyperparameter-free optimization for pairing interacting biological sequences, which can be applied to a wide variety of scores. We apply it to a benchmark prokaryotic dataset, using mutual information and neighbor graph alignment scores. DiffPaSS outperforms existing algorithms for optimizing the same scores. We demonstrate the usefulness of our paired alignments for the prediction of protein complex structure. DiffPaSS does not require sequences to be aligned, and we also apply it to non-aligned sequences from T cell receptors.</description>

      <title>Impact of phylogeny on the inference of functional sectors from protein sequence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical analysis of multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins has revealed groups of coevolving amino acids called sectors. These groups of amino-acid sites feature collective correlations in their amino-acid usage, and they are associated to functional properties. Modeling showed that nonlinear selection on an additive functional trait of a protein is generically expected to give rise to a functional sector. These modeling results motivated a principled method, called ICOD, which is designed to identify functional sectors, as well as mutational effects, from sequence data. However, a challenge for all methods aiming to identify sectors from multiple sequence alignments is that correlations in amino-acid usage can also arise from the mere fact that homologous sequences share common ancestry, i.e. from phylogeny. Here, we generate controlled synthetic data from a minimal model comprising both phylogeny and functional sectors. We use this data to dissect the impact of phylogeny on sector identification and on mutational effect inference by different methods. We find that ICOD is most robust to phylogeny, but that conservation is also quite robust. Next, we consider natural multiple sequence alignments of protein families for which deep mutational scan experimental data is available. We show that in this natural data, conservation and ICOD best identify sites with strong functional roles, in agreement with our results on synthetic data. Importantly, these two methods have different premises, since they respectively focus on conservation and on correlations. Thus, their joint use can reveal complementary information.</description>
