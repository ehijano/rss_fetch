      <title>Optomagnetic forces on YIG/YFeO3 microspheres levitated in chiral hollow-core photonic crystal fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a magnetooptomechanical system consisting of a single magnetic microparticle optically levitated within the core of a helically twisted single-ring hollow-core photonic crystal fibre. We use newly-developed magnetic particles that have a core of antiferromagnetic yttrium-ortho-ferrite (YFeO3) and a shell of ferrimagnetic YIG (Y3Fe5O12) approximately 50 nm thick. Using a 632.8 nm probe beam, we observe optical-torque-induced rotation of the particle and rotation of the magnetization vector in presence of an external static magnetic field. This one-of-a-kind platform opens a path to novel investigations of optomagnetic physics with levitated magnetic particles.</description>

      <title>Rapid-scanned and self-corrected repetition rates enabled in a bidirectional polarization-multiplexed fiber laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repetition-rate-scanned lasers are practical in accordion frequency comb generation that serves as a variable gearbox connecting optical and radio wave domains. Rapid and wide-range scanned repetition rate can benefit versatile purposes, however scanning robustness remains unsecured that typically requires complicated feedback loops. Recently, multiplexed lasers have been demonstrated with the nature of common-noise rejection among simultaneously emitted combs. Here, we propose a bidirectional polarization-multiplexed fiber laser that delivers synchronized pulses with rapid-scanned and reference-free repetition rates. Benefiting from the all polarization-maintaining fiber configuration, the laser shows good robustness and inter-comb coherence. As rapid as 493.5 kHz/s scanning rate over 329-kHz scanning range of fundamental repetition rate is realized. The 1-hour and 1-day maximal variations of difference frequency are merely 0.52 Hz and 5.46 Hz. The capability to rebuilt steady state after mode hopping is also demonstrated. These results provide a promising solution for developing high-performance accordion-frequency laser sources.</description>

      <title>Generation of multiple bound states in the continuum through doubly degenerate quasi-guided modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed theoretical analysis of a peculiar generation of multiple bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two-dimensional periodic arrays of dielectric spheres. They emerge in high-symmetry lattices with the $C_{6v}$ and $C_{4v}$ point groups and involve doubly degenerate quasi-guided modes at the $\Gamma$ point that can couple to external radiation. By tuning a system parameter, the doubly degenerate modes can exhibit accidental BICs at a critical parameter. In the vicinity of the critical parameter, the two bands originating from the degenerate mode exhibit multiple off-$\Gamma$ BICs. They move and annihilate across the two bands by changing the parameter around the critical one. A ring-like high $Q$ channel pinned with multiple BICs emerges particularly for the $C_{6v}$ case. Across the critical coupling, the total vorticity of the multiple BICs is conserved. The $\vb*{k}\cdot\vb*{p}$ perturbation theory explains some features of the phenomena reasonably well.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Voltage-controlled Oscillator from a Kerr-Induced Synchronized Soliton Microcomb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of controlled and arbitrarily tunable terahertz radiation, essential for many applications, has proven challenging due to the complexity of experimental setups and fabrication techniques. We introduce a new strategy involving control over a terahertz repetition rate integrated frequency comb, using Kerr-induced synchronization, that results in a terahertz-voltage-controlled oscillator. By modulating the reference laser, we can transfer any microwave waveform onto the microcomb repetition rate via a linear transfer function based on optical frequency division. The resulting frequency comb with a terahertz carrier can be created using integrated components, with a bandwidth constrained only by the synchronization bandwidth and high coherence resulting from the low-noise soliton microcomb in the Kerr-induced synchronized state.</description>

      <title>Application of RESNET50 Convolution Neural Network for the Extraction of Optical Parameters in Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimation of the optical properties of scattering media such as tissue is important in diagnostics as well as in the development of techniques to image deeper. As light penetrates the sample scattering events occur that alter the propagation direction of the photons in a random manner leading degradation of image quality. The distribution of the scattered light does, however, give a measure of the optical properties such as the reduced scattering coefficient and the absorption coefficient. Unfortunately, inverting scattering patterns to recover the optical properties is not simple, especially in the regime where the light is partially randomized. Machine learning has been proposed by several authors as a means of recovering these properties from either the back scattered or the transmitted light. In the present paper, we train a general purpose convolutional neural network RESNET 50 with simulated data based on Monte Carlo simulations. We show that compared with previous work our approach gives comparable or better reconstruction accuracy with training on a much smaller dataset. Moreover, by training on multiple parameters such as the intensity distribution at multiple planes or the exit angle and spatial distribution one achieves improved performance compared to training on a single input such as the intensity distribution captured at the sample surface. While our approach gives good parameter reconstruction, we identify factors that limit the accuracy of the recovered properties, particularly the absorption coefficient. In the light of these limitations, we suggest how the present approach may be enhanced for even better performance.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking and Spatiotemporal Pattern Formation in Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the dynamics of time varying photonic media with an optical Kerr nonlinearity and an associated phase transition. The interplay between a periodically modulated permittivity and the nonlinearity induces a continuous transition of electromagnetic waves to a state with broken spatial and time translation symmetries. This transition gives rise to a lattice-like wave pattern, in many ways similar to a spatial crystallization in solids. Symmetry breaking triggers the emergence of soft, Goldstone-like modes, which propagate as deformations of the lattice structure, as well as massive Higgs-like modes - spatially uniform oscillations of the field amplitude. We extend the analysis of the non-equlibrium symmetry breaking to 2+1 dimensional time varying media and discuss pattern formation as well as the connection to discrete time crystals.</description>

      <title>Pocket Schlieren: a background oriented schlieren imaging platform on a smartphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background-oriented schlieren (BOS) is a powerful technique for flow visualization. Nevertheless, the widespread dissemination of BOS is impeded by its dependence on scientific cameras, computing hardware, and dedicated analysis software. In this work, we aim to democratize BOS by providing a smartphone based scientific tool called "Pocket Schlieren". Pocket Schlieren enables users to directly capture, process, and visualize flow phenomena on their smartphones. The underlying algorithm incorporates consecutive frame subtraction (CFS) and optical flow (OF) techniques to compute the density gradients inside a flow. It performs on both engineered and natural background patterns. Using Pocket Schlieren, we successfully visualized the flow produced from a burning candle flame, butane lighter, hot soldering iron, room heater, water immersion heating rod, and a large outdoor butane flame. Pocket Schlieren promises to serve as a frugal yet potent instrument for scientific and educational purposes. We have made it publicly available at doi: 10.5281/zenodo.10949271.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometers are some of the most important optical devices, yet their spin wave based analogues so far received limited attention. In this work we demonstrate how one can design Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) operating on spin waves, and use to construct a spin wave version of a well known1 MZI based AI computing device. Modeling, performed both micromagnetically and by using a novel, finite difference based method, shows that some of the achievable operational parameters are orders of magnitude superior to both optical and CMOS based implementations.</description>

      <title>Laser Laboratory Beam Alignment Skills: Course Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of tutorials, assessments, and instructor guides are presented as a complete package for an upper-level undergraduate, or lower-level graduate, laboratory-based course, or extended new-student seminar. The purpose of this package is to teach the students essential skills beneficial for working in an experimental optical laboratory by introducing them to fundamental laboratory skills, and advanced optical alignment techniques. It is assumed that the students do not have any prior optical laboratory training or experience and the tutorials are written using detailed step-by-step instructions for the students to follow independently without the need for continual instructor guidance. The tutorials are intended to establish a common fundamental knowledge base and set of optical alignment skills within the group of students taking the course. Two examples of the target student groups for this package are: (1) an upper-level undergraduate optics course with a laboratory component (i.e., an undergraduate institution similar to Cal Poly), or (2) a cohort of new graduate students to an experimental optical program whose undergraduate backgrounds can span anything from no experimental optical experience to extensive experimental optical experience (i.e., an experimental R1 doctoral university similar to the Institut f\"ur Angewandte Physik at the Universit\"at Bonn). The accompanying assessments and instructor guides for each tutorial are provided in this package for the convenience of the course instructor(s) to use in the course as-is, or to use for their own reference of what skills to assess and how to tell if the student did the tasks correctly.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity in laser ultrasound revisited: Is wavefield characterisation by scanning laser excitation strictly reciprocal to that by scanning laser detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The common believe about strict measurement reciprocity between scanning laser detection and scanning laser excitation is disproved by a simple experiment. Nevertheless, a deeper study based on the reciprocity relation reveals correct reciprocal measurement set-ups for both the probe-excitation / laser-detection and the laser-excitation / probe-detection case. Similarly, the all-laser measurement, that is thermoelastic laser excitation with laser vibrometer detection, is not in general reciprocal with respect to the exchange of excitation and detection positions. Again, a substitute for the laser doppler vibrometer out-of-plane displacement measurement was found which ensures measurement reciprocity together with laser excitation. The apparent confusion in literature about strict validity/non-validity of measurement reciprocity is mitigated by classifying the measurement situations systematically.</description>

      <title>Counterfactuality, back-action, and information gain in multi-path interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of an absorber in one of the paths of an interferometer changes the output statistics of that interferometer in a fundamental manner. Since the individual quantum particles detected at any of the outputs of the interferometer have not been absorbed, any non-trivial effect of the absorber on the distribution of these particles over these paths is a counterfactual effect. Here, we quantify counterfactual effects by evaluating the information about the presence or absence of the absorber obtained from the output statistics, distinguishing between classical and quantum counterfactual effects. We identify the counterfactual gain which quantifies the advantage of quantum counterfactual protocols over classical counterfactual protocols, and show that this counterfactual gain can be separated into two terms: a semi-classical term related to the amplitude blocked by the absorber, and a Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability assigning a joint probability to the blocked path and the output port. A negative Kirkwood-Dirac term between a path and an output port indicates that inserting the absorber into that path will have a focussing effect, increasing the probability of particles arriving at that output port, resulting in a significant enhancement of the counterfactual gain. We show that the magnitude of quantum counterfactual effects cannot be explained by a simple removal of the absorbed particles, but originates instead from a well-defined back-action effect caused by the presence of the absorber in one path, on particles in other paths.</description>

      <title>Rational Designing of Anthocyanidins-Directed Near-Infrared Two-Photon Fluorescence Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, two-photon fluorescent probes based on anthocyanidins molecules have attracted extensive attention due to their outstanding photophysical properties. However, there are only a few two-photon excited fluorescent probes that really meet the requirements of relatively long emission wavelengths (&gt;600 nm), large two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections (300 GM), significant Stokes shift (&gt;80 nm), and high fluorescence intensity. Herein, the photophysical properties of a series of anthocyanidins with the same substituents but different fluorophore skeletons were investigated in detail. Compared with b-series molecules, a-series molecules with a six-membered ring in the backbone have a slightly higher reorganization energy. This results in more energy loss upon light excitation, enabling the reaction products to detect NTR through a larger Stokes shift. More importantly, there is very little decrease in fluorescence intensity as the Stokes shift increases. These features are extremely valuable for high-resolution NTR detection. In light of this, novel 2a-n (n=1-5) compounds are designed, which are accomplished by inhibiting the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effect through alkyl cyclization, azetidine ring and extending {\pi} conjugation. Among them, 2a-3 gains long emission spectrum ({\lambda}em=691.42 nm), noticeable TPA cross section (957.36 GM), and large Stokes shift (110.88 nm), indicating that it serves as a promising candidate for two-photon fluorescent dyes. It is hoped that this work will offer some insightful theoretical direction for the development of novel high performance anthocyanin fluorescent materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of the lasing action observed on the 1S0--3P1 intercombination transition of ytterbium atoms that are laser-cooled and -trapped inside a high-finesse cavity. The dressing of the atomic states on the 1S0--1P1 transition by the magneto-optical trap (MOT) laser light allows the coupled atom-cavity system to lase, via a two-photon transition, on the same line on which it is pumped. The observation and basic description of this phenomenon was presented earlier by Gothe et al. [Phys. Rev. A 99, 013415 (2019)]. In the current work, we focus on a detailed analysis of the lasing threshold and frequency properties and perform a comparison to our theoretical models.</description>

      <title>A Polychromatic Theory of Emission</title>

Abstract: The control of thermal radiation by means of micro-structured materials is an active area of research with applications such as thermophotovoltaics and radiative cooling. The original theories of thermal radiation were derived for electromagnetically large objects, and predict unpolarized, omnidirectional, and uncorrelated radiation. Microstructures, however, exhibit thermal emissions that can be polarized, highly directional, and spatially and temporally correlated. The original theories are also restricted to thermal equilibrium situations and do not apply to steady-state emissions of electromagnetically small objects under a stationary illumination. In here, we establish a polychromatic framework to predict thermal radiation in the stationary regime, which includes thermal equilibrium. After identifying an object--adapted set of independent polychromatic absorption modes, we assume that the emission also occurs independently through the outgoing versions of each polychromatic mode. Energy conservation leads then to a Kirchhoff-like law for each polychromatic mode. The salient properties of the polychromatic theory are: Emission in frequencies that are absent in the illumination, change in the number of photons, and applicability to both thermal radiation and luminescence upon illumination with a continuous wave laser, as long as the emitted power depends linearly on the input intensity. These properties are independent of the chosen set of polychromatic modes. In this work, we chose the absorption modes derived from the scattering operator of a given object, and use the T-matrix formalism for computations, which applies to general objects, including microscopic ones. Some counter-intuitive results motivate the future search for a different set of modes.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional Ray Polaritons in Twisted Asymmetric Stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of a vast repository of van der Waals (vdW) materials supporting polaritons - light coupled to matter excitations - offers a plethora of different possibilities to tailor electromagnetic waves at the subwavelength-scale. In particular, the development of twistoptics - the study of the optical properties of twisted stacks of vdW materials - allows the directional propagation of phonon polaritons (PhPs) along a single spatial direction, which has been coined as canalization. Here we demonstrate a complementary type of nanoscale unidirectional propagation that naturally emerges thanks to twistoptics: unidirectional ray polaritons (URPs). This natural phenomenon arises in two types of twisted hyperbolic stacks: homostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, each with very different thicknesses of its constituents. URPs are characterized by the absence of diffraction and the presence of a single phase of the propagating field. Importantly, we demonstrate that this ray behavior can be tuned by means of both relative twist angle and illumination frequency variations. Additionally, an unprecedented "pinwheel-like" propagation emerges at specific twist angles of the homostructure. We show that URPs emerge due to the twist between asymmetrically stacked biaxial slabs, while the shear effect in monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is of minor importance. Our findings demonstrate a natural way to excite unidirectional ray-like PhPs and offer a unique platform for controlling the propagation of PhPs at the nanoscale with many potential applications like nanoimaging, (bio)-sensing or polaritonic thermal management.</description>

      <title>Amoeba Formulation of Non-Bloch Band Theory in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect dramatically reshapes the energy bands of non-Hermitian systems, meaning that the usual Bloch band theory is fundamentally inadequate as their characterization. The non-Bloch band theory, in which the concept of Brillouin zone is generalized, has been widely applied to investigate non-Hermitian systems in one spatial dimension. However, its generalization to higher dimensions has been challenging. Here, we develop a formulation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary spatial dimensions, which is based on a natural geometrical object known as the amoeba. Our theory provides a general framework for studying non-Hermitian bands beyond one dimension. Key quantities of non-Hermitian bands, including the energy spectrum, eigenstates profiles, and the generalized Brillouin zone, can be efficiently obtained from this approach.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-based neural representations for computational adaptive optics in widefield microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widefield microscopy is widely used for non-invasive imaging of biological structures at subcellular resolution. When applied to complex specimen, its image quality is degraded by sample-induced optical aberration. Adaptive optics can correct wavefront distortion and restore diffraction-limited resolution but require wavefront sensing and corrective devices, increasing system complexity and cost. Here, we describe a self-supervised machine learning algorithm, CoCoA, that performs joint wavefront estimation and three-dimensional structural information extraction from a single input 3D image stack without the need for external training dataset. We implemented CoCoA for widefield imaging of mouse brain tissues and validated its performance with direct-wavefront-sensing-based adaptive optics. Importantly, we systematically explored and quantitatively characterized the limiting factors of CoCoA's performance. Using CoCoA, we demonstrated the first in vivo widefield mouse brain imaging using machine-learning-based adaptive optics. Incorporating coordinate-based neural representations and a forward physics model, the self-supervised scheme of CoCoA should be applicable to microscopy modalities in general.</description>
