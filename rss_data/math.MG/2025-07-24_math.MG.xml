      <title>Regularity of Resolutions and Limits of Manifolds with a Uniform Contractibility Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a short and self-contained proof to a 1991 conjecture by Moore concerning the structure of certain finite-dimensional Gromov--Hausdorff limits, in the ANR setting. As a consequence, one easily characterizes finite dimensional limits of PL-able or Riemannian $n$-manifolds with a uniform contractibility function. For example, one can define for any compact connected metric space that is a resolvable ANR homology manifold of covering dimension at least 5, an obstruction, which vanishes if and only if the homology manifold can be approximated in the Gromov--Hausdorff sense by PL-manifolds of the same dimension and with a uniform contractibility function. Further, it provides short proofs to certain well known results by reducing them to problems in Bing topology. We also give another proof using more classical arguments that yield more structural information. We give several applications to the theory of homology manifolds, Alexandrov spaces, Wasserstein spaces and a generalized form of the diffeomorphism stability conjecture.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal $t$-design curves on $S^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $\textit{spherical $t$-design curve}$ was defined by Ehler and Gr\"{o}chenig to be a continuous, piecewise smooth, closed curve on the sphere with finitely many self-intersections whose associated line integral applied to any polynomial of degree at most $t$ evaluates to the average of this polynomial on the sphere. These authors posed the problem of proving that there exist sequences $(\gamma_t)_{t=0}^\infty$ of $t$-design curves on $S^d$ of asymptotically optimal length $\ell(\gamma_t)\asymp t^{d-1}$ as $t\to\infty$ and solved this problem for $d=2$. This work solves the problem for $d=3$ by proving that there exists a constant $\mathscr C&gt;0$ such that for any $C\geq\mathscr C$ and $t\in\Bbb N_+$, there exists a simple $t$-design curve on $S^3$ of length $Ct^2$.</description>

      <title>Borsuk and V\'azsonyi problems through Reuleaux polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Borsuk conjecture and the V\'azsonyi problem are two attractive and famous questions in discrete and combinatorial geometry, both based on the notion of diameter of a bounded sets. In this paper, we present an equivalence between the critical sets with Borsuk number 4 in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and the minimal structures for the V\'azsonyi problem by using the well-known Reuleaux polyhedra. The latter lead to a full characterization of all finite sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with Borsuk number 4.
  The proof of such equivalence needs various ingredients, in particular, we proved a conjecture dealing with strongly critical configuration for the V\'azsonyi problem and showed that the diameter graph arising from involutive polyhedra is vertex (and edge) 4-critical.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Identification of Lattice Quantizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01799v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattices with minimal normalized second moments are designed using a new numerical optimization algorithm. Starting from a random lower-triangular generator matrix and applying stochastic gradient descent, all elements are updated towards the negative gradient, which makes it the most efficient algorithm proposed so far for this purpose. A graphical illustration of the theta series, called theta image, is introduced and shown to be a powerful tool for converting numerical lattice representations into their underlying exact forms. As a proof of concept, optimized lattices are designed in dimensions up to 16. In all dimensions, the algorithm converges to either the previously best known lattice or a better one. The dual of the 15-dimensional laminated lattice is conjectured to be optimal in its dimension and its exact normalized second moment is computed.</description>
