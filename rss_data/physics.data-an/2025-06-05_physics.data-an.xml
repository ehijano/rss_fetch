      <title>Physics and Computing Performance of the EggNet Tracking Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle track reconstruction is traditionally computationally challenging due to the combinatorial nature of the tracking algorithms employed. Recent developments have focused on novel algorithms with graph neural networks (GNNs), which can improve scalability. While most of these GNN-based methods require an input graph to be constructed before performing message passing, a one-shot approach called EggNet that directly takes detector spacepoints as inputs and iteratively apply graph attention networks with an evolving graph structure has been proposed. The graphs are gradually updated to improve the edge efficiency and purity, thus providing a better model performance. In this work, we evaluate the physics and computing performance of the EggNet tracking pipeline on the full TrackML dataset. We also explore different techniques to reduce constraints on computation memory and computing time.</description>

      <title>Extremely large oblate deformation of the first excited state in $^{12}$C: a new challenge to modern nuclear theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Coulomb-excitation study of the high-lying first excited state at 4.439 MeV in the nucleus $^{12}$C has been carried out using the $^{208}$Pb($^{12}$C,$^{12}$C$^*$)$^{208}$Pb$^*$ reaction at 56 MeV and the {\sc Q3D} magnetic spectrograph at the Maier-Leibnitz Laboratorium in Munich. High-statistics achieved with an average beam intensity of approximately 10$^{11}$ ions/s together with state-of-the-art {\it ab initio} calculations of the nuclear dipole polarizability permitted the accurate determination of the spectroscopic quadrupole moment, $Q_{_S}(2_{_1}^+) = +0.076(30)$~eb, in agreement with previous measurements. Combined with previous work, a weighted average of $Q_{_S}(2_{_1}^+) = +0.090(14)$ eb is determined, which includes the re-analysis of a similar experiment by Vermeer and collaborators, $Q_{_S}(2_{_1}^+) = +0.103(20)$~eb. Such a large oblate deformation challenges modern nuclear theory and emphasizes the need of $\alpha$ clustering and associated triaxiality effects for full convergence of $E2$ collective properties.</description>

      <title>Multi-Exit Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: enhancing accuracy and parsimony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) uniquely combine high accuracy with interpretability, making them valuable for scientific modeling. However, it is unclear a priori how deep a network needs to be for any given task, and deeper KANs can be difficult to optimize. Here we introduce multi-exit KANs, where each layer includes its own prediction branch, enabling the network to make accurate predictions at multiple depths simultaneously. This architecture provides deep supervision that improves training while discovering the right level of model complexity for each task. Multi-exit KANs consistently outperform standard, single-exit versions on synthetic functions, dynamical systems, and real-world datasets. Remarkably, the best predictions often come from earlier, simpler exits, revealing that these networks naturally identify smaller, more parsimonious and interpretable models without sacrificing accuracy. To automate this discovery, we develop a differentiable "learning to exit" algorithm that balances contributions from exits during training. Our approach offers scientists a practical way to achieve both high performance and interpretability, addressing a fundamental challenge in machine learning for scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Risk and Reward of Transitioning from a National to a Zonal Electricity Market in Great Britain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More spatially granular electricity wholesale markets promise more efficient operation and better asset siting in highly renewable power systems. Great Britain is considering moving from its current single-price national wholesale market to a zonal design. Existing studies reach varying and difficult-to-reconcile conclusions about the desirability of a zonal market in GB, partly because they rely on models that vary in their transparency and assumptions about future power systems. Using a novel open-source electricity market model, calibrated to match observed network behaviour, this article quantifies consumer savings, unit-level producer surplus impacts, and broader socioeconomic benefits that would have arisen had a six-zone market operated in Great Britain during 2022-2024. In the absence of mitigating policies, it is estimated that during those three years GB consumers would save approximately {\pounds}9.4/MWh (equalling an average of more than {\pounds}2.3B per year), but generators in northern regions would experience revenue reductions of 30-40\%. Policy interventions can restore these units' national market revenues to up to 97\% while still preserving around {\pounds}3.1/MWh in consumer savings (about {\pounds}750M per year). It is further estimated that the current system could achieve approximately {\pounds}380-{\pounds}770 million in annual welfare gain during 2022-2024 through improved operational efficiency alone. The drivers behind these benefits, notably wind curtailment volumes, are expected to become more pronounced towards 2030, suggesting that purely operationally achieved annual benefits of around {\pounds}1-2 billion beyond 2029 are likely. It is found that the scale of these benefits would outweigh the potential downsides related to increases in the cost of capital that have been estimated elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation of dynamic cavity equations for linearly-coupled stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.</description>

      <title>Is the end of Insight in Sight ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of deep learning challenges the longstanding scientific ideal of insight - the human capacity to understand phenomena by uncovering underlying mechanisms. In many modern applications, accurate predictions no longer require interpretable models, prompting debate about whether explainability is a realistic or even meaningful goal. From our perspective in physics, we examine this tension through a concrete case study: a physics-informed neural network (PINN) trained on a rarefied gas dynamics problem governed by the Boltzmann equation. Despite the system's clear structure and well-understood governing laws, the trained network's weights resemble Gaussian-distributed random matrices, with no evident trace of the physical principles involved. This suggests that deep learning and traditional simulation may follow distinct cognitive paths to the same outcome - one grounded in mechanistic insight, the other in statistical interpolation. Our findings raise critical questions about the limits of explainable AI and whether interpretability can - or should-remain a universal standard in artificial reasoning.</description>

      <title>UniFoil: A Universal Dataset of Airfoils in Transitional and Turbulent Regimes for Subsonic and Transonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present UniFoil, a large publicly available universal airfoil dataset based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. It contains over 500,000 samples spanning a wide range of Reynolds and Mach numbers, capturing both transitional and fully turbulent flows across incompressible to compressible regimes. UniFoil is designed to support machine learning research in fluid dynamics, particularly for modeling complex aerodynamic phenomena. Most existing datasets are limited to incompressible, fully turbulent flows with smooth field characteristics, overlooking the critical physics of laminar\-turbulent transition and shock\-wave interactions\-features that exhibit strong nonlinearity and sharp gradients. UniFoil addresses this limitation by offering a broad spectrum of realistic flow conditions. Turbulent simulations utilize the Spalart\-Allmaras (SA) model, while transitional flows are modeled using an e^N\-based transition prediction method coupled with the SA model. The dataset includes a comprehensive geometry set comprising over 4,800 natural laminar flow (NLF) airfoils and 30,000 fully turbulent (FT) airfoils, covering a diverse range of airfoil designs relevant to aerospace, wind energy, and marine applications. This dataset is also valuable for scientific machine learning, enabling the development of data-driven models that more accurately capture the transport processes associated with laminar-turbulent transition. UniFoil is freely available under a permissive CC\-BY\-SA license.</description>
