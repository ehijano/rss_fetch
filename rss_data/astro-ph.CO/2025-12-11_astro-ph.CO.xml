      <title>The eventful life journey of galaxy clusters. II. Impact of mass accretion on the thermodynamical structure of the ICM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The internal structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) is tightly linked to the assembly history and physical processes in groups and clusters, but the role of recent accretion in shaping these profiles has not been fully explored.
  Aims. We investigate to what extent mass accretion accounts for the variability in ICM density and thermodynamic profiles, and what can present-day structures reveal about their formation histories.
  Methods. We analyze a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation including gas cooling but no feedback, to isolate the effects of heating from structure formation. Median profiles of ICM quantities are introduced as a robust description of the bulk ICM. We then examine correlations between mass accretion rates or assembly indicators with the profiles of temperature, entropy, pressure, gas and dark-matter density, as well as their scatter.
  Results. Accretion in the last dynamical time strongly lowers central gas densities, while leaving dark matter largely unaffected, producing a distinct signature in the baryon depletion function. Pressure and entropy show the clearest dependence on accretion, whereas temperature is less sensitive. The radii of steepest entropy, temperature, and pressure shift inward by $\sim (10-20)\%$ between high- and low-accretion subsamples. Assembly-state indicators are also related to the location of these features, and accretion correlates with the parameters of common fitting functions for density, pressure, and entropy.
  Conclusions. Recent accretion leaves measurable imprints on the ICM structure, highlighting the potential of thermodynamic profiles as diagnostics of cluster growth history.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Cluster Detection and Dynamical Analysis in the VIPERS High-Redshift Spectroscopic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical analysis of galaxy clusters identified in the VIPERS spectroscopic survey within the redshift range 0.5 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.2. Cluster candidates were first detected as overdense regions in redshift space through the Finger-of-God (FoG) effect, and cluster membership was assigned using the GalWeight technique within the FoG-GalWeight methodology developed by our team. For each cluster, we derived the virial radius (R200), velocity dispersion (sigma200), and virial mass (M200) using the virial mass estimator. We identified ten VIPERS clusters spanning a mass range of 0.59 x 10^14 &lt;= M200/(h^-1 Msun) &lt;= 4.32 x 10^14 and velocity dispersions of 360 &lt;= sigma200 &lt;= 900 km s^-1. We cross-matched the VIPERS clusters with published catalogs and found at least one matching system for each cluster, offering external validation for our detections. We investigated the velocity dispersion-mass relation for these systems and obtained log(sigma200) = (2.73 +/- 0.06) + (0.36 +/- 0.18) log(M200), with an intrinsic scatter of sigma_int = 0.04 +/- 0.07. The derived relation is consistent with theoretical predictions from N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, confirming the reliability of the FoG-GalWeight methodology and the robustness of the virial mass estimator. Our findings demonstrate that the velocity dispersion can serve as a reliable and direct proxy for cluster mass, even at high redshift, without requiring additional dynamical mass modeling.</description>

      <title>Bimetric MOND as a framework for variable-$G$ theories -- local systems and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bimetric MOND (BIMOND) is used as a platform for variable-$G$ theories that have MOND-specific idiosyncrasies. E.g., MOND premises dictate return to standard dynamics in the high-acceleration limit, predicting the standard value of $G$ for high-acceleration systems. This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology. My guiding motivation is to see if such theories may account for some roles of dark matter in cosmology; e.g., in accounting for the expansion history of the Universe in the matter-dominated era, by having a $G_e\approx 2\pi G$ govern the later stages of the expansion, instead of invoking matter density $\approx 2\pi\times$ baryon density. Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G_e\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G_e&gt; G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era.</description>

      <title>Exploring Machine Learning Regression Models for Advancing Foreground Mitigation and Global 21cm Signal Parameter Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting parameters from the global 21cm signal is crucial for understanding the early Universe. However, detecting the 21cm signal is challenging due to the brighter foreground and associated observational difficulties. In this study, we evaluate the performance of various machine-learning regression models to improve parameter extraction and foreground removal. This evaluation is essential for selecting the most suitable machine learning regression model based on computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. We compare four models: Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The comparison is based on metrics such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and $R^2$ scores. We examine their effectiveness across different dataset sizes and conditions, including scenarios with foreground contamination. Our results indicate that ANN consistently outperforms the other models, achieving the lowest RMSE and the highest $R^2$ scores across multiple cases. While GPR also performs well, it is computationally intensive, requiring significant RAM and longer execution times. SVR struggles with large datasets due to its high computational costs, and RFR demonstrates the weakest accuracy among the models tested. We also found that employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing step significantly enhances model performance, especially in the presence of foregrounds.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Spatial Curvature and Dark Energy Dynamics in the $w$CDM Model from DESI DR1 and DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the $w$CDM dynamical dark energy model with spatial curvature utilizing the recently released DESI Collaboration data (DR1 and DR2) in conjunction with other observational probes such as BBN, Observational Hubble Data (OHD), and Pantheon Plus (PP). Our investigation attempts to discover which DESI dataset gives a better match to the $w$CDM framework and assess the impact of spatial curvature on cosmological constraints. We find that the cosmic curvature parameter, $\Omega_k$, disfavors the cosmological constant for the DR2+BBN and DR2+BBN+OHD data combinations. However, the deviation from the cosmological constant remains below the $1\sigma$ level, indicating a mild preference for a open universe. In contrast, when using the DR1 based combinations namely DR1+BBN and DR1+BBN+OHD-the deviation from the cosmological constant increases to approximately $1.2\sigma$, suggesting a slightly stronger indication of a open geometry. Also, the best-fit values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) obtained from the DR1+BBN+OHD+PP and DR2+BBN+OHD+PP combinations within the dynamical dark energy model are consistent with the results reported by the Planck Collaboration. Our findings provide constraints on the dark energy EoS parameter $ w_{\mathrm{}0}$, reveal a mild but notable deviation from the vacuum energy ($w = -1$) scenario at a significance level $1.8\sigma$ from DR2+BBN+OHD+PP and $0.5\sigma$ from DR1+BBN+OHD+PP, both favoring the quintessence region of dark energy. Furthermore, the key physical distance measures $D_H$, $D_V$, and $D_M$ show better consistency with our model when analyzed with the DR2 data.</description>

      <title>SLICE -- Combining Strong Lensing and X-ray in AC\,114. Insights into the Merger Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AC114 is a historically significant galaxy cluster, being one of the first strong lensing clusters detected from the ground in the early 1990s, prior to the launch of the HST. Despite this early prominence, no detailed lensing analyses have been carried out for more than fifteen years. We here study this cluster using JWST imaging obtained as part of the SLICE program, complemented by archival HST and X-ray observations. JWST data reveal ten new multiply imaged systems and enable the identification of conjugate substructures in several of the sixteen systems, significantly increasing the number of strong lensing constraints. Using these data, we construct a parametric mass model with Lenstool and extend it by explicitly incorporating the Chandra data in a combined strong lensing+X-ray fit. Our best-fit model reproduces the multiple images with an RMS of 0.4" while simultaneously matching the X-ray data. The dark matter distribution is unimodal and centered on the brightest cluster galaxy, with a large core radius of 83+-5kpc, consistent with values reported in other strong lensing clusters. The strong lensing constraints require the inclusion of an external shear component which position angle points unambiguously towards a nearby (~1Mpc), well defined mass concentration at the same redshift in the North-West, for which we propose the naming AC114b. The spatial coverage of the XMM-Newton data encompasses the whole structure, allowing us to probe the X-ray properties of the companion cluster and the thermodynamics of AC114, providing evidence for a major merger, in line with previous signatures seen in Chandra, radio and optical spectroscopic data. Our results shed new light on the merging scenario, revealing a major merger caught in a late post-collisional phase, where AC114 is the dominant system and Ac114b has likely been stripped of its hot gas.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on New Tsallis holographic energy in Rastall theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological implications of New Tsallis holographic dark energy (NTHDE) in Rastall theory have been studied. Using the data set that includes DESI BAO (DR2), PantheonPlus SNe Ia, H(z) measurements, and BBN and the MCMC analysis, the key cosmological and model-specific parameters are constrained. The result is compared with that of the {\Lambda}CDM model indicating that in addition to providing a viable dynamical dark energy framework, predictions for H(z) are slightly more consistent with intermediate-redshift observations. Generally, the model remains compatible with current data and offers testable deviations from {\Lambda}CDM for upcoming surveys. It is also seen that when the energy density of quantum fields in vacuum, exposed by NTHDE, is combined with the Rastall correction term to the general relativity, a plausible candidate for dynamical dark energy is obtained that mimic the current value of the dark energy density parameter reported in the {\Lambda}CDM model. The latter cannot be repeated by NTHDE alone. The study also confirms previous theoretical and observational constraints on the Rastall parameter obtained by focusing on the thermodynamics, early universe, pulsars, and the early-type galaxies.</description>

      <title>Tachyonic dark energy- Constraints from current observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey have reignited the debate on the true nature of dark energy, challenging the standard cosmological constant model of cosmology. The results suggest a preference for dark energy to be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. Several recent analyses of DESI data indicate that the universe's expansion may not be accelerating in the way suggested by supernova based cosmology. Motivated by these studies, we investigated a tachyon type scalar field $\phi$ as a model for dark energy, assuming an exponential potential for the field and performed parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Such a model offers solutions that have $w \sim -1$ and are decelerating without requiring a phantom like equation of state. The present day value of the equation of state parameter is treated as a free parameter; however, for the reference model, we fix its present value to $-1$. The analysis is carried out using the latest Supernovae dataset (Pantheon+) and BAO measurements from DESI. The results show that both types of datasets consistently predict a turnaround in the equation of state, regardless of whether $w_{\phi 0}$ is treated as a free parameter or fixed to $-1$. The corresponding deceleration parameter also exhibits a future turnaround for both datasets when $w_{\phi 0}$ is free. However, in the reference model with $w_{\phi 0} = -1$, the deceleration parameter instead approaches $-1$ asymptotically. A model comparison using the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria shows that the Pantheon+ dataset favors the free $w_{\phi 0}$ scenario, while BAO observations prefer the $w_{\phi 0} = -1$ case. This indicates a disagreement in the future evolution trends predicted by the two datasets within the tachyon type dark energy model.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. Review of forecast constraints on dark energy and modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclid mission has been designed to provide, as one of its main deliverables, information on the nature of the gravitational interaction, which determines the expansion of the Universe and the formation of structures. Thus, Euclid has the potential to test deviations from general relativity that will allow us to shed light on long-lasting problems in the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Euclid will mainly do this by using two complementary probes: weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. In this paper we review pre-launch Euclid analyses for dark energy and modified gravity. These include forecast constraints with future Euclid data on cosmological parameters for different cosmological models, such as a time-varying dark energy component, phenomenological modifications of the perturbation sector and specific modified gravity models, with further extensions that include neutrino physics and the coupling to the electromagnetic sector through the fine-structure constant. We review the study of the impact of nonlinear clustering methods on beyond-$\Lambda$CDM constraints with Euclid. This is of fundamental importance to efficiently predict the large-scale clustering of matter and dark matter halos, given that we will have access to a wealth of information on scales beyond the linear regime. We inspect the extension of theoretical predictions for observable quantities in alternative cosmologies to $\Lambda$CDM at fully nonlinear scales by means of $N$-body simulations. We discuss the impact of relativistic corrections in extended cosmological models. Overall, this review highlights the significant potential of the Euclid mission to tightly constrain parameters of dark energy and modified gravity models, or perhaps to detect possible signatures of a $\Lambda$CDM failure.</description>

      <title>Adding electromagnetic birefringence to pulsar timing and astrometry to detect gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently shown that the time variation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves from pulsars can be used, in cross-correlation with pulsar timing, to probe the chirality of an isotropic gravitational wave background. Here, we show that the expression for the cross-correlation is derived efficiently with the total-angular-momentum formalism and use this framework to extend the formulation to cross-correlation with astrometry. We do so for spin-1 gravitational waves (that may arise in alternative-gravity theories) as well as the general-relativistic spin-2 gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Primordial non-Gaussianity -- Fast simulations and persistent summary statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of topological and traditional summary statistics to primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) using two suites of simulations. First, we introduce a new simulation suite for PNG, PNG-pmwd, comprising more than $20{,}000$ halo catalogs that vary individually local and equilateral shapes, together with variations in $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. Second, we carry out a systematic comparison of topological descriptors, as well as powerspectrum and bispectrum measurements, evaluating their constraining power on both local and equilateral $f_{\rm NL}$ and how this sensitivity varies with halo mass. This dataset enables likelihood-free neural regression of $f_{\rm NL}$ across multiple halo mass bins for a wide range of summary statistics. Third, we assess the transferability of these learned mappings by testing whether models trained on fast pmwd simulations can robustly infer on simulations from the QuijotePNG suite. We find that a combination of simple descriptive statistics of the topological features (PD-statistics) leads to the best performance to constrain equilateral PNG. We observe that the constraining power of these summaries comes from large-mass halos, with small-mass halos adding noise and degrading performance. Similarly, we find that the transferability of the learned mappings, for both topological and powerspectrum plus bispectrum, degrades if small scales or small-mass halos are included.</description>

      <title>Beyond Two Parameters: Revisiting Dark Energy with the Latest Cosmic Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark energy (DE) models with many free parameters are often considered excessive, as constraining all parameters poses a significant challenge. On the other hand, such models offer greater flexibility to probe the DE sector in more detail. With the rapid advancement of astronomical surveys and the availability of diverse datasets, it is timely to examine whether current combined observations can effectively constrain an extended parameter space in DE models. This article investigates a four-parameter dynamical dark energy (DDE) model that spans a broad region of the universe's expansion history through four key parameters: the present-day value of the DE equation of state ($w_0$), its initial value ($w_m$), the scale factor depicting transition from $w_m$ to $w_0$ occurs ($a_t$), and the steepness of this transition ($\Delta_{\rm de}$). We constrain the model using CMB data from Planck, BAO from DESI DR2, and three distinct compilations of Type Ia Supernovae: PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3. Our results show that constraining all four parameters remains difficult: $a_t$ is not constrained by any dataset, while the remaining three parameters can be constrained only when all observational probes are combined (with the exception of DESY5). The results further show that DE has a quintessential nature at present ($w_0 &gt; -1$), while $w_m$ is negative, indicating a phantom-like behaviour at early times. Interestingly, despite its larger parameter space, the proposed DDE model is preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, based on both $\Delta\chi^2$ and Bayesian evidence, for certain combined datasets, particularly CMB+BAO+DESY5 and CMB+BAO+Union3.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies and extragalactic foregrounds in the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) contain information that can be used to test both cosmological models and models of galaxy formation. Starting from lightcone-based HEALPix maps and catalogues, we present a new set of mock CMB maps constructed in a self-consistent manner from the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, including CMB lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, cosmic infrared background, radio point source and anisotropic screening maps. We show that these simulations reproduce a wide range of observational constraints. We also compare our simulations with previous predictions based on dark matter-only simulations which generally model the secondary anisotropies independently from one another, concluding that our hydrodynamical simulation mocks perform at least as well as previous mocks in matching the observations whilst retaining self-consistency in the predictions of the different components. Using the model variations in FLAMINGO, we further explore how the signals depend on cosmology and feedback modelling, and we predict cross-correlations between some of the signals that differ significantly from those in previous mocks. The mock CMB maps should provide a valuable resource for exploring correlations between different secondary anisotropies and other large-scale structure tracers, and can be applied to forecasts for upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Self-calibration of weak lensing cosmic shear biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to reach the required performance of Stage-III and IV weak lensing surveys, cosmic shear measurements have to rely on external simulations to calibrate residual biases. Over the years, several techniques have been developed to mitigate the impact of residual biases prior to calibration, including the inference of shear responses on images to correct multiplicative biases, and the empirical correction of additive biases. We introduce a novel methodology that generalises upon the state-of-the-art approaches by inferring multiplicative and additive biases jointly from parameterised distributions of measured ellipticities, crucially without relying on external simulations and independently from cosmology. Shear biases are marginalised over the unknown hyper-parameters in the modelling, hence mitigating the impact of degeneracies. We apply the technique to a representative problem and show the performance of the estimation, even in the presence of noise. The method has a high potential for applicability to the calibration of weak lensing cosmic shear in current and future lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning of halo gas density profiles: a sensitivity analysis of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar and AGN-driven feedback processes affect the distribution of gas on a wide range of scales, from within galaxies well into the intergalactic medium. Yet, it remains unclear how feedback, through its connection to key galaxy properties, shapes the radial gas density profile in the host halo. We tackle this question using suites of the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which span a variety of feedback models. We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; M_{\rm 200c} &lt; 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;4$. For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift. Our framework can be readily embedded in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to incorporate halo gas density profiles consistent with different hydrodynamical simulations. Our work also provides a proof of concept for constraining feedback models with future observations of galaxy properties and of the surrounding gas distribution.</description>

      <title>Curvaton-assisted hilltop inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results, we consider hilltop inflation where the inflaton is coupled to a curvaton, simultaneously addressing two main challenges faced by conventional hilltop inflation models: the initial-value problem; and their viability for sub-Planckian field values. In standard single-field hilltop inflation, the inflaton must start extremely close to the maximum of the potential, raising concerns about the naturalness of the initial conditions. We demonstrate that the curvaton field not only solves the initial-value problem, but also opens up parameter space through modifying the curvature perturbation power spectrum, reviving the cubic and quartic hilltop inflation models in the sub-Planckian regime. We find viable parameter space consistent with the recent cosmological observations, and predict a sizable tensor-to-scalar ratio that can be tested in the next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetic field from chiral plasma instability with sourcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an electron-positron plasma, an imbalance in the number of right- and left-chiral particles can lead to the growth of a helical magnetic field through a phenomenon called the chiral plasma instability (CPI). In the early universe, scattering reactions that violate chirality come into thermal equilibrium when the plasma cools below a temperature of approximately $80 \, \mathrm{TeV}$. Since these reactions tend to relax any pre-existing chiral asymmetry to zero as the system approaches equilibrium, the standard lore is that primordial magnetogenesis via the CPI is not viable below $80 \, \mathrm{TeV}$. In this work, we propose that the presence of a source for chirality can allow the CPI to operate even below $80 \, \mathrm{TeV}$, we explore the implications of this scenario, and we derive predictions for the resultant magnetic field helicity using a combination of analytical methods and direct numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>The stellar and dark matter distributions in elliptical galaxies measured by stacked weak gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate stellar mass and central dark matter density profiles of photometric luminous red galaxies with stellar masses of $\sim10^{10}-10^{12}M_\odot$ using weak gravitational lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program data obtained with the Subaru Telescope. By stacking weak lensing signals from a large number of galaxies, we obtain average tangential shear profiles down to $\sim 10\,\mathrm{kpc}/h$, which are fitted assuming a two-component model consisting of stellar and dark matter components to constrain their central dark matter distribution. We find a preference for non-zero core radii of dark matter distributions in galaxies with stellar masses of $\sim 10^{11}M_\odot$. Our results imply a stronger feedback effect than that typically predicted by current hydrodynamical simulations. In addition, we provide a new constraint on the stellar-to-halo mass relation, where both stellar and halo masses are, for the first time, directly constrained by weak gravitational lensing. Our results prefer the stellar initial mass function (IMF) that is more bottom-heavy than the Salpeter IMF.</description>

      <title>CWTHF: Subhalo Identification with Continuous Wavelet Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With advances in cosmology and computer science, cosmological simulations now resolve structures in increasingly fine detail. As key tracers of hierarchical structure formation, subhalos are among the most important objects within these simulations. In our previous work, we established that the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) can effectively extract clustering information and serve as a robust halo finder. Here, we extend the CWT framework to subhalo identification by adapting the CWTHF (Continuous Wavelet Transform Halo Finder) code. This extension extends the unbinding procedure, which enables the reliable identification of gravitationally bound substructures. The algorithm identifies density peaks within known halos or subhalos and segments the surrounding volume accordingly. Once a new subhalo is registered, its position is recorded to prevent duplicate detection. We validate our approach using the TNG50-2 and TNG100-1 simulations, as well as a single Friends-of-Friends (FOF) halo, by comparing the resulting CWT catalog against the reference SUBFIND catalog. Because the method inherits the original computational framework, our subhalo finder maintains a favorable linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$.</description>

Abstract: In the literature, many warm inflationary models are formulated. In this piece of work, a warm inflationary model in the braneworld scenario is studied, considering constant and variable dissipation coefficients. Performance of the model has been considered in both strong and weak dissipative regimes. We study the dynamics of this scenario under slow-roll approximation and estimate cosmological observables, viz., the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio. In order to constrain the parameters in our model, we consider data from Planck 2018 and BICEP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological parameter inference and model selection from a Bayesian perspective. Type Ia supernova data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES-SN5YR) are used to test the \(\Lambda\)CDM, \(w\)CDM, and CPL cosmological models. Posterior inference is performed via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo using the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) implemented in NumPyro and analyzed with ArviZ in Python. Bayesian model comparison is conducted through Bayes factors computed using the \texttt{bridgesampling} library in R. The results indicate that all three models demonstrate similar predictive performance, but \(w\)CDM shows stronger evidence relative to \(\Lambda\)CDM and CPL. We conclude that, under the assumptions and data used in this study, \(w\)CDM provides a better description of cosmological expansion.</description>

      <title>Reconciling ALP Dark Matter and Electroweak Baryogenesis through First-Order Electroweak Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that an axionlike particle (ALP) can simultaneously generate the baryon asymmetry and constitute dark matter through dynamics triggered by a first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT). In our proposal, the transition briefly reshapes the ALP potential via a temperature-dependent vacuum expectation value of a scalar field $S$, responsible for making the EWPT of first order, inducing a transient mass enhancement of ALP via higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operator(s). This sudden kick generates a large ALP velocity near the onset of EWPT enabling the broadening of relic satisfied parameter space and predict a complementary stochastic gravitational-wave signal from the underlying first-order transition. We further show that the same ALP dynamics can naturally fuel electroweak baryogenesis through its coupling to electroweak anomaly.</description>

      <title>Relativistic accretion process onto rotating black holes in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we uncover the accretion dynamics and oscillatory behavior around rotating black holes within the EEH nonlinear electrodynamic framework by analyzing both the motion of test particles and numerically solving the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Using EEH geometry, we compute the structure of circular motion, the effective potential and force, and we evaluate the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies together with the Lense-Thirring and periastron precession rates. Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations.</description>

      <title>On priors and scale cuts in EFT-based full-shape analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter estimation from galaxy survey data from the full-shape method depends on scale cuts and priors on EFT parameters. The effects of priors, including the so-called ''prior volume'' phenomenon have been originally studied in Ivanov et al. (2019) and subsequent works. In this note, we repeat and extend these tests and also apply them to other priors used in the literature. We point out that in addition to the ''prior volume'' effect there is a more dangerous effect that is largely overlooked: a systematic bias on cosmological parameters due to overoptimistic scale cuts. Unlike the ''prior volume'' effect, this is a genuine systematic bias due to two-loop corrections that does not vanish with better priors or with larger data volumes. Our study is based on the high fidelity BOSS-like PT Challenge simulation data which offer many advantages over analyses based on synthetic data generated with fitting pipelines. We show that some analysis choices associated with the PyBird code, especially the scale cuts, significantly bias parameter recovery, overestimating $\sigma_8$ by over $5\%$ (equivalent to $1\sigma$). The bias on measured EFT parameters is even more significant. In contrast, the analysis choices associated with the CLASS-PT code lead to much smaller ($\lesssim 1\%$) shifts in cosmological parameters based on their best-fit values.</description>

      <title>Baryonification: An alternative to hydrodynamical simulations for cosmological studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved baryonification (BFC) model that modifies dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations to generate particle-level outputs for gas, dark matter, and stars. Unlike previous implementations, our approach first splits each simulation particle into separate dark matter and baryonic components, which are then displaced individually using the BFC technique. By applying the hydrostatic and ideal gas equations, we assign pressure and temperature values to individual gas particles. The model is validated against hydrodynamical simulations from the FLAMINGO and TNG suites (which feature varied feedback prescriptions) showing good agreement at the level of density and pressure profiles across a wide range of halo masses. As a further step, we calibrate the BFC model parameters to gas and stellar mass ratio profiles from the hydrodynamical simulations. Based on these calibrations, we baryonify $N$-body simulations and compare the resulting total matter power spectrum suppressions to the ones from the same hydrodynamical simulation. Carrying out this test of the BFC method at each redshift individually, we obtain a 2 percent agreement up to $k=5\,h$/Mpc across all tested feedback scenarios. We also define a reduced, 2+1 parameter BFC model that simultaneously accounts for feedback variations (2 parameters) and redshift evolution (1 parameter). The 2+1 parameter model agrees with the hydrodynamical simulations to better than 2.5 percent over the scales and redshifts relevant for cosmological surveys. Finally, we present a map-level comparison between a baryonified $N$-body simulation and a full hydrodynamical run from the TNG simulation suite. Visual inspection of dark matter, gas, and stellar density fields, along with the integrated pressure map, shows promising agreement. Further work is needed to quantify the accuracy at the level of observables.</description>

      <title>Taking the Weight Off: Mitigating Parameter Bias from Catastrophic Outliers in 3$\times$2pt Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stage IV cosmological surveys will map the universe with unprecedented precision, reducing statistical uncertainties to levels where unmodelled systematics can significantly bias inference. In particular, photometric redshift (photo-z) errors and intrinsic alignments (IA) must be robustly accounted for to ensure accurate inference of cosmological parameters. The increasing depth of Stage IV surveys exacerbates these challenges by producing low signal-to-noise galaxy populations prone to inaccurate photo-z measurements. Catastrophically misidentified redshifts are especially problematic for 3$\times$2pt inferences that combine weak lensing and galaxy clustering information. We demonstrate that even modest outlier fractions (e.g. 5%) can lead to substantial biases in cosmological parameter estimates: up to 1.8${\sigma}$ in ${\Omega}_M$ and ${\sigma}_8$, and over 8${\sigma}$ in the IA redshift evolution parameter ${\eta}$. To address this, we introduce a flexible weighting scheme at the likelihood level that down-weights the most contamination-sensitive elements of the data vector during inference. This method mitigates biases without inflating the parameter space, reducing cosmological parameter biases to below 1${\sigma}$ without substantially degrading constraining power. Our approach offers a practical solution for future analyses, enabling robust cosmological inference in the presence of catastrophic redshift errors.</description>

      <title>What Galaxy Clusters Have to Say About Dynamical Dark Energy and $H_0$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in flat $\Lambda$CDM, low-redshift structure probes -- cluster abundances, 3$\times$2-point analyses, and full-shape clustering -- are mutually consistent, jointly delivering precise constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ that agree with geometrical datasets (CMB+BAO+SN). In $w_0w_a$CDM, adding clusters to the geometry dataset reduces the evidence for evolving dark energy while relaxing the $H_0$ tension, suggesting a $\Lambda$CDM evolution of the late-time Universe and a sound horizon that differs from its standard value.</description>

      <title>The frame-dragging vector potential on galaxy scales from DM-only Newtonian $N$-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effects of General Relativity are usually neglected in the non-linear evolution of structures, where Newtonian $N$-body simulations are traditionally employed. In the post-Friedmann expansion framework, a weak-field relativistic approximation purpose-built for cosmology, a frame-dragging gravito-magnetic vector potential arises at leading order, sourced by momentum currents, contributing to the metric even if the dynamics of matter fields at this order is Newtonian, and can thus be extracted from $N$-body simulations. Using the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator code on the IllustrisTNG simulations, here we extend previous work in order to compute the power spectrum of this vector potential down to galactic scales. The magnitude of the vector potential is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by perturbation theory, and is a $1\% \sim 0.1\%$ effect compared to the non-linear Newtonian scalar gravitational potential. In the red-shift range considered here, the gravito-magnetic effect remains subdominant, without showing any enhancement during a particular phase in the evolution of structures, aside from the continuous growth of non-linearity at low redshift. Although this seems to suggest that, within the $\Lambda$CDM model, no significant gravito-magnetic effects contribute to the non-linear evolution of cosmic structures, i.e. to the dynamics of massive particles, possible observational consequences, e.g. in lensing, deserve further exploration.</description>

      <title>Ekpyrosis in Quantum Gravitational Anisotropic Bouncing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the isotropization of a model anisotropic universe in the bouncing models using the ekpyrotic potential without assuming initial conditions corresponding to an ekpyrotic phase. In particular, we explore the way the use of ekpyrotic potentials may dynamically help isotropization for the considered initial conditions corresponding to the macroscopic classical contracting universe with potentially large anisotropies. As an example of a concrete nonsingular bouncing mechanism, we consider the effective description of loop quantum cosmology for Bianchi-I and Bianchi-IX spacetimes for ekpyrotic and ekpyrotic-like potentials. Considering two different values of potential parameters and initial conditions corresponding to a classical macroscopic universe, we show that for both of these spacetimes, the cosmological singularity is resolved via multiple short-duration nonsingular bounces caused by quantum gravitational effects. We perform a large number of numerical simulations for a wide range of initial conditions which do not favor ekpyrosis initially. Even with such unfavorable initial conditions, we show that the relative strength of the anisotropies at the end of the bounce regime is noticeably reduced in more than 90% of the simulations. This provides a strong evidence for the isotropization ability of the ekpyrotic potentials. We find that isotropization can occur over cycles of rapid nonsingular bounces in the Planck regime via enhancement of the contribution of the (isotropic) energy density relative to the anisotropies at the bounces. Achieving isotropization is found to be easier in Bianchi-I spacetimes when compared to Bianchi-IX spacetimes. Our results demonstrate that, even with initial conditions which are not most favorable for the existence of ekpyrosis, an effective isotropization can occur in nonsingular anisotropic models with ekpyrotic and ekpyrotic-like potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks may have formed in the early universe following the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. Notably, several particle physics models predict the existence of current-carrying DWs, which can capture and store particles as zero modes on it. In this study, we demonstrate that gravitational waves (GWs) generated by current-carrying DWs with fermionic zeromodes exhibit a novel feature: an additional peak in the GW spectrum resembling mountains, arising from metastable topological remnants, which we term ``spherons.'' This distinct signature could be detectable in upcoming GW observatories such as LISA and ET. The results suggest that DW networks in beyond Standard Model scenarios could emit GW signals that are significantly stronger and with greater detectability than previously expected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark Matter can interact with electroweak gauge bosons via higher-dimensional operators, in spite of being neutral under gauge interactions, much like neutral atoms interact with photons through Rayleigh scattering. This study explores effective interactions between a real scalar Dark Matter particle, singlet under the SM gauge group, and electroweak gauge bosons. We present a comprehensive analysis of current constraints and projected sensitivities from both lepton and hadron colliders as well as direct and indirect detection experiments in testing Rayleigh Dark Matter interactions. We find that, thanks to the complementarity between collider experiments and cosmological probes, thermally produced Rayleigh Dark Matter at the hundreds of GeV scale can be thoroughly tested with the next generation of experiments. For lighter candidates, upcoming forecasts will explore uncharted parameter space, significantly surpassing the thermal Dark Matter benchmark.</description>

      <title>Results from Hubble parameter data: oscillating dark energy?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a model-independent analysis method which bases on the Lagrange mean value theorem for obtaining the derivative of the Hubble function, we analyze $H(z)$ parameter data with some restrictive conditions. We find that: (a) the Universe may experience an accelerated expansion with a confidence level greater than 5 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{101}\in (0, 0.36)$ and greater than 1.9 $\sigma$ at redshifts $z_{3835}\in (1.3, 1.53)$ and $z_{3836}\in (1.43, 1.53)$, where $z_j&lt;z_{ij}&lt;z_i$ and $i$ marks the $i$-th Hubble parameter data we consider; (b) the Universe may experience a decelerated expansion with a confidence level greater than 1.5 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{2012}\in (0.40, 0.52)$; (c) $w_{\rm{x}}\leq w_{\rm{t}}&lt;-1$ with confidence level great than 1.6 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{3836}\in (1.43, 1.53)$. These results indicate that the evolution of dark energy may be oscillatory.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Freeze-In and Small-Scale Observables: Novel Mass Bounds and Viable Particle Candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The suppression of cosmological structure at small scales is a key signature of dark matter (DM) produced via freeze-in in the low-mass regime. We present a comprehensive analysis of its impact, incorporating recent constraints from Milky Way satellite counts, strong gravitational lensing with JWST data, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We adopt a general strategy to translate existing warm dark matter (WDM) bounds into lower mass limits for a broad class of DM candidates characterized by quasi-thermal phase space distributions. The benefits of this approach include computational efficiency and the ability to explore a wide range of models. We derive model-independent bounds for DM produced via two-body decays, scatterings, and three-body decays, and apply the framework to concrete scenarios such as the Higgs portal, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, and the dark photon portal. Results from specific models confirm the validity of the model-independent analysis.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Lepton Flavor Violating Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extreme conditions within the supernova core, a high-temperature and high-density environment, create an ideal laboratory for the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Of particular interest are low-energy supernovae, characterized by their low explosion energies, which place strong constraints on the new-physics energy transfer from the core to the mantle. We compute low-energy supernova constraints on lepton-flavor-violating axions and axion-like particles that couple to both electrons and muons. For axion mass above the muon mass, the electron-muon coalescence and the axion decay are dominant production and reabsorption processes, respectively. We find that the low-energy supernovae provide the most stringent constraints on the axions in the mass range of $\sim (110,550)$ MeV, probing the coupling constant down to $g_{ae\mu} \simeq {\cal O}(10^{-11})$.</description>

      <title>Double Trouble: Two spectroscopically confirmed low-mass quiescent galaxies at z&gt;5 in overdensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of two low-mass, high-redshift, quiescent galaxies, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy alongside NIRCam and MIRI photometry. Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and with stellar masses of $\rm 10^{9.6}M_\odot$ and $\rm 10^{9.5}M_\odot$, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive ($\sim10\times$ lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation ($z\sim 7$) and has a formation redshift of around z$\sim$11, whilst GS-z5-Q1 formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation ($z\sim6$). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z "mini-quenched" galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass $z&gt;5$ quiescent galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.</description>

      <title>Cosmic domain walls on a lattice: illusive effects of initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolution of cosmic domain walls (DWs) settles to the scaling solution, which is often assumed to be independent of initial conditions. However, lattice simulations performed in this work reveal a clear dependence of the scaling DW area on the initial configuration of the sourcing scalar field, specifically, its infrared (IR) properties. Namely, the DW area grows as one suppresses IR modes in the initial scalar field spectrum. This growth is saturated, when the area parameter $\xi$ commonly used in the literature reaches the value $\xi_{max} \approx 1.2$. The dependence of $\xi$ on IR modes is argued to be of non-physical origin: it is likely to be due to effects of the lattice boundary. Assuming that physically the memory of initial conditions is erased, one recognizes $\xi \approx 1.2$ obtained in the situation with maximally suppressed IR modes as a genuine universal value of the area parameter in the scaling regime. We demonstrate that ignorance about initial conditions may affect predictions for the energy density of gravitational waves by the factor five. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is also affected by the choice of initial conditions, most notably in the low-frequency part. Likewise, we revisit annihilation of DWs under the influence of a potential bias. It has been previously found in Ref. [19] that the annihilation happens significantly earlier compared to the estimate based on the simple balance between the potential bias and surface energy density. We further support this observation and show that the tendency towards an earlier annihilation gets even stronger upon removing IR modes in simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratio in star-forming galaxies at redshift z~1-6, with a median redshift of z=2.7, using deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy. Leveraging detections of faint auroral emission lines in 76 galaxies at z&gt;1 from both the MARTA survey and a large compilation of high-redshift literature objects, we derive direct electron temperature-based abundances for nitrogen and oxygen using rest-frame optical lines. We establish the first high-redshift calibrations of strong-line N/O diagnostics based on direct abundance measurements, finding no significant evolution for either N2O2 = [NII]6585/[OII]3727,3729 and N2S2 = [NII]6585/[SII]6717,6731 diagnostics compared to local realisations. We then investigate the N/O-O/H relation across cosmic time using both direct abundances and strong-line based measurements (additional 430 galaxies). We find evidence for mild but systematic nitrogen enhancement at high redshift: galaxies at z&gt;1 exhibit N/O ratios elevated by ~0.18 dex (median offset) at fixed O/H compared to the local relation, with a more pronounced enhancement at low metallicity (12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.1) where the offset reaches up to ~0.3-0.4 dex. We consider several scenarios to explain the observed trends, including bursty star formation, differential metal loading, and inflows of pristine gas. Our results provide the most extensive confirmation of elevated N/O ratios at high-redshift to date based on rest-optical diagnostics and within a self-consistent frame.</description>
