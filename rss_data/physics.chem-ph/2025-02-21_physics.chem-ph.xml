      <title>Strong coupling quantum electrodynamics Hartree-Fock response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of reliable ab initio methods for light-matter strong coupling is necessary for a deeper understanding of molecular polaritons. The recently developed strong coupling quantum electrodynamics Hartree-Fock model (SC-QED-HF) provides cavity-consistent molecular orbitals, overcoming several difficulties related to the simpler QED-HF wave function. In this paper, we further develop this method by implementing the response theory for SC-QED-HF. We compare the derived linear response equations with the time-dependent QED-HF theory and discuss the validity of equivalence relations connecting matter and electromagnetic observables. Our results show that electron-photon correlation induces an excitation redshift compared to the time-dependent QED-HF energies, and we discuss the effect of the dipole self-energy on the ground and excited state properties with different basis sets.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for Molecular Benchmarks in Nonadiabatic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the coupled electronic and nuclear response of a molecule to light excitation requires the application of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. However, when faced with a specific photophysical or photochemical problem, selecting the most suitable theoretical approach from the wide array of available techniques is not a trivial task. The challenge is further complicated by the lack of systematic method comparisons and rigorous testing on realistic molecular systems. This absence of comprehensive molecular benchmarks remains a major obstacle to advances within the field of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. A CECAM workshop, Standardizing Nonadiabatic Dynamics: Towards Common Benchmarks, was held in May 2024 to address this issue. This Perspective highlights the key challenges identified during the workshop in defining molecular benchmarks for nonadiabatic dynamics. Specifically, this work outlines some preliminary observations on essential components needed for simulations and proposes a roadmap aiming to establish, as an ultimate goal, a community-driven, standardized molecular benchmark set.</description>

      <title>Turning on the Light: Polymorphism-Induced Photoluminescence in Cysteine Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoluminescence of non-aromatic supramolecular chemical assemblies has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its potential for use in molecular sensing and imaging technologies. The underlying structural origins, the mechanisms of light emission in these systems, and the generality of this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that crystals of L-Cysteine (Cys) formed in heavy water ($\text{D}_2\text{O}$) exhibit distinct packing and hydrogen-bond networks, resulting in significantly enhanced photoluminescence compared to those prepared in $\text{H}_2\text{O}$. Using advanced excited-state simulations, we elucidate the nature of electronic transitions that activate vibrational modes of Cys in $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, particularly those involving thiol (S-H) and amine (C-N) groups, which lead to non-radiative decay. For the crystal formed in $\text{D}_2\text{O}$, these modes appear to be more constrained, and we also observe intersystem crossing from the singlet to the triplet state, indicating a potentially more complex light emission mechanism. Our findings provide new insights into this intriguing phenomenon and introduce innovative design principles for generating emergent fluorophores.</description>

      <title>Learning the P2D Model for Lithium-Ion Batteries with SOH Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium ion batteries are widely used in many applications. Battery management systems control their optimal use and charging and predict when the battery will cease to deliver the required output on a planned duty or driving cycle. Such systems use a simulation of a mathematical model of battery performance. These models can be electrochemical or data-driven. Electrochemical models for batteries running at high currents are mathematically and computationally complex. In this work, we show that a well-regarded electrochemical model, the Pseudo Two Dimensional (P2D) model, can be replaced by a computationally efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) surrogate model fit to accurately simulated data from a class of random driving cycles. We demonstrate that a CNN is an ideal choice for accurately capturing Lithium ion concentration profiles. Additionally, we show how the neural network model can be adjusted to correspond to battery changes in State of Health (SOH).</description>

      <title>Revealing the Relationship Between Publication Bias and Chemical Reactivity with Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A synthetic method's substrate tolerance and generality are often showcased in a "substrate scope" table. However, substrate selection exhibits a frequently discussed publication bias: unsuccessful experiments or low-yielding results are rarely reported. In this work, we explore more deeply the relationship between such publication bias and chemical reactivity beyond the simple analysis of yield distributions using a novel neural network training strategy, substrate scope contrastive learning. By treating reported substrates as positive samples and non-reported substrates as negative samples, our contrastive learning strategy teaches a model to group molecules within a numerical embedding space, based on historical trends in published substrate scope tables. Training on 20,798 aryl halides in the CAS Content Collection$^{\text{TM}}$, spanning thousands of publications from 2010-2015, we demonstrate that the learned embeddings exhibit a correlation with physical organic reactivity descriptors through both intuitive visualizations and quantitative regression analyses. Additionally, these embeddings are applicable to various reaction modeling tasks like yield prediction and regioselectivity prediction, underscoring the potential to use historical reaction data as a pre-training task. This work not only presents a chemistry-specific machine learning training strategy to learn from literature data in a new way, but also represents a unique approach to uncover trends in chemical reactivity reflected by trends in substrate selection in publications.</description>

      <title>Investigating the hyperparameter space of deep neural network models for reaction coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying reaction coordinates (RCs) is a key to understanding the mechanism of reactions in complex systems. Deep neural network (DNN) and machine learning approaches have become a powerful tool to find the RC. On the other hand, the hyperparameters that determine the DNN model structure can be highly flexible and are often selected intuitively and in a non-trivial and tedious manner. Furthermore, how the hyperparameter choice affects the RC quality remains obscure. Here, we explore the hyperparameter space by developing the hyperparameter tuning approach for the DNN model for RC and investigate how the parameter set affects the RC quality. The DNN model is built to predict the committor along the RC from various collective variables by minimizing the cross-entropy function; the hyperparameters are automatically determined using the Bayesian optimization method. The approach is applied to study the isomerization of alanine dipeptide in vacuum and in water, and the features that characterize the RC are extracted using the explainable AI (XAI) tools. The results show that the DNN models with diverse structures can describe the RC with similar accuracy, and furthermore, the features analyzed by XAI are highly similar. This indicates that the hyperparameter space is multimodal. The electrostatic potential from the solvent to the hydrogen H18 plays an important role in the RC in water. The current study shows that the structure of the DNN models can be rather flexible, while the suitably optimized models share the same features; therefore, a common mechanism from the RC can be extracted.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Bethe-Salpeter equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation has been extensively employed to compute the two-body electron-hole propagator and its poles which correspond to the neutral excitation energies of the system. Through a different time-ordering, the two-body Green's function can also describe the propagation of two electrons or two holes. The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules. The description of double core hole states is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the forces: assessing non-conservative force models for atomistic machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of machine learning to estimate the energy of a group of atoms, and the forces that drive them to more stable configurations, have revolutionized the fields of computational chemistry and materials discovery. In this domain, rigorous enforcement of symmetry and conservation laws has traditionally been considered essential. For this reason, interatomic forces are usually computed as the derivatives of the potential energy, ensuring energy conservation. Several recent works have questioned this physically-constrained approach, suggesting that using the forces as explicit learning targets yields a better trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency - and that energy conservation can be learned during training. The present work investigates the applicability of such non-conservative models in microscopic simulations. We identify and demonstrate several fundamental issues, from ill-defined convergence of geometry optimization to instability in various types of molecular dynamics. Contrary to the case of rotational symmetry, lack of energy conservation is hard to learn, control, and correct. The best approach to exploit the acceleration afforded by direct force evaluation might be to use it in tandem with a conservative model, reducing - rather than eliminating - the additional cost of backpropagation, but avoiding most of the pathological behavior associated with non-conservative forces.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetry rules of response properties in certain chemical spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic BN-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. Response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power.</description>
