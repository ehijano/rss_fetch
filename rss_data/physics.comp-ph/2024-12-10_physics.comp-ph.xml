      <title>Thermal Slip Length at a Liquid/Solid Interface: Power Law Relations From Spatial and Frequency Attributes of the Contact Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specialty integrated chips for power intensive tasks like artificial intelligence generate so much heat that data centers are switching to liquid cooling to prevent malfunction. A critical factor hindering optimization of the thermal flux across the liquid/solid (L/S) interface is the lack of any predictive model for the thermal slip length at non-cryogenic temperatures. An extensive study using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveals distinct power law relations governing this length scale which incorporate the influence of local temperature, in-plane translational order and vibrational frequency of the liquid contact layer and adjoining solid layer. Similar relations are expected to hold for other L/S systems modeled by the Lennard-Jones potential given the principle of corresponding states.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation. Part II: Hybridisation with the Proper Generalised Decomposition for non-linear surrogate modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a hybrid approach that combines the Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) with deep learning techniques to provide real-time solutions for parametrised mechanics problems. By relying on a tensor decomposition, the proposed method addresses the curse of dimensionality in parametric computations, enabling efficient handling of high-dimensional problems across multiple physics and configurations. Each mode in the tensor decomposition is generated by a sparse neural network within the Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation (FENNI) framework presented in Part I, where network parameters are constrained to replicate the classical shape functions used in the Finite Element Method. This constraint enhances the interpretability of the model, facilitating transfer learning, which improves significantly the robustness and cost of the training process. The FENNI framework also enables finding the optimal spatial and parametric discretisation dynamically during training, which accounts to optimising the model's architecture on the fly. This hybrid framework offers a flexible and interpretable solution for real-time surrogate modelling. We highlight the efficiency of the FENNI-PGD approach through 1D and 2D benchmark problems, validating its performance against analytical and numerical reference solutions. The framework is illustrated through linear and non-linear elasticity problems, showing the flexibility of the method in terms of changes in physics.</description>

      <title>Scope of physics-based simulation artefacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data and metadata documentation requirements for explainable-AI-ready (XAIR) models and data in physics-based simulation technology are discussed by analysing different perspectives from the literature on two core aspects: First, the scope of the simulation; this category is taken to include subject matter, the objective with which the simulation is conducted, and the object of reference, i.e., the simulated physical system or process. Second, the artefacts that need to be documented in order to make data and models XAIR, and modelling and simulation workflows explainable; two CEN workshop agreements, MODA and ModGra, are compared for this purpose. As a result, minimum requirements for an ontologization of the scope of simulation artefacts are formulated, and the object-objective abstractness diagram is proposed as a tool for visualizing the landscape of use cases for physics-based simulation.</description>

      <title>A Three-Tiered Hierarchical Computational Framework Bridging Molecular Systems and Junction-Level Charge Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method combined with ab initio calculations has been widely used to study charge transport in molecular junctions. However, the significant computational demands of high-resolution calculations for all device components pose challenges in simulating junctions with complex molecular structures and understanding the functionality of molecular devices. In this study, we developed a series of approximation methods capable of effectively handling the molecular Hamiltonian, electrode self-energy, and their interfacial coupling at different levels of approximation. These methods, as three-tiered hierarchical levels, enable efficient charge transport computations ranging from individual molecules to complete junction systems, achieving an optimal balance between computational cost and accuracy, and are able to addresses specific research objectives by isolating and analyzing the dominant factors governing charge transport. Integrated into a Question-Driven Hierarchical Computation (QDHC) framework, we show this three-tiered framework significantly enhances the efficiency of analyzing charge transport mechanisms, as validated through a series of benchmark studies on diverse molecular junction systems, demonstrating its capability to accurately and efficiently elucidate charge transport mechanisms in complex molecular devices.</description>

      <title>An efficiency and memory-saving programming paradigm for the unified gas-kinetic scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, non-equilibrium flows have gained significant attention in aerospace engineering and micro-electro-mechanical systems. The unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) follows the methodology of direct modeling to couple particle collisions and free transport during gas evolution. However, like other discrete-velocity-based methods, the UGKS faces challenges related to high memory requirements and computational costs, such as the possible consumption of $1.32$ TB of memory when using $512$ cores for the simulations of the hypersonic flow around an X38-like space vehicle. This paper introduces a new UGKS programming paradigm for unstructured grids, focusing on reducing memory usage and improving parallel efficiency. By optimizing the computational sequence, the current method enables each cell in physical space to store only the distribution function for the discretized velocity space, eliminating the need to retain the entire velocity space for slopes and residuals. Additionally, the parallel communication is enhanced through the use of non-blocking MPI. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new strategy in the programming effectively simulates non-equilibrium problems while achieving high computational efficiency and low memory consumption. For the hypersonic flow around an X38-like space vehicle, the simulation, which utilizes $1,058,685$ physical mesh cells and $4,548$ discrete velocity space mesh cells, requires only $168.12$ GB of memory when executed on $512$ CPU cores. This indicates that memory consumption in the UGKS is much reduced. This new programming paradigm can serve as a reference for discrete velocity methods for solving kinetic equations.</description>

      <title>PyPSA-Spain: an extension of PyPSA-Eur to model the Spanish energy system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents PyPSA-Spain, an open-source model of the Spanish energy system based on the European model PyPSA-Eur. It aims to leverage the benefits of single-country modelling over a multi-country approach. In particular, several databases provided by Spanish institutions are exploited to improve the estimation of solar photovoltaic (PV) and onshore wind generation hourly profiles, as well as the spatio-temporal description of the electricity demand. PyPSA-Spain attains hourly resolution for a entire year and represents the Spanish energy system using a configurable number of nodes, while selecting around 35-50 nodes is identified as a good compromise between spatial resolution and model simplicity. To accommodate cross-border interactions, a nested model approach with PyPSA-Eur was used, wherein time-dependent electricity prices from neighbouring countries were precomputed through the optimisation of the European energy system. As a case study, the optimal electricity mix for 2030 was obtained and compared with the latest update of the Spanish National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) from September 2024.</description>

      <title>Mapping The Layers of The Ocean Floor With a Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mapping of ocean floor layers is a current challenge for the oil industry. Existing solution methods involve mapping through seismic methods and wave inversion, which are complex and computationally expensive. The introduction of artificial neural networks, specifically UNet, to predict velocity models based on seismic shots reflected from the ocean floor shows promise for optimising this process. In this study, two neural network architectures are validated for velocity model inversion and compared in terms of stability metrics such as loss function and similarity coefficient, as well as the differences between predicted and actual models. Indeed, neural networks prove promising as a solution to this challenge, achieving S{\o}rensen-Dice coefficient values above 70%.</description>

      <title>Detection of Surface Waves During Femtosecond Filamentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort pulsed lasers (USPL) can produce thin columns of plasma in air via femtosecond filamentation, and these plasmas have been found to generate broadband TeraHertz (THz) and Radio Frequency (RF) radiation. A recent theory argues that the currents driven at the boundary of the plasma excite a Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) surface wave (in particular a Sommerfeld-Goubau wave given the cylindrical symmetry), which proceeds to detach from the end of the plasma to become the RF pulse. We have performed near-field measurements of these plasmas with a D-dot probe, and find an excellent agreement with this theory. The radial field dependence is precisely fit by a Hankel function, with an outer length scale in agreement with plasma conductivity and radius, and a measured longitudinal drift in frequency maxima closely matches both SPP simulations and analytic expectations.</description>

      <title>Temporal modulation on mixed convection in turbulent channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied flow organization and heat transfer properties in mixed turbulent convection within Poiseuille-Rayleigh-B\'enard channels subjected to temporally modulated sinusoidal wall temperatures. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations were performed for Rayleigh numbers ranging from $10^6 \leq Ra \leq 10^8$, a Prandtl number $Pr = 0.71$, and a bulk Reynolds number $Re_b \approx 5623$. We found that high-frequency wall temperature oscillations had minimal impact on flow structures, while low-frequency oscillations induced adaptive changes, forming stable stratified layers during cooling. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis revealed a dominant streamwise unidirectional shear flow mode. Large-scale rolls oriented in the streamwise direction appeared as higher POD modes and were significantly influenced by lower-frequency wall temperature variations. Long-time averaged statistics showed that the Nusselt number increased with decreasing frequency by up to 96\%, while the friction coefficient varied by less than 15\%. High-frequency modulation predominantly influenced near-wall regions, enhancing convective effects, whereas low frequencies reduced these effects via stable stratified layer formation. Phase-averaged statistics showed that high-frequency modulation resulted in phase-stable streamwise velocity and temperature profiles, while low-frequency modulation caused significant variations due to weakened turbulence. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles remained high near the wall during both heating and cooling at high frequency, but decreased during cooling at low frequencies. TKE budget analysis revealed that during heating, TKE production was dominated by shear near the wall and by buoyancy in the bulk region; while during cooling, the production, distribution, and dissipation of TKE were all nearly zero.</description>

      <title>A Diffeomorphic Variable-Step Finite Difference Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces an approach to variable-step Finite Difference Method (FDM) where non-uniform meshes are generated via a weight function, which establishes a diffeomorphism between uniformly spaced computational coordinates and variably spaced physical coordinates. We then derive finite difference approximations for derivatives on variable meshes in both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional cases, and discuss constraints on the weight function. To demonstrate efficacy, we apply the method to the two-dimensional time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for a harmonic oscillator, achieving improved eigenfunction resolution without increased computational cost.</description>

      <title>Local fermion-to-qudit mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic density-functional theory for the moving contact-line problem reveals fluid structure and emergence of a spatially distinct pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nanoscale effects controlling the dynamics of a contact line -- defined as the line formed at the junction of two fluid phases and a solid -- has been a longstanding problem in fluid mechanics pushing experimental and numerical methods to their limits. A major challenge is the multiscale nature of the problem, whereby nanoscale phenomena manifest themselves at the macroscale. To probe the nanoscale, not easily accessible to other methods, we propose a reductionist model that employs elements from statistical mechanics, namely dynamic-density-functional theory (DDFT), in a Navier-Stokes-like equation -- an approach we name hydrodynamic DDFT. The model is applied to an isothermal Lennard-Jones-fluid with no slip on a flat solid substrate. Our computations reveal fluid stratification with an oscillatory density structure close to the wall and the emergence of two distinct regions as the temperature increases: a region of compression on the vapor side of the liquid-vapour interface and an effective slip region of large shear on the liquid side. The compressive region spreads along the fluid interface at a lengthscale that increases faster than the width of the fluid interface with temperature, while the width of the slip region is bound by the oscillatory fluid density structure and is constrained to a few particle diameters from the wall. Both compressive and shear effects may offset contact line friction, while compression in particular has a disproportionately high effect on the speed of advancing contact lines at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation. Part I: Interpretable and Adaptive Discretization for Solving PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation (FENNI) framework, a sparse neural network architecture extending previous work on Embedded Finite Element Neural Networks (EFENN) introduced with the Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Networks (HiDeNN). Due to their mesh-based structure, EFENN requires significantly fewer trainable parameters than fully connected neural networks, with individual weights and biases having a clear interpretation.
  Our FENNI framework, within the EFENN framework, brings improvements to the HiDeNN approach. First, we propose a reference element-based architecture where shape functions are defined on a reference element, enabling variability in interpolation functions and straightforward use of Gaussian quadrature rules for evaluating the loss function. Second, we propose a pragmatic multigrid training strategy based on the framework's interpretability. Third, HiDeNN's combined rh-adaptivity is extended from 1D to 2D, with a new Jacobian-based criterion for adding nodes combining h- and r-adaptivity. From a deep learning perspective, adaptive mesh behavior through rh-adaptivity and the multigrid approach correspond to transfer learning, enabling FENNI to optimize the network's architecture dynamically during training.
  The framework's capabilities are demonstrated on 1D and 2D test cases, where its accuracy and computational cost are compared against an analytical solution and a classical FEM solver. On these cases, the multigrid training strategy drastically improves the training stage's efficiency and robustness. Finally, we introduce a variational loss within the EFENN framework, showing that it performs as well as energy-based losses and outperforms residual-based losses. This framework is extended to surrogate modeling over the parametric space in Part II.</description>

      <title>Scalable Training of Neural Network Potentials for Complex Interfaces Through Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural network (ANN) potentials enable highly accurate atomistic simulations of complex materials at unprecedented scales. Despite their promise, training ANN potentials to represent intricate potential energy surfaces (PES) with transferability to diverse chemical environments remains computationally intensive, especially when atomic force data are incorporated to improve PES gradients. Here, we present an efficient ANN potential training methodology that uses Gaussian process regression (GPR) to incorporate atomic forces into ANN training, leading to accurate PES models with fewer additional first-principles calculations and a reduced computational effort for training. Our GPR-ANN approach generates synthetic energy data from force information in the reference dataset, thus augmenting the training datasets and bypassing direct force training. Benchmark tests on hybrid density-functional theory data for ethylene carbonate (EC) molecules and Li metal-EC interfaces, relevant for lithium metal battery applications, demonstrate that GPR-ANN potentials achieve accuracies comparable to fully force-trained ANNs with a significantly reduced computational overhead. Detailed comparisons show that the method improves both data efficiency and scalability for complex interfaces and heterogeneous environments. This work establishes the GPR-ANN method as a powerful and scalable framework for constructing high-fidelity machine learning interatomic potentials, offering the computational and memory efficiency critical for the large-scale simulations needed for the simulation of materials interfaces.</description>

      <title>A review of low-rank methods for time-dependent kinetic simulations</title>

Abstract: Time-dependent kinetic models are ubiquitous in computational science and engineering. The underlying integro-differential equations in these models are high-dimensional, comprised of a six--dimensional phase space, making simulations of such phenomena extremely expensive. In this article we demonstrate that in many situations, the solution to kinetics problems lives on a low dimensional manifold that can be described by a low-rank matrix or tensor approximation. We then review the recent development of so-called low-rank methods that evolve the solution on this manifold. The two classes of methods we review are the dynamical low-rank (DLR) method, which derives differential equations for the low-rank factors, and a Step-and-Truncate (SAT) approach, which projects the solution onto the low-rank representation after each time step. Thorough discussions of time integrators, tensor decompositions, and method properties such as structure preservation and computational efficiency are included. We further show examples of low-rank methods as applied to particle transport and plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>A brief introduction to the diffusion Monte Carlo method and the fixed-node approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods represent a powerful family of computational techniques for tackling complex quantum many-body problems and performing calculations of stationary state properties. QMC is among the most accurate and powerful approaches to the study of electronic structure, but its application is often hindered by a steep learning curve, hence it is rarely addressed in undergraduate and postgraduate classes. This tutorial is a step towards filling this gap. We offer an introduction to the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method, which aims to solve the imaginary time Schr\"odinger equation through stochastic sampling of the configuration space. Starting from the theoretical foundations, the discussion leads naturally to the formulation of a step-by-step algorithm. To illustrate how the method works in simplified scenarios, examples such as the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom are provided. The discussion extends to the fixed-node approximation, a crucial approach for addressing the fermionic sign problem in multi-electron systems. In particular, we examine the influence of trial wavefunction nodal surfaces on the accuracy of DMC energy by evaluating results from a non-interacting two-fermion system. Extending the method to excited states is feasible in principle, but some additional considerations are needed, supported by practical insights. By addressing the fundamental concepts from a hands-on perspective, we hope this tutorial will serve as a valuable guide for researchers and students approaching DMC for the first time.</description>

      <title>Multifidelity Uncertainty Quantification for Ice Sheet Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ice sheet simulations suffer from vast parametric uncertainties, such as the basal sliding boundary condition or geothermal heat flux. Quantifying the resulting uncertainties in predictions is of utmost importance to support judicious decision-making, but high-fidelity simulations are too expensive to embed within uncertainty quantification (UQ) computations. UQ methods typically employ Monte Carlo simulation to estimate statistics of interest, which requires hundreds (or more) of ice sheet simulations. Cheaper low-fidelity models are readily available (e.g., approximated physics, coarser meshes), but replacing the high-fidelity model with a lower fidelity surrogate introduces bias, which means that UQ results generated with a low-fidelity model cannot be rigorously trusted. Multifidelity UQ retains the high-fidelity model but expands the estimator to shift computations to low-fidelity models, while still guaranteeing an unbiased estimate. Through this exploitation of multiple models, multifidelity estimators guarantee a target accuracy at reduced computational cost. This paper presents a comprehensive multifidelity UQ framework for ice sheet simulations. We present three multifidelity UQ approaches -- Multifidelity Monte Carlo, Multilevel Monte Carlo, and the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator -- that enable tractable UQ for continental-scale ice sheet simulations. We demonstrate the techniques on a model of the Greenland ice sheet to estimate the 2015-2050 ice mass loss, verify their estimates through comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, and give a comparative performance analysis. For a target accuracy equivalent to 1 mm sea level rise contribution at 95% confidence, the multifidelity estimators achieve computational speedups of two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fractional discrete NLS equations: dispersion relations, rogue waves, fundamental and vortex solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce physically relevant new models of two-dimensional (2D) fractional lattice media accounting for the interplay of fractional intersite coupling and onsite self-focusing. Our approach features novel discrete fractional operators based on an appropriately modified definition of the continuous Riesz fractional derivative. The model of the 2D isotropic lattice employs the discrete fractional Laplacian, whereas the 2D anisotropic system incorporates discrete fractional derivatives acting independently along orthogonal directions with different L\'evy indices (LIs). We derive exact linear dispersion relations (DRs), and identify spectral bands that permit linear modes to exist, finding them to be similar to their continuous counterparts, apart from differences in the wavenumber range. Additionally, the modulational instability in the discrete models is studied in detail, and, akin to the linear DRs, it is found to align with the situation in continuous models. This consistency highlights the nature of our newly defined discrete fractional derivatives. Furthermore, using Gaussian inputs, we produce a variety of rogue-wave structures. By means of numerical methods, we systematically construct families of 2D fundamental and vortex solitons, and examine their stability. Fundamental solitons maintain the stability due to the discrete nature of the interactions, preventing the onset of the critical and supercritical collapse. On the other hand, vortex solitons are unstable in the isotropic lattice model. However, the anisotropic one -- in particular, its symmetric version with equal LIs acting in both directions -- maintains stable vortex solitons with winding numbers $S=1$ and $S=3$. The detailed results stress the robustness of the newly defined discrete fractional Laplacian in supporting well-defined soliton modes in the 2D lattice media.</description>

      <title>Is the neural tangent kernel of PINNs deep learning general partial differential equations always convergent ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the neural tangent kernel (NTK) for general partial differential equations (PDEs) based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). As we all know, the training of an artificial neural network can be converted to the evolution of NTK. We analyze the initialization of NTK and the convergence conditions of NTK during training for general PDEs. The theoretical results show that the homogeneity of differential operators plays a crucial role for the convergence of NTK. Moreover, based on the PINNs, we validate the convergence conditions of NTK using the initial value problems of the sine-Gordon equation and the initial-boundary value problem of the KdV equation.</description>

      <title>Machine learning interatomic potential for the low-modulus Ti-Nb-Zr alloys in the vicinity of dynamical instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, alloying and thermal treatment are considered as the main tools for design of new materials. Application of first-principles simulations can significantly accelerate the process of materials design, however, to account for both, multicomponent chemical disorder and finite temperature effects in theoretical simulations is a challenging task. In this work we have trained machine learning interatomic potential to effectively simulate finite temperature elastic properties of multicomponent \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys. Our simulations predict the presence of the elinvar effect for the wide range of temperatures. Importantly, we predict that in a vicinity of dynamical and mechanical instability, the \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys demonstrate strongly non-linear concentration-dependence of elastic moduli, which leads to low values of moduli comparable to that of human bone. Moreover, these alloys demonstrate a strong anisotropy of directional Young's modulus which can be helpful for microstructure tailoring and design of materials with desired elastic properties.</description>

Abstract: Organic molecular crystals are ideally placed to become next-generation piezoelectric materials due to their diverse chemistries that can be used to engineer tailor-made solid-state assemblies. Using crystal engineering principles, and techniques such as co-crystallisation, these materials can be engineered to have a wide range of electromechanical properties. For materials that have been structurally characterised by methods such as X-Ray Diffraction, computational chemistry is an effective tool to predict their electromechanical properties, allowing researchers to screen these molecular crystals and identify materials best suited to their chosen application. Here we present our database of small molecular crystals, and their Density Functional Theory (DFT) predicted electromechanical properties, CrystalDFT (https://actuatelab.ie/CrystalDFT). We highlight the broad range of electromechanical properties amongst this primary dataset, and in particular, the high number of crystals that have a naturally occurring longitudinal d33 constant. This longitudinal electromechanical coupling is a prerequisite for several conventional sensing and energy harvesting applications, the presence of which is notably rare amongst the literature on biomolecular crystal piezoelectricity to date.</description>

      <title>Effect of simple shear on knotted polymer coils and globules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the effect of Couette flow on knotted linear polymer chains with extensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Hydrodynamic interactions are accounted for by means of Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD). The polymer chain, containing originally a simple trefoil knot at rest, is described by a coarse-grained bead-spring model in a coil or globular state. We demonstrate that under shear existing loosely localized knots in polymer coils typically tighten to several segments beyond a certain shear rate threshold. At large shear rates the polymer undergoes a tumbling-like motion during which knot sizes can fluctuate. In contrast, sheared knotted globules unwind into a convoluted pearl-necklace structure of sub-globules that folds back onto itself and in which knot types change over time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently been extensively applied to model the time-evolution in fluid dynamics, weather predictions, and even chaotic systems thanks to their ability to capture temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in data. Here we present a RNN model based on convolutional neural networks for modeling the nonlinear non-adiabatic dynamics of hybrid quantum-classical systems. The dynamical evolution of the hybrid systems is governed by equations of motion for classical degrees of freedom and von Neumann equation for electrons. The physics-aware recurrent convolutional (PARC) neural network structure incorporates a differentiator-integrator architecture that inductively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of generic physical systems. Validation studies show that the trained PARC model could reproduce the space-time evolution of a one-dimensional semi-classical Holstein model {with comparable accuracy to direct numerical simulations}. We also investigate the scaling of prediction errors with size of training dataset, prediction window, step-size, and model size.</description>

      <title>Can Neural Networks Learn Nanoscale Friction?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current nanofriction experiments on crystals, both tip-on-surface and surface-on-surface, provide force traces as their sole output, typically exhibiting atomic size stick-slip oscillations. Physically interpreting these traces is a task left to the researcher. Historically done by hand, it generally consists in identifying the parameters of a Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model that best reproduces these traces. This procedure is both work-intensive and quite uncertain. We explore in this work how machine learning (ML) could be harnessed to do that job with optimal results, and minimal human work. A set of synthetic force traces is produced by PT model simulations covering a large span of parameters, and a simple neural network (NN) perceptron is trained with it. Once this trained NN is fed with experimental force traces, it will ideally output the PT parameters that best approximate them. By following this route step by step, we encountered and solved a variety of problems which proved most instructive and revealing. In particular, and very importantly, we met unexpected inaccuracies with which one or another parameter was learned by the NN. The problem, we then show, could be eliminated by proper manipulations and augmentations operated on the training force traces, and that without extra efforts and without injecting experimental informations. Direct application to the sliding of a graphene coated AFM tip on a variety of 2D materials substrates validates and encourages use of this ML method as a ready tool to rationalise and interpret future stick-slip nanofriction data.</description>

      <title>Multi-soliton solutions and data-driven discovery of higher-order Burgers' hierarchy equations with physics informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Burgers hierarchy consists of nonlinear evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) with progressively higher-order dispersive and nonlinear terms. Notable members of this hierarchy are the Burgers equation and the Sharma-Tasso-Olver equation, which are widely applied in fields such as plasma physics, fluid mechanics, optics, and biophysics to describe nonlinear waves in inhomogeneous media. Various soliton and multi-soliton solutions to these equations have been identified and the fission and fusion of solitons have been studied using analytical and numerical techniques. Recently, deep learning methods, particularly Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), have emerged as a new approach for solving PDEs. These methods use deep neural networks to minimize PDE residuals while fitting relevant data. Although PINNs have been applied to equations like Burgers' and Korteweg-de Vries, higher-order members of the Burgers hierarchy remain unexplored in this context. In this study, we employ a PINN algorithm to approximate multi-soliton solutions of linear combinations of equations within the Burgers hierarchy. This semi-supervised approach encodes the PDE and relevant data, determining PDE parameters and resolving the linear combination to discover the PDE that describes the data. Additionally, we employ gradient-enhanced PINNs (gPINNs) and a conservation law, specific to the generic Burgers' hierarchy, to improve training accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs in describing multi-soliton solutions within the generic Burgers' hierarchy, their robustness to increased levels of data noise, and their limited yet measurable predictive capabilities. They also verify the potential for training refinement and accuracy improvement using enhanced approaches in certain cases, while enabling the discovery of the PDE model that describes the observed solitary structures.</description>

Abstract: The transfer and storage of quantum information in a hybrid quantum system, consisting of an ensemble of atoms or spins interacting with a cavity, is adversely affected by the inhomogeneity of the spins, which negates the coherent exchange of excitations between the physical components. Using a full quantum treatment based on variational renormalization group, we show how quantum information encoded in the states of a parametrically driven hybrid system is strongly protected against any decoherence that may arise due to the inhomogeneity in the spin-ensemble.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic phases of electron-doped infinite-layer Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$CuO$_2$ are elucidated by first-principles density functional calculations. The antiferromagnetic parent state, metallic transition, as well as lattice evolution with doping and pressure are found to be consistent with experiments. The specific heat coefficient $\gamma$, magnetic exchange coupling $J$, as well as the density of states at Fermi level $N(0)$ of low-energy states with multiple magnetic configurations are investigated. We highlight a subset of such states in which we note an increase in $N(0)$ to suggest the interesting effects of magnetic fluctuations and La substitution on the electronic structure of this material.</description>

      <title>TriMe++: Multi-threaded triangular meshing in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TriMe++, a multi-threaded software library designed for generating two-dimensional meshes for intricate geometric shapes using the Delaunay triangulation. Multi-threaded parallel computing is implemented throughout the meshing procedure, making it suitable for fast generation of large-scale meshes. Three iterative meshing algorithms are implemented: the DistMesh algorithm, the centroidal Voronoi diagram meshing, and a hybrid of the two. We compare the performance of the three meshing methods in TriMe++, and show that the hybrid method retains the advantages of the other two. The software library achieves significant parallel speedup when generating large-scale meshes containing between $10^4$ to $10^7$ points. TriMe++ can handle complicated geometries and generates adaptive meshes of high quality.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Secondary and Backscattered Electron Energy Spectra and Yields Analysis: from Theory to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07521v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Response Theory for Pumped Systems and its Application to Transient Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the two-time linear response theory for out-of-equilibrium pumped systems, generic pump-probe delays and probe frequencies. Such a theory enormously simplifies the numerical calculations, for instance, of the optical conductivity with respect to the actual procedure, which requires computing the effect of the probe pulse for each time delay with respect to the pump pulse. The theory is given for a generic observable and pumped Hamiltonian and then specialized for a system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and its transient optical properties, exploiting the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA). The theory is complemented by a set of crucial numerical guidelines that help perform actual calculations in a computationally affordable way. The optical response (differential transient reflectivity and absorption) of a prototypical three-band (core, valence, and conduction) model in the XUV regime is analyzed in detail to illustrate the theory and its application. Using some generalizations of the density of states, we provide a systematic approach to exploring the optical properties in terms of the system band structure features and the pump parameters. Such an analysis can be extremely helpful in understanding the actual results of experimental optical measurements. Moreover, we study the effects of inter-band and intra-band transitions, the local dipole coupling, and single and multi-photon processes. The latter is further investigated by varying the central frequency of the pump pulse to have different regions of the first Brillouin zone in resonance with it. We also study the effect of varying the pump pulse intensity. Finally, we study and analyze the transient optical properties in the probe pulse regime of IR and visible.</description>

      <title>A narrow band finite element method for the level set equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite element method is introduced to track interface evolution governed by the level set equation. The method solves for the level set indicator function in a narrow band around the interface. An extension procedure, which is essential for a narrow band level set method, is introduced based on a finite element $L^2$- or $H^1$-projection combined with the ghost-penalty method. This procedure is formulated as a linear variational problem in a narrow band around the surface, making it computationally efficient and suitable for rigorous error analysis. The extension method is combined with a discontinuous Galerkin space discretization and a BDF time-stepping scheme. The paper analyzes the stability and accuracy of the extension procedure and evaluates the performance of the resulting narrow band finite element method for the level set equation through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Burst-tree structure and higher-order temporal correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding characteristics of temporal correlations in time series is crucial for developing accurate models in natural and social sciences. The burst-tree decomposition method was recently introduced to reveal higher-order temporal correlations in time series in a form of an event sequence, in particular, the hierarchical structure of bursty trains of events for the entire range of timescales [Jo et al., Sci.~Rep.~\textbf{10}, 12202 (2020)]. Such structure has been found to be simply characterized by the burst-merging kernel governing which bursts are merged together as the timescale for defining bursts increases. In this work, we study the effects of kernels on the higher-order temporal correlations in terms of burst size distributions, memory coefficients for bursts, and the autocorrelation function. We employ several kernels, including the constant, sum, product, and diagonal kernels as well as those inspired by empirical results. We generically find that kernels with preferential merging lead to heavy-tailed burst size distributions, while kernels with assortative merging lead to positive correlations between burst sizes. The decaying exponent of the autocorrelation function depends not only on the kernel but also on the power-law exponent of the interevent time distribution. In addition, thanks to the analogy to the coagulation process, analytical solutions of burst size distributions for some kernels could be obtained. Our findings may shed light on the role of burst-merging kernels as underlying mechanisms of higher-order temporal correlations in time series.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Enhancing creep resistance in refractory high-entropy alloys: role of grain size and local chemical order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are a promising class of materials with potential applications in extreme environments, where the dominant failure mode is thermal creep. The design of these alloys, therefore, requires an understanding of how their microstructure and local chemical distribution affect creep behavior. In this study, we performed high-fidelity atomistic simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials to explore the creep deformation of MoNbTaW RHEAs under a wide range of stress and temperature conditions. We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which are controllable during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced by larger grain sizes and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.</description>
