      <title>Ultrasensitivity without conformational spread: A mechanical origin for non-equilibrium cooperativity in the bacterial flagellar motor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flagellar motors enable bacteria to navigate their environments by switching rotation direction in response to external cues with high sensitivity. Previous work suggested that ultrasensitivity of the flagellar motor originates from conformational spread, in which subunits of the switching complex are strongly coupled to their neighbors as in an equilibrium Ising model. However, dynamic single-motor measurements indicated that rotation switching is driven out of equilibrium, and the mechanism for this dissipative driving remains unknown. Here, based on recent cryo-EM structures, we propose that local mechanical torques on motor subunits can affect their conformation dynamics. This gives rise to a tug of war between stator-associated subunits, which produces cooperative, non-equilibrium switching responses without requiring nearest-neighbor interactions. Since subunits are effectively coupled at a distance, we call this mechanism ``Global Mechanical Coupling." Our model makes a qualitatively new prediction that the motor response cooperativity grows with the number of stators driving rotation. Re-analyzing published motor dose-response curves in varying load conditions, we find tentative experimental evidence for this prediction. Finally, we show that operating out of equilibrium enables motors to achieve high cooperativity with faster responses compared to equilibrium motors. Our results suggest a general role for mechanics in sensitive chemical regulation.</description>

      <title>Time scale competition in the Active Coagulation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spreading processes on top of active dynamics provide a novel theoretical framework for capturing emerging collective behavior in living systems. I consider run-and-tumble dynamics coupled with coagulation/decoagulation reactions that lead to an absorbing state phase transition. While the active dynamics does not change the location of the transition point, the relaxation toward the stationary state depends on motility parameters. Because of the competition between spreading dynamics and active motion, the system can support long-living currents whose typical time scale is a nontrivial function of motility and reaction rates. Beyond the mean-field regime, instability at finite length scales regulates a crossover from periodic to diffusive modes. Finally, it is possible to individuate different mechanisms of pattern formation on a large time scale, ranging from Fisher-Kolmogorov to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.</description>
