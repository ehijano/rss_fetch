      <title>Thermal boundary conductance of sharp metal-diamond interfaces predicted by machine learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport across sharp metal-diamond interfaces plays a critical role in the thermal management of future diamond-based ultrawide bandgap semiconductor devices. However, experimental thermal boundary conductance (TBC) values are mostly nonexistent, and current theoretical models are inaccurate in predicting the TBCs since accurate interatomic potentials of metal-diamond heterostructures are unavailable. In this letter, we show the prediction of TBCs of several practically promising sharp metal-diamond interfaces using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations by developing accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The predicted TBCs of Al, Mo, Zr, and Au-diamond interfaces are approximately 316, 88, 52, and 55 MW/m2K, respectively, after quantum corrections. The corresponding thermal boundary resistances (TBRs) are equivalent to 0.75-{\mu}m thick of Al, 1.38-{\mu}m Mo, 0.30-{\mu}m Zr and 5.28-{\mu}m Au, respectively. These low TBC values need to be considered in future diamond-based semiconductor designs. We also find that, the conventional simple models such as the acoustic mismatch model (AMM) and diffuse mismatch model (DMM), even including the full band phonon dispersion from first principles, largely mispredict the TBC because they do not include inelastic transmission as well as interfacial structural and bonding information. The quantum correction of TBC matches well with the quantum correction of phonon specific heat of metals, instead of diamond. Additionally, we reveal that the Debye temperature ratio is a better indicator of TBC than the elastic modulus ratio.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary segregation prediction with a dual-solute model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solute segregation along grain boundaries (GBs) profoundly affects their thermodynamic and kinetic behavior in polycrystalline materials. Recently, it has become a promising strategy for alloy design, mitigating grain growth by reducing excess GB energy and strengthening the GB network in nanocrystalline metals. In this context, the spectrum approach has emerged as a powerful tool to predict GB segregation. However, previous GB segregation predictions using this method relied heavily on single-solute segregation spectra, neglecting the crucial role of solute-solute interactions, which are often incorporated through a fitting parameter. In this work, we developed a dual-solute model whose segregation energy spectrum intrinsically considers the solute-solute interactions. Further improvement was made by describing the volume fraction of GBs as a varying parameter that scales with the total solute concentration and temperature. The refined dual-solute model was attempted to predict the GB segregation at finite temperatures in several binary systems. It shows significant improvement over the single-solute model and can accurately predict the hybrid Molecular Dynamics/Monte Carlo data within a broad temperature range with varying solute concentrations before forming secondary phases. This dual-solute model provides an effective way to statistically predict GB segregation with considerable accuracy in nanocrystalline metals.</description>

      <title>Magnetic anisotropy in single-crystalline antiferromagnetic Mn$_2$Au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple recent studies have identified the metallic antiferromagnet Mn$_2$Au to be a candidate for spintronic applications due to apparent in-plane anisotropy, preserved magnetic properties above room temperature, and current-induced N\'eel vector switching. Crystal growth is complicated by the fact that Mn$_2$Au melts incongruently. We present a bismuth flux method to grow millimeter-scale bulk single crystals of Mn$_2$Au in order to examine the intrinsic anisotropic electrical and magnetic properties. Flux quenching experiments reveal that the Mn$_2$Au crystals precipitate below 550{\deg}C, about 100{\deg}C below the decomposition temperature of Mn$_2$Au. Bulk Mn$_2$Au crystals have a room-temperature resistivity of 16-19 $\mu\Omega$-cm and a residual resistivity ratio of 41. Mn$_2$Au crystals have a dimensionless susceptibility on the order of 10$^{-4}$, comparable to calculated and experimental reports on powder samples. Single-crystal neutron diffraction confirms the in-plane magnetic structure. The tetragonal symmetry of Mn$_2$Au constrains the $ab$-plane magnetic susceptibility to be constant, meaning that $\chi_{100}=\chi_{110}$ in the low-field limit, below any spin-flop transition. We find that three measured magnetic susceptibilities $\chi_{100}$, $\chi_{110}$, and $\chi_{001}$ are the same order of magnitude and agree with the calculated prediction, meaning the low-field susceptibility of Mn$_2$Au is quite isotropic, despite clear differences in $ab$-plane and $ac$-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Mn$_2$Au is calculated to have an extremely high in-plane spin-flop field above 30 T, which is much larger than that of another in-plane antiferromagnet Fe$_2$As (less than 1 T). The subtle anisotropy of intrinsic susceptibilities may lead to dominating effects from shape, crystalline texture, strain, and defects in devices that attempt spin readout in Mn$_2$Au.</description>

      <title>DFT mediated X2AuYZ6 (X= Cs, Rb; Z= Cl, Br, I) double Perovskites for photovoltaic and wasted heat management device applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the phase stability, opto-electronic and thermo-electric behavior of X2AuYZ6 (X = Cs, Rb; Z = Cl/Br/I) double perovskite halides by using the DFT method. The compounds belong to the cubic arrangement and are verified by the tolerance and octahedral factor. Formation enthalpy and binding energy meet the requirements of structural stability. The ductility behavior was also confirmed by the Cauchy pressure, Pugh's ratio, and Poisson's ratio. The positive frequency of phonon dispersion except Rb2AuYI6 compound shows the dynamical stability and the negative formation energy of each identified competing phase confirms the thermo-dynamic equilibrium of all compounds. The band gap values of 2.85(2.91), 2.35(2.40), and 1.74(1.78) eV of Cs2AuYZ6 (Rb2AuYZ6) [Z = Cl, Br, I) double perovskites has been explored in the context of optoelectronic properties, and the results show that these materials might be useful in such devices. The spectral optical response covers the visible-to-UV area, which governs the solar cell and thermo-electric device applications. A comprehensive study of thermo-electric properties such as the thermal conductivity (electrical and electronic part), carrier concentration, thermo-power, and figure of merit was also observed. The investigated compounds [Cs (Rb)-based] exhibit ZT values of 0.51(0.55), 0.53(0.62), and 0.58(0.75) at room temperature with Cl, Br, and I respectively. Additional routine work was also done on the thermo-mechanical characteristics. These studies provide in-depth knowledge of these materials in preparation for their future use.</description>

      <title>Order evolution from a high-entropy matrix: understanding and predicting paths to low temperature equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in high-entropy inorganic compounds originates from their ability to stabilize cations and anions in local environments that rarely occur at standard temperature and pressure. This leads to new crystalline phases in many-cation formulations with structures and properties that depart from conventional trends. The highest-entropy homogeneous and random solid-solution is a parent structure from which a continuum of lower-entropy offspring can originate by adopting chemical and/or structural order. This report demonstrates how synthesis conditions, thermal history, and elastic and chemical boundary conditions conspire to regulate this process in Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O, during which coherent CuO nano-tweeds and spinel nano-cuboids evolve. We do so by combining structured synthesis routes, atomic-resolution microscopy and spectroscopy, density functional theory, and a phase field modeling framework that accurately predicts the emergent structure and local chemistry. This establishes a framework to appreciate, understand, and predict the macrostate spectrum available to a high-entropy system that is critical to rationalize property engineering opportunities.</description>

      <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis and Magnetic Properties of the Mixed-Valent Binary Silver(I,II) Fluorides, AgI2AgIIF4 and AgIAgIIF3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluoridoargentates(II) represent a fascinating class of silver(II) compounds that exhibit structural and magnetic similarities to cuprate superconductors. However, their synthesis is challenging, leaving their properties largely unexplored. In this study, mechanochemistry is introduced as a new technique for the synthesis of fluoridoargentates(II), which avoids the use of anhydrous HF or heating, and employs simple equipment. Furthermore, by ball milling of commercially available precursors, AgF and AgF2, we obtained the first two examples of binary mixed-valent silver(I,II) phases, AgI2AgIIF4 and AgIAgIIF3. While the AgI2AgIIF4 phase was obtained at room temperature, the AgIAgIIF3 phase is metastable and required milling under cryogenic conditions. Using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction, it was found that AgI2AgIIF4 crystallizes in the P21/c space group and is isostructural to beta-K2AgF4. Here, double-bridged [AgF6]4- octahedra form chains that propagate along the a-crystallographic direction, giving a quasi-1D canted antiferromagnetic character, as shown by magnetic susceptibility. The AgIAgIIF phase adopts the P-1 space group, is isostructural to AgCuF3 and shows features of a one-dimensional antiferromagnet. It is expected that this facile synthetic approach will enable the expansion of silver(II) chemistry and accelerate the search for a silver analogue to cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Low thermal boundary resistance at bonded GaN/diamond interface by controlling ultrathin heterogeneous amorphous layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal boundary resistance (TBR) in semiconductor-on-diamond structure bottlenecks efficient heat dissipation in electronic devices. In this study, to reduce the TBR between GaN and diamond, surface-activated bonding with a hybrid SiOx-Ar ion source was applied to achieve an ultrathin interfacial layer. The simultaneous surface activation and slow deposition of the SiOx binder layer enabled precise control over layer thickness (2.5-5.3 nm) and formation of an amorphous heterogeneous nanostructure comprising a SiOx region between two inter-diffusion regions. Crucially, the 2.5-nm-thick interfacial layer achieved a TBR of 8.3 m2-W/GW, a record low for direct-bonded GaN/diamond interface. A remarkable feature is that the TBR is extremely sensitive to the interfacial thickness; rapidly increasing to 34 m2-K/GW on doubling the thickness to 5.3 nm. Theoretical analysis revealed the origin of this increase: a diamond/SiOx interdiffusion layer extend the vibrational frequency, far-exceeding that of crystalline diamond, which increases the lattice vibrational mismatch and suppresses phonon transmission.</description>

      <title>Framework for Polarized Magnetic Neutron Scattering from Nanoparticle Assemblies with Vortex-Type Spin Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the recently introduced multi-nanoparticle power-series expansion method for the polarized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) cross section, we present analytical expressions for the polarized SANS observables arising from dilute nanoparticle assemblies with antisymmetric vortex-type spin structures. We establish connections between the magnetic correlation coefficients and the magnetic field-dependent vortex-axes distribution function, which is related to the random orientations of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy axes of the nanoparticles. Our analytical results are validated through a comparative analysis with micromagnetic simulations. This framework contributes to a comprehensive understanding of polarized magnetic neutron scattering from spherical nanoparticle systems exhibiting vortex-type spin structures.</description>

      <title>Phonon-driven wavefunction localization promotes room-temperature, pure single-photon emission in large organic-inorganic lead-halide quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In lead halide perovskites (APbX3), the effect of the A-site cation on optical and electronic properties has initially been thought to be marginal. Yet, evidence of beneficial effects on solar cell performance and light emission is accumulating. Here, we report that the A-cation in soft APbBr3 colloidal quantum dots (QDs) controls the phonon-induced localization of the exciton wavefunction. Insights from ab initio molecular dynamics and single-particle fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrate that anharmonic lattice vibrations and the resulting polymorphism act as an additional confinement potential. Avoiding the trade-off between single-photon purity and optical stability faced by downsizing conventional QDs into the strong confinement regime, dynamical phonon-induced confinement in large organic-inorganic perovskite QDs enables bright (10^6 photons/s), stable (&gt; 1h), and pure (&gt; 95%) single-photon emission in a widely tuneable spectral range (495-745 nm). Strong electron-phonon interaction in soft perovskite QDs provides an unconventional route toward the development of scalable room-temperature quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Optical signatures of type-II Weyl fermions in the noncentrosymmetric semimetals $R$AlSi ($R$=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals with magnetic ordering provide a promising platform for the investigation of rare topological effects such as the anomalous Hall effect, resulting from the interplay of nontrivial bands with various spin configurations. The materials $R$AlSi, where $R$ represents a rare-earth element, are prominent representatives of Weyl semimetals, where the Weyl states are induced by space inversion symmetry breaking and in addition, for several rare-earth elements $R$, enhanced by time-reversal symmetry breaking through the formation of a magnetic order at low temperature. We report optical signatures of Weyl fermions in the magnetic compounds CeAlSi, PrAlSi, NdAlSi, and SmAlSi as well as the non-magnetic family member LaAlSi by broad-frequency infrared spectroscopy at room temperature, i.e., in the paramagnetic phase. A similar profile of the optical conductivity spectrum and a metallic character are observed for all compounds, with LaAlSi showing the strongest free charge carrier contribution. Furthermore, the linear-in-frequency behavior of the optical conductivity of all investigated compounds indicates the presence of Weyl nodes in close vicinity of the Fermi energy, resulting from inversion symmetry breaking in noncentrosymmetric structures. According to the characteristics of these linear slopes, the $R$AlSi compounds are expected to host mainly type-II Weyl states with overtilted Weyl cones. The results are compared to the optical response of the closely related $R$AlGe materials, which are considered as potential hybridization-driven Weyl-Kondo systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of rapid solidification microstructure in additive manufacturing of a Magnesium alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioresorbable Mg-based alloys with low density, low elastic modulus, and excellent biocompatibility are outstanding candidates for temporary orthopedic implants. Coincidentally, metal additive manufacturing (AM) is disrupting the biomedical sector by providing fast access to patient-customized implants. Due to the high cooling rates associated with fusion-based AM techniques, they are often described as rapid solidification processes. However, conclusive observations or rapid solidification in metal AM -- attested by drastic microstructural changes induced by solute trapping, kinetic undercooling, or morphological transitions of the solid-liquid interface -- are scarce. Here we study the formation of banded microstructures during laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) of a biomedical-grade Magnesium-rare earth alloy, combining advanced characterization and state-of-the-art thermal and phase-field modeling. Our experiments unambiguously identify microstructures as the result of an oscillatory banding instability known from other rapid solidification processes. Our simulations confirm that LPBF-relevant solidification conditions strongly promote the development of banded microstructures in a Mg-Nd alloy. Simulations also allow us to peer into the sub-micrometer nanosecond-scale details of the solid-liquid interface evolution giving rise to the distinctive banded patterns. Since rapidly solidified Mg alloys may exhibit significantly different mechanical and corrosion response compared to their cast counterparts, the ability to predict the emergence of rapid solidification microstructures (and to correlate them with local solidification conditions) may open new pathways for the design of bioresorbable orthopedic implants, not only fitted geometrically to each patient, but also optimized with locally-tuned mechanical and corrosion properties.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale sensing of spatial correlations in nonequilibrium current noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centers are spatially resolved probes of current noise. So far, current noise sensing with NV centers has primarily been used as a way to probe equilibrium transport coefficients. We develop a framework for computing the spatiotemporal correlations of nonequilibrium current noise in the Boltzmann regime, and apply it to two-dimensional metals in current-biased steady states. We argue that the spatial structure of the noise reveals the nonequilibrium nature of the electron distribution function, and more generally reveals the nature and lifetimes of the excitations responsible for transport. We estimate the visibility of these signatures in near-term experiments.</description>

      <title>Twisted MoSe2 Homobilayer Behaving as a Heterobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures (HSs) formed by the transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) materials have shown great promise in next-generation opto/electronic and photonic applications. An artificially twisted HS, allows us to manipulate the optical, and electronic properties. With this work, we introduce the understanding of the complex energy transfer (ET) process governed by the dipolar interaction in a twisted molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) homobilayer without any charge-blocking interlayer. We fabricated an unconventional homobilayer (i.e., HS) with a large twist angle by combining the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and mechanical exfoliation (Exf.) techniques to fully exploit the lattice parameters mismatch and indirect/direct (CVD/Exf.) bandgap nature. This effectively weaken the charge transfer (CT) process and allows the ET process to take over the carrier recombination channels. We utilize a series of optical and electron spectroscopy techniques complementing by the density functional theory calculations, to describe a massive photoluminescence enhancement from the HS area due to an efficient ET process. Our results show that the electronically decoupled MoSe2 homobilayer is coupled by the ET process, mimicking a 'true' heterobilayer nature.</description>

      <title>Hybrid plasmonic Bound State in the Continuum entering the zeptomolar biodetection range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Bound States in the Continuum are peculiar localized states within the continuous spectrum that are unaffected by any far-field radiation and intrinsic absorption, therefore possessing infinite mode lifetime and Q-factor. To date they have been widely studied in dielectric structures whereas their exploitation in lossy media, i.e. plasmonic nanostructures, still remains a challenge. Here, we show the emergence of a hybrid BIC state in a 2D system of silver-filled dimers, quasi-embedded in a high-index dielectric waveguide. The hybrid BIC onset is found to be highly dependent on the bare modes' spectral and spatial overlap, but particularly on the plasmonic field's intensity. By tailoring the hybridizing plasmonic/photonic fractions we select an ideal coupling regime for which the mode exhibits both, high Q-factor values and strong near-field enhancement tightly confined in the nanogap and a consequently extremely small modal volume. We demonstrate that this optical layout can be exploited in a proof-of-concept experiment for the detection of TAR DNA-binding protein 43, which outperforms the sensitivity of current label-free biosensing platforms, reaching the zeptomolar range of concentration.</description>

      <title>Terahertz magneto-optical response in ferromagnetic Fe-Co-Al alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.05997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the magneto-optical properties of Fe-Co-Al ordered alloys in the terahertz range of frequencies. Using the standard Kubo-based approach to compute intrinsic part of the $\sigma_{xy}(\omega)$ we find a strong dependence of $\sigma_{xy}$ on $\omega$ in the terahertz range. For example, we find that below 10~THz Co$_3$Al has nearly constant $\sigma_{xy}$ and that above 10~THz it is reduced by about 50 times. Furthermore, we find a strong dependence of $\sigma_{xy}$ on the chemical composition. For example, we find that the addition of Al to Fe changes the sign of $\sigma_{xy}$, while the addition of Co to Fe leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of $\sigma_{xy}$ on Co concentration.</description>

      <title>Materials Properties Prediction (MAPP): Empowering the prediction of material properties solely based on chemical formulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting material properties has always been a challenging task in materials science. With the emergence of machine learning methodologies, new avenues have opened up. In this study, we build upon our recently developed Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to construct models that predict four distinct material properties. Our graph model represents materials as element graphs, with chemical formula serving as the only input. This approach ensures permutation invariance, offering a robust solution to prior limitations. By employing bootstrap methods to train on this individual GNN, we further enhance the reliability and accuracy of our predictions. With multi-task learning, we harness the power of extensive datasets to boost the performance of smaller ones. We introduce the inaugural version of the Materials Properties Prediction (MAPP) framework, empowering the prediction of material properties solely based on chemical formulas.</description>

      <title>Element-specific and high-bandwidth ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy with a coherent, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We applied a tabletop, ultrafast, high-harmonic generation (HHG) source to measure the element-specific ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in ultra-thin magnetic alloys and multilayers on an opaque Si substrate. We demonstrate a continuous wave bandwidth of 62 GHz, with promise to extend to 100 GHz or higher. This laboratory-scale instrument detects the FMR using ultrafast, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light, with photon energies spanning the M-edges of most relevant magnetic elements. An RF frequency comb generator is used to produce a microwave excitation that is intrinsically synchronized to the EUV pulses with a timing jitter of 1.1 ps or better. We apply this system to measure the dynamics in a multilayer system as well as Ni-Fe and Co-Fe alloys. Since this instrument operates in reflection-mode, it is a milestone toward measuring and imaging the dynamics of the magnetic state and spin transport of active devices on arbitrary and opaque substrates. The higher bandwidth also enables measurements of materials with high magnetic anisotropy, as well as ferrimagnets, antiferromagnets, and short-wavelength (high wavevector) spinwaves in nanostructures or nanodevices. Furthermore, the coherence and short wavelength of the EUV will enable extending these studies using dynamic nanoscale lensless imaging techniques such as coherent diffractive imaging, ptychography, and holography.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Electron Extraction in Co-Doped TiO2 Quantified by Drift-Diffusion Simulation for Stable CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar cells based on inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 are promising candidates to resolve the challenge of operational stability in the field of perovskite photovoltaics. For stable operation, however, it is crucial to thoroughly understand the extractive and recombinative processes occurring at the interfaces of perovskite and the charge-selective layers. In this study, we focus on the electronic properties of (doped) TiO2 as an electron-selective contact. We show via KPFM that co-doping of TiO2 with Nb(V) and Sn(IV) reduces the materials work function by 270 meV, giving it stronger n-type characteristics compared to Nb(V) mono-doped TiO2. The altered electronic alignment with CsPbI3 translates to enhanced electron extraction, as demonstrated with ssPL, trPL and trSPV in triad. Importantly, we extract crucial parameters, such as the concentration of extracted electrons and the interface hole recombination velocity, from the SPV transients via 2D drift-diffusion simulations. When implementing the co-doped TiO2 into full n-i-p solar cells, the operational stability is enhanced to 32000 h of projected TS80 lifetime. This study provides fundamental understanding of interfacial charge extraction and its correlation with operational stability of perovskite solar cells, which can be transferred to other charge-selective contacts.</description>

Abstract: Similarity between Walker and Helmholtz equations encouraged many to search for analogies between optical and spin wave phenomena. In the present article we demonstrate that one to one relationship can be established by formalizing the concept of magnetic refractive index and deriving on its basis Eikonal equations for magnetic media, formally proving that a very substantial portion of optical devices: lenses, mirrors, waveguides and so on, can be implemented as magnetic devices operating on spin waves instead of optical radiation. Controlling the refractive index is accomplished by changing the environmental variables such as magnetic bias field or temperature. Functionality of the above mentioned devices is confirmed with micromagnetic simulations, which also demonstrate a substantial agreement with the analytical model introduced in the present manuscript.</description>

Abstract: Efficient heuristics have predicted many functional materials such as high-temperature superconducting hydrides, while inorganic structural chemistry explains why and how the crystal structures are stabilized. Here we develop the paired mathematical programming formalism for searching and systematizing the structural prototypes of crystals. The first is the minimization of the volume of the unit cell under the constraints of only the minimum and maximum distances between pairs of atoms. We show the capabilities of linear relaxations of inequality constraints to optimize structures by the steepest-descent method, which is computationally very efficient. The second is the discrete optimization to assign five kinds of geometrical constraints including chemical bonds for pairs of atoms. Under the constraints, the two object functions, formulated as mathematical programming, are alternately optimized to realize the given coordination numbers of atoms. This approach successfully generates a wide variety of crystal structures of oxides such as spinel, pyrochlore-$\alpha$, and $\mathrm{K}_2 \mathrm{NiF}_4$ structures.</description>

      <title>A new non-extensive equation of state for the fluid phases of argon including the metastable states, from the melting line to 2300 K and 50 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:1504.00633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new equation of state for argon has been developed in view to extend the range of validity of the equation of state previously proposed by Tegeler et al. (Ref. 4) and to obtain a better physical description of the experimental thermodynamic data for the whole fluid region (single-phase, metastable and saturation states). As proposed by Tegeler et al., this equation is also based on a functional form of the residual part of the reduced Helmholtz free energy. However in this work, the fundamental equation for the Helmholtz free energy has been derived from the measured quantities CV(rho,T) and P(rho,T). The empirical description of the isochoric heat capacity CV(rho,T) is based on an original empirical description containing explicitly the metastable states. The thermodynamic properties (internal energy, entropy, free energy) are then obtained by combining integration of CV(rho,T). The arbitrary functions introduced by the integration process have been deduced from a comparison between calculated and experimental pressure P(rho,T) data. The new formulation is valid for the whole fluid region from the melting line to 2300 K and for pressures up to 50 GPa. It also predicts existence of a maximum of the isochoric heat capacity CV along isochors as experimentally observed in several other fluids. For many applications, an approximate form of the equation of state for the liquid phase may be sufficient. A Tait-Tammann equation is therefore proposed between the triple point temperature and 148 K.</description>

Abstract: The paper presents ab initio results on the structural phase stability of beryllium and magnesium crystals under high and ultrahigh pressures (multi-terapascal regime). Magnesium is shown to undergo a number of structural transformations which markedly reduce the crystal packing factor. As for beryllium, its high-pressure body-centered cubic phase remains stable even under ultrahigh pressures. Changes in the electronic structure of Be and Mg crystals under compression are analyzed and some interesting effects are revealed. Specifically, a narrow band gap appears in the electronic structure of magnesium under pressures above 2.5 TPa. For the metals of interest, PT-diagrams are constructed and compared with available experimental and theoretical results from other investigations.</description>

      <title>Molecular beam epitaxy of superconducting FeSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ thin films interfaced with magnetic topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Engineering heterostructures with various types of quantum materials can provide an intriguing playground for studying exotic physics induced by the proximity effect. Here, we report the successful synthesis of iron-based superconductor FeSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ (FST) thin films across the entire composition range of $0 \leq x \leq 1$ and its heterostructure with a magnetic topological insulator by using molecular beam epitaxy. Superconductivity is observed in the FST films with an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ $\sim$ 12 K at around x = 0.1. We found that superconductivity survives in the very Te-rich films ($x \leq 0.05$), showing stark contrast to bulk crystals with suppression of superconductivity due to an appearance of bicollinear antiferromagnetism accompanied by a monoclinic structural transition. By examining thickness $t$ dependence of magnetic susceptibility and electrical transport properties, we observed a trend where anomalies associated with the first order structural transition broaden in films with below $t \sim$ 100 nm. We infer this observation suggests a suppression of the structural instability near substrates. Furthermore, we fabricated an all chalcogenide-based heterointerface between FST and a magnetic topological insulator (Cr,Bi,Sb)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ for the first time, observing both superconductivity and a large anomalous Hall conductivity. The anomalous Hall conductivity increases with decreasing temperature, approaching the quantized value of $e^2/h$ down to the measurable minimum temperature at $T_c$. The result suggests coexistence of magnetic and superconducting gaps at low temperatures opening at the top and bottom surfaces, respectively. Our novel magnetic topological insulator/superconductor heterostructure could be an ideal platform to explore chiral Majorana edge mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the low-frequency electrodynamics in the vortex state of two type-II superconducting films, namely, a moderate-to-strongly pinned Niobium Nitride (NbN) and a very weakly pinned amorphous Molybdenum Germanium (a-MoGe). We employ a two-coil mutual inductance technique to extract the complex penetration depth, $\tilde{\lambda}$. The sample response is studied through the temperature variation of $\tilde{\lambda}$ in the mixed state, where we employ a model developed by Coffey and Clem (CC model) to extract the different vortex lattice (VL) parameters such as the restoring pinning force constant (Labusch parameter), VL drag coefficient and pinning potential barrier. We observe that a consistent description of the inductive and dissipative part of the response is only possible when we take the viscous drag on the vortices to be several orders of magnitudes larger than viscous drag estimated from the Bardeen-Stephen model.</description>

      <title>Charge Density Wave Ordering in NdNiO$_2$: Effects of Multiorbital Nonlocal Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate collective electronic fluctuations and, in particular, the possibility of the charge density wave ordering in an infinite-layer NdNiO$_2$. We perform advanced many-body calculations for the ab-initio three-orbital model by taking into account local correlation effects, non-local charge and magnetic fluctuations, and the electron-phonon coupling. We find that in the considered material, electronic correlations are strongly orbital- and momentum-dependent. Notably, the charge density wave and magnetic instabilities originate from distinct orbitals. In particular, we show that the correlation effects lead to the momentum-dependent hybridization between different orbitals, resulting in the splitting and shifting of the flat part of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ band. This strong renormalization of the electronic spectral function drives the charge density wave instability that is related to the intraband Ni-$d_{z^2}$ correlations. Instead, the magnetic instability stems from the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, which remains half-filled through the redistribution of the electronic density between different bands even upon hole doping. Consequently, the strength of the magnetic fluctuations remains nearly unchanged for the considered doping levels. We argue that this renormalization is not inherent to the stoichiometric case but can be induced by hole doping.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Semantic-Numerical Gap: A Numerical Reasoning Method of Cross-modal Knowledge Graph for Material Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using machine learning (ML) techniques to predict material properties is a crucial research topic. These properties depend on numerical data and semantic factors. Due to the limitations of small-sample datasets, existing methods typically adopt ML algorithms to regress numerical properties or transfer other pre-trained knowledge graphs (KGs) to the material. However, these methods cannot simultaneously handle semantic and numerical information. In this paper, we propose a numerical reasoning method for material KGs (NR-KG), which constructs a cross-modal KG using semantic nodes and numerical proxy nodes. It captures both types of information by projecting KG into a canonical KG and utilizes a graph neural network to predict material properties. In this process, a novel projection prediction loss is proposed to extract semantic features from numerical information. NR-KG facilitates end-to-end processing of cross-modal data, mining relationships and cross-modal information in small-sample datasets, and fully utilizes valuable experimental data to enhance material prediction. We further propose two new High-Entropy Alloys (HEA) property datasets with semantic descriptions. NR-KG outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving relative improvements of 25.9% and 16.1% on two material datasets. Besides, NR-KG surpasses SOTA methods on two public physical chemistry molecular datasets, showing improvements of 22.2% and 54.3%, highlighting its potential application and generalizability. We hope the proposed datasets, algorithms, and pre-trained models can facilitate the communities of KG and AI for materials.</description>

      <title>Crossed Andreev Reflection in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a scattering phenomenon occurring in a superconductor (SC) connected to two metallic leads, where an incident electron on one side of the SC emerges on the opposite side as a hole. Despite its significance, CAR detection is often impeded by the prevalent electron tunneling (ET), wherein the incident electron exits on the opposing side as an electron. One approach to augment CAR over ET involves employing two antiparallel ferromagnets across the SC. However, this method is constrained by the low polarization in ferromagnets and necessitates the application of a magnetic field. Altermagnets (AMs) present a promising avenue for detecting and enhancing CAR due to their distinct Fermi surfaces for the two spins. Here, we propose a configuration utilizing two AMs rotated by $90^{\circ}$ with respect to each other on either side of an SC to enhance CAR. We calculate local and nonlocal conductivities across the AM-SC-AM junction using the Landauer-B\"uttiker scattering approach. Our findings reveal that in the strong phase of AMs, CAR overwhelmingly dominates nonlocal transport. In the weak phase, CAR can exhibit significant enhancement for larger values of the altermagnetic parameter compared to the scenario where AMs are in the normal metallic phase. As a function of the length of the SC, the conductivities exhibit oscillations reminiscent of Fabry-P\'erot interference.</description>
