      <title>Spatial Analysis of Neuromuscular Junctions Activation in Three-Dimensional Histology-based Muscle Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histology has long been a foundational technique for studying anatomical structures through tissue slicing. Advances in computational methods now enable three dimensional (3D) reconstruction of organs from histology images, enhancing the analysis of structural and functional features. Here, we present a novel multimodal computational method to reconstruct rodent muscles in 3D using classical image processing and data analysis techniques, analyze their structural features and correlate them to previously recorded electrophysiological data. The algorithm analyzes spatial distribution patterns of features identified through histological staining, normalizing them across multiple samples. Further, the algorithm successfully correlates spatial patterns with high density epimysial ElectroMyoGraphy (hdEMG) recordings, providing a multimodal perspective on neuromuscular dynamics, linking spatial and electrophysiological information. The code was validated by looking at the distribution of NeuroMuscular Junctions (NMJs) in naive soleus muscles and compared the distributions and patterns observed with ones observed in previous literature. Our results showed consistency with the expected results, validating our method for features and pattern recognition. The multimodal aspect was shown in a naive soleus muscle, where a strong correlation was found between motor unit locations derived via hdEMG, and NMJ locations obtained from histology, highlighting their spatial relationship. This multimodal analysis tool integrates 3D structural data with electrophysiological activity, opening new avenues in muscle diagnostics, regenerative medicine, and personalized therapies where spatial insights could one day predict electrophysiological behavior or vice versa.</description>

      <title>Association of normalization, non-differentially expressed genes and data source with machine learning performance in intra-dataset or cross-dataset modelling of transcriptomic and clinical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18888v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-dataset testing is critical for examining machine learning (ML) model's performance. However, most studies on modelling transcriptomic and clinical data only conducted intra-dataset testing. It is also unclear whether normalization and non-differentially expressed genes (NDEG) can improve cross-dataset modeling performance of ML. We thus aim to understand whether normalization, NDEG and data source are associated with performance of ML in cross-dataset testing. The transcriptomic and clinical data shared by the lung adenocarcinoma cases in TCGA and ONCOSG were used. The best cross-dataset ML performance was reached using transcriptomic data alone and statistically better than those using transcriptomic and clinical data. The best balance accuracy, area under curve and accuracy were significantly better in ML algorithms training on TCGA and tested on ONCOSG than those trained on ONCOSG and tested on TCGA (p&lt;0.05 for all). Normalization and NDEG greatly improved intra-dataset ML performances in both datasets, but not in cross-dataset testing. Strikingly, modelling transcriptomic data of ONCOSG alone outperformed modelling transcriptomic and clinical data whereas including clinical data in TCGA did not significantly impact ML performance, suggesting limited clinical data value or an overwhelming influence of transcriptomic data in TCGA. Performance gains in intra-dataset testing were more pronounced for ML models trained on ONCOSG than TCGA. Among the six ML models compared, Support vector machine was the most frequent best-performer in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset testing. Therefore, our data show data source, normalization and NDEG are associated with intra-dataset and cross-dataset ML performance in modelling transcriptomic and clinical data.</description>

      <title>Age Group Sensitivity Analysis of Epidemic Models: Investigating the Impact of Contact Matrix Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the role of different age groups in disease transmission is crucial for designing effective intervention strategies. A key parameter in age-structured epidemic models is the contact matrix, which defines the interaction structure between age groups. However, accurately estimating contact matrices is challenging, as different age groups respond differently to surveys and are accessible through different channels. This variability introduces significant epistemic uncertainty in epidemic models.
  In this study, we introduce the Age Group Sensitivity Analysis (AGSA) method, a novel framework for assessing the impact of age-structured contact patterns on epidemic outcomes. Our approach integrates age-stratified epidemic models with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) method, enabling a systematic sensitivity analysis of age-specific interactions. Additionally, we propose a new sensitivity aggregation technique that quantifies the contribution of each age group to key epidemic parameters.
  By identifying the age groups to which the model is most sensitive, AGSA helps pinpoint those that introduce the greatest epistemic uncertainty. This allows for targeted data collection efforts, focusing surveys and empirical studies on the most influential age groups to improve model accuracy. As a result, AGSA can enhance epidemic forecasting and inform the design of more effective and efficient public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Validating the predictions of mathematical models describing tumor growth and treatment response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in methods to interrogate tumor biology, the observational and population-based approach of classical cancer research and clinical oncology does not enable anticipation of tumor outcomes to hasten the discovery of cancer mechanisms and personalize disease management. To address these limitations, individualized cancer forecasts have been shown to predict tumor growth and therapeutic response, inform treatment optimization, and guide experimental efforts. These predictions are obtained via computer simulations of mathematical models that are constrained with data from a patient's cancer and experiments. This book chapter addresses the validation of these mathematical models to forecast tumor growth and treatment response. We start with an overview of mathematical modeling frameworks, model selection techniques, and fundamental metrics. We then describe the usual strategies employed to validate cancer forecasts in preclinical and clinical scenarios. Finally, we discuss existing barriers in validating these predictions along with potential strategies to address them.</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of bone growth and mineralization surrounding biodegradable Mg-based and permanent Ti implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In silico testing of implant materials is a research area of high interest, as cost- and labour-intensive experiments may be omitted. However, assessing the tissue-material interaction mathematically and computationally can be very complex, in particular when functional, such as biodegradable, implant materials are investigated. In this work, we expand and refine suitable existing mathematical models of bone growth and magnesium-based implant degradation based on ordinary differential equations. We show that we can simulate the implant degradation, as well as the osseointegration in terms of relative bone volume fraction and changes in bone ultrastructure when applying the model to experimental data from titanium and magnesium-gadolinium implants for healing times up to 32 weeks. An additional sensitivity analysis highlights important parameters and their interactions. Moreover, we show that the model is predictive in terms of relative bone volume fraction with mean absolute errors below 6%.</description>

      <title>Parametric Sensitivity Analysis for Models of Reaction Networks within Interacting Compartments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models of reaction networks within interacting compartments (RNIC) are a generalization of stochastic reaction networks. It is most natural to think of the interacting compartments as "cells" that can appear, degrade, split, and even merge, with each cell containing an evolving copy of the underlying stochastic reaction network. Such models have a number of parameters, including those associated with the internal chemical model and those associated with the compartment interactions, and it is natural to want efficient computational methods for the numerical estimation of sensitivities of model statistics with respect to these parameters. Motivated by the extensive work on computational methods for parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of stochastic reaction networks over the past few decades, we provide a number of methods in the basic RNIC setting. Provided methods include the (unbiased) Girsanov transformation method (also called the Likelihood Ratio method) and a number of coupling methods for the implementation of finite differences, each motivated by methods from previous work related to stochastic reaction networks. We provide several numerical examples comparing the various methods in the new setting. We find that the relative performance of each method is in line with its analog in the "standard" stochastic reaction network setting. We have made all of the Matlab code used to implement the various methods freely available for download.</description>
