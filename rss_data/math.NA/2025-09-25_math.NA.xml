      <title>Stability of high-order Scott-Vogelius elements for 2D non-Newtonian incompressible flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stability of high-order Scott-Vogelius elements for 2D non-Newtonian incompressible flow problems. For elements of degree 4 or higher, we construct a right-inverse of the divergence operator that is stable uniformly in the polynomial degree $N$ from $L^p$ to $\boldsymbol{W}^{1,p}$, show that the associated inf-sup constant is bounded below by a constant that decays at worst like $N^{-3\left| \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{p}\right|}$, and construct local Fortin operators with stability constants explicit in the polynomial degree. We demonstrate these results with several numerical examples suggesting that the $p$-version method can offer superior convergence rates over the $h$-version method even in the non-Newtonian setting.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of matrix-sequences: perspectives of the GLT analysis and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years there has been a growing attention on distribution results in the sense of Weyl for the collective behavior of eigenvalues and singular values of matrix-sequences. Starting from the work of Szeg\"o regarding the case of Toeplitz matrix-sequences, there has been a wealth of associated results, which culminated in the works of Tilli and of Tyrtyshnikov, Zamarashkin, and of the author for preconditioned and non-preconditioned $r$-block $d$-level Toeplitz matrix-sequences with Lebesgue integrable generating functions. In the latter the use of matrix-valued linear positive operators and related Korovkin theories has been crucial. The subsequent steps induced by the analysis of preconditioning techniques and inspired by the rich world of the (pseudo) differential operators have been studies from the same perspective of matrix-sequences with hidden (asymptotic) structure, widely studied in the literature. The widest generalization is represented by the notion of generalized locally Toeplitz matrix-sequences, which have inherent hidden structure and which include virtually any approximation via local numerical methods of (systems of) integral equations, partial and fractional differential equations, also with nonsmooth variable coefficients and irregular bounded/unbounded domains/manifolds.
  In the current work, instead of focusing on a specific type of results, starting from the most recent advances on the topic, we describe shortly a series of open problems, challenges to be developed in the future.</description>

      <title>HPL-MxP Benchmark: Mixed-Precision Algorithms, Iterative Refinement, and Scalable Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mixed-precision benchmark called HPL-MxP that uses both a lower-precision LU factorization with a non-stationary iterative refinement based on GMRES. We evaluate the numerical stability of one of the methods of generating the input matrix in a scalable fashion and show how the diagonal scaling affects the solution quality in terms of the backward-error. Some of the performance results at large scale supercomputing installations produced Exascale-level compute throughput numbers thus proving the viability of the proposed benchmark for evaluating such machines. We also present the potential of the benchmark to continue increasing its use with proliferation of hardware accelerators for AI workloads whose reliable evaluation continues to pose a particular challenge for the users.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning via Randomized Range Deflation (RandRAND)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce RandRAND, a new class of randomized preconditioning methods for large-scale linear systems. RandRAND deflates the spectrum via efficient orthogonal projections onto random subspaces, without computing eigenpairs or low-rank approximations. This leads to advantages in computational cost and numerical stability. We establish rigorous condition number bounds that depend only weakly on the problem size and that reduce to a small constant when the dimension of the deflated subspace is comparable to the effective spectral dimension. RandRAND can be employed without explicit operations with the deflation basis, enabling the effective use of fast randomized transforms. In this setting, the costly explicit basis orthogonalization is bypassed by using fast randomized Q-less QR factorizations or iterative methods for computing orthogonal projections. These strategies balance the cost of constructing RandRAND preconditioners and applying them within linear solvers, and can ensure robustness to rounding errors.</description>

      <title>High-order Multiscale Preconditioner for Elasticity of Arbitrary Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a two-level preconditioner for solving linear systems arising from the discretization of the elliptic, linear-elastic deformation equation, in displacement unknowns, over domains that have arbitrary geometric and topological complexity and heterogeneity in material properties (including fractures). The preconditioner is an algebraic translation of the high-order pore-level multiscale method (hPLMM) proposed recently by the authors, wherein a domain is decomposed into non-overlapping subdomains, and local basis functions are numerically computed over the subdomains to construct a high-quality coarse space (or prolongation matrix). The term "high-order" stands in contrast to the recent low-order PLMM preconditioner, where BCs of local basis problems assume rigidity of all interfaces shared between subdomains. In hPLMM, interfaces are allowed to deform, through the use of suitable mortar spaces, thereby capturing local bending/twisting moments under challenging loading conditions. Benchmarked across a wide range of complex (porous) structures and material heterogeneities, we find hPLMM exhibits superior performance in Krylov solvers than PLMM, as well as state-of-the-art Schwarz and multigrid preconditioners. Applications include risk analysis of subsurface CO2/H2 storage and optimizing porous materials for batteries, prosthetics, and aircraft.</description>

      <title>A fast direct solver for two-dimensional transmission problems of elastic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a fast direct boundary element method for elastodynamic transmission problems in two dimensions, which can be used for analyzing elastic wave scattering by an inclusion. This paper reports the development of an efficient solver based on a discretization method that is broadly applicable regardless of the inclusion shape. From the smoothness of the solutions of the Navier--Cauchy equation, it is reasonable that the displacement is approximated by the piecewise linear bases and the traction is approximated by the piecewise constant bases. However, in this mixed bases strategy, Calder\'on preconditioning, that is, an analytical preconditioning with excellent performance, cannot be applied, which means we cannot adopt iterative solvers. To address this challenge, we developed a fast direct solver formulated using both Burton--Miller and Poggio--Miller--Chang--Harrington--Wu--Tsai (PMCHWT) boundary integral equations. Our method uses a technique based on the proxy method for low-rank approximation of the coefficient matrix's off-diagonal blocks. To handle transmission problems, the proposed fast direct solver uses separate binary tree partitions for nodes and elements. Numerical examples demonstrate that our solver achieves linear computational complexity and can efficiently handle problems with multiple right-sides. Notably, the solver based on the Burton--Miller formulation is approximately 20\% faster than the one using the PMCHWT formulation. Our new method provides a versatile, fast solver, whose performance is independent of the shape of inclusions and computational parameters, such as frequency and density, for elastodynamic transmission problems.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Analysis of Non-Contacting Mechanical Face Seals with Axial Disturbances and Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in industrial applications are driving developments in non-contacting
  mechanical seal technology. Key requirements include improvements in efficiency and
  reliability, which lead to smaller clearances, lower frictional losses, and
  minimisation of wear, during operation. However, a critical consideration is the
  effect of external disturbances experience by the seal from the local environment
  which may cause destabilisation, and lead to premature failures through unanticipated
  face contact.
  This work examines the dynamic behaviour of a non-contacting mechanical face seals,
  where a thin fluid film separates a pair of coaxial discs; a rotor (rotating face) and
  stator (stationary face). It is assumed that the rotor-stator have an angular
  misalignment and operation is under conditions involving large axial disturbances,
  representing external disturbances. A fully coupled unsteady mathematical
  representation is developed, where the fluid flow is coupled to the structural
  response of the stator, and the rotor motion is prescribed. The stator is modelled as
  a spring-mass-damper system, and the fluid film model is based on a lubrication
  approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations. The governing equations are solved via a
  numerical technique based on finite element and Runge-Kutta methods.
  A parameter study reveals the impact of misalignment on the seal dynamics, when
  experiencing an external disturbance. The angle of misalignment and corresponding
  amplitude of forcing can be identified when the minimum fluid film thickness becomes
  less than a given tolerance. This provides insights into safe operating conditions and
  manufacturing tolerances, with the research aiding to improve the design critera and
  reliability of non-contacting mechanical face seals.</description>

      <title>A note on the compactness properties of discontinuous Galerkin time discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the discrete compactness results of Walkington (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 47(6):4680-4710, 2010) for high-order discontinuous Galerkin time discretizations of parabolic problems to more general function space settings. In particular, we show a discrete version of the Aubin-Lions-Simon lemma that holds for general Banach spaces $X$, $B$, and $Y$ satisfying $X \hookrightarrow B$ compactly and $B \hookrightarrow Y$ continuously. Our proofs rely on the properties of a time reconstruction operator and remove the need for quasi-uniform time partitions assumed in previous works.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Meshfree Collocation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive overview of meshfree collocation methods for numerically approximating differential operators on continuously labeled unstructured point clouds. Meshfree collocation methods do not require a computational grid or mesh. Instead, they approximate smooth functions and their derivatives at potentially irregularly distributed collocation points, often called particles, to a desired order of consistency. We review several meshfree collocation methods from the literature, trace the historical development of key concepts, and propose a classification of methods according to their principle of derivation. Although some of the methods reviewed are similar or identical, there are subtle yet important differences between many, which we highlight and discuss. We present a unifying formulation of meshfree collocation methods that renders these differences apparent and show how each method can be derived from this formulation. Finally, we propose a generalized derivation for meshfree collocation methods going forward.</description>

      <title>Development of a Model Order Reduced Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (MORALE) formulation for structures subjected to dynamic moving loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent developments, it has been demonstrated that the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation can be utilized to improve computational efficiency, when simulating the response of structures subjected to moving loads. It is also well established in literature, that Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques significantly enhance calculation speed. This contribution details the combination of both these tools into a novel Model Order Reduced Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (MORALE) formulation. Both hyperelastic and viscoelastic material models are considered. Simulations of pavement structures subjected to moving loads are then carried out, which show a significant enhancement in computational speed and efficiency. Such an efficient and fast simulation framework is of vital importance in technologies such as digital twins of roadway infrastructure (like pavements), as it enables engineers to quickly run what-if analyses and make informed decisions about the management of the structure under consideration.</description>

      <title>Efficient Long-Time Simulations of Multiscale Systems via High-Order Numerical Homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a high-order numerical homogenization method, a heterogeneous multiscale scheme was developed in Jin &amp; Li (2022) for evolving differential equations containing two time scales. In this paper, we further explore the technique to propose an efficient algorithm able to carry out simulations up to a long time which was prohibitive before. The new algorithm is a multigrid-in-time method which combines coarse-grid high-order approximations with fine-grid low-order evaluations. The high efficiency is attained by minimizing the computational cost while the approximation accuracy is guaranteed. A priori error estimates are rigorously established and validated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A convergent finite element method for two-phase Stokes flow driven by surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first convergence proof for an iso-parametric finite element discretization of two-phase Stokes flow in $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$, with interface dynamics governed by mean curvature. The proof relies on a crucial discrete coupled parabolicity structure of the error system and a powerful iso-parametric framework of convergence analysis where we do not really discriminate consistency and stability. This new mixing idea leads to a non-trivial construction of the bulk mesh in the consistency analysis. The techniques and analysis developed in this paper provide fundamental numerical analysis tools for general curvature-driven free boundary problems.</description>

      <title>THINNs: Thermodynamically Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models aiming to approximate solutions of PDEs by training neural networks to minimize the residual of the equation. Focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems, we propose a physically informed choice of penalization that is consistent with the underlying fluctuation structure, as characterized by a large deviations principle. This approach yields a novel formulation of PINNs in which the penalty term is chosen to penalize improbable deviations, rather than being selected heuristically. The resulting thermodynamically consistent extension of PINNs, termed THINNs, is subsequently analyzed by establishing analytical a posteriori estimates, and providing empirical comparisons to established penalization strategies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we study the impact of data augmentation on the smoothness of principal components of high-dimensional datasets. Using tools from quantum harmonic analysis, we show that eigenfunctions of operators corresponding to augmented data sets lie in the modulation space $M^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$, guaranteeing smoothness and continuity. Numerical examples on synthetic and audio data confirm the theoretical findings. While interesting in itself, the results suggest that manifold learning and feature extraction algorithms can benefit from systematic and informed augmentation principles.</description>

      <title>PySymmetry: A Sage/Python Framework for the Symmetry Reduction of Linear G-Equivariant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the prevalence of symmetry in scientific linear systems, these structural properties are often underutilized by standard computational software. This paper introduces PySymmetry, an open-source Sage/Python framework that implements classical representation theory to simplify G-equivariant linear systems. PySymmetry uses projection operators to generate symmetry-adapted bases, transforming equivariant operators into a more efficient block-diagonal form. Its functionalities include defining and reducing representations, calculating multiplicities, and obtaining the explicit block structure.
  We demonstrate PySymmetry's versatility through three case studies: a chemistry application, a numerical benchmark on the non-Hermitian Schr\"odinger equation that achieved a performance increase of over 17x compared to standard methods, and a symbolic investigation that enabled the first complete analytical classification of a challenging problem in celestial mechanics. Designed for seamless integration with libraries like NumPy and SciPy, PySymmetry offers a powerful, user-friendly tool for exploring symmetries in theoretical and applied contexts. ```</description>

      <title>A Note on Fine-Grained Quantum Reductions for Linear Algebraic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe that any $T(n)$ time algorithm (quantum or classical) for several central linear algebraic problems, such as computing $\det(A)$, $tr(A^3)$, or $tr(A^{-1})$ for an $n \times n$ integer matrix $A$, yields a $O(T(n)) + \tilde O(n^2)$ time \textit{quantum algorithm} for $n \times n$ matrix-matrix multiplication. That is, on quantum computers, the complexity of these problems is essentially equivalent to that of matrix multiplication. Our results follow by first observing that the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm gives a direct quantum reduction from matrix multiplication to computing $tr(ABC)$ for $n \times n$ inputs $A,B,C$. We can then reduce $tr(ABC)$ to each of our problems of interest.
  For the above problems, and many others in linear algebra, their fastest known algorithms require $\Theta(n^\omega)$ time, where $\omega \approx 2.37$ is the current exponent of fast matrix multiplication. Our finding shows that any improvements beyond this barrier would lead to faster quantum algorithms for matrix multiplication. Our results complement existing reductions from matrix multiplication in algebraic circuits [BCS13], and reductions that work for standard classical algorithms, but are not tight -- i.e., which roughly show that an $O(n^{3-\delta})$ time algorithm for the problem yields an $O(n^{3-\delta/3})$ matrix multiplication algorithm [WW10].</description>

Abstract: It is known that, if $\Omega$ $\subset$ C is a convex set containing the numerical range of an operator A, then $\Omega$ is a C $\Omega$ -spectral set for A with C $\Omega$ $\le$ 1+ $\sqrt$ 2. We improve this estimate in unbounded cases.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Optimal Unraveling Schemes for Simulating Lindblad Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic unraveling schemes are powerful computational tools for simulating Lindblad equations, offering significant reductions in memory requirements. However, this advantage is accompanied by increased stochastic uncertainty, and the question of optimal unraveling remains open. In this work, we investigate unraveling schemes driven by Brownian motion or Poisson processes and present a comprehensive parametric characterization of these approaches. For the case of a single Lindblad operator and one noise term, this parametric family provides a complete description for unraveling scheme with pathwise norm-preservation. We further analytically derive dynamically optimal quantum state diffusion (DO-QSD) and dynamically optimal quantum jump process (DO-QJP) that minimize the short-time growth of the variance of an observable. Compared to jump process ansatz, DO-QSD offers two notable advantages: firstly, the variance for DO-QSD can be rigorously shown not to exceed that of any jump-process ansatz locally in time; secondly, it has very simple expressions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DO-QSD scheme may achieve substantial reductions in the variance of observables and the resulting simulation error.</description>

      <title>An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of integer-constrained optimization problems governed by partial differential equation (PDE) constraints and regularized via total variation (TV) in the context of topology optimization. The presence of discrete design variables, nonsmooth regularization, and non-convex objective renders the problem computationally challenging. To address this, we adopt the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, which enables a decomposition of the original problem into simpler subproblems that can be solved efficiently. The augmented Lagrangian formulation ensures consistency across variable updates while facilitating convergence under appropriate conditions.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated FREDopt package for simultaneous dose and LETd proton radiotherapy plan optimization via superiorization methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents FREDopt, a newly developed GPU-accelerated open-source optimization software for simultaneous proton dose and dose-averaged LET (LETd) optimization in IMPT treatment planning. FREDopt was implemented entirely in Python, leveraging CuPy for GPU acceleration and incorporating fast Monte Carlo (MC) simulations from the FRED code. The treatment plan optimization workflow includes pre-optimization and optimization, the latter equipped with a novel superiorization of feasibility-seeking algorithms. Feasibility-seeking requires finding a point that satisfies prescribed constraints. Superiorization interlaces computational perturbations into iterative feasibility-seeking steps to steer them toward a superior feasible point, replacing the need for costly full-fledged constrained optimization. The method was validated on two treatment plans of patients treated in a clinical proton therapy center, with dose and LETd distributions compared before and after reoptimization. Simultaneous dose and LETd optimization using FREDopt led to a substantial reduction of LETd and (dose)x(LETd) in organs at risk (OARs) while preserving target dose conformity. Computational performance evaluation showed execution times of 14-50 minutes, depending on the algorithm and target volume size-satisfactory for clinical and research applications while enabling further development of the well-tested, documented open-source software.</description>

      <title>Examining the robustness of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to noise for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental for the modeling of dynamical systems in science and engineering. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a recent machine learning-based approach, for which many properties and limitations remain unknown. PINNs are widely accepted as inferior to traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as the finite element method, both with regard to computation time and accuracy. However, PINNs are commonly claimed to show promise in solving inverse problems and handling noisy or incomplete data. We compare the performance of PINNs in solving inverse problems with that of a traditional approach using the finite element method combined with a numerical optimizer. The models are tested on a series of increasingly difficult fluid mechanics problems, with and without noise. We find that while PINNs may require less human effort and specialized knowledge, they are outperformed by the traditional approach. However, the difference appears to decrease with higher dimensions and more data. We identify common failures during training to be addressed if the performance of PINNs on noisy inverse problems is to become more competitive.</description>

      <title>On high-order/low-order and micro-macro methods for implicit time-stepping of the BGK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a high-order/low-order (HOLO) method is combined with a micro-macro (MM) decomposition to accelerate iterative solvers in fully implicit time-stepping of the BGK equation for gas dynamics. The MM formulation represents a kinetic distribution as the sum of a local Maxwellian and a perturbation. In highly collisional regimes, the perturbation away from initial and boundary layers is small and can be compressed to reduce the overall storage cost of the distribution. The convergence behavior of the MM methods, the usual HOLO method, and the standard source iteration method is analyzed on a linear BGK model. Both the HOLO and MM methods are implemented using a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization in phase space, which naturally preserves the consistency between high- and low-order models required by the HOLO approach. The accuracy and performance of these methods are compared on the Sod shock tube problem and a sudden wall heating boundary layer problem. Overall, the results demonstrate the robustness of the MM and HOLO approaches and illustrate the compression benefits enabled by the MM formulation when the kinetic distribution is near equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Secure numerical simulations using fully homomorphic encryption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data privacy is a significant concern when using numerical simulations for sensitive information such as medical, financial, or engineering data -- especially in untrusted environments like public cloud infrastructures. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers a promising solution for achieving data privacy by enabling secure computations directly on encrypted data. Aimed at computational scientists, this work explores the viability of FHE-based, privacy-preserving numerical simulations of partial differential equations. The presented approach utilizes the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme, a widely used FHE method for approximate arithmetic on real numbers. Two Julia packages are introduced, OpenFHE$.$jl and SecureArithmetic$.$jl, which wrap the OpenFHE C++ library to provide a convenient interface for secure arithmetic operations. With these tools, the accuracy and performance of key FHE operations in OpenFHE are evaluated, and implementations of finite difference schemes for solving the linear advection equation with encrypted data are demonstrated. The results show that cryptographically secure numerical simulations are possible, but that careful consideration must be given to the computational overhead and the numerical errors introduced by using FHE. An analysis of the algorithmic restrictions imposed by FHE highlights potential challenges and solutions for extending the approach to other models and methods. While it remains uncertain how broadly the approach can be generalized to more complex algorithms due to CKKS limitations, these findings lay the groundwork for further research on privacy-preserving scientific computing.</description>

      <title>On Multilevel Energy-Based Fragmentation Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy-based fragmentation methods approximate the potential energy of a molecular system as a sum of contribution terms built from the energies of particular subsystems. Some such methods reduce to truncations of the many-body expansion (MBE); others combine subsystem energies in a manner inspired by the principle of inclusion/exclusion (PIE). The combinatorial technique of M\"obius inversion of sums over partially ordered sets, which generalizes the PIE, is known to provide a non-recursive expression for the MBE contribution terms, and has also been connected to related cluster expansion methods. We build from these ideas a very general framework for decomposing potential functions into energetic contribution terms associated with elements of particular partially ordered sets (posets) and direct products thereof. Specific choices immediately reproduce not only the MBE, but also a number of other existing decomposition forms, including, e.g., the multilevel ML-BOSSANOVA schema. Furthermore, a different choice of poset product leads to a setup familiar from the combination technique for high-dimensional approximation, which has a known connection to quantum-chemical composite methods. We present the ML-SUPANOVA decomposition form, which allows the further refinement of the terms of an MBE-like expansion of the Born-Oppenheimer potential according to systematic hierarchies of ab initio methods and of basis sets. We outline an adaptive algorithm for the a posteori construction of quasi-optimal truncations of this decomposition. Some initial experiments are reported and discussed.</description>

      <title>A deep learning approach to inverse medium scattering: Learning regularizers from a direct imaging method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to solve numerically the two-dimensional inverse medium scattering problem with far-field data. This is a challenging task due to the severe ill-posedness and strong nonlinearity of the inverse problem. As already known, it is necessary but also difficult numerically to employ an appropriate regularization strategy which effectively incorporates certain a priori information of the unknown scatterer to overcome the severe ill-posedness of the inverse problem. In this paper, we propose to use a deep learning approach to learn the a priori information of the support of the unknown scatterer from a direct imaging method. Based on the learned a priori information, we propose two inversion algorithms for solving the inverse problem. In the first one, the learned a priori information is incorporated into the projected Landweber method. In the second one, the learned a priori information is used to design the regularization functional for the regularized variational formulation of the inverse problem which is then solved with a traditional iteration algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments show that our inversion algorithms provide good reconstruction results even for the high contrast case and have a satisfactory generalization ability.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we assess the performance of adaptive and nested factorized sparse approximate inverses as smoothers in multilevel V-cycles, when smoothing is performed following the Chebyshev iteration of the fourth kind. For our test problems, we rely on the partition of unity method to discretize the biharmonic and triharmonic equations in a multilevel manner. Inspired by existing algorithms, we introduce a new adaptive algorithm for the construction of sparse approximate inverses, based on the block structure of matrices arising in the partition of unity method. Additionally, we also present a new (and arguably simpler) formulation of the Chebyshev iteration of the fourth kind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bilinear form u^\top f(A) v of matrix functions appears in many application problems, where u, v \in R^n\), A \in R^{n * n}\), and f(z) is a given analytic function.The IDR(s) method effectively reduces computational complexity and storage requirements by introducing dimension reduction techniques, while maintaining the numerical stability of the algorithm. This paper studies the numerical algorithm and posterior error estimation for the matrix function bilinear form u^{\top} f(A) v based on the IDR(s) method. Through the error analysis of the IDR(s) algorithm, the corresponding error expansion is derived, and it is verified that the leading term of the error expansion serves as a reliable posterior error estimate. Based on this, in this paper a corresponding stopping criterion is proposed. This approach is dedicated to improving computational efficiency, especially by showing excellent performance in handling ill-posed and large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Schrodingerization based quantum algorithms for the time-fractional heat equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a quantum algorithm for solving high-dimensional time-fractional heat equations. By applying the dimension extension technique from [FKW23], the $d+1$-dimensional time-fractional equation is reformulated as a local partial differential equation in $d+2$ dimensions. Through discretization along both the extended and spatial domains, a stable system of ordinary differential equations is obtained by a simple change of variables. We propose a quantum algorithm for the resulting semi-discrete problem using the Schrodingerization approach from [JLY24a,JLY23,JL24a]. The Schrodingerization technique transforms general linear partial and ordinary differential equations into Schrodinger-type systems--with unitary evolution, making them suitable for quantum simulation. This is accomplished via the warped phase transformation, which maps the equation into a higher-dimensional space. We provide detailed implementations of this method and conduct a comprehensive complexity analysis, demonstrating up to exponential advantage--with respect to the inverse of the mesh size in high dimensions~--~compared to its classical counterparts. Specifically, to compute the solution to time $T$, while the classical method requires at least $\mathcal{O}(N_t d h^{-(d+0.5)})$ matrix-vector multiplications, where $N_t $ is the number of time steps (which is, for example, $\mathcal{O}(Tdh^{-2})$ for the forward Euler method), our quantum algorithms requires $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^2d^4 h^{-8})$ queries to the block-encoding input models, with the quantum complexity being independent of the dimension $d$ in terms of the inverse mesh size $h^{-1}$. Numerical experiments are performed to validate our formulation.</description>

      <title>Robust Training of Neural Networks at Arbitrary Precision and Sparsity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discontinuous operations inherent in quantization and sparsification introduce a long-standing obstacle to backpropagation, particularly in ultra-low precision and sparse regimes. The standard Straight-Through Estimator (STE) is widely used to address this, but the well-understood mismatch between its quantization-aware forward pass and quantization-oblivious backward pass leads to unmanaged error that can corrupt the learning process. We solve this by introducing a denoising dequantization transform derived from a principled ridge regression objective. This transform makes the entire learning process aware of and robust to the quantization error that STE's surrogate gradient bypasses, by creating an explicit, corrective gradient path. We extend this principle to sparsification by viewing it as a special form of quantization that maps insignificant values to zero. Our unified framework allows existing models to be trained at a wide spectrum of precisions and sparsity levels with off-the-shelf recipes, achieving stable training of fully binary (A1W1) and sparse sub-1-bit networks where other methods falter. This approach yields state-of-the-art results and provides a theoretically-grounded path to hyper-efficient neural networks.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a proof of generic structural stability for Riemann solutions to $2 \times 2$ system of hyperbolic conservation laws in one spatial variable, without diffusive terms. This means that for almost every left and right state, shocks and rarefaction solutions of the same type are preserved via perturbations of the flux functions, the left state, and the right state. The main assumptions for this proof involve standard assumptions on strict hyperbolicity and genuine non-linearity, a technical assumption on directionality of rarefaction curves, and the regular manifold (submersion) assumption motivated by concepts in differential topology. We show that the structural stability of the Riemann solutions is related to the transversality of the Hugoniot loci and rarefaction curves in the state space. The regular manifold assumption is required to invoke a variant of a theorem from differential topology, Thom's parametric transversality theorem, to show the genericity of transversality of these curves. This in turn implies the genericity of structural stability. We then apply this theorem to two examples: the p-system and a $2 \times 2$ system governing the evolution of gravity-driven monodisperse particle-laden thin films. In particular, we illustrate how one can verify all the above assumptions for the former, and apply the theorem to different numerical and physical aspects of the system governing the latter.</description>

Abstract: Among other uses, neural networks are a powerful tool for solving deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems in real-time, where variational autoencoders, a specialized type of neural network, enable the Bayesian estimation of model parameters and their distribution from observational data allowing real-time inverse uncertainty quantification. In this work, we build upon existing research [Goh, H. et al., Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 2022] by proposing a novel loss function to train variational autoencoders for Bayesian inverse problems. When the forward map is affine, we provide a theoretical proof of the convergence of the latent states of variational autoencoders to the posterior distribution of the model parameters. We validate this theoretical result through numerical tests and we compare the proposed variational autoencoder with the existing one in the literature both in terms of accuracy and generalization properties. Finally, we test the proposed variational autoencoder on a Laplace equation, with comparison to the original one and Markov Chains Monte Carlo.</description>
