      <title>Lambda Value-at-Risk under ambiguity and risk sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Lambda Value-at-Risk ($\Lambda$VaR) under ambiguity, where the ambiguity is represented by a family of probability measures. We establish that for increasing Lambda functions, the robust (i.e., worst-case) $\Lambda$VaR under such an ambiguity set is equivalent to $\Lambda$VaR computed with respect to a capacity, a novel extension in the literature. This framework unifies and extends both traditional $\Lambda$VaR and Choquet quantiles (Value-at-Risk under ambiguity). We analyze the fundamental properties of this extended risk measure and establish a novel equivalent representation for $\Lambda$VaR under capacities with monotone Lambda functions in terms of families of downsets. Moreover, explicit formulas are derived for robust $\Lambda$VaR when ambiguity sets are characterized by $\phi$-divergence and the likelihood ratio constraints, respectively.
  We further explore the applications in risk sharing among multiple agents. We demonstrate that the family of risk measures induced by families of downsets is closed under inf-convolution. In particular, we prove that the inf-convolution of $\Lambda$VaR with capacities and monotone Lambda functions is another$\Lambda$VaR under a capacity. The explicit forms of optimal allocations are also derived. Moreover, we obtain more explicit results for risk sharing under ambiguity sets characterized by $\phi$-divergence and likelihood ratio constraints. Finally, we explore comonotonic risk-sharing for $\Lambda$VaR under ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Cost-of-capital valuation with risky assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cost-of-capital valuation is a well-established approach to the valuation of liabilities and is one of the cornerstones of current regulatory frameworks for the insurance industry. Standard cost-of-capital considerations typically rely on the assumption that the required buffer capital is held in risk-less one-year bonds. The aim of this work is to analyze the effects of allowing investments of the buffer capital in risky assets, e.g.~in a combination of stocks and bonds. In particular, we make precise how the decomposition of the buffer capital into contributions from policyholders and investors varies as the degree of riskiness of the investment increases, and highlight the role of limited liability in the case of heavy-tailed insurance risks. We present a combination of general theoretical results, explicit results for certain stochastic models and numerical results that emphasize the key findings.</description>

      <title>Further Developments on Stochastic Dominance for Different Classes of Infinite-mean Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, stochastic dominance for independent and identically distributed (iid) infinite-mean random variables has received considerable attention. The literature has identified several classes of distributions of nonnegative random variables that encompass many common heavy-tailed distributions. A key result demonstrates that the weighted sum of iid random variables from these classes is stochastically larger than any individual random variable in the sense of the first-order stochastic dominance. This paper systematically investigates the properties and inclusion relationships among these distribution classes, and extends some existing results to more practical scenarios. Furthermore, we analyze the case where each random variable follows a compound binomial distribution, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for the preservation of the aforementioned stochastic dominance relation.</description>

      <title>Robust Hedging of path-dependent options using a min-max algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an investor who wants to hedge a path-dependent option with maturity $T$ using a static hedging portfolio using cash, the underlying, and vanilla put/call options on the same underlying with maturity $ t_1$, where $0 &lt; t_1 &lt; T$. We propose a model-free approach to construct such a portfolio. The framework is inspired by the \textit{primal-dual} Martingale Optimal Transport (MOT) problem, which was pioneered by \cite{beiglbock2013model}. The optimization problem is to determine the portfolio composition that minimizes the expected worst-case hedging error at $t_1$ (that coincides with the maturity of the options that are used in the hedging portfolio). The worst-case scenario corresponds to the distribution that yields the worst possible hedging performance. This formulation leads to a \textit{min-max} problem. We provide a numerical scheme for solving this problem when a finite number of vanilla option prices are available. Numerical results on the hedging performance of this model-free approach when the option prices are generated using a \textit{Black-Scholes} and a \textit{Merton Jump diffusion} model are presented. We also provide theoretical bounds on the hedging error at $T$, the maturity of the target option.</description>

      <title>Loss-Given-Default Modeling by Post-Last Passage Time Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.00868v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a stochastic model for loss-given-default (LGD) which provides the LGD distribution based on credit market and company-specific financial conditions. The model utilizes last passage time of a linear diffusion (representing firm value) to a certain threshold point, after which default occurs as a surprising event. By treating the post-last passage time process in a continuum of the original process, we are able to use firm-value approach before and intensity-based approach after the last passage time, leading to a hybrid model. Under minimal and standard assumptions, we obtain the distributions of default time and LGD explicitly. We provide a computationally simple estimation procedure and real-world examples of estimated LGD distribution implied in CDS market.</description>

      <title>Forecasting realized volatility in the stock market: a path-dependent perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Volatility forecasting in financial markets is a topic that has received more attention from scholars. In this paper, we propose a new volatility forecasting model that combines the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model with a family of path-dependent volatility models (HAR-PD). The model utilizes the long- and short-term memory properties of price data to capture volatility features and trend features. By integrating the features of path-dependent volatility into the HAR model family framework, we develop a new set of volatility forecasting models. And, we propose a HAR-REQ model based on the empirical quartile as a threshold, which exhibits stronger forecasting ability compared to the HAR-REX model. Subsequently, the predictive performance of the HAR-PD model family is evaluated by statistical tests using data from the Chinese stock market and compared with the basic HAR model family. The empirical results show that the HAR-PD model family has higher forecasting accuracy compared to the underlying HAR model family. In addition, robustness tests confirm the significant predictive power of the HAR-PD model family.</description>

      <title>Dimension Reduction of Distributionally Robust Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems with uncertainty sets consisting of high-dimensional random vectors that are close in the multivariate Wasserstein distance to a reference random vector. We give conditions under which the images of these sets under scalar-valued aggregation functions are equal to or bounded by uncertainty sets of univariate random variables defined via a univariate Wasserstein distance. This allows us to rewrite or bound high-dimensional DRO problems with simpler DRO problems over the space of univariate random variables. We generalize the results to uncertainty sets defined via the Bregman-Wasserstein divergence and the max-sliced Wasserstein and Bregman-Wasserstein divergence. The max-sliced divergences allow us to jointly model distributional uncertainty around the reference random vector and uncertainty in the aggregation function. Finally, we derive explicit bounds for worst-case risk measures that belong to the class of signed Choquet integrals.</description>
