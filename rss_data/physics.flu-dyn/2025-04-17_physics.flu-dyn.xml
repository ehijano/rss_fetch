      <title>Boundary Effects and Oxygen Deficiency-Driven Pattern Transitions in Algal Bioconvection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspensions of motile microorganisms can spontaneously give rise to large scale fluid motion, known as bioconvection, which is characterized by dense, cell-rich downwelling plumes interspersed with broad upwelling regions. In this study, we investigate bioconvection in shallow suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells confined within spiral-shaped boundaries, combining detailed experimental observations with 3D simulations. Under open liquid-air interface conditions, cells accumulate near the surface due to negative gravitaxis, forming spiral shaped density patterns that subsequently fragment into lattice-like structures and give rise to downwelling plumes. Space-time analyses reveal coherent rotational dynamics, with inward-moving patterns near the spiral core and bidirectional motion farther from the center. Introducing confinement by sealing the top boundary with an air-impermeable transparent wall triggers striking transitions in the bioconvection patterns, driven by oxygen depletion: initially stable structures reorganize into new patterns with reduced characteristic wavelengths. Complementary 3D simulations, based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and incorporating negative buoyancy and active stress from swimming cells, capture the initial pattern formation and its subsequent instability, reproducing the fragmentation of spiral-shaped accumulations into downwelling plumes and the emergence of strong vortical flows, nearly an order of magnitude faster than individual cell swimming speeds. However, these models do not capture the oxygen-driven pattern transitions observed experimentally. Our findings reveal that confinement geometry, oxygen dynamics, and metabolic transitions critically govern bioconvection pattern evolution, offering new strategies to control microbial self-organization and flow through environmental and geometric design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming more commonly used in populated areas, raising concerns about noise pollution generated from their propellers. This study investigates the acoustic performance of unconventional propeller designs, specifically toroidal and uneven-blade spaced propellers, for their potential in reducing psychoacoustic annoyance. Our experimental results show that these designs noticeably reduced acoustic characteristics associated with noise annoyance.</description>

      <title>An immersed boundary method for particle-resolved simulations of arbitrary-shaped rigid particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work extends the direct-forcing immersed boundary method introduced by Garc\'ia-Villalba et al. (2023), broadening its application from spherical to arbitrarily-shaped particles, while maintaining its capacity to address both neutrally-buoyant and light objects (down to a density ratio of 0.5). The proposed method offers a significant advantage over existing methods regarding its simplicity, in particular for the case of neutrally-buoyant particles. Three test cases from the literature are selected for validation: a neutrally-buoyant prolate spheroid in a shear flow; a settling oblate spheroid; and, finally, a rising oblate spheroid.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear wave dynamics on a chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow water waves are a striking example of nonlinear hydrodynamics, giving rise to phenomena such as tsunamis and undular waves. These dynamics are typically studied in hundreds-of-meter-long wave flumes. Here, we demonstrate a chip-scale, quantum-enabled wave flume. The wave flume exploits nanometer-thick superfluid helium films and optomechanical interactions to achieve nonlinearities surpassing those of extreme terrestrial flows. Measurements reveal wave steepening, shock fronts, and soliton fission -- nonlinear behaviors long predicted in superfluid helium but never previously directly observed. Our approach enables lithography-defined wave flume geometries, optomechanical control of hydrodynamic properties, and orders of magnitude faster measurements than terrestrial flumes. Together, this opens a new frontier in hydrodynamics, combining quantum fluids and nanophotonics to explore complex wave dynamics at microscale.</description>

      <title>A hybrid U-Net and Fourier neural operator framework for the large-eddy simulation of turbulent flows over periodic hills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient predictions of three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows are of significant importance in the fields of science and engineering. In the current work, we propose a hybrid U-Net and Fourier neural operator (HUFNO) method, tailored for mixed periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions which are often encountered in complex turbulence problems. The HUFNO model is tested in the large-eddy simulation (LES) of 3D periodic hill turbulence featuring strong flow separations. Compared to the original Fourier neural operator (FNO) and the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based U-Net framework, the HUFNO model has a higher accuracy in the predictions of the velocity field and Reynolds stresses. Further numerical experiments in the LES show that the HUFNO framework outperforms the traditional Smagorinsky (SMAG) model and the wall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model in the predictions of the turbulence statistics, the energy spectrum, the wall stresses and the flow separation structures, with much lower computational cost. Importantly, the accuracy and efficiency are transferable to unseen initial conditions and hill shapes, underscoring its great potentials for the fast prediction of strongly separated turbulent flows over curved boundaries.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for flow-compatible reconstruction of heart motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of cardiac chamber motion from time-resolved medical imaging modalities is of growing interest in both the clinical and biomechanical fields. Despite recent advancement, the cardiac motion reconstruction process remains complex and prone to uncertainties. Moreover, traditional assessments often focus on static comparisons, lacking assurances of dynamic consistency and physical relevance. This work introduces a novel paradigm of flow-compatible motion reconstruction, integrating anatomical imaging with flow data to ensure adherence to fundamental physical principles, such as mass and momentum conservation. The approach is demonstrated in the context of right ventricular motion, utilizing diffeomorphic mappings and multi-slice MRI to achieve dynamically consistent and physically robust reconstructions. Results show that enforcing flow compatibility within the reconstruction process is feasible and enhances the physical realism of the resulting kinematics.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Drone for Dynamic Smoke Plume Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel autonomous drone-based smoke plume tracking system capable of navigating and tracking plumes in highly unsteady atmospheric conditions. The system integrates advanced hardware and software and a comprehensive simulation environment to ensure robust performance in controlled and real-world settings. The quadrotor, equipped with a high-resolution imaging system and an advanced onboard computing unit, performs precise maneuvers while accurately detecting and tracking dynamic smoke plumes under fluctuating conditions. Our software implements a two-phase flight operation, i.e., descending into the smoke plume upon detection and continuously monitoring the smoke movement during in-plume tracking. Leveraging Proportional Integral-Derivative (PID) control and a Proximal Policy Optimization based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) controller enables adaptation to plume dynamics. Unreal Engine simulation evaluates performance under various smoke-wind scenarios, from steady flow to complex, unsteady fluctuations, showing that while the PID controller performs adequately in simpler scenarios, the DRL-based controller excels in more challenging environments. Field tests corroborate these findings. This system opens new possibilities for drone-based monitoring in areas like wildfire management and air quality assessment. The successful integration of DRL for real-time decision-making advances autonomous drone control for dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Practical Application of the Quantum Carleman Lattice Boltzmann Method in Industrial CFD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations are crucial in industrial applications but require extensive computational resources, particularly for extreme turbulent regimes. While classical digital approaches remain the standard, quantum computing promises a breakthrough by enabling a more efficient encoding of large-scale simulations with a limited number of qubits.
  This work presents a practical numerical assessment of a hybrid quantum-classical approach to CFD based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). The inherently non-linear LBM equations are linearized via a Carleman expansion and solved using the quantum Harrow Hassidim Lloyd algorithm (HHL). We evaluate this method on three benchmark cases featuring different boundary conditions, periodic, bounceback, and moving wall, using statevector emulation on high-performance computing resources.
  Our results confirm the validity of the approach, achieving median error fidelities on the order of $10^{-3}$ and success probabilities sufficient for practical quantum state sampling. Notably, the spectral properties of small lattice systems closely approximate those of larger ones, suggesting a pathway to mitigate one of HHL's bottlenecks: eigenvalue pre-evaluation.</description>

      <title>Chaotic advection in a steady three-dimensional MHD flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the 3D stationary flow of a weakly conducting fluid in a cubic cavity, driven by the Lorentz force created by two permanent magnets and a weak constant current. Our goal is to determine the conditions leading to efficient mixing within the cavity. The flow is composed of a large cell created by one side magnet, superposed to two cells created by a central magnet perpendicular to the first one. The overall structure of this flow, obtained here by solving the Stokes equations with Lorentz forcing, is similar to the tri-cellular model flow studied by Toussaint et. al. (Phys. Fluids. 7, 1995). Chaotic advection in this flow is analyzed by means of Poincar\'e sections, Lyapunov exponents and expansion entropies. In addition, we quantify the quality of mixing by computing contamination rates, homogeneity, as well as mixing times. We observe that, though individual vortices have poor mixing properties, the superposition of both flows creates chaotic streamlines and efficient mixing.</description>

      <title>DrivAerML: High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics Dataset for Road-Car External Aerodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionise the field of automotive aerodynamics, enabling split-second flow predictions early in the design process. However, the lack of open-source training data for realistic road cars, using high-fidelity CFD methods, represents a barrier to their development. To address this, a high-fidelity open-source (CC-BY-SA) public dataset for automotive aerodynamics has been generated, based on 500 parametrically morphed variants of the widely-used DrivAer notchback generic vehicle. Mesh generation and scale-resolving CFD was executed using consistent and validated automatic workflows representative of the industrial state-of-the-art. Geometries and rich aerodynamic data are published in open-source formats. To our knowledge, this is the first large, public-domain dataset for complex automotive configurations generated using high-fidelity CFD.</description>

      <title>The destabilizing effect of particle concentration in inclined settlers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water scarcity has required constant water recycling, leading to a decline in water quality, further exacerbated by high concentrations of fine particles that reduce the efficiency of solid-liquid separation systems. Inclined settlers offer a viable secondary treatment option for high-turbidity water. Effective design requires understanding of operational conditions, geometry, and suspension properties. Using OpenFOAM, computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed for a continuous inclined countercurrent conduit to assess the influence of inlet particle concentration on efficiency, exploring various Surface Overflow Rates (SOR) and inclination angles. The results show that the steady state in which the flow settles is strongly dependent on the particle concentration. For very low particle concentrations, the flow is mostly stationary with little to no resuspension of particles. Increasingly unstable regimes are observed to emerge as the inlet concentration increases, leading to increased particle resuspension. Instabilities arise from overhanging zones at the tip of the suspension, generating recirculation zones that enlarge the resuspension region and induce entrainment within the bulk suspension. Shear instabilities become noticeable at large particle concentrations, further increasing resuspension. Different regimes were identified, influenced by the SOR and the inclination angles. Additionally, a Reynolds number characterizing these systems is proposed alongside a scale analysis. The findings highlight particle concentration as a critical parameter in inclined plate settler design.</description>

      <title>The Harmonic Pitching NACA 0018 Airfoil in Low Reynolds Number Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the aerodynamic performance of the symmetric NACA 0018 airfoil under harmonic pitching motions at low Reynolds numbers, a regime characterized by the presence of laminar separation bubbles and their impact on aerodynamic forces. The analysis encompasses oscillation frequencies of 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 13.3 Hz, with amplitudes of 4{\deg} and 8{\deg}, along with steady-state simulations conducted for angles of attack up to 20{\deg} to validate the numerical model. The results reveal that the Transition SST turbulence model provides improved predictions of aerodynamic forces at higher Reynolds numbers but struggles at lower Reynolds numbers, where laminar flow effects dominate. The inclusion of the 13.3 Hz frequency, relevant to Darrieus vertical-axis wind turbines, demonstrates the model's effectiveness in capturing dynamic hysteresis loops and reduced oscillations, contrasting with the \(k-\omega\) SST model. Comparisons with XFOIL further highlight challenges in accurately modeling laminar-to-turbulent transitions and dynamic flow phenomena. These findings offer valuable insights into the aerodynamic behavior of thick airfoils under low Reynolds number conditions and contribute to advancing the understanding of turbulence modeling, particularly in applications involving vertical-axis wind turbines.</description>
