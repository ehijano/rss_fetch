      <title>Measurement resolution enhanced coherence for lattice fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak measurement enables the extraction of targeted information from a quantum system while minimizing decoherence due to measurement backaction. However, in many-body quantum systems backaction can have unexpected effects on wavefunction collapse. We theoretically study a minimal many-particle model consisting of weakly measured non-interacting fermions in a one dimensional lattice. Repeated measurement of on-site occupation number with single-site resolution stochastically drives the system toward a Fock state, regardless of the initial state. This need not be the case for measurements that do not, even in principle, have single-site spatial resolution. We numerically show for systems with up to 16 sites that decreasing the spatial resolution strongly affects both the rate of stochastic evolution for each quantum trajectory and the allowed final states. The full Hilbert space can be partitioned into backaction-free subspaces (BFSs) the elements of which are indistinguishable to these measurements. Repeated measurements will drive any initial state into a single BFS, leading to a steady state that is a fixed point of the measurement process. We exactly calculate the properties of these BFSs for systems up to 32 sites and find that even for moderate reductions in measurement resolution they yield non-trivial steady state entanglement and coherence.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of first sound in a weakly interacting ultracold Fermi liquid: an exact calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At low temperature, a normal gas of unpaired spin-1/2 fermions is one of the cleanest realizations of a Fermi liquid. It is described by Landau's theory, where no phenomenological parameters are needed as the quasiparticle interaction function can be computed perturbatively in powers of the scattering length $a$, the sole parameter of the short-range interparticle interactions. Obtaining an accurate solution of the transport equation nevertheless requires a careful treatment of the collision kernel, as the uncontrolled error made by the relaxation time approximations increases when the temperature $T$ drops below the Fermi temperature. Here, we study sound waves in the hydrodynamic regime up to second order in the Chapman-Enskog's expansion. We find that the frequency $\omega_q$ of the sound wave is shifted above its linear depart as $\omega_q=c_1 q(1+\alpha q^2\tau^2)$ where $c_1$ and $q$ are the speed and wavenumber of the wave and the typical collision time $\tau$ scales as $1/a^2T^2$. Besides the shear viscosity, the coefficient $\alpha$ is described by a single second-order collision time which we compute exactly from an analytical solution of the transport equation, resulting in a positive dispersion $\alpha&gt;0$. Our results suggest that ultracold atomic Fermi gases are an ideal experimental system for quantitative tests of second order hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Properties of a trapped multiple-species bosonic mixture at the infinite-particle-number limit: A solvable model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a trapped mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates consisting of a multiple number of P species using an exactly-solvable many-body model, the $P$-species harmonic-interaction model. The solution is facilitated by utilizing a double set of Jacoby coordinates. A scheme to integrate the all-particle density matrix is derived and implemented. Of particular interest is the infinite-particle-number limit, which is obtained when the numbers of bosons are taken to infinity while keeping the interaction parameters fixed. We first prove that at the infinite-particle-number limit {\it all} the species are $100\%$ condensed. The mean-field solution of the $P$-species mixture is also obtained analytically, and is used to show that the energy per particle and densities per particle computed at the many-body level of theory boil down to their mean-field counterparts. Despite these, correlations in the mixture exist at the infinite-particle-number limit. To this end, we obtain closed-form expressions for the correlation energy and the depletion of the species at the infinite-particle-number limit. The depletion and the correlation energy per species are shown to critically depend on the number of species. Of separate interest is the entanglement between one species of bosons and the other $P-1$ species. Interestingly, there is an optimal number of species, here $P=3$, where the entanglement is maximal. Importantly, the manifestation of this interspecies entanglement in an observable is possible. It is the position-momentum uncertainty product of one species in the presence of the other $P-1$ species which is derived and demonstrated to correlate with the interspecies entanglement. All in all, we show and explain how correlations at the infinite-particle-number limit of a trapped multiple-species bosonic mixture depend on the interactions, and how they evolve with the number of species.</description>

      <title>Can vortex quantum droplets be realized experimentally?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current state of research on vortices carried by quantum droplets (QDs) has predicted their existence, in the stable form, in two- and three-dimensional free-space binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and dipolar BECs. These theoretical results suggest that QDs may be excellent carriers of self-trapped vortex states. Given that the experimental creation of QDs has already been firmly established, the observation of embedded vortices in them becomes a key question for the next phase of the development in the field.</description>

      <title>Winding Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their ubiquity, systematic characterization of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold exceptional points (EP$n$s), remains a significant unsolved problem. In this article, we characterize Abelian topology of eigenvalues for generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s for arbitrary $n$. The former and the latter emerge in a $(2n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-dimensional parameter space, respectively. By introducing resultant winding numbers, we elucidate that these EP$n$s are stable due to topology of a map from a base space (momentum or parameter space) to a sphere defined by these resultants. Our framework implies fundamental doubling theorems of both generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s in $n$-band models.</description>

      <title>Boundary-localized many-body bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs), referring to spatially localized bound states with energies falling within the range of extended modes, have been extensively investigated in single-particle systems, leading to diverse applications in photonics, acoustics, and other classical-wave systems. Recently, there has been theoretical interest in exploring many-body BICs in interacting quantum systems, which necessitate the careful design of impurity potentials or spatial profiles of interaction. Here, we propose a type of many-body BICs localized at boundaries, which can be purely induced by the uniform onsite interaction without requiring any specific design of impurity potential or nonlocal interaction. We numerically show that three or more interacting bosons can concentrate on the boundary of a homogeneous one-dimensional lattice, which is absent at single- and twoparticle counterparts. Moreover, the eigenenergy of multi-boson bound states can embed within the continuous energy spectra of extended scattering states, thereby giving rise to interactioninduced boundary many-body BICs. Furthermore, by mapping Fock states of three and four bosons to nonlinear circuit networks, we experimentally simulate boundary many-body BICs. Our findings enrich the comprehension of correlated BICs beyond the single-particle level, and have the potential to inspire future investigations on exploring many-body BICs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Scrambling, Chaos, Sensitivity, and Emergent State Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding quantum chaos is of profound theoretical interest and carries significant implications for various applications, from condensed matter physics to quantum error correction. Recently, out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOCs) have emerged as a powerful tool to quantify quantum chaos. For a given quantum system, the OTOCs measure incompatibility between an operator evolved in the Heisenberg picture and an unevolved operator. In the first part of this thesis, we employ OTOCs to study the dynamical sensitivity of a perturbed non-Komogorov-Arnold-Moser (non-KAM) system in the quantum limit as the parameter that characterizes the $\textit{resonance}$ condition is slowly varied. For this purpose, we consider a quantized kicked harmonic oscillator (KHO) model that displays stochastic webs in the phase space. The OTOC analysis is followed by a study of quantum Fisher information (QFI) at the resonances and a comparison with the non-resonance cases. We shall show that scaling of the QFI in time is enhanced at the resonances, making the dynamics of the non-KAM systems good candidates for quantum sensing. In the following chapter, we study the OTOCs in a bipartite system of kicked coupled tops with a special focus on the mixed phase space OTOC dynamics. The last part of the thesis is devoted to the study of the emergence of quantum state designs as a signature of quantum chaos and the role of symmetries in this phenomenon. Recently proposed projected ensemble framework utilizes quantum chaos as a resource to construct approximate higher-order state designs. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetries on the emergence of quantum state designs remain under-explored. We thoroughly investigate this by demonstrating the interplay between symmetries and measurements in constructing approximate state designs. Finally, we outline a few open directions relevant to the current thesis.</description>

      <title>Correlations of the Current Density in Many-Body Landau Level States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in quantum gas microscopy, we investigate correlation functions of the current density in many-body Landau Level states, such as the Laughlin state of the fractional quantum Hall effect. For states fully in the lowest Landau level, we present an exact relationship which shows that all correlation functions involving the current density are directly related to correlation functions of the number density. We calculate perturbative corrections to this relationship arising from inter-particle interactions, and show that this provides a method by which to extract the system's interaction energy. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our results also to lattice systems.</description>

Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Moir\'e Systems in Twisted Bilayer Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e related physics in twisted bilayer two-dimensional (2D) materials has attracted widespread interest in condensed matter physics. Simulation of moir\'e related physics in cold atom platform is expected to outperform the 2D materials thanks to its advantage of higher tunablility. Here, we point out, the cold atom platform enables a new mechanism of moir\'e lattice formation, with intrinsic "dynamical" character arising from interlayer interaction, in contrast to conventional moir\'e lattice induced by "static" ways such as single-particle interlayer tunneling or external controls. Specifically, we consider a twisted bilayer Bose-Hubbard model with vanishing interlayer tunneling, and the bilayer is solely coupled through interlayer interaction that originates from contact interaction of atoms. We find that this system hosts a plethora of novel phases unique to this dynamical lattice, including a variety of Mott insulator (MI) and superfluid (SF) phases either preserving or breaking moir\'e lattice symmetry, phases with one layer in SF and the other in MI, "interlocked" MI, and self-localized phases at commensurate twist angles, which exhibits the characteristics of Bose glass and quasi-many-body localization in the absence of (quasi)disorder or quasicrystalline lattices. Our prediction can be readily observed in current experimental setup of twisted bilayer optical lattices, opening up new avenues for exploring the rich physics of dynamical moir\'e systems in cold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superfluid dilute neutron matter and ultracold gas, close to the unitary regime, exhibit several similarities. Therefore, to a certain extent, fermionic ultracold gases may serve as emulators of dilute neutron matter, which forms the inner crust of neutron stars and is not directly accessed experimentally. Quantum vortices are one of the most significant properties of neutron superfluid, essential for comprehending neutron stars' dynamics. The structure and dynamics of quantum vortices as a function of pairing correlations' strength are being investigated experimentally and theoretically in ultracold gases. Certain aspects of these studies are relevant to neutron stars. We provide an overview of the characteristics of quantum vortices in s-wave-type fermionic and electrically neutral superfluids. The main focus is on the dynamics of fermionic vortices and their intrinsic structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stable Bardeen-Schrieffer-Cooper (BCS) pairing state of a bosonic system has long been sought theoretically and experimentally. Here we study the BCS state of a binary Bose gas with $s$-wave intra-species repulsions and an inter-species attraction in the mean-field-stable region. We find that above the Bose-Einstein-Condensation (BEC) transtion temperature, there is a phase transtion from the normal state to the BCS state due to inter-species pairing. When the temperature decreases, another phase transtion from the BCS state to the mixture state with both atomic BEC and inter-species pairs occurs. As the temperature is further lowered, the mixuture state is taken over by the BEC state. The phase diagram of this system is presented and experimental implications are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Networks of Rydberg atoms provide a powerful basis for quantum simulators and quantum technologies. Inspired by matter-wave atomtronics, here we engineer switches, diodes and universal logic gates. Our schemes control the Rydberg excitation dynamics via the anti-blockade or facilitation mechanism, allowing for much faster devices compared to cold atom systems. Our approach is robust to noise and can be applied to individually trapped atoms and extensive three-dimensional gases. In analogy to electronics, Rydberg atomtronic devices promise to enhance quantum information processors and quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Generic reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in metallic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermi sea in a metal can host exotic quantum topology, which determines its conductance quantization and is characterized by Euler characteristic $\chi_F$. Unlike gapped band topology described by the global feature of wave function, this topology of gapless system is associated with the geometry of Fermi sea, and thus probing and identifying $\chi_F$ are inherently difficult in high-dimensional systems. Here, we propose a dimensional reduction theory for $d$-dimensional Fermi sea topology, showing that $\chi_F$ can be determined by the feature of so-called reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces, with theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness. By performing the gapization for the metallic systems, we also reveal that $\chi_F$ can be reflected in the gapped band topology, which further provides an indirect way to measure $\chi_F$ through the (pseudo)spin structures of the superconducting system. Our work opens an avenue to characterize and detect the Fermi sea topology using low-dimensional momentum information.</description>

      <title>Models of interacting bosons with exact ground states: a unified approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for number-conserving bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer and vertex models, toric code, and certain Levin-Wen string-net models. We also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>
