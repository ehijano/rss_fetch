      <title>The Origin of Structure in the Auroral Ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The auroral ionosphere presents a paradox: turbulence often thrives in a conductive layer that should suppress the growth rates of plasma instabilities. Using a novel composite power spectrum from coherent radar and GPS data, we show that turbulence on a wide range of scales stem not from local instabilities. Instead, its spectrum is a structural imprint of field-aligned electrical currents, and its dissipative character is governed by the flux of precipitating particles. Our measurements provide a clear geophysical example of a driven, emergent system of self-organized dissipative structures.</description>

      <title>Multi-directional investigations on quiet time suprathermal ions measured by ASPEX-STEPS on-board Aditya L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin, acceleration and anisotropy of suprathermal ions in the interplanetary medium during quiet periods have remained poorly understood issues in solar wind physics. To address these aspects, we derive the spectral indices for the quiet time suprathermal ions based on the measurements by the four directionally separated sensors that are part of the Supra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on-board Aditya L1 spacecraft. Three out of four STEPS sensors Parker Spiral (PS), Inter-Mediate (IM), Earth Pointing (EP) are in one plane (nearly aligned with the ecliptic plane) while the fourth sensor North Pointing (NP) is in a mutually orthogonal plane. The energy ranges covered by the PS, IM, EP and NP sensors are 0.36-1.32 MeV, 0.14-1.22 MeV, 0.39-1.33 MeV and 0.12-1.23 MeV respectively. The quiet intervals are identified during January November, 2024 and the derived spectral indices (differential directional flux versus energy) are found to be in the range of 2.0 for all directions in the time scale of a few days revealing isotropic nature of their distribution. Further analysis of elemental abundance ratios (3He/4He, Fe/O, and C/O) during the same quiet intervals obtained from the Ultra-Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on board the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft suggests possible contributions from the leftover ions from the previous impulsive (Solar flares) and gradual events (CMEs) in the quiet time suprathermal ion pool.</description>

      <title>GIC--Related Observations During the May 2024 Geomagnetic Storm in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The May 2024 geomagnetic storm was one of the most severe in the past twenty years. Understanding how large geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) impact geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) within power grid networks is key to ensuring their resilience. We have assembled and synthesized a large and diverse set of GMD-related data, compared model predictions with measurements, and identified empirical relationships for GICs in the contiguous United States for this storm.
  Measurement data include GIC data from $47$ sites and magnetometer data from $17$ magnetometer sites. Model data include computed GIC by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) power system operators at four sites, GIC computed using a reference model at $47$ sites, $\Delta \mathbf{B}$ at 12 magnetometer sites from the Multiscale Atmosphere-Geospace Environment Model (MAGE), Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), and Open Geospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM) global magnetosphere models, and $\mathbf{\beta}$ scaling factors derived from magnetotelluric (MT) transfer functions at $\sim 5,000$ MT sites.
  GIC measured and modeled by TVA had a correlation coefficient $&gt;0.8$ and a prediction efficiency between $0.4$ and $0.7$. The horizontal magnetic field pertubation from a basline, $\Delta B_H$, predicted by MAGE, SWMF, and OpenGGCM had a correlation that ranged from $0.4$ to $0.6$. Two empirical relationships were considered: (1) how the correlation between measured GIC site pairs depended on differences in site separation distance, $\beta$ scaling factor, and latitude; and (2) a regression model that predicts the standard deviation and maximum GIC magnitude at each site given inputs of site latitude and $\beta$.</description>

      <title>SLAMS-Propelled Electron Acceleration at High-Mach Number Astrophysical Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short Large Amplitude Magnetic Structures (SLAMS) are frequently detected during spacecraft crossings over the Earth bow shock. We investigate the existence of such structures at astrophysical shocks, where they could result from the steepening of cosmic-ray (CR) driven waves. Using kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we study the growth of SLAMS and the appearance of associated transient shocks in the upstream region of quasi-parallel, non-relativistic, high-Mach number collisionless shocks. We find that high-energy CRs significantly enhance the transverse magnetic field within SLAMS, producing highly inclined field lines. As SLAMS are advected towards the shock, these fields lines form an intermittent superluminal configuration which traps magnetized electrons at fast shocks. Due to their oscillatory nature, SLAMS are periodically separated by subluminal gaps with lower transverse magnetic field strength. In these regions, electrons diffuse and accelerate by bouncing between the shock and the approaching SLAMS region through a mechanism that we call quasi-periodic shock acceleration (QSA). We analytically derive the distribution of electrons accelerated via QSA, $f(p)\sim p^{[-4.7,-5.7]}$, which agrees well with the simulation spectra. We find that the electron power law remains steep until the end of our longest runs, providing a possible explanation for the steep electron spectra observed at least up to GeV energies in young and fast supernova remnants.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Magnetic Reconnection in Astrophysical Plasmas: A Powerful Mechanism of Nonthermal Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection -- a fundamental plasma physics process, where magnetic field lines of opposite polarity annihilate -- is invoked in astrophysical plasmas as a powerful mechanism of nonthermal particle acceleration, able to explain fast-evolving, bright high-energy flares. Near black holes and neutron stars, reconnection occurs in the ``relativistic'' regime, in which the mean magnetic energy per particle exceeds the rest mass energy. This review reports recent advances in our understanding of the kinetic physics of relativistic reconnection: (1) Kinetic simulations have elucidated the physics of plasma heating and nonthermal particle acceleration in relativistic reconnection; (2) The physics of radiative relativistic reconnection, with its self-consistent interplay between photons and reconnection-accelerated particles -- a peculiarity of luminous, high-energy astrophysical sources -- is the new frontier of research; (3) Relativistic reconnection plays a key role in global models of high-energy sources, both in terms of global-scale layers, as well as of reconnection sites generated as a byproduct of local magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. We summarize themes of active investigation and future directions, emphasizing the role of upcoming observational capabilities, laboratory experiments, and new computational tools.</description>
