      <title>A Binary IV Model for Persuasion: Profiling Persuasion Types among Compliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an empirical study of persuasion, researchers often use a binary instrument to encourage individuals to consume information and take some action. We show that, with a binary Imbens-Angrist instrumental variable model and the monotone treatment response assumption, it is possible to identify the joint distribution of potential outcomes among compliers. This is necessary to identify the percentage of mobilised voters and their statistical characteristic defined by the moments of the joint distribution of treatment and covariates. Specifically, we develop a method that enables researchers to identify the statistical characteristic of persuasion types: always-voters, never-voters, and mobilised voters among compliers. These findings extend the kappa weighting results in Abadie (2003). We also provide a sharp test for the two sets of identification assumptions. The test boils down to testing whether there exists a nonnegative solution to a possibly under-determined system of linear equations with known coefficients. An application based on Green et al. (2003) is provided.</description>

      <title>Normal Approximation for U-Statistics with Cross-Sectional Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply Stein's method to investigate the normal approximation for both non-degenerate and degenerate U-statistics with cross-sectionally dependent underlying processes in the Wasserstein metric. We show that the convergence rates depend on the mixing rates, the sparsity of the cross-sectional dependence, and the moments of the kernel functions. Conditions are derived for central limit theorems to hold as corollaries. We demonstrate one application of the theoretical results with nonparametric specification test for data with cross-sectional dependence.</description>

      <title>Autoencoder Enhanced Realised GARCH on Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realised volatility has become increasingly prominent in volatility forecasting due to its ability to capture intraday price fluctuations. With a growing variety of realised volatility estimators, each with unique advantages and limitations, selecting an optimal estimator may introduce challenges. In this thesis, aiming to synthesise the impact of various realised volatility measures on volatility forecasting, we propose an extension of the Realised GARCH model that incorporates an autoencoder-generated synthetic realised measure, combining the information from multiple realised measures in a nonlinear manner. Our proposed model extends existing linear methods, such as Principal Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis, to reduce the dimensionality of realised measures. The empirical evaluation, conducted across four major stock markets from January 2000 to June 2022 and including the period of COVID-19, demonstrates both the feasibility of applying an autoencoder to synthesise volatility measures and the superior effectiveness of the proposed model in one-step-ahead rolling volatility forecasting. The model exhibits enhanced flexibility in parameter estimations across each rolling window, outperforming traditional linear approaches. These findings indicate that nonlinear dimension reduction offers further adaptability and flexibility in improving the synthetic realised measure, with promising implications for future volatility forecasting applications.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Policy Learning for Continuous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies policy learning for continuous treatments from observational data. Continuous treatments present more significant challenges than discrete ones because population welfare may need nonparametric estimation, and policy space may be infinite-dimensional and may satisfy shape restrictions. We propose to approximate the policy space with a sequence of finite-dimensional spaces and, for any given policy, obtain the empirical welfare by applying the kernel method. We consider two cases: known and unknown propensity scores. In the latter case, we allow for machine learning of the propensity score and modify the empirical welfare to account for the effect of machine learning. The learned policy maximizes the empirical welfare or the modified empirical welfare over the approximating space. In both cases, we modify the penalty algorithm proposed in \cite{mbakop2021model} to data-automate the tuning parameters (i.e., bandwidth and dimension of the approximating space) and establish an oracle inequality for the welfare regret.</description>

      <title>Debiased Regression for Root-N-Consistent Conditional Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a debiasing method for regression estimators, including high-dimensional and nonparametric regression estimators. For example, nonparametric regression methods allow for the estimation of regression functions in a data-driven manner with minimal assumptions; however, these methods typically fail to achieve $\sqrt{n}$-consistency in their convergence rates, and many, including those in machine learning, lack guarantees that their estimators asymptotically follow a normal distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a debiasing technique for nonparametric estimators by adding a bias-correction term to the original estimators, extending the conventional one-step estimator used in semiparametric analysis. Specifically, for each data point, we estimate the conditional expected residual of the original nonparametric estimator, which can, for instance, be computed using kernel (Nadaraya-Watson) regression, and incorporate it as a bias-reduction term. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed estimator achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality under a mild convergence rate condition for both the original nonparametric estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator. Notably, this approach remains model-free as long as the original estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator satisfy the convergence rate condition. The proposed method offers several advantages, including improved estimation accuracy and simplified construction of confidence intervals.</description>
