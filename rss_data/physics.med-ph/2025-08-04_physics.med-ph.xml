      <title>Anatomically Informed GREIT Reconstruction: Improving EIT Imaging for Lung Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Time-difference electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is gaining widespread use for bedside lung monitoring in intensive care patients suffering from lung-related diseases. It involves collecting voltage measurements from electrodes placed on the patient's thorax, which are then used to reconstruct impedance images. This study investigates how incorporating anatomical information from CT data into the widely used GREIT reconstruction algorithm affects EIT images and improves their interpretability. Approach: Based on clinically motivated lung state scenarios, we simulated EIT measurements to assess how the GREIT parameters influence the result of EIT image reconstruction, particularly with respect to noise performance and image accuracy. We introduce quality measures that allow us to perform a quantitative assessment of reconstruction quality. Anatomical features from CT data were included by customizing background conductivity and GREIT training target distribution. Main results: Our analysis confirmed that unphysiological background conductivity assumptions can lead to misleading EIT images, whereas physiological values, although more accurate, come with higher noise sensitivity. By increasing the number of GREIT training targets inside the lung and adapting the respective weighting radius, we significantly improved the anatomical accuracy of the EIT images. When applied to clinical EIT data from a representative ARDS patient, these adjustments in the reconstruction setup substantially enhanced the interpretability of the resulting EIT images. Significance: Integrating CT-based anatomical data in the GREIT reconstruction significantly enhances the clinical applicability of EIT in lung monitoring. The improved interpretability of EIT images facilitates better-informed clinical decisions and the individualized adjustment of ventilation strategies for critically ill patients.</description>

      <title>Review: Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Head and Neck Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future of ART in head and neck cancer is just beginning. Novel technologies have pushed the boundary of what is possible in terms of techniques to identify biomarkers for adaptation as well as innovative devices specialized to respond to these adaptations, sometimes in real-time. Important interdisciplinary steps must be taken moving forward to ensure the safe deployment of these new techniques, such as rigorous quality assurance evaluations from medical physicists, clinical trials from physicians, and comprehensive testing from vendors prior to release. In summary, we aimed not to provide a single correct answer for the optimal implementation of ART in the era of imaging biomarkers, but to encourage the field to collaborate and bring each idea discussed here together to overcome current barriers and deliver the best treatment possible to the patient.</description>

      <title>Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many complex systems - be they financial, natural or social - are composed by units - such as stocks, neurons or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationships between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at providing an answer within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing. Briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph, by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not - and, in case, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, the structure of the negative subgraph being more prone to inter-subject variability than the complementary, positive subgraph. At the mesoscopic level, instead, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</description>

      <title>Material Decomposition in Photon-Counting Computed Tomography with Diffusion Models: Comparative Study and Hybridization with Variational Regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) has emerged as a promising imaging technique, enabling spectral imaging and material decomposition (MD). However, images typically suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio due to constraints such as low photon counts and sparse-view settings which provoke artifacts. To prevent this, variational methods minimize a data-fit function coupled with handcrafted regularizers which mimics a prior by enforcing image properties such as the sparsity of the gradient. In the last few years, diffusion models (DMs) became predominant in the field of generative models and have been used as a learned prior for image reconstruction. This work investigates the use of DMs as regularizers for MD tasks in PCCT, specifically using diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) guidance. Three DPS-based approaches, i.e., image-domain two-step DPS (im-TDPS), projection-domain two-step DPS (proj-TDPS), and one-step DPS (ODPS), are evaluated. The first two methods perform MD in two steps by performing reconstruction and MD separately. The last method, ODPS, samples the material images directly from the measurement data. The results indicate that ODPS achieves superior performance compared to im-TDPS and proj-TDPS, providing sharper, noise-free and crosstalk-free images. Furthermore, we introduce a novel hybrid ODPS method for scenarios involving materials absent from the training dataset. This methods combine DM priors with standard variational handcrafted regularizers for the materials unknown to the DM. This hybrid method demonstrates improved MD quality compared to a standard variational method and does not require additional training of the DM neural network (NN).</description>
