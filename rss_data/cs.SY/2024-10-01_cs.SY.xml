      <title>Constraint-Aware Refinement for Safety Verification of Neural Feedback Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) are becoming increasingly popular in the design of control pipelines for autonomous systems. However, since the performance of NNs can degrade in the presence of out-of-distribution data or adversarial attacks, systems that have NNs in their control pipelines, i.e., neural feedback loops (NFLs), need safety assurances before they can be applied in safety-critical situations. Reachability analysis offers a solution to this problem by calculating reachable sets that bound the possible future states of an NFL and can be checked against dangerous regions of the state space to verify that the system does not violate safety constraints. Since exact reachable sets are generally intractable to calculate, reachable set over approximations (RSOAs) are typically used. The problem with RSOAs is that they can be overly conservative, making it difficult to verify the satisfaction of safety constraints, especially over long time horizons or for highly nonlinear NN control policies. Refinement strategies such as partitioning or symbolic propagation are typically used to limit the conservativeness of RSOAs, but these approaches come with a high computational cost and often can only be used to verify safety for simple reachability problems. This paper presents Constraint-Aware Refinement for Verification (CARV): an efficient refinement strategy that reduces the conservativeness of RSOAs by explicitly using the safety constraints on the NFL to refine RSOAs only where necessary. We demonstrate that CARV can verify the safety of an NFL where other approaches either fail or take up to 60x longer and 40x the memory.</description>

      <title>Analysis of human steering behavior differences in human-in-control and autonomy-in-control driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steering models (such as the generalized two-point model) predict human steering behavior well when the human is in direct control of a vehicle. In vehicles under autonomous control, human control inputs are not used; rather, an autonomous controller applies steering and acceleration commands to the vehicle. For example, human steering input may be used for state estimation rather than direct control. We show that human steering behavior changes when the human no longer directly controls the vehicle and the two are instead working in a shared autonomy paradigm. Thus, when a vehicle is not under direct human control, steering models like the generalized two-point model do not predict human steering behavior. We also show that the error between predicted human steering behavior and actual human steering behavior reflects a fundamental difference when the human directly controls the vehicle compared to when the vehicle is autonomously controlled. Moreover, we show that a single distribution describes the error between predicted human steering behavior and actual human steering behavior when the human's steering inputs are used for state estimation and the vehicle is autonomously controlled, indicating there may be a underlying model for human steering behavior under this type of shared autonomous control. Future work includes determining this shared autonomous human steering model and demonstrating its performance.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Approach To Preserve Safety and Reference Tracking for Constrained Cyber-Physical Systems Under Network Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a worst-case data-driven control architecture capable of ensuring the safety of constrained Cyber-Physical Systems under cyber-attacks while minimizing, whenever possible, potential degradation in tracking performance. To this end, a data-driven robust anomaly detector is designed to detect cyber-attack occurrences. Moreover, an add-on tracking supervisor module allows safe open-loop tracking control operations in case of unreliable measurements. On the plant side, a safety verification module and a local emergency controller are designed to manage severe attack scenarios that cannot be handled on the controller's side. These two modules resort to worst-case reachability and controllability data-driven arguments to detect potential unsafe scenarios and replace, whenever strictly needed, the tracking controller with emergency actions whose objective is to steer the plant's state trajectory in a predefined set of admissible and safe robust control invariant region until an attack-free scenario is restored. The effectiveness of the proposed solution has been shown through a simulation example.</description>

      <title>Koopman Operator in the Weighted Function Spaces and its Learning for the Estimation of Lyapunov and Zubov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematical properties and data-driven learning of the Koopman operator, which represents nonlinear dynamics as a linear mapping on a properly defined functional spaces, have become key problems in nonlinear system identification and control. However, Koopman operators that are approximately learned from snapshot data may not always accurately predict the system evolution on long horizons. In this work, by defining the Koopman operator on a space of weighted continuous functions and learning it on a weighted reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the Koopman operator is guaranteed to be contractive and the accumulation learning error is bounded. The weighting function, assumed to be known a priori, has an exponential decay with the flow or decays exponentially when compensated by an exponential factor. Under such a construction, the Koopman operator learned from data is used to estimate (i) Lyapunov functions for globally asymptotically stable dynamics, and (ii) Zubov-Lyapunov functions that characterize the domain of attraction. For these estimations, probabilistic bounds on the errors are derived.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Dunkelflaute: An analysis of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variable renewable energy droughts, also referred to as "Dunkelflaute", emerge as a challenge for realizing climate-neutral energy systems based on variable wind and solar power. Using data on 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method, we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and policy-relevant renewable technology portfolios. We show that drought characteristics heavily depend on the chosen threshold. Using single thresholds, as common in the literature, is thus not advisable. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We further identify the most extreme droughts and show how these drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system. Such events comprise sequences of shorter, contiguous droughts of varying severity. In a perfectly interconnected Europe, the most extreme drought event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55~days. Yet, the average renewable portfolio availability during this event was still 47% of its long-run mean. As extreme droughts may span across the turn of years, single calendar year planning horizons are not suitable for modeling weather-resilient future energy scenarios.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Input and State Estimation for Multi-agent System with Dynamic Topology and Heterogeneous Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial challenge in decentralized systems is state estimation in the presence of unknown inputs, particularly within heterogeneous sensor networks with dynamic topologies. While numerous consensus algorithms have been introduced, they often require extensive information exchange or multiple communication iterations to ensure estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm that achieves an unbiased and optimal solution comparable to filters with full information about other agents. This is accomplished through the use of information filter decomposition and the fusion of inputs via covariance intersection. Our method requires only a single communication iteration for exchanging individual estimates between agents, instead of multiple rounds of information exchange, thus preserving agents' privacy by avoiding the sharing of explicit observations and system equations. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by dynamic communication topologies, we propose two practical strategies to handle issues arising from intermittent observations and incomplete state estimation, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the estimation process. Experiments and ablation studies conducted in both stationary and dynamic environments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over other baselines. Notably, it performs as well as, or even better than, algorithms that have a global view of all neighbors.</description>

      <title>Interleaved One-Shot SPS Performance under Smart DoS Attacks in C-V2X Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of the one-shot Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) mechanism in Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) networks under Denial-of-Service (DoS) smart attack scenarios. The study focuses on the impact of these attacks on key performance metrics, including Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Inter-Packet Gap (IPG), and Age of Information (AoI). Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the one-shot mechanism significantly enhances network resilience by mitigating the adverse effects of smart DoS attacks. The findings reveal that while the one-shot mechanism improves the PDR and reduces the IPG and AoI tail values, its effectiveness diminishes slightly in high-density vehicular environments. Nevertheless, the one-shot mechanism proves to be a robust solution for maintaining the stability and reliability of C-V2X communications under adversarial conditions.</description>

      <title>MERIT: Multimodal Wearable Vital Sign Waveform Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and premature mortality worldwide, with occupational environments significantly influencing CVD risk, underscoring the need for effective cardiac monitoring and early warning systems. Existing methods of monitoring vital signs require subjects to remain stationary, which is impractical for daily monitoring as individuals are often in motion. To address this limitation, we propose MERIT, a multimodality-based wearable system designed for precise ECG waveform monitoring without movement restrictions. Daily activities, involving frequent arm movements, can significantly affect sensor data and complicate the reconstruction of accurate ECG signals. To mitigate motion impact and enhance ECG signal reconstruction, we introduce a deep independent component analysis (Deep-ICA) module and a multimodal fusion module. We conducted experiments with 15 subjects. Our results, compared with commercial wearable devices and existing methods, demonstrate that MERIT accurately reconstructs ECG waveforms during various office activities, offering a reliable solution for fine-grained cardiac monitoring in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Absolute centrality in a signed Friedkin-Johnsen based model: a graphical characterisation of influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the evolution of opinions governed by a Friedkin Johnsen (FJ) based model in arbitrary network structures with signed interactions. The agents contributing to the opinion formation are characterised as being influential. Initially, the agents are classified as opinion leaders and followers based on network connectivity and the nature of interactions. However, the addition of stubbornness leads to interesting behaviours wherein a non influential agent can now become influential and vice versa. Thereafter, a signal flow graph (SFG) based method is proposed to quantify the influence of an influential agents' opinions. Additionally, it helps illustrate the role played by network topology in shaping the final opinions of the agents. Based on this analysis, the absolute centrality measure is proposed to determine the overall influence of all the agents in the network. Unlike most of the existing measures, it is applicable to any network structure and considers the effect of stubbornness and antagonism. Examples are presented throughout the paper to illustrate and validate these results.</description>

      <title>Optimized Excitation Signal Tailored to Pertinent Dynamic Process Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of data-driven techniques significantly relies on the input signal used to generate the training data. Nevertheless, there is a notable gap in research when it comes to designing excitation signals for identifying nonlinear dynamic systems, likely because of the challenges involved. Based on current knowledge, it is crucial for excitation signals to effectively capture the nonlinearity across the entire operational area and to gather insights into the area-specific dynamic process characteristics. The Incremental Dynamic Space-Filling Design (IDS-FID) strategy designs excitation signals to achieve a space-filling distribution across the input space of a nonlinear approximator used in external dynamics modeling, gathering information throughout its operational area. Simultaneously, the approach enables for a heightened focus on either the systems steady-state or transient responses during information acquisition by altering the excitation signals dynamics, facilitating targeted insights into dynamic process characteristics.</description>

      <title>Koopman Spectral Analysis from Noisy Measurements based on Bayesian Learning and Kalman Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman spectral analysis plays a crucial role in understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems as it reveals key system behaviors and long-term dynamics. However, the presence of measurement noise poses a significant challenge to accurately extracting spectral properties. In this work, we propose a robust method for identifying the Koopman operator and extracting its spectral characteristics in noisy environments. To address the impact of noise, our approach tackles an identification problem that accounts for both systematic errors from finite-dimensional approximations and measurement noise in the data. By incorporating Bayesian learning and Kalman smoothing, the method simultaneously identifies the Koopman operator and estimates system states, effectively decoupling these two error sources. The method's efficiency and robustness are demonstrated through extensive experiments, showcasing its accuracy across varying noise levels.</description>

      <title>Fast and Reliable $N-k$ Contingency Screening with Input-Convex Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system operators must ensure that dispatch decisions remain feasible in case of grid outages or contingencies to prevent cascading failures and ensure reliable operation. However, checking the feasibility of all $N - k$ contingencies -- every possible simultaneous failure of $k$ grid components -- is computationally intractable for even small $k$, requiring system operators to resort to heuristic screening methods. Because of the increase in uncertainty and changes in system behaviors, heuristic lists might not include all relevant contingencies, generating false negatives in which unsafe scenarios are misclassified as safe. In this work, we propose to use input-convex neural networks (ICNNs) for contingency screening. We show that ICNN reliability can be determined by solving a convex optimization problem, and by scaling model weights using this problem as a differentiable optimization layer during training, we can learn an ICNN classifier that is both data-driven and has provably guaranteed reliability. Namely, our method can ensure a zero false negative rate. We empirically validate this methodology in a case study on the IEEE 39-bus test network, observing that it yields substantial (10-20x) speedups while having excellent classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Improved Sample Complexity of Imitation Learning for Barrier Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work in imitation learning has shown that having an expert controller that is both suitably smooth and stable enables stronger guarantees on the performance of the learned controller. However, constructing such smoothed expert controllers for arbitrary systems remains challenging, especially in the presence of input and state constraints. As our primary contribution, we show how such a smoothed expert can be designed for a general class of systems using a log-barrier-based relaxation of a standard Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization problem.
  Improving upon our previous work, we show that barrier MPC achieves theoretically optimal error-to-smoothness tradeoff along some direction. At the core of this theoretical guarantee on smoothness is an improved lower bound we prove on the optimality gap of the analytic center associated with a convex Lipschitz function, which we believe could be of independent interest. We validate our theoretical findings via experiments, demonstrating the merits of our smoothing approach over randomized smoothing.</description>

      <title>Outage-Constrained Sum Secrecy Rate Maximization for STAR-RIS with Energy-Harvesting Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel strategy for enhancing secure wireless communication through the use of a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) in a multiple-input single-output system. In the presence of energy-harvesting eavesdroppers, the study aims to maximize the secrecy rate while adhering to strict energy harvesting constraints. By dynamically manipulating the wireless environment with the STAR-RIS, the research examines the balance between harvested energy and secrecy rate under two key protocols: energy splitting and mode selection. The study addresses both imperfect and perfect channel state information (CSI) and formulates a complex non-convex optimization problem, which is solved using a penalty concave convex procedure combined with an alternating optimization algorithm. The method optimizes beamforming and STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients to achieve a optimal balance between secure communication and energy harvesting constraints. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach is effective, even with imperfect CSI, and outperforms conventional RIS methods in terms of robust security and energy performance.</description>

      <title>Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems: A compositional electro-magneto hydrodynamics model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics plays a crucial role in various multiphysics applications, including energy systems, electronics cooling, and biomedical engineering. Developing computational models for complex coupled systems can be challenging and time-consuming. In particular, ensuring the consistent integration of models from diverse physical domains requires meticulous attention. Even if the coupling of specialized simulation tools based on different formalisms were practically feasible, the growing demand to combine first-principles-based modeling with scientific machine learning necessitates an integrated high-level approach to model specification. Considering the example of electro-magneto hydrodynamics (on a fixed spatial domain and with linear polarization and magnetization), this article demonstrates how relatively complex models can be hierarchically composed from simpler parts by means of a formal language for multiphysics modeling. The Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS) modeling language features a simple graphical syntax for expressing the energy-based interconnection of subsystems. This reduces cognitive load and facilitates communication, especially in multidisciplinary environments. As the example demonstrates, existing models can be easily integrated as subsystems of new models. Specifically, the ideal fluid model is used as a subsystem of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier fluid model, which in turn is used as a subsystem of the electro-magneto hydrodynamics model. The compositional approach makes it nearly trivial to encapsulate, reuse, and swap out (parts of) models. Moreover, structural properties of EPHS models guarantee fundamental properties of thermodynamic systems, such as conservation of energy, non-negative entropy production, and Onsager reciprocal relations.</description>

      <title>Research on Enhancing C-V2X Communication via Risk-Level Transmission Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a protocol that optimizes message dissemination in C-V2X technology, crucial for advancing intelligent transportation systems (ITS) aimed at enhancing road safety. As vehicle density and velocity rise, the volume of data requiring communication significantly increases. By considering the risk levels that vehicles encounter and using inter-vehicle proximity as a key indicator of potential hazards, the proposed protocol prioritizes communication, allowing vehicles facing higher risks to transmit their messages first. Our results show that this prioritization effectively reduces the number of concurrent transmissions, leading to improved performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, throughput, latency, and lower probabilities of channel congestion and collision.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid PV-Wind-Battery Power System for a Mars Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a hybrid photovoltaic-wind-battery power system designed to sustain a Mars base under varying seasonal and climatic conditions. The Mars Climate Database was utilized to simulate the effects of seasonal changes, diurnal cycles, and dust storms on the system's power generation. The seasonal performance was analyzed across the Martian surface and at potential habitation sites proposed in the "First Landing Site/Exploration Zone Workshop for Human Missions to the Surface of Mars (FLSW).'' Within the hybrid system, the photovoltaic arrays serve as the primary energy source, with wind turbines providing essential backup during nighttime and dust storms. A single $1\,000\,\mathrm{m}^2$ photovoltaic array, a $33.4\,\mathrm{m}$ diameter wind turbine, and a $312\,\mathrm{kWh}$ battery can support a six-person Mars base at $32.1\%$ of the Martian surface during the equinoxes and solstices, expanding to $51.7\%$ with three sets of arrays and turbines. Additionally, $24$ FLSW sites can be supported throughout the solstices and equinoxes by a single photovoltaic array, turbine, and battery, even during global dust storms. Among the $24$ sites, Hebrus Valles, Huygens Crater, and Noctis Labyrinthus had the highest energy production potential. These findings are expected to guide further research on hybrid renewable power systems for Mars exploration.</description>

Abstract: Social-media platforms are one of the most prevalent communication media today. In such systems, a large amount of content is generated and available to the platform. However, not all content can be transmitted to every possible user at all times. At the other end are the users, who have their own preferences about which content they enjoy, which is often unknown ex ante to the platform. We model the interaction between the platform and the users as a signaling game with asymmetric information, where each user optimizes its preference disclosure policy, and the platform optimizes its information disclosure policy. We provide structural as well as existence of policies that constitute Bayesian Nash Equilibria, and necessary optimality conditions used to explicitly compute the optimal policies.</description>

      <title>Energetic Resilience of Linear Driftless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a malfunction causes a control system to lose authority over a subset of its actuators, achieving a task may require spending additional energy in order to compensate for the effect of uncontrolled inputs. To understand this increase in energy, we introduce energetic resilience metrics that quantify the maximal additional energy required to achieve finite-time regulation in linear driftless systems that lose authority over some of their actuators. Using a technical lemma based on the calculus of variations, we first derive optimal control signals and minimum energies to achieve this task in both the nominal and malfunctioning systems. We then obtain a bound on the worst-case energy used by the malfunctioning system, and its exact expression in the special case of loss of authority over one actuator. Further considering this special case, we derive bounds on additive and multiplicative metrics for energetic resilience. A simulation example on a model of an underwater robot demonstrates that these bounds are useful in quantifying the increased energy used by a system suffering a partial loss of control authority.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBF) are widely explored to enforce the safety-critical constraints on nonlinear systems recently. There are many researchers incorporating the control barrier functions into path planning algorithms to find a safe path, but these methods involve huge computational complexity or unidirectional randomness, resulting in arising of run-time. When safety constraints are satisfied, searching efficiency, and searching space are sacrificed. This paper combines the novel motion planning approach using rapid exploring random trees (RRT) algorithm with model predictive control (MPC) to enforce the CBF with dynamically updating constraints to get the safety-critical resolution of trajectory which will enable the robots not to collide with both static and dynamic circle obstacles as well as other moving robots while considering the model uncertainty in process. Besides, this paper first realizes application of CBF-RRT in robot arm model for nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Framework for Physical-Virtual Integration in V2X-Enabled Connected Vehicle Corridors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS) are critical in improving traffic safety, reliability, and sustainability by integrating computing, communication, and control in transportation systems. The connected vehicle corridor is at the forefront of this transformation, where Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) technology facilitates real-time data exchange between infrastructure, vehicles, and road users. However, challenges remain in processing and synchronizing the vast V2X data from vehicles and roadside units, particularly when ensuring scalability, data integrity, and operational resilience. This paper presents a digital twin framework for T-CPS, developed from a real-world connected vehicle corridor to address these challenges. By leveraging C-V2X technology and real-time data from infrastructure, vehicles, and road users, the digital twin accurately replicates vehicle behaviors, signal phases, and traffic patterns within the CARLA simulation environment. This framework demonstrates high fidelity between physical and digital systems and ensures robust synchronization of vehicle trajectories and signal phases through extensive experiments. Moreover, the digital twin's scalable and redundant architecture enhances data integrity, making it capable of supporting future large-scale C-V2X deployments. The digital twin is a vital tool in T-CPS, enabling real-time traffic monitoring, prediction, and optimization to enhance the reliability and safety of transportation systems.</description>

      <title>AARK: An Open Toolkit for Autonomous Racing Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing demands safe control of vehicles at their physical limits for extended periods of time, providing insights into advanced vehicle safety systems which increasingly rely on intervention provided by vehicle autonomy. Participation in this field carries with it a high barrier to entry. Physical platforms and their associated sensor suites require large capital outlays before any demonstrable progress can be made. Simulators allow researches to develop soft autonomous systems without purchasing a platform. However, currently available simulators lack visual and dynamic fidelity, can still be expensive to buy, lack customisation, and are difficult to use. AARK provides three packages, ACI, ACDG, and ACMPC. These packages enable research into autonomous control systems in the demanding environment of racing to bring more people into the field and improve reproducibility: ACI provides researchers with a computer vision-friendly interface to Assetto Corsa for convenient comparison and evaluation of autonomous control solutions; ACDG enables generation of depth, normal and semantic segmentation data for training computer vision models to use in perception systems; and ACMPC gives newcomers to the field a modular full-stack autonomous control solution, capable of controlling vehicles to build from. AARK aims to unify and democratise research into a field critical to providing safer roads and trusted autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low-crosstalk Silicon Switches Driven Thermally and Electrically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonic switches are widely considered as a cost-effective solution for addressing the ever-growing data traffic in datacenter networks, as they offer unique advantages such as low power consumption, low latency, small footprint and high bandwidth. Despite extensive research efforts, crosstalk in large-scale photonic circuits still poses a threat to the signal integrity. In this paper, we present two designs of silicon Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) switches achieving ultra-low-crosstalk, driven thermally and electrically. Each switch fabric is optimized at both the device and circuit level to suppress crosstalk and reduce system complexity. Notably, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we harness the inherent self-heating effect in a carrier-injection-based MZI switch to create a pair of phase shifters that offer arbitrary phase differences. Such a pair of phase shifters induces matched insertion loss at each arm, thus minimizing crosstalk. Experimentally, an ultra-low crosstalk ratio below -40 dB is demonstrated for both thermo-optic (T-O) and electro-optic (E-O) switches. The T-O switch exhibits an on-chip loss of less than 5 dB with a switching time of 500 microseconds, whereas the E-O switch achieves an on-chip loss as low as 8.5 dB with a switching time of under 100 ns. In addition, data transmission of a 50 Gb/s on-off keying signal is demonstrated with high fidelity on the E-O switch, showing the great potential of the proposed switch designs.</description>

      <title>Robust Multivariate Detection and Estimation with Fault Frequency Content Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04922v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of fault detection and estimation (FDE) for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with a particular focus on frequency content information of faults, possibly as multiple disjoint continuum ranges, and under both disturbances and stochastic noise. To ensure the worst-case fault sensitivity in the considered frequency ranges and mitigate the effects of disturbances and noise, an optimization framework incorporating a mixed H_/H2 performance index is developed to compute the optimal detection filter. Moreover, a thresholding rule is proposed to guarantee both the false alarm rate (FAR) and the fault detection rate (FDR). Next, shifting attention to fault estimation in specific frequency ranges, an exact reformulation of the optimal estimation filter design using the restricted Hinf performance index is derived, which is inherently non-convex. However, focusing on finite frequency samples and fixed poles, a lower bound is established via a highly tractable quadratic programming (QP) problem. This lower bound together with an alternating optimization (AO) approach to the original estimation problem leads to a suboptimality gap for the overall estimation filter design. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is validated through applications of a non-minimum phase hydraulic turbine system and a multi-area power system.</description>

      <title>Modeling Fault Recovery and Transient Stability of Grid-Forming Converters Equipped With Current Reference Limitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) face severe grid disturbances (e.g., short-circuit faults), the current limitation mechanism may be triggered. Consequently, the GFM IBRs enter the current-saturation mode, inducing nonlinear dynamical behaviors and posing great challenges to the post-disturbance transient angle stability. This paper presents a systematic study to reveal the fault recovery behaviors of a GFM IBR and identify the risk of instability. A closed-form expression for the necessary condition that a GFM IBR returns from the current-saturation mode to the normal operation mode is presented. Based on these analyses, it is inferred that the angle of the magnitude-saturated current significantly affects the post-fault recovery and transient stability; with different angle selection, the system may follow multiple post-fault trajectories depending on those conditions: 1) Convergence to a normal stable equilibrium point (SEP), 2) convergence to a saturated stable equilibrium point (satSEP), or 3) divergence (instability). In this paper, the circumstances under which a GFM IBR cannot escape from the current-saturation mode are thoroughly investigated. The theoretical analyses are verified by dynamic simulations.</description>

Abstract: The rise of advanced air mobility (AAM) is expected to become a multibillion-dollar industry in the near future. Market-based mechanisms are touted to be an integral part of AAM operations, which comprise heterogeneous operators with private valuations. In this work, we study the problem of designing a mechanism to coordinate the movement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, operated by multiple operators each having heterogeneous valuations associated with their fleet, between vertiports, while enforcing the arrival, departure, and parking constraints at vertiports. Particularly, we propose an incentive-compatible and individually rational vertiport reservation mechanism that maximizes a social welfare metric, which encapsulates the objective of maximizing the overall valuations of all operators while minimizing the congestion at vertiports. Additionally, we improve the computational tractability of designing the reservation mechanism by proposing a mixed binary linear programming approach that leverages the network flow structure.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-Based Distributed Droop-Free Controller and Communication Topology Co-Design for DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18210v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control approach for the voltage regulation problem in DC microgrids (MGs) comprised of an interconnected set of distributed generators (DGs), loads, and power lines. First, we describe the closed-loop DC MG as a networked system where the sets of DGs and lines (i.e., subsystems) are interconnected via a static interconnection matrix. This interconnection matrix demonstrates how the inputs and outputs of DGs and lines are connected with each other. Each DG has a local controller and a distributed global controller. To design the distributed global controllers, we use the dissipativity properties of the subsystems and formulate a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. To support the feasibility of this distributed global controller design, we identify a set of necessary local conditions, which we then enforce in a specifically developed LMI-based local controller design process. In contrast to existing DC MG control solutions that separate distributed controller and communication topology design problems, our approach proposes a unified framework for distributed controller and communication topology co-design. As the co-design process is LMI-based, it can be efficiently implemented and evaluated using existing software tools. The effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of voltage regulation and current sharing is verified by simulating an islanded DC MG in a MATLAB/Simulink environment under different scenarios, such as load changes and topological constraint changes, and comparing its performance with the recent droop control approach.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Free Coordinated Dispatch of Microgrid: A Data-Driven Online Optimization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional prediction-dependent dispatch methods can face challenges when renewables and prices predictions are unreliable in microgrid. Instead, this paper proposes a novel prediction-free two-stage coordinated dispatch approach in microgrid. Empirical learning is conducted during the offline stage, where we calculate the offline optimal state of charge (SOC) sequences for generic energy storage under different historical scenarios. During the online stage, we synthesize a dynamically updated reference for SOC and a dynamic opportunity price (DOP) based on empirical learning and real-time observations. They provide a global vision for online operation and effectively address the myopic tendencies inherent to online decision-making. The real-time control action, generated from online optimization algorithm, aims to minimize the operational costs while tracking the reference and considering DOP. Additionally, we develop an adaptive virtual-queue-based online optimization algorithm based on online convex optimization (OCO) framework. We provide theoretical proof that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing OCO algorithms and achieves sublinear dynamic regret bound and sublinear strict constraint violation bound. Simulation-based studies demonstrate that, compared with model predictive control-based methods, it reduces operational costs and voltage violation rate by 5% and 9%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Market Implications of Alternative Operating Reserve Modeling in Wholesale Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pricing and settlement mechanisms are crucial for efficient re-source allocation, investment incentives, market competition, and regulatory oversight. In the United States, Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs) adopts a uniform pricing scheme that hinges on the marginal costs of supplying additional electricity. This study investigates the pricing and settlement impacts of alternative reserve constraint modeling, highlighting how even slight variations in the modeling of constraints can drastically alter market clearing prices, reserve quantities, and revenue outcomes. Focusing on the diverse market designs and assumptions in ancillary services by U.S. RTOs, particularly in relation to capacity sharing and reserve substitutions, the research examines four distinct models that combine these elements based on a large-scale synthetic power system test data. Our study provides a critical insight into the economic implications and the underlying factors of these alternative reserve constraints through market simulations and data analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Safety of Trajectories using Peak-Minimizing Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work quantifies the safety of trajectories of a dynamical system by the perturbation intensity required to render a system unsafe (crash into the unsafe set). Computation of this measure of safety is posed as a peak-minimizing optimal control problem. Convergent lower bounds on the minimal peak value of controller effort are computed using polynomial optimization and the moment-Sum-of-Squares hierarchy. The crash-safety framework is extended towards data-driven safety analysis by measuring safety as the maximum amount of data corruption required to crash into the unsafe set.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for setpoint tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main objective of tracking control is to steer the tracking error, that is the difference between the reference and the output, to zero while the plant's operation limits are satisfied. This requires that some assumptions on the evolution of the future values of the reference must be taken into account. Typically a simple evolution of the reference is considered, such as step, ramp, or parabolic reference signals. It is important to notice that the tracking problem considers possible variations in the reference to be tracked, such as steps or slope variations of the ramps. Then the tracking control problem is inherently uncertain, since the reference may differ from what is expected. If the value of the reference is changed, then there is no guarantee that the feasibility and stability properties of the resulting control law hold. This report presents the MPC for tracking (MPCT) approach, which ensures recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of the setpoint when the value of the reference is changed.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control on Positive Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An optimal control problem on finite-dimensional positive cones is stated. Under a critical assumption on the cone, the corresponding Bellman equation is satisfied by a linear function, which can be computed by convex optimization. A separate theorem relates the assumption on the cone to the existence of minimal elements in certain subsets of the dual cone. Three special cases are derived as examples. The first one, where the positive cone is the set of positive semi-definite matrices, reduces to standard linear quadratic control. The second one, where the positive cone is a polyhedron, reduces to a recent result on optimal control of positive systems. The third special case corresponds to linear quadratic control with additional structure, such as spatial invariance.</description>

      <title>iWalker: Imperative Visual Planning for Walking Humanoid Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots, with the potential to perform a broad range of tasks in environments designed for humans, have been deemed crucial for the basis of general AI agents. When talking about planning and controlling, although traditional models and task-specific methods have been extensively studied over the past few decades, they are inadequate for achieving the flexibility and versatility needed for general autonomy. Learning approaches, especially reinforcement learning, are powerful and popular nowadays, but they are inherently "blind" during training, relying heavily on trials in simulation without proper guidance from physical principles or underlying dynamics. In response, we propose a novel end-to-end pipeline that seamlessly integrates perception, planning, and model-based control for humanoid robot walking. We refer to our method as iWalker, which is driven by imperative learning (IL), a self-supervising neuro-symbolic learning framework. This enables the robot to learn from arbitrary unlabeled data, significantly improving its adaptability and generalization capabilities. In experiments, iWalker demonstrates effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments, representing a significant advancement toward versatile and autonomous humanoid robots.</description>
