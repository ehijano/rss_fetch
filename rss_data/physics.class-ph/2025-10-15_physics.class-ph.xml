      <title>The Effective Radius of an Electric Point Charge in Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the century-old problem of modeling the electron as a pointlike particle with finite self energy, we develop a new class of nonlinear perturbations of Maxwell's electrodynamics inspired by, but distinct from, the Born--Infeld theory. A hallmark of our construction is that the effective radius of an electric point charge can be reduced arbitrarily by tuning a coupling parameter, thereby achieving scales far below the Born--Infeld bound and consistent with the experimentally undetected size of the electron. The models preserve finite self energy for point charges while energetically excluding monopoles and dyons, a robustness that appears intrinsic to this class of nonlinear theories. Two complementary behaviors are uncovered: In the non-polynomial perturbations, the Maxwell limit is not recovered as the coupling vanishes, whereas in polynomial models the self energy diverges correctly, meaning that the Maxwellian ultraviolet structure is reinstated. A further subtlety emerges in the distinction between the prescribed source charge, imposed through the displacement field, and the measurable free charge arising from the induced electric field. In particular, the free charge and the self energy contained within any ball around the point charge tend to zero in the strong-nonlinearity or zero effective-radius limit, rendering a pointlike structure locally undetectable, both electrically and energetically. These findings highlight how nonlinear field equations reconcile theoretical prescription with experimental measurement and suggest a classical rationale for the effective invisibility of the electron substructure.</description>

      <title>Advanced creep modelling for polymers: A variable-order fractional calculus approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer-based plastics exhibit time-dependent deformation under constant stress, known as creep, which can lead to rupture or static fatigue. A common misconception is that materials under tolerable static loads remain unaffected over time. Accurate long-term deformation predictions require experimental creep data, but conventional models based on simple rheological elements like springs and dampers often fall short, lacking the flexibility to capture the power-law behaviour intrinsic to creep processes. The springpot, a fractional calculus-based element, has been used to provide a power-law relationship; however, its fixed-order nature limits its accuracy, particularly when the deformation rate evolves over time. This article introduces a variable-order (VO) springpot model that dynamically adapts to the evolving viscoelastic properties of polymeric materials during creep, capturing changes between glassy, transition and rubbery phases. Model parameters are calibrated using a robust procedure for model identification based on the cross-entropy (CE) method, resulting in physically consistent and accurate predictions. This advanced modelling framework not only overcomes the limitations of the fixed-order models but also establishes a foundation for applying VO mechanics to other viscoelastic materials, providing a valuable tool for predicting long-term material performance in structural applications.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</description>
