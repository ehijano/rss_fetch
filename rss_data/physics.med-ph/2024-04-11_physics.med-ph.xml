      <title>Spiral Scanning and Self-Supervised Image Reconstruction Enable Ultra-Sparse Sampling Multispectral Photoacoustic Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multispectral photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is an imaging modality that utilizes the photoacoustic effect to achieve non-invasive and high-contrast imaging of internal tissues. However, the hardware cost and computational demand of a multispectral PAT system consisting of up to thousands of detectors are huge. To address this challenge, we propose an ultra-sparse spiral sampling strategy for multispectral PAT, which we named U3S-PAT. Our strategy employs a sparse ring-shaped transducer that, when switching excitation wavelengths, simultaneously rotates and translates. This creates a spiral scanning pattern with multispectral angle-interlaced sampling. To solve the highly ill-conditioned image reconstruction problem, we propose a self-supervised learning method that is able to introduce structural information shared during spiral scanning. We simulate the proposed U3S-PAT method on a commercial PAT system and conduct in vivo animal experiments to verify its performance. The results show that even with a sparse sampling rate as low as 1/30, our U3S-PAT strategy achieves similar reconstruction and spectral unmixing accuracy as non-spiral dense sampling. Given its ability to dramatically reduce the time required for three-dimensional multispectral scanning, our U3S-PAT strategy has the potential to perform volumetric molecular imaging of dynamic biological activities.</description>

      <title>Joint regional uptake quantification of Thorium-227 and Radium-223 using a multiple-energy-window projection-domain quantitative SPECT method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thorium-227-based alpha-particle radiopharmaceutical therapies ({\alpha}-RPTs) are being investigated in several clinical and pre-clinical studies. After administration, Thorium-227 decays to Radium-223, another alpha-particle-emitting isotope, which redistributes within the patient. Reliable dose quantification of both Thorium-227 and Radium-223 is clinically important, and SPECT may perform this quantification as these isotopes also emit X- and gamma-ray photons. However, reliable quantification is challenged by the orders-of-magnitude lower activity compared to conventional SPECT, resulting in a very low number of detected counts, the presence of multiple photopeaks, substantial overlap in the emission spectra of these isotopes, and the image-degrading effects in SPECT. To address these issues, we propose a multiple-energy-window projection-domain quantification (MEW-PDQ) method that jointly estimates the regional activity uptake of both Thorium-227 and Radium-223 directly using the SPECT projection from multiple energy windows. We evaluated the method with realistic simulation studies using anthropomorphic digital phantoms, in the context of imaging patients with bone metastases of prostate cancer and treated with Thorium-227-based {\alpha}-RPTs. The proposed method yielded reliable (accurate and precise) regional uptake estimates of both isotopes and outperformed state-of-the-art methods across different lesion sizes and contrasts, in a virtual imaging trial, as well as with moderate levels of intra-regional heterogeneous uptake and with moderate inaccuracies in the definitions of the support of various regions. Additionally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of using multiple energy windows and the variance of the estimated uptake using the proposed method approached the Cram\'er-Rao-lower-bound-defined theoretical limit.</description>

      <title>Bias-Reduced Neural Networks for Parameter Estimation in Quantitative MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop neural network (NN)-based quantitative MRI parameter estimators with minimal bias and a variance close to the Cram\'er-Rao bound.
  Theory and Methods: We generalize the mean squared error loss to control the bias and variance of the NN's estimates, which involves averaging over multiple noise realizations of the same measurements during training. Bias and variance properties of the resulting NNs are studied for two neuroimaging applications.
  Results: In simulations, the proposed strategy reduces the estimates' bias throughout parameter space and achieves a variance close to the Cram\'er-Rao bound. In vivo, we observe good concordance between parameter maps estimated with the proposed NNs and traditional estimators, such as non-linear least-squares fitting, while state-of-the-art NNs show larger deviations.
  Conclusion: The proposed NNs have greatly reduced bias compared to those trained using the mean squared error and offer significantly improved computational efficiency over traditional estimators with comparable or better accuracy.</description>
