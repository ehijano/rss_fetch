      <title>Self-intersecting curves on a pair of pants and periodic orbits of Hamiltonian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The character variety $\mathscr{X}(S,G)$ associated to an oriented compact surface $S$ with boundary and a real reductive Lie group $G$ admits a Poisson structure and is foliated by symplectic leaves. When $G$ is a matrix group, any closed curve $c\in\pi_1(S)$ induces a trace function $\mathsf{tr}_c\colon[\rho]\mapsto \mathsf{tr}(\rho(c))$ on $\mathscr{X}(S,G)$. In this article, we study the Hamiltonian flows of trace functions associated to self-intersecting curves. We prove that when $G=\mathsf{PSL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ and $S$ is the pair of pants, every orbit of the Hamiltonian flow of the trace of a figure eight curve on $S$ is periodic and has a unique fixed point. The proof uses explicit computations in Fock-Goncharov coordinates. As an application, we prove a similar statement for the trace of the $\Theta$-web. Finally, we focus on the symplectic leaf corresponding to the unipotent locus, and derive similar results for two more self-intersecting curves: the commutator, and a curve going $k$ times around a boundary component.</description>

      <title>Adapted Renormalized Volume for Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds with Compressible Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalized volume is a smooth function associating to every convex co-compact hyperbolic $3$-manifold $M$ a real number. When the boundary of $M$ is incompressible, the renormalized volume is always positive, otherwise there are sequences of convex co-compact structures on $M$ whose renormalized volumes diverge to minus infinity.
  We define here a new version of the renormalized volume which adapts to the compressible boundary case, satisfying properties analogous to those of the classical one in the incompressible setting. In particular, the adapted renormalized volume is bounded from below, its differential has uniformly bounded supremum norm, and its gradient has uniformly bounded Weil-Petersson norm. Moreover, it stays at uniformly bounded distance from the convex core volume function. As a corollary, we obtain a bound on the convex core volume of handlebodies in terms of the Weil-Petersson distance from a subset of the Teichm\"uller space. Furthermore, the adapted renormalized volume extends continuously, as a function on the Teichm\"uller space of $\partial\bar M$, to the strata in the boundary of its Weil-Petersson completion corresponding to compressible multicurves. We provide a geometric interpretation of the limit quantity by defining a renormalized volume, and its adapted version, for convex co-compact hyperbolic $3$-manifolds with a finite set of marked points in the boundary.</description>

      <title>Transverse Spheres in Flag Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For some partial flag manifolds of semisimple real Lie groups, including many full flag manifolds, transverse circles are known to be locally maximally transverse. We complete the classification of all partial flag manifolds of split real Lie groups with this property. As a consequence, $\{7\}$-Anosov subgroups of split $E_7$ are virtually free or surface groups.
  On the other hand, using spinors, we find transverse spheres of arbitrarily large dimension in certain full flag manifolds of Cartan-Killing types $A,B,D$. These transverse spheres are verified to be maximally transverse with tools from topological $K$-theory. The aforementioned classification follows from constructions of transverse $m$-spheres, $m \geq 2$, that complement the previously known restrictions as well as the new $E_7$ restriction. Additionally, when $G$ is split of type $G_2, B_3,$ or $D_4$, the full flag manifold admits a fibration by maximally transverse 3-spheres.</description>

      <title>$L^2$ Fr\"olicher inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Fr\"olicher inequality between $L^2$ Betti and $L^2$ Hodge numbers on normal coverings of compact complex manifolds. This is achieved by building an injection using suitable spectral projectors associated to the self adjoint operators $(D_h)^2:=(\overline\partial+\overline\partial^*+h\partial+h\partial^*)^2$ for $h\in[0,1]$. As a by-product, we find a new proof of the classical Fr\"olicher inequality on compact complex manifolds which does not rely at all on spectral sequences.</description>

      <title>A homotopy invariant of stable maps to oriented surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The singular set of a generic map $f: M\to F$ of a manifold $M$ of dimension $m\ge 2$ to an oriented surface $F$ is a closed smooth curve $\Sigma(f)$. We study the parity of the number of components of $\Sigma(f)$. The image $f(\Sigma)$ of the singular set inherits canonical local orientations via so-called chessboard functions. Such a local orientation gives rise to the cumulative winding number $\omega(f)\in \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$ of $\Sigma(f)$. When the dimension of the manifold $M$ is even we also define an invariant $I(f)$ which is the residue class modulo $4$ of the sum of the number of components of $\Sigma(f)$, the number of cusps, and twice the number of self-intersection points of $f(\Sigma)$. Using the cumulative winding number and the invariant $I(f)$, we show that the parity of the number of connected components of $\Sigma(f)$ does not change under homotopy of $f$ provided that one of the following conditions is satisfied: (i) the dimension of $M$ is even, (ii) the singular set of the homotopy is an orientable manifold, or (iii) the image of the singular set of the homotopy does not have triple self-intersection points.</description>

      <title>The kernel of the Goldberg homomorphism is not finitely generated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let M be a closed surface other than the sphere or projective plane. Goldberg defined a natural homomorphism from the n-stranded pure braid group of M to the n-fold product of the fundamental group of M and showed that the kernel of the homomorphism is finitely normally generated. Here we show that the kernel is not finitely generated. The proof is an elementary application of covering space theory and the geometry of the euclidean or hyperbolic plane.</description>

      <title>A Non-Abelian Generalization of the Alexander Polynomial from Quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.06983v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One construction of the Alexander polynomial is as a quantum invariant associated with representations of restricted quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at a fourth root of unity. We generalize this construction to define a link invariant $\Delta_{\mathfrak{g}}$ for any semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of rank $n$, taking values in $n$-variable Laurent polynomials. Focusing on the case $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_3$, we establish a direct relation between $\Delta_{\mathfrak{sl}_3}$ and the Alexander polynomial. We show that certain parameter evaluations of $\Delta_{\mathfrak{sl}_3}$ recover the Alexander polynomial on knots, despite the $R$-matrix not satisfying the Alexander-Conway skein relation at these points. We tabulate $\Delta_{\mathfrak{sl}_3}$ for all knots up to seven crossings and various other examples, including the Kinoshita-Terasaka knot and Conway knot mutant pair which are distinguished by this invariant.</description>
