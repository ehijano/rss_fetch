      <title>Analysis of Stick-Slip Motion as a Jump Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyse the stick-slip motion of a soft elastomeric block on a smooth, hard surface under the application of shear, which is induced by a puller moving at a steady velocity. The frictional stress is generated by make-break of bonds between the pendent chains of the elastomeric block and bonding sites on the hard surface. Relation between velocity and frictional stress has been estimated using the bond-population balance model. Stick-slip motion occurs when the pulling velocity is lower than a critical value. Unlike, the rate-and-state friction model which views the stick-slip motion as a limit cycle, we show that during the stick phase, the sliding surface actually sticks to the hard surface and remains stationary till the shear exerted by puller causes rupture of all bonds between contacting surfaces. The major fraction of the bonds undergo catastrophic rupture so as to cause the sliding surface to slip and attain a significantly higher velocity than the pulling velocity. During the slip phase, the sliding friction is balanced by rapid make-break of weak bonds. As the sliding velocity decreases, the bonds undergo aging and the adhesion stress increases. When the bond adhesion stress exceeds the pulling stress, the contacting surfaces stick together. We have mathematically modeled both the stick and the slip regimes using the bond-population balance model. We have validated the model using the experimental data from the work of Baumberger et al (2002) on sliding of an elastomeric gelatine-gel block on a glass surface.</description>

      <title>Granular temperature controls local rheology of vibrated granular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use numerical simulations to demonstrate a local rheology for sheared, vibrated granular flows. We consider a granular assembly that is subjected to simple shear and harmonic vibration at the boundary. This configuration allows us to isolate the effects of vibration, as parameterized by granular temperature. We find that friction is reduced due to local velocity fluctuations of grains. All data obey a local rheology that relates the material friction coefficient, the granular temperature, and the dimensionless shear rate. We also observe that reduction in material friction due to granular temperature is associated with reduction in fabric anisotropy. We demonstrate that the temperature can be modeled by a heat equation with dissipation with appropriate boundary conditions, which provides complete closure of the system and allows a fully local continuum description of sheared, vibrated granular flows. This success suggests local rheology based on temperature, as suggested previously, combined with the new, empirical heat diffusion equation may provide a general strategy for dense granular flows.</description>

      <title>Image charge effects under metal and dieletric boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image charge effect is a fundamental problem in electrostatics. However, a proper treatment at the continuum level for many-ion systems, such as electrolyte solutions or ionic liquids, remains an open theoretical question. Here, we demonstrate and systematically compare the image charge effects under metal and dielectric boundary conditions (BCs), based on a renormalized Gaussian-fluctuation theory. Our calculations for a simple 1:1 symmetric electrolyte in the point-charge approximation show that the double-layer structure, capacitance, and interaction forces between like-charged plates depend strongly on the types of boundaries, even in the weak-coupling regime. Like-charge attraction is predicted for both metal and dielectric BCs. Finally, we comment on the effects of a dielectrically-saturated solvent layer on the metal surface. We provide these results to serve as a baseline for comparison with more realistic molecular dynamics simulations and experiments.</description>

      <title>Generating forces in confinement via polymerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth and reconfiguration of polymer networks such as the cytoskeleton can generate forces that move objects and deform materials and membranes, even in the absence of molecular motors. Taking inspiration from this, we ask whether a dynamic polymer system can generate deformation forces by merely controlling the monomer structure and interactions, and the temporal schedule of monomer release, which can be considered a "molecular program" directing polymer assembly. Using simulations of patchy particles that are released into the interior of a vesicle at a given rate, we ask which molecular programs are most proficient at generating forces. We show that stiff polymers induce deformation by spontaneously bundling, and deforming the vesicle axially. The rate at which monomers are released controls whether the polymers can generate forces quickly, or deform the vesicle more slowly but with a larger maximal force. For softer polymers, which cannot ordinarily deform the vesicle, we demonstrate that introducing crosslinkers can be enough to promote the bundling of polymers required to deform vesicles, but that the details of how this crosslinking is implemented can significantly affect the outcome. Finally, we show that dynamic release of monomers and crosslinkers can increase the variance of this process, and that by making the polymers polar filaments one can obtain better force generation by suppressing nucleation. Our results provide a blueprint for the experimental realization of molecular programs that could produce nanoscale forces using synthetic biopolymers.</description>

      <title>Observation of Brownian elastohydrodynamic forces acting on confined soft colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confined motions in complex environments are ubiquitous in microbiology. These situations invariably involve the intricate coupling between fluid flow, soft boundaries, surface forces and fluctuations. In the present study, such a coupling is investigated using a novel method combining holographic microscopy and advanced statistical inference. Specifically, the Brownian motion of softmicrometric oil droplets near rigid walls is quantitatively analyzed. All the key statistical observables are reconstructed with high precision, allowing for nanoscale resolution of local mobilities and femtonewton inference of conservative or non-conservative forces. Strikingly, the analysis reveals the existence of a novel, transient, but large, soft Brownian force. The latter might be of crucial importance for microbiological and nanophysical transport, target finding or chemical reactions in crowded environments, and hence the whole life machinery.</description>

      <title>Adsorption of polyelectrolytes in the presence of varying dielectric discontinuity between solution and substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the interactions between polyelectrolytes (PEs) and uncharged substrates at conditions corresponding to a dielectric discontinuity between the aqueous solution and the substrate. To this end, we vary the substrate dielectric constant $\varepsilon_{\rm s}$ under different salt conditions. We employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with rodlike PEs in salt solutions with explicit ions and implicit water solvent with dielectric constant $\varepsilon_{\rm w} = 80$. As expected, at low salt concentrations, PEs are repelled from the substrates with $\varepsilon_{\rm s} &lt; \varepsilon_{\rm w}$ but are attracted to substrates with a high dielectric constant due to image charges. This attraction considerably weakens for high salt and multivalent counterions due to enhanced screening. Further, for monovalent salt, screening enhances adsorption for weakly charged PEs, but weakens it for strongly charged ones. Multivalent counterions, on the other hand, have little effect on weakly charged PEs, but prevent adsorption of highly charged PEs, even at low salt concentrations. We also find that correlation-induced charge inversion of a PE is enhanced close to the low dielectric constant substrates, but suppressed when the dielectric constant is high. To explore the possibility of a PE monolayer formation, we examine the interaction of a pair of like-charged PEs aligned parallel to a high dielectric constant substrate with $\varepsilon_{\rm s} = 8000$. Our main conclusion is that monolayer formation is possible only for weakly charged PEs at high salt concentrations of both monovalent and multivalent counterions. Finally, we also consider the energetics of a PE approaching the substrate perpendicular to it, in analogy to polymer translocation.</description>

      <title>Accessing Semi-Addressable Self Assembly with Efficient Structure Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern experimental methods enable the creation of self-assembly building blocks with tunable interactions, but optimally exploiting this tunability for the self-assembly of desired structures remains an important challenge. Many studies of this inverse problem start with the so-called fully-addressable limit, where every particle in a target structure is different. This leads to clear design principles that often result in high assembly yield, but it is not a scaleable approach -- at some point, one must grapple with ``reusing'' building blocks, which lowers the degree of addressability and may cause a multitude of off-target structures to form. While the existence of off-target structures does not necessarily preclude high yield assembly of the target structure(s), it massively complicates the design process because it is often unclear if or how these off-target structures can be controlled. Here, we solve a key obstacle preventing robust inverse design in the ``semi-addressable regime'' by developing a highly efficient algorithm that enumerates all structures that can be formed from a given set of building blocks. By combining this with established partition-function-based yield calculations, we successfully inverse design for target structures while minimizing the required number of distinct building block species. Furthermore, we show that it is almost always possible to find semi-addressable designs where the entropic gain from reusing building blocks outweighs the presence of off-target structures and even increases the yield of the target. Thus, not only does our enumeration algorithm enable robust and scalable inverse design in the semi-addressable regime, our results demonstrate that it is possible to operate in this regime while maintaining the level of control often associated with full addressability.</description>

      <title>Active nematodynamics on deformable surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider active nematodynamics on deformable surfaces. Based on a thermodynamically consistent surface Beris-Edwards model we add nematic activity and focus on the emerging additional coupling mechanism between the nematic field, the flow field and the curved surface. We analyse the impact of the active nematic force at topological defects. Under the presence of curvature all defects become active and contribute not only tangential forces but also normal forces. This confirms the proposed role of topological defects in surface evolution and provides the basis for a dynamic description of morphogenetic processes.</description>

      <title>Active dynamics of charged macromolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the role of active coupling on the transport properties of homogeneously charged macromolecules in an infinitely dilute solution. An enzyme becomes actively bound to a segment of the macromolecule, exerting an electrostatic force on it. Eventually, thermal fluctuations cause it to become unbound, introducing active coupling into the system. We study the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and find a new scaling regime compared to the thermal counterpart in the presence of hydrodynamic and segment-segment electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the study of segment-segment equal-time correlation reveals the swelling of the macromolecule. Further, we derive the concentration equation of the macromolecule with active binding and study how the cooperative diffusivity of the macromolecules get modified by its environment, including the macromolecules itself. It turns out that these active fluctuations enhance the effective diffusivity of the macromolecules. The derived closed-form expression for diffusion constant is pertinent to the accurate interpretation of light scattering data in multi-component systems with binding-unbinding equilibria.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Response Theory of Molecular Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical affinities are responsible for driving active matter systems out of equilibrium. At the nano-scale, molecular machines interact with the surrounding environment and are subjected to external forces. The mechano-chemical coupling which arises naturally in these systems reveals a complex interplay between chemical and mechanical degrees of freedom with strong impact on their active mechanism. By considering various models far from equilibrium, we show that the tuning of applied forces give rise to a nonlinear response that causes a non-monotonic behaviour in the machines' activity. Our findings have implications in understanding, designing, and triggering such processes by controlled application of external fields, including the collective dynamics of larger non-equilibrium systems where the total dissipation and performance might be affected by internal and inter-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>The interplay between liquid-liquid and ferroelectric phase transitions in supercooled water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distinctive characteristics of water, evident in its thermodynamic anomalies, have implications across disciplines from biology to geophysics. Considered a valid hypothesis to rationalize its unique properties, a liquid-liquid phase transition in water's supercooled regime has nowadays been observed in several molecular dynamics simulations and is being actively researched experimentally. Here, we highlight novel and far-reaching implications of water: the interplay between the liquid-liquid and a ferroelectric phase transition. Our results are based on the analysis of extensive molecular dynamics simulations and are explained in the context of a classical density functional theory in mean-field approximation valid for a polar liquid. The theory underpins the potential role of ferroelectricity in promoting the liquid-liquid phase transition. The existence of ferroelectric order in supercooled low-density liquid water is confirmed by the observation in molecular dynamics simulations of collective modes in polarization fluctuations dynamics, traceable to spontaneous breaking of continuous rotational symmetry. Our work opens the door to new experimental investigations of the static and dynamic behavior of water polarization.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann methods for soft flowing matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the Lattice Boltzmann method has found major scope for the simulation of a large spectrum of problems in soft matter, from multiphase and multi-component microfluidic flows, to foams, emulsions, colloidal flows, to name but a few. Crucial to many such applications is the role of supramolecular interactions which occur whenever mesoscale structures, such as bubbles or droplets, come in close contact, say of the order of tens of nanometers. Regardless of their specific physico-chemical origin, such near-contact interactions are vital to preserve the coherence of the mesoscale structures against coalescence phenomena promoted by capillarity and surface tension, hence the need of including them in Lattice Boltzmann schemes. Strictly speaking, this entails a complex multiscale problem, covering about six spatial decades, from centimeters down to tens of nanometers, and almost twice as many in time. Such a multiscale problem can hardly be taken by a single computational method, hence the need for coarse-grained models for the near-contact interactions. In this review, we shall discuss such coarse-grained models and illustrate their application to a variety of soft flowing matter problems, such as soft flowing crystals, strongly confined dense emulsions, flowing hierarchical emulsions, soft granular flows, as well as the transmigration of active droplets across constrictions. Finally, we conclude with a few considerations on future developments in the direction of quantum-nanofluidics, machine learning, and quantum computing for soft flows applications.</description>

      <title>Giant splitting of the hydrogen rotational eigenenergies in the C$_2$ filled ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen hydrates present a rich phase diagram influenced by both pressure and temperature, with the so-called C$_2$ phase emerging prominently above 2.5 GPa. In this phase, hydrogen molecules are densely packed within a cubic ice-like lattice and the interaction with the surrounding water molecules profoundly affects their quantum rotational dynamics. Herein, we delve into this intricate interplay by directly solving the Schr\"{o}dinger's equation for a quantum H$_2$ rotor in the C$_2$ crystal field at finite temperature, generated through Density Functional Theory. Our calculations reveal a giant energy splitting relative to the magnetic quantum number of $\pm$3.2 meV for $l=1$. Employing inelastic neutron scattering, we experimentally measure the energy levels of H$_2$ within the C$_2$ phase at 6.0 and 3.4 GPa and low temperatures, finding remarkable agreement with our theoretical predictions. These findings underscore the pivotal role of hydrogen--water interactions in dictating the rotational behavior of the hydrogen molecules within the C$_2$ phase and indicate heightened induced-dipole interactions compared to other hydrogen hydrates.</description>

      <title>Consistent expansion of the Langevin propagator with application to entropy production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic thermodynamics is a developing theory for systems out of thermal equilibrium. It allows to formulate a wealth of nontrivial relations among thermodynamic quantities such as heat dissipation, excess work, and entropy production in generic nonequilibrium stochastic processes. A key quantity for the derivation of these relations is the propagator - the probability to observe a transition from one point in phase space to another after a given time. Here, applying stochastic Taylor expansions, we devise a formal expansion procedure for the propagator of overdamped Langevin dynamics. The three leading orders are obtained explicitly. The technique resolves the shortcomings of the current mathematical machinery for the calculation of the propagator. For the evaluation of the first two displacement cumulants, the leading order Gaussian propagator is sufficient. However, some functionals of the propagator - such as the entropy production - which we refer to as "first derivatives of the trajectory", need to be evaluated to a previously-unrecognized higher order. The method presented here can be extended to arbitrarily higher orders in order to accurately compute any other functional of the propagator.</description>

      <title>Active Magnetic Matter: Propelling Ferrimagnetic Domain Walls by Dynamical Frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter encompasses many-particle systems with self-propelling units, such as flocks of birds or schools of fish. Here, we show how self-propelling domain walls can be realised in a solid-state system when a ferrimagnet is weakly driven out of thermal equilibrium by an oscillating field. This activates the Goldstone mode, inducing a rotation of the antiferromagnetic xy-order in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, determined by the sign of the ferromagnetic component. Two opposite directions of rotation meet at a ferromagnetic domain wall, resulting in 'dynamical frustration', with three main consequences. (i) Domain walls move actively in a direction chosen by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Their speed is proportional to the square root of the driving power across large parameter regimes. (ii) In one dimension (1D), after a quench into the ferrimagnetic phase, this motion and strong hydrodynamic interactions lead to a linear growth of the magnetic correlation length over time, much faster than in equilibrium. (iii) The dynamical frustration makes the system highly resilient to noise. The correlation length of the weakly driven 1D system can be orders of magnitude larger than in the corresponding equilibrium system with the same noise level.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the competing effects of simultaneous presence of chirality and generalised tumbles in the dynamics of an active Brownian particle. Chiral active particles perform circular motions that give rise to slow transport at late times. By interrupting these circular trajectories at the right time or by performing a tumble at the correct angle, we show that particles can enhance their diffusion. After deriving exact expressions for the orientational propagator and correlations, we use this to calculate the first two moments of displacement. For the effective diffusion coefficient, we study various optimal tumbling strategies. We show that under optimisation of the tumbling rate, the case of symmetrically distributed tumbles always give rise to enhanced diffusion, with an effective diffusion coefficient taking a universal value. Next, two cases are considered in detail, namely directional reversal and tumbles at an arbitrary but fixed angle. We discuss how asymmetric tumbles can enhance diffusion beyond that of symmetric tumbles.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model of fluid front dynamics driven by porous media pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air-permeable porous media hosts air within their pores. Upon removal from the material's interior, these porous media have the tendency to replenish the air, effectively acting as a suction pump. Therefore, the technique used to convert a porous media into a pump, consists of degassing the material to remove their air inside. The suction property when recovering the air, can be used to move a liquid through a microfluidic channel, studying the dynamics of the liquid-air front. In this article, we have developed a theoretical mathematical model that precisely characterize the behavior of this kind of pumps and the dynamics of the liquid-air front. This model allows us to use porous media pumps as very accurate devices to move liquids in a completely controlled way, being able to obtain characteristic properties of fluids such as viscosity or the pressure applied to them. We have tested it using experimental data from the literature, and we have been able to observe that the theory fits satisfactorily with the experiments, being able to affirm that the model is correctly satisfied. This type of pump is of great interest to the scientific community because of its small size and the fact that it operates without any external power source.</description>

      <title>Simulating dynamics of ellipsoidal particles using lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic particles are often encountered in different fields of soft matter and complex fluids. In this work, we present an implementation of the coupled hydrodynamics of solid ellipsoidal particles and the surrounding fluid using the lattice Boltzmann method. A standard link-based mechanism is used to implement the solid-fluid boundary conditions. We develop an implicit method to update the position and orientation of the ellipsoid. This exploits the relations between the quaternion which describes the ellipsoid's orientation and the ellipsoid's angular velocity to obtain a stable and robust dynamic update. The proposed algorithm is validated by looking at four scenarios: (i) the steady translational velocity of a spheroid subject to an external force in different orientations, (ii) the drift of an inclined spheroid subject to an imposed force, (iii) three-dimensional rotational motions in a simple shear flow (Jeffrey's orbits), and (iv) developed fluid flows and self-propulsion exhibited by a spheroidal microswimmer. In all cases the comparison of numerical results showed good agreement with known analytical solutions, irrespective of the choice of the fluid properties, geometrical parameters, and lattice Boltzmann model, thus demonstrating the robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Solvent Selectivity controls Micro- versus Macro-phase Separation in Multiblock Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble were used to obtain critical parameters and conditions leading to microphase separation for block copolymers with solvophilic and solvophobic segments. Solvent selectivity was systematically varied to distinguish between systems that undergo macrophase separation to ones that microphase separate in the dilute phase, prior to macrophase separating. Finite-size scaling was used to obtain the critical parameters. Interestingly, corrections to scaling increase significantly for systems that form finite aggregates. The threshold value of solvent selectivity for aggregation was determined for symmetric diblock chains of varying length. The results indicate that long diblock copolymers form micelles in the dilute phase prior to macrophase separation, even in marginally selective solvents. The dependence of critical temperature on solvent selectivity was obtained for triblock, multiblock, and alternating chains. For highly selective solvents, strong structuring of both dilute and dense phases makes it harder to reach equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamic hyperuniform states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform structures are an exotic state of matter having suppressed density fluctuations at large length-scale similar to perfect crystals and quasicrystals but without any long range orientational order. In the past decade, an increasing number of non-equilibrium systems were found to have dynamic hyperuniform states, which have emerged as a new research direction coupling both non-equilibrium physics and hyperuniformity. Here we review the recent progress in understanding dynamic hyperuniform states found in various non-equilibrium systems, including the critical hyperuniformity in absorbing phase transitions, non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluids and the hyperuniform structures in phase separating systems via spinodal decomposition.</description>

      <title>Programmable XY-type couplings through parallel spin-dependent forces on the same trapped ion motional modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an analog scheme for generating XY-type ($J_{ij}^x \sigma_x^i \sigma_x^j \;$ + $J_{ij}^y \sigma_y^i \sigma_y^j \;$) Hamiltonians on trapped ion spins with independent control over the $J_{ij}^x$ and $J_{ij}^y$ terms. The Ising-type interactions $\sigma_x^i \sigma_x^j \;$ and $\sigma_y^i \sigma_y^j \;$ are simultaneously generated by employing two spin-dependent forces operating in parallel on the same set of normal modes. We analytically calculate the region of validity of this scheme, and provide numerical and experimental validation with $^{171}\rm{Yb}^+\;$ ions. This scheme inherits the programmability and scalability of the Ising-type interactions with trapped ions that have been explored in numerous quantum simulation experiments. Our approach extends the capabilities of existing trapped ion quantum simulators to access a large class of spin Hamiltonians relevant for exploring exotic quantum phases such as superfluidity and spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulations of the Blinking-Checkers Model for Polyamorphic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The blinking-checkers model [F. Caupin and M. A. Anisimov, Phys. Rev. Lett, 127,185701 (2021)] is a minimal lattice model which has demonstrated that, in the meanfield approximation, it can reproduce the phenomenon of fluid polyamorphism. This model is a binary lattice-gas, in which each site has three possible states: empty, occupied with particles of type 1, and occupied with particles of type 2. Additionally, the two types of particles may interconvert from one to another. Equilibrium interconversion imposes a constraint that makes this model thermodynamically equivalent to a single-component system. In this work, Monte-Carlo simulations of the blinking-checkers model are performed, demonstrating polyamorphic phase behavior. The locations of the liquid-liquid and liquid-gas critical points are found to be different from the meanfield predictions for this model with the same interaction parameters, as the phase behavior is significantly affected by critical fluctuations. Based on the computed values of the critical exponents of the order parameter, susceptibility, correlation length, and surface tension, we confirm that the blinking-checkers model, for both liquid-gas and liquid-liquid equilibria, belongs to the three-dimensional Ising class of critical-point universality.</description>
