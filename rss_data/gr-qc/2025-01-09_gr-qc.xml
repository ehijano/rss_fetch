      <title>The effective phase space and $e$-folding of the Starobinsky and extended Starobinsky model of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For zero spatial curvature, cosmological phase space of Starobinsky and extended Starobinsky inflationary model show three apparent attractors; the fixed angle attractor in the large field limit, the final attractor representing reheating phase in the small field region, and the apparent attractor corresponding to the slow-roll condition connecting between the large-field and small-field region. To consider the total $e$-folding likelihood of the model, Remmen-Carroll conserved measure is constructed and normalized. Using the measure, the total e-folding number $N$ and its expectation value $\left\langle N \right\rangle$ are calculated. We found that $\left\langle N \right\rangle = 62.37$ for ultraviolet cutoff $\phi_{\rm UV}=50 M^{*}_{\rm Pl}$ in the Starobinsky model. For extended Starobinsky model with additional $R^3$ term parametrized by a coupling $\alpha$, the expectation value shifted to lower values $\left\langle N \right\rangle = 4.03, 61.4$ for $\alpha = 10^{-4},10^{-35}$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiations around the Schwarzschild-MOG black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04367v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the motion of massive particles in the gravitational field of a modified gravity (MOG) black hole (BH), characterized by the parameter $\alpha$. Using the Hamiltonian formalism, the geodesic equations and the effective potential governing particle trajectories are derived. Key features, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the innermost bound circular orbit (IBCO), are analyzed, revealing their dependence on the particle's energy, angular momentum, and the MOG parameter. In the extremal case, where $\alpha=-1$, the event horizon merges with the Cauchy horizon, forming a distinctive BH configuration. Numerical methods are employed to compute periodic orbits in this spacetime, with a comparison drawn to the Schwarzschild BH. The findings indicate that for $\alpha&gt;0$, periodic orbits around Schwarzschild-MOG BH exhibit lower energy requirements than those in Schwarzschild spacetime, whereas for $-1&lt;\alpha&lt;0$, the energy requirements are higher. Precessing orbits near periodic trajectories are also examined, offering insights into their complex dynamical behavior. Finally, the gravitational wave (GW) radiation from the periodic orbits of a test particle around the Schwarzschild-MOG BH is examined, generating intricate waveforms that provide insights into the gravitational structure of the system.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Stability of Schwarzschild-de Sitter Black holes with R\'enyi entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though, classically, a black holes is gravitational object, it can be treated as a thermodynamic object when quantum effect is taken into account. It is found that by using Gibbs-Boltzmann entropy, thermodynamic system associated Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole is unstable while it is stable under description of R\'enyi entropy. According to R\'enyi entropy, the thermodynamic phase space needed to be extended. Specifically, the non-extensive parameter must be treated as a thermodynamic variable. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic stability of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole with R\'enyi entropy by treating non-extensive parameter as chemical potential. We found that it is possible to obtain the stability of the black hole under the process with fixing pressure, temperature and number of particles. We also found that there exist the phase transitions from the hot gas to the stable black hole in such the process. Therefore, if such a black hole is possibly observed, the non-extensive effect of R\'enyi statistics may provide a physical insight beyond the standard approach to black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity Effects on Modeling Dynamic Quantities and Their Correlations in Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we begin by revisiting the oscillatory behavior of radiative quantities-energy, angular momentum, and linear momentum-linked with initial eccentricities in binary black hole (BBH) mergers. By varying the mean anomaly $l_0$ across the parameter range $[0,2\pi]$ from a post-Newtonian perspective, we establish an envelope that encapsulates the oscillations of these radiative quantities. Our analysis reveals that while the oscillations are influenced by the specific initial condition $l_0$, the effect of eccentricity contributes to the formation of this envelope. Subsequently, we model dynamical quantities such as peak luminosity $L_{\text{peak}}$, remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$, spin $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$, and recoil velocity $V_{\text{rem}}$ in circular orbits. Through polynomial modeling, we explore their relationships with mass ratios and correlations. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these polynomials in capturing the intricate relationships and correlations among these quantities in circular orbits. Furthermore, we synthesize and analyze dynamical quantities for both circular and eccentric orbits, revealing continuous variations within specific ranges corresponding to distinct mass ratios. These variations are influenced by continuous changes in initial eccentricity and the associated envelope, which can be extrapolated to encompass other mass ratios. By interpolating the maximum and minimum values of these dynamical quantities, we unveil considerably broad domains relative to circular orbits in both orbital and non-orbital BBH mergers. These domains provide robust constraints on the relationships between dynamical quantities, mass ratios, and their correlations. Finally, we discuss the extension of this eccentricity effect to spin alignment and spin precession configurations of BBHs.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing and shadows in the toron solution of Einstein's equations using ray tracing methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical and analytical study of the so-called `toron' solution of the stationary axisymmetric Einstein equations in vacuum expressed in terms of elliptic functions. The asymptotic behavior of this solution coincides with the one of the NUT solution, i.e., it has a `gravimagnetic' mass known as the NUT parameter while the ordinary mass vanishes. The physical properties of this spacetime are studied via ray tracing. The results are compared to known geodesic flows in Schwarzschild, Kerr and NUT spacetimes to discuss similarities and differences, with a particular emphasis on the comparison of NUT and toron spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scalar perturbations in Horndeski-like gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories are promising dark energy models. A promising scalar-tensor theory, called Horndeski-like gravity, is coming from the application of the Horndeski gravity in string theory and cosmology that takes into account two dilaton fields. In this work we study the stability of the scalar sector of this theory and compare it with that coming from the previously studied tensor sector. Furthermore, the entropy coming from particle production $S_{in}$ and that of the apparent horizon $S$ will be studied, which translates into entropy bounds. The gravitational slip (minus one) to entropy ratio is also considered as a possible replacement for the usual shear viscosity to entropy ratio for black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the Multi-Band Template Analysis (MBTA) search pipeline dedicated to the detection of compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational wave signals from the data obtained by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration (LVK) during the fourth observing run (O4), which started in May 2023. We give details on the configuration of the pipeline and its evolution compared to the third observing run (O3). We focus here on the configuration used for the offline results of the first part of the run (O4a), which are part of the GWTC-4 catalog (in preparation). We also give a brief summary of the online configuration and highlight some of the changes implemented or considered for the second part of O4 (O4b).</description>

      <title>Star equilibrium: from BNG to TOV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the role of the equilibrium equation in bootstrapped Newtonian gravity (BNG) by including terms inspired by the post-Newtonian expansion of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equation. We then compare (approximate) BNG solutions for homogenous stars with their Newtonian and General Relativistic exact solutions. Regardless of the additional terms from the conservation equation, BNG stars do not exhibit a Buchdahl limit. However, specific extra terms added to this equation can cause the pressure to become negative inside stars with compactness smaller than the critical values for BNG black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Kerr black hole parameters and its distance from the Earth in terms of directly measurable quantities of accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extract elegant and concise analytic formulae for the mass and rotation parameters of the Kerr black hole as well as its distance from the Earth only in terms of directly measurable quantities of the accretion disk revolving in the black hole spacetime background. To this end, we consider massive geodesic particles circularly orbiting the Kerr black hole in the equatorial plane and emitting frequency-shifted photons toward a distant observer. We calculate the frequency shift and redshift rapidity at the detector location, and by solving an inverse problem, we express the Kerr black hole parameters and its distance from a distant observer in terms of a handful of observable elements, such as frequency shift, aperture angle of the telescope, and redshift rapidity, a newly introduced concept in [1]. The aperture angle of the telescope (angular distance) characterizes the emitter position on the sky, and the redshift rapidity is an observable relativistic invariant representing the proper time evolution of the frequency shift. The relations presented in this article allow us to disentangle mass, spin, and distance to the black holes in the Kerr spacetime background and obtain these parameters separately. Our analytic formulae are valid on the midline and close to the line of sight, and they can be directly applied to supermassive black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei orbited by water vapor clouds within their accretion disks. The generic exact relations are valid for an arbitrary point of the emitter's orbit, and they can be employed in black hole parameter estimation studies.</description>

      <title>Cosmic deceptions due to peculiar motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative motions have long been known to mislead the unsuspecting observers to false interpretations of reality. The deceptions are usually brief and unimportant, though relative motions have also led to illusions that were both long-lasting and important. Indeed, in the history of astronomy there are several examples where relative-motion effects have misled us to gross misinterpretations. Here, we consider the possibility that our peculiar motion relative to the cosmic rest-frame can trigger deceptions on cosmological scales. In so doing, we will demonstrate that unsuspecting observers inside bulk peculiar flows may come to the false conclusion of recent accelerated expansion, when their host universe is actually decelerating. The same observers may then erroneously attribute their apparent acceleration to an also recent dramatic change in the nature of the cosmic medium. In reality, however, nothing has really happened. Despite the appearances, the host universe keeps decelerating and its material content retains its conventional form. Nevertheless, there are ways out of these illusions. Our observers can find out that they have been deceived by their own peculiar flow, by looking for the trademark signature of relative motion in their data. This signature is nothing else but a Doppler-like anisotropy in the sky distribution of the measured deceleration parameter. To the bulk-flow observers, the universe should appear to accelerate faster along a certain point on the celestial sphere and equally slower along the antipodal. Moreover, the magnitude of the apparent dipole should decrease with increasing redshift.</description>

      <title>Generally relativistic description of fast magnetic reconnection induced by thermal electromotive force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many theoretical models were come up with to figure out the properties of magnetic reconnection process, among which the Sweet-Parker model is the most famous since it describes the magnetic reconnection in a concise way. However, the low reconnection rate expected by this model is generally not available in most astrophysical systems, which motivates people to seek fast reconnection models. Under the scheme of generalized magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for pair plasma, a fast magnetic reconnection model was established, in which the thermal electromotive force plays a key role to remarkably increase the reconnection rate. In this work, I would like to extend the discussions in my previous work, about the generally relativistic description of Sweet-Parker model, to the description of fast magnetic reconnection induced by thermal electromotive force. I will revisit the fast reconnection model briefly to initialize my discussions and show how the thermal electromotive force impacts the reconnection rate. Next, some basic setups will be exhibited before discussing specific examples about how the properties of fast magnetic reconnection are modified by gravitational effect or in observations. Results in this work consolidate my opinion reiterated in my previous work that properties of magnetic reconnection would never be modified by gravitational effect significantly if the magnetic reconnection process occurs in a local scale while the modifications of properties could not be neglected when the process is detected by an observer who is moving with respect to the laboratory, in the rest frame of which the magnetic reconnection occurs.</description>

      <title>Remarks on ghost resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study various aspects of ghost resonances: the resummation that leads to the dressed propagator, the poles locations, the analytic continuation into the second Riemann sheet and the spectral representations in both first and second sheets. In particular, we show that for real masses above the multiparticle threshold the ghost propagator has a pair of complex conjugate poles in the first sheet, unlike the case of an ordinary unstable resonance which has no pole in the first sheet but a complex conjugate pair in the second sheet. Mathematical and physical implications of this feature are discussed. We also clarify an important point regarding the two absorptive contributions of a ghost propagator in the narrow-width approximation. Furthermore, we argue that finite-time quantum field theories are needed to consistently derive the dressed ghost propagator and capture the true physical properties of ghost resonances. Throughout the work, different prescriptions to define the ghost propagator on the real axis are considered: Feynman, anti-Feynman and fakeon prescriptions.</description>

      <title>Corrections to the Black hole entropy from a Bose Einstein condensate: a semi-classical phenomenological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain logarithmic corrections to the black hole entropy. Motivated by our recent proposal concerning the nature of the degrees of freedom leading to the black hole entropy in terms of a Bose Einstein (BEC) condensate of gravitons, we study how to introduce logarithmic corrections. In fact we show that, after modifying the internal energy by means of simple by physically sound arguments dictated by ordinary quantum mechanics and possible non-commutative effects at Planckian scales, a logarithmic term does appear in the Bekenstein Hawking entropy law. We also obtain that the entropy $S_{BH}$ of a ball of Planckian areal radius is $2\pi K_B$, i.e. $S_{BH}(R=L_P)=2\pi K_B$. Our approach show that the possibility that the interior of a black hole is composed with a BEC of gravitons is a viable physically motivated possibility.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear coupling between magnetar QPOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the tails of magnetar giant $\gamma$-ray flares have long been interpreted as normal oscillation modes of these stars. However, most studies modelling QPOs have neglected some key features in the analyses of the signals, namely that QPOs appear to be detectable only intermittently and exhibit drifts in their frequencies. These are typical characteristics of nonlinear mode coupling, where, at leading order, the modes couple and evolve collectively as triplets. Using a representative triplet of modes we solve the system's nonlinear equations of motion analytically and argue that the coupling is likely axial-axial-polar in nature, with the observed intermittence and frequency drifts providing a way to infer details of the magnetar's internal magnetic-field geometry.</description>

      <title>Hot wormholes and chaos dynamics in a two-coupled SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological indices of general relativity and Yang-Mills theory in four-dimensional space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06953v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report investigates general relativity and the Yang-Mills theory in four-dimensional space-time using a common mathematical framework, the Chern-Weil theory for principal bundles. The whole theory is described owing to the fibre bundle with the GL(4) symmetry by twisting several principal bundles with the gauge symmetry.
  In addition to the principal connection, we introduce the Hodge-dual connection into the Lagrangian to make gauge fields have dynamics independent from the Bianchi identity. We show that the duplex superstructure appears in the bundle when a Z2-grading operator exists in the total space of the bundle in general. The Dirac operator appears in the secondary superspace using the one-dimensional Clifford algebra, and it provides topological indices from the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.
  Though the topological index is usually discussed in the elliptic-type manifold, this report treats it in the hyperbolic-type space-time manifold using a novel method, the theta-metric space. The theta-metric treats the Euclidean and Minkowski spaces simultaneously and defines the topological index in the Minkowski space-time.</description>

      <title>Vaidya-like exterior solution and formation of singularity in $f(R, T)$ theory of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08753v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the gravitational collapse of a fluid ball undergoing dissipation in the form of heat flux, in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. To apply the junction conditions in order to match the interior and the exterior spacetimes and analyze the dynamics of collapse, it is necessary to know the exterior metric for the radiating fireball, which is not yet available in the context of $f(R,T)$ gravity. Therefore, at the outset, we have determined the exterior Vaidya-like radiating metric in $f(R,T)$ gravity. Subsequently, we solved the $f(R,T)$ field equations and used the $f(R,T)$ junction conditions to match the exterior with the interior spacetime. The time of formation of the singularity and the time of formation of the apparent horizon have been determined. It is concluded that the final singularity is hidden behind the horizon.</description>

      <title>Kasner bounces and fluctuating collapse inside hairy black holes with charged matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interior of black holes in the presence of charged scalar hair of small amplitude $\epsilon$ on the event horizon and show their terminal boundary is a crushing Kasner-like singularity. These spacetimes are spatially homogeneous and they differ significantly from the hairy black holes with uncharged matter previously studied in [M. Van de Moortel, Violent nonlinear collapse inside charged hairy black holes, Arch. Rational. Mech. Anal., 248, 89, 2024] in that the electric field is dynamical and subject to the backreaction of charged matter. This charged backreaction causes drastically different dynamics compared to the uncharged case that impact the formation of the spacelike singularity, exhibiting novel phenomena such as
  - Collapsed oscillations: oscillatory growth of the scalar hair, nonlinearly induced by the collapse.
  - A fluctuating collapse: The final Kasner exponents' dependency in $\epsilon$ is via an expression of the form $|\sin\left(\omega_0 \cdot \epsilon^{-2}+ O(\log (\epsilon^{-1}))\right)|$.
  - A Kasner bounce: a transition from an unstable Kasner metric to a different stable Kasner metric.
  The Kasner bounce occurring in our spacetime is reminiscent of the celebrated BKL scenario in cosmology. We additionally propose a construction indicating the relevance of the above phenomena -- including Kasner bounces -- to spacelike singularities inside more general (asymptotically flat) black holes, beyond the hairy case. While our result applies to all values of $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, in the $\Lambda&lt;0$ case, our spacetime corresponds to the interior region of a charged asymptotically Anti-de-Sitter stationary black hole, also known as a holographic superconductor, and whose exterior region was rigorously constructed in the recent mathematical work [W. Zheng, Asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Spherically Symmetric Hairy Black Holes, arXiv.2410.04758].</description>

      <title>Dynamical Implications of the Kerr Multipole Moments for Spinning Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously the linearized stress tensor of a stationary Kerr black hole has been used to determine some of the values of gravitational couplings for a spinning black hole to linear order in the Riemann tensor in the action (worldline or quantum field theory). In particular, the couplings on operators containing derivative structures of the form $(S\cdot\nabla)^n$ acting on the Riemann tensor were fixed, with $S^\mu$ the spin vector of the black hole. In this paper we find that the Kerr solution determines all of the multipole moments in the sense of Dixon of a stationary spinning black hole and that these multipole moments determine all linear in $R$ couplings. For example, additional couplings beyond the previously mentioned are fixed on operators containing derivative structures of the form $S^{2n}(p\cdot\nabla)^{2n}$ acting on the Riemann tensor with $p^\mu$ the momentum vector of the black hole. These additional operators do not contribute to the three-point amplitude, and so do no contribute to the linearized stress tensor for a stationary black hole. However, we find that they do contribute to the Compton amplitude. Additionally, we derive formal expressions for the electromagnetic and gravitational Compton amplitudes of generic spinning bodies to all orders in spin in the worldline formalism and evaluated expressions for these amplitudes to order $S^3$ in electromagnetism and order $S^5$ in gravity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and observational constraints on black holes with primary hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity: Stability and shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we find that unlike in General Relativity, the shift-symmetric subclass of Beyond Horndeski theories permits black holes with primary hair that are thermodynamically stable and align with current Event Horizon Telescope observations of the M87* and Sgr A* black holes. This work begins by investigating thermodynamic properties, analyzing how primary hair influences thermodynamic quantities and local stability, which imposes strict constraints on the allowed range of primary hair values. The null geodesics near this black hole are then examined, demonstrating how scalar hair affects the shadow diameter. Specifically, when the parameter of the Beyond Horndeski function $F_4$ is negative, increasing scalar hair enlarges the shadow; in contrast, when this parameter is positive, greater scalar hair reduces the shadow size. Further constraints on the scalar hair are derived using observational data, highlighting its sensitivity to other black hole parameters. To explore additional observational features, face-on two-dimensional images of spherically infalling accretion disks are simulated, revealing how primary scalar hair shapes the black hole's shadow. Finally, all relevant constraints are combined to identify black holes that are both stable and consistent with observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary black holes are the most abundant source of gravitational-wave observations. Gravitational-wave observatories in the next decade will require tremendous increases in the accuracy of numerical waveforms modeling binary black holes, compared to today's state of the art. One approach to achieving the required accuracy is using spectral-type methods that scale to many processors. Using the SpECTRE numerical-relativity code, we present the first simulations of a binary black hole inspiral, merger, and ringdown using discontinuous Galerkin methods. The efficiency of discontinuous Galerkin methods allows us to evolve the binary through ~18 orbits at reasonable computational cost. We then use SpECTRE's Cauchy Characteristic Evolution (CCE) code to extract the gravitational waves at future null infinity. The open-source nature of SpECTRE means this is the first time a spectral-type method for simulating binary black hole evolutions is available to the entire numerical-relativity community.</description>

Abstract: We study some aspects of the de Sitter version of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Though we do not have propagating gravitons, we have a boundary mode when we compute observables with a fixed dilaton and metric at the boundary. We compute the no-boundary wavefunctions and probability measures to all orders in perturbation theory. We also discuss contributions from different topologies, borrowing recent results by Saad, Shenker and Stanford. We discuss how the boundary mode leads to gravitational corrections to cosmological observables when we add matter. Finally, starting from a four dimensional gravity theory with a positive cosmological constant, we consider a nearly extremal black hole and argue that some observables are dominated by the two dimensional nearly de Sitter gravity dynamics.</description>

      <title>Landau Theory of Causal Dynamical Triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the continuum limit of a theory of discrete random geometries is a beautiful but difficult challenge. In this optic, we review here the insights that can be obtained for Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) by employing the Landau approach to critical phenomena. In particular, concentrating on the cases of two and three dimensions, we will make the case that the configuration of the volume of spatial slices effectively plays the role of an order parameter, helping us to understand the phase structure of CDT. Moreover, consistency with numerical simulations of CDT provides hints that the effective field theory of the model lives in the space of theories invariant under foliation-preserving diffeomorphisms. Among such theories, Horava-Lifshitz gravity has the special status of being a perturbatively renormalizable theory, while General Relativity sits in a subspace with enhanced symmetry. In order to reach either of them, one would likely need to fine tune some of the parameters in the CDT action, or additional ones from some generalization thereof.</description>

Abstract: The public release of data from the LIGO and Virgo detectors has enabled the identification of potential gravitational wave signals by independent teams using alternative methodologies. In addition to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration's GWTC-3 catalogue there have been several additional works claiming the detection of signals in the data from the first three observing runs. In this paper we present an analysis of these new signals using the same analysis workflow which was used to generate the GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 catalogues published by the LVK, matching the analysis configuration as closely as possible, and we provide our parameter estimation results in a format comparable to those of the GWTC-3 data release. We also include a discussion of the workflow developed for this analysis.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM model against cosmography: A possible deviation after DESI 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present an analysis of the standard flat-$\Lambda$CDM model using a cosmographic approach, incorporating recent DESI BAO observations and Supernovae Type Ia catalogues (SNIa), including the DES-SN5YR and Pantheon+ compilations. We find full consistency between the standard model and the cosmographic approach when considering DESI BAO and SNIa catalogues independently. When combining DESI BAO with SNIa data, we examine the impact of the Planck prior on the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, and the Cepheid prior on the absolute magnitude, $M$. Applying the Planck prior on $r_d$ alone yields an $H_0$ value consistent with the Planck measurement, while applying the Cepheid prior on $M$ alone results in an $H_0$ value consistent with the SH0ES measurement. Without any priors, the $H_0$ value obtained has a large error margin, reconciling the Planck and SH0ES measurements. In all cases where individual priors are applied, we observe no significant tension between the flat-$\Lambda$CDM model and the cosmographic approach. However, when both Planck and Cepheid priors are applied simultaneously, significant tensions arise between the model and cosmography. This tension is even more pronounced when excluding LRG1 and LRG2 from the DESI measurements. These results indicate that the standard model cannot simultaneously reconcile high-redshift Planck CMB observations and local Cepheid measurements. This discrepancy supports the possibility of new physics beyond the standard model or, alternatively, the presence of unrecognized systematic errors in the observational data.</description>

      <title>Anisotropies of cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds in non-flat spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent reports of stochastic gravitational wave background from four independent pulsar-timing-array collaborations have renewed the interest in the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB), which is expected to open a new window into the early Universe. Although the early Universe is supposed to be extremely flat from an inflationary point of view, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data alone from the Planck satellite measurement prefers an enhanced lensing amplitude that can be explained by a closed Universe. In this paper, we propose an independent method to constrain the early-universe flatness from the anisotropies of CGWB. Using the generalized harmonic decompositions in the non-flat spacetime, we find CGWBs from different physical mechanisms such as cosmic inflation and phase transitions share the same integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) term but possess different SW terms, which would exhibit different behaviors when including the spatial curvature since the ISW effect is more sensitive to the spatial curvature than the SW effect. Furthermore, we provide the cross-correlations between CGWB and CMB, implying a positive or negative correlation between their SW effect terms depending on the GW mechanisms, which may hint at the sign of $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ when considering non-Gaussianity contributions to anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions -- III: Long term evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. More and more analyses show that QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. QPEs have shown to be invaluable in probing the orbits of SMOs in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In this paper, we extend previous orbital analyses in Refs. arXiv:2401.11190, arXiv:2405.06429 by including extra effects, the SMO orbital decay due to collisions with the disk and the disk precession. We find clear Bayes evidence for orbital decay in GSN 069 and for disk precession in eRO-QPE2, the two most stable QPE sources. The detection of these effects provides informative constraints on the SMBH mass, the radiation efficiency of QPEs, the SMO nature, the accretion disk surface density and the accretion disk viscosity. With tighter constraints on the SMO orbital parameters, we further confirm that these two QPE EMRIs are nearly circular orbiters which are consistent with the wet EMRI formation channel prediction, but are incompatible with either the dry loss-cone channel or the Hills mechanism. Combining all the QPE sources available, we find the QPE EMRIs can be divided into two populations according to their orbital eccentricities, where the orbital periods and the SMBH masses in the low-eccentricity population follow a scaling relation $T_{\rm obt}\propto M_{\bullet}^n$ with $n\approx 0.8$.</description>
