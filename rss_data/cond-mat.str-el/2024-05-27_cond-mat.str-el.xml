      <title>Integrable models on Rydberg atom chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of integrable models for spin chains with constrained Hilbert spaces; we focus on spin-1/2 chains with the Rydberg constraint. We extend earlier results for medium-range spin chains to the constrained Hilbert space, and formulate an integrability condition. This enables us to construct new integrable models with fixed interaction ranges. We classify all time- and space-reflection symmetric integrable Rydberg-constrained Hamiltonians of range 3 and 4. At range 3, we find a single family of integrable Hamiltonians: the so-called RSOS quantum chains, which are related to the well-known RSOS models of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. At range 4 we find two families of models, the first of which is the constrained XXZ model. We also find a new family of models depending on a single coupling $z$. We provide evidence of two critical points related to the golden ratio $\phi$, at $z=\phi^{-1/2}$ and $z=\phi^{3/2}$. We also perform a partial classification of integrable Hamiltonians for range 5.</description>

      <title>Metallic bonding in close packed structures: structural frustration from a hidden gauge symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on its simple valence electron configuration, we may expect lithium to have straightforward physical properties that are easily explained. However, solid lithium, when cooled below 77 K, develops a complex structure that has been debated for decades. A close parallel is found in sodium below 36 K where the crystal structure still remains unresolved. In this letter, we explore a possible driving force behind this complexity. We begin with the observation that Li and Na form close-packed structures at low temperatures. We demonstrate a gauge symmetry that forces \textit{all} close-packed structures to have the same electronic energy and, in fact, the very same band structure. This symmetry requires two conditions: (a) bands must arise from $s$ orbitals, and (b) hoppings beyond second-nearest neighbours must be negligible. We argue that both can be reasonably invoked in Li and Na. When these conditions are satisfied, we have extensive degeneracy with the number of competing iso-energetic structures growing exponentially with linear system size. Weak effects, such as $p$-orbital admixture, long-range hopping and phonon zero-point energy, can break this symmetry. These can play a decisive role in `selecting' one particular ordered structure. This point of view may explain the occurrence of ordered structures in Li and Na under pressure. Our results suggest that martensitic transitions may also occur in heavier alkali metals such as potassium.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible SPT, gauging and symmetry fractionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly realize the Rep($Q_8$) non-invertible symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state as a 1+1d cluster state on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits. Using the Kramers-Wannier operator, we construct the lattice models for the phases of all the symmetries in the Rep($Q_8$) duality web. We further show that we can construct a class of lattice models with Rep($G$) symmetry including non-invertible SPT phases if they have a dual anomalous abelian symmetry. Upon dualizing, there is a rich interplay between onsite symmetries, non-onsite symmetries, non-abelian symmetries, and non-invertible symmetries. We show that these interplay can be explained using the symmetry fractionalization in the 2+1d bulk SET.</description>

      <title>Theoretical model for multi-orbital Kondo screening in strongly correlated molecules with several unpaired electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism of Kondo screening in strongly correlated molecules with several unpaired electrons on a metal surface is still under debate. Here, we provide a theoretical framework that rationalizes the emergence of Kondo screening involving several extended molecular orbitals with unpaired electrons. We introduce a perturbative model, which provides simple rules to identify the presence of antiferromagnetic spin-flip channels involving charged molecular multiplets responsible for Kondo screening. The Kondo regime is confirmed by numerical renormalization group calculations. In addition, we introduce the concept of Kondo orbitals as molecular orbitals associated with the Kondo screening process, which provide a direct interpretation of experimental $dI/dV$ maps of Kondo resonances. We demonstrate that this theoretical framework can be applied to different strongly correlated open-shell molecules on metal surfaces, obtaining good agreement with previously published experimental data.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved X-ray Spectroscopy from the Atomic Orbital Ground State Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray spectroscopy has been a key method to determine ground and excited state properties of quantum materials with atomic specificity. Now, new x-ray facilities are opening the door to the study of pump-probe x-ray spectroscopy - specifically time-resolved x-ray absorption (trXAS) and time-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (trRIXS). In this paper we will present simulations of each of these spectroscopies using a time-domain full atomic multiplet, charge transfer Hamiltonian, adapted to study the properties of a generalized cluster model including a central transition metal ion caged by ligand atoms in a planar geometry. The numerically evaluated trXAS and trRIXS cross-sections for representative electron configurations $3d^9$ and $3d^8$ demonstrate the insights that can be obtained from charge transfer pumping, and how this nonequilibrium process affects ground and excited state properties. The straightforward characterization of the excitations in these systems, based on our analysis of the simulations, can serve as a benchmark for future experiments, as access to these time-resolved spectroscopic techniques becomes more widely available.</description>

      <title>Non-local optical response of a multi-phased quantum material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction in quantum materials presents a new paradigm as light can tip the balance between many competing quantum many-body phases to result in new phenomena. Describing the optical response of such materials requires complex models. Here, we develop a non-local model to describe the optical response of a quantum material, 1T-TaS$_2$. 1T-TaS$_2$ is a nearly commensurate charge-density-wave material at room temperature. The competing stacking configurations of the charge domains in this layered material result in significant optical inhomogeneity that necessitates a non-local dielectric function. We experimentally measure the non-local optical response of 1T-TaS$_2$ films under various illumination intensities and validate our model. The non-local parameter extracted from our measurements sheds light on the competition between the two stacking configurations of 1T-TaS$_2$. Our technique of measuring non-local optical response serves as a quick, simple, and non-invasive method to probe the energy landscape of strong correlations in many such quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Classical dynamics of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg $S=1/2$ spin ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a classical limit grounded in SU(4) coherent states to investigate the temperature-dependent dynamical spin structure factor of the $S = 1/2$ ladder consisting of weakly coupled dimers. By comparing the outcomes of this classical approximation with density matrix renormalization group and exact diagonalization calculations in finite size ladders, we demonstrate that the classical dynamics offers an accurate approximation across the entire temperature range when the interdimer coupling is weak and a good approximation in the high temperature regime even when the interdimer coupling is strong. This agreement is achieved after appropriately rescaling the temperature axis and renormalizing expectation values to satisfy a quantum sum rule, following D. Dahlbom et al. [Phys. Rev. B 109, 014427 (2024)]. We anticipate the method will be particularly effective when applied to 2D and 3D lattices composed of weakly-coupled dimers, situations that remain challenging for alternative numerical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CrX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I) have the same crystal structure and Hamiltonian but different ligand spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constant $\lambda_X$, providing excellent material platform exploring for exotic two-dimensional (2D) spin orders. Their microscopic mechanism underlying 2D spin physics and Hamiltonian remain unestablished, along with experimental corroboration of Kitaev exchange interaction, central to realizing topological quantum spin liquids. We report Kitaev interaction signature in magnetic anisotropy measured by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. We present measured values of Heisenberg J, Kitaev K, and off-diagonal symmetric $\Gamma$ exchange interactions in CrX$_3$ determined using FMR and exact diagonalization. K and $\Gamma$ exhibit dominant quadratic dependencies on $\lambda_X$, indicating its central role in 2D magnetism. Our study provides foundation for exploring exotic 2D magnetic topologies by tuning intrinsic material parameters such as SOC.</description>

      <title>Emergent topological magnetism in Hund's excitonic insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogous to the charged electron-electron pair condensation in superconductors, an excitonic insulator (EI) represents Fermi surface instability due to spontaneous formation and condensation of charge-neutral electron-hole pair (exciton). Unlike in superconductors, however, the charge-neutral nature of exciton makes probing emergent EI phase via macroscopic physical properties generally difficult. Here, we propose a van der Waals coupled antiferromagnetic semiconductor GdGaI (GGI) as a new material category leading to emergent multi-q magnet intertwined with spontaneous exciton formation/condensation. Before excitonic band hybridization, a simple picture for the parent electronic state consists of electron (Gd-derived 5d) and hole (Ga-derived 4p) delocalized bands, together with Gd-derived 4f localized antiferromagnets with S = 7/2 classical nature. Through intra Gd atom 4f-5d Hund's coupling, a notable finding is the emergent minimum length scale (2a) Skyrmion-like spin texture resulting from spontaneous condensation/formation of spin-polarized exciton with BCS-BEC crossover phenomenology. This discovered platform is promising for realizing valuable quantum matter on the nanoscale; our finding will provide significant insight into designing the atomic scale topological magnetism out of itinerant systems.</description>

      <title>Giant anomalous Hall effect and band folding in a Kagome metal with mixed dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic metals with geometric frustration offer a fertile ground for studying novel states of matter with strong quantum fluctuations and unique electromagnetic responses from conduction electrons coupled to spin textures. Recently, TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ has emerged as such an intriguing platform as it behaves as a quasi-one-dimension (quasi-1D) Ising magnet with antiferromagnetic orderings at 20.4 K and 3 K, respectively. Magnetic fields along the Tb zigzag-chain direction reveal plateaus at 1/3 and 2/3 of saturated magnetization, respectively. At metamagnetic transition boundaries, a record-high anomalous Hall conductivity of 6.2 $\times$ 10$^5$ $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ is observed. Within the plateau, noncollinear magnetic texture is suggested. In addition to the characteristic Kagome 2D electronic structure, ARPES unequivocally demonstrates quasi-1D electronic structure from the Tb 5$d$ bands and a quasi-1D hybridization gap in the magnetic state due to band folding with $q$ = (1/3, 0, 0) possibly from the spin-density-wave order along the Tb chain. These findings emphasize the crucial role of mixed dimensionality and the strong coupling between magnetic texture and electronic band structure in regulating physical properties of materials, offering new strategies for designing materials for future spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Electronic thermal resistivity and quasi-particle collision cross-section in semi-metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids and their density of states. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Exploring Superconductivity: The Interplay of Electronic Orders in Topological Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum materials hold great promise for future technological applications. Their unique electronic properties, such as protected surface states and exotic quasiparticles, offer opportunities for designing novel electronic devices, spintronics, and quantum information processing. The origin of the interplay between various electronic orders in topological quantum materials, such as superconductivity and magnetism, remains unclear, particularly whether these electronic orders cooperate, compete, or simply coexist. Since the 2000s, the combination of topology and matter has sparked a tremendous surge of interest among theoreticians and experimentalists alike. Novel theoretical descriptions and predictions, as well as complex experimental setups confirming or refuting these theories, continuously appear in renowned journals. This review aims to provide conceptual tools to understand the fundamental concepts of this ever-growing field. Superconductivity and its historical development will serve as a second pillar alongside topological materials. While the primary focus will be on topological superconductors, other topological materials, such as topological insulators and topological semimetals, will also be explained phenomenologically.</description>

      <title>Thermally-induced mimicry of quantum cluster excitations and implications for the magnetic transition in FePX$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two dimensional magnets, the interplay of thermal fluctuations and spin anisotropy control the existence of long-range magnetic order. In the van der Waals antiferromagnets FePX$_3$, orbital degeneracy in the $t_{2g}$ levels of the Fe$^{2+}$ ions in octahedral coordination yields strong uniaxial anisotropy, which stabilizes magnetic order up to $T \approx 100$ K. Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements around the magnetic ordering transition have shown the existence of a broad spectrum of magnetic fluctuations with nontrivial momentum dependence, what has been interpreted as evidence for localized entangled cluster excitations. In this paper, we offer an alternative interpretation using classical non-linear spin dynamics simulations. We present stochastic Landau Lifshitz dynamics simulations that reproduce the neutron scattering measurements of Chen et al. [1] on FePX$_3$. These calculations faithfully explain the dynamical structure factor's momentum and energy dependence and point to a classical origin for the excitations observed in neutron spectroscopy and that the order-disorder transition can be understood in terms of thermal fluctuations overcoming the anisotropy energy.</description>

      <title>Exact dynamics of quantum dissipative $XX$ models: Wannier-Stark localization in the fragmented operator space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address dissipative dynamics of the one-dimensional nearest-neighbour $XX$ spin-$1/2$ chain governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In the absence of dissipation the model is integrable. We identify a broad class of dissipative terms that generically destroy integrability but leave the operator space of the model fragmented into an extensive number of dynamically disjoint subspaces of varying dimensions. In sufficiently small subspaces the GKSL equation in the Heisenberg representation can be easily solved, sometimes in a closed analytical form. We provide an example of such an exact solution for a specific choice of dissipative terms. It is found that observables experience the Wannier-Stark localization in the corresponding operator subspace. As a result, the expectation values of the observables are linear combinations of essentially a few discrete decay modes, the long time dynamics being governed by the slowest mode. We examine the complex Liouvillian eigenvalue corresponding to this latter mode as a function of the dissipation strength. We find an exceptional point at a critical dissipation strength that separates oscillating and non-oscillating decay. We also describe a different type of dissipation that leads to a single decay mode in the whole operator subspace. Finally, we point out that our exact solutions of the GKSL equation entail exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation describing the quench dynamics in closed spin ladders dual to the dissipative spin chains.</description>

      <title>Stoner instabilities and Ising excitonic states in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) systems provide a tunable platform for studying electron-correlation driven quantum phases. Such phases have so far been found at rational fillings of the moir\'e superlattice, and it is believed that lattice commensurability plays a key role in their stability. In this work, we show via magnetotransport measurements on twisted WSe2 that new correlated electronic phases can exist away from commensurability. The first phase is an antiferromagnetic metal that is driven by proximity to the van Hove singularity. The second is a re-entrant magnetic field-driven insulator. This insulator is formed from a small and equal density of electrons and holes with opposite spin projections - an Ising excitonic insulator.</description>

      <title>Kondo-Zeno crossover in the dynamics of a monitored quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a quantum dot coupled to a metallic bath and subject to continuous monitoring of its charge density. The dynamics averaged over measurement noise is described by a dissipative Anderson impurity model with local Markovian dephasing, that we solve using an extension of the Non-Crossing Approximation in the vectorized Hilbert space. We show that the decay time scale of an initially polarised spin which is suddenly coupled to the bath and to the monitoring protocol displays a crossover from Kondo screening, with a lifetime controlled by interactions, to Quantum Zeno effect, with a lifetime which decreases with bare dissipation as the dephasing or monitoring rate is increased. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation on the Lindbladian we derive an effective model for the long-time dynamics which is described at weak dissipation by a non-Hermitian Kondo model with complex-valued spin-spin exchange. As the dephasing is increased heating due to doublon production takes over and control the spin decay.</description>

      <title>Crystalline invariants of fractional Chern insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of crystalline symmetry, topologically ordered states can acquire a host of symmetry-protected invariants. These determine the patterns of crystalline symmetry fractionalization of the anyons in addition to fractionally quantized responses to lattice defects. Here we show how ground state expectation values of partial rotations centered at high symmetry points can be used to extract crystalline invariants. Using methods from conformal field theory and G-crossed braided tensor categories, we develop a theory of invariants obtained from partial rotations, which apply to both Abelian and non-Abelian topological orders. We then perform numerical Monte Carlo calculations for projected parton wave functions of fractional Chern insulators, demonstrating remarkable agreement between theory and numerics. For the topological orders we consider, we show that the Hall conductivity, filling fraction, and partial rotation invariants fully characterize the crystalline invariants of the system. Our results also yield invariants of continuum fractional quantum Hall states protected by spatial rotational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Anomaly inflow for CSS and fractonic lattice models and dualities via cluster state measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a class of quantum error correction codes that contains the toric code and fracton models. A procedure called foliation defines a cluster state for a given CSS code. We use the CSS chain complex and its tensor product with other chain complexes to describe the topological structure in the foliated cluster state, and argue that it has a symmetry-protected topological order protected by generalized global symmetries supported on cycles in the foliated CSS chain complex. We demonstrate the so-called anomaly inflow between CSS codes and corresponding foliated cluster states by explicitly showing the equality of the gauge transformations of the bulk and boundary partition functions defined as functionals of defect world-volumes. We show that the bulk and boundary defects are related via measurement of the bulk system. Further, we provide a procedure to obtain statistical models associated with general CSS codes via the foliated cluster state, and derive a generalization of the Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality for such statistical models with insertion of twist defects. We also study the measurement-assisted gauging method with cluster-state entanglers for CSS/fracton models based on recent proposals in the literature, and demonstrate a non-invertible fusion of duality operators. Using the cluster-state entanglers, we construct the so-called strange correlator for general CSS/fracton models. Finally, we introduce a new family of subsystem-symmetric quantum models each of which is self-dual under the generalized Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality transformation, which becomes a non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was proposed that the chiral central charge of a gapped, two-dimensional quantum many-body system is proportional to a bulk ground state entanglement measure known as the modular commutator. While there is significant evidence to support this relation, we show in this paper that it is not universal. We give examples of lattice systems that have vanishing chiral central charge which nevertheless give nonzero "spurious" values for the modular commutator for arbitrarily large system sizes, in both one and two dimensions. Our examples are based on cluster states and utilize the fact that they can generate nonlocal modular Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Anomalous isotope Effect in d-wave superconductors on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isotope effect with a large coefficient $\alpha=-\partial \ln T_c/\partial \ln M$ is usually taken as an evidence of phonon mediated superconductors in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. However, in cuprates which are now widely believed to be strong correlation induced d-wave superconductors, $\alpha$ is experimentally observed to be quite small at optimal doping, but keeps growing up with decreasing $T_c$ upon doping, even after exceeding the BCS value $1/2$. Such an anomalous isotope effect seems to challenge the non-phonon picture and still leave room for the phonon-dominated mechanism. In this work, we show that the anomalous dependence of $\alpha$ on $T_c$ can actually be obtained in spin fluctuation induced d-wave superconductors, by studying the Hubbard model on square lattices with functional renormalization group. We have considered two types of electron-phonon couplings (EPCs). The first type couples to electron densities, including the Holstein, breathing and buckling phonons, called Holstein-like. For all these EPCs, $\alpha$ is negative and drops down towards $-\infty$ with decreasing $T_c$ upon doping. On the opposite, for the other type of Peierls-like EPC coupling to electron hoppings on the nearest bonds, also called Su-Schrieffer-Heeger phonon, $\alpha$ is positive, grows up with decreasing $T_c$ and tends to diverge as $T_c\to0$, in qualitative agreement with the experiments. The difference between these two types of EPCs can be understood by their isotope effects on spin fluctuations. From this study, we conclude that the SSH phonon can explain the anomalous isotope effect in cuprates, although it is not the leading pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer and Spin-Valley locking in 4Hb-TaS$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 4Hb-TaS$_2$ is a superconductor that exhibits unique characteristics such as time-reversal symmetry breaking, hidden magnetic memory, and topological edge modes. It is a naturally occurring heterostructure comprising of alternating layers of 1H-TaS$_2$ and 1T-TaS$_2$. The former is a well-known superconductor, while the latter is a correlated insulator with a possible non-trivial magnetic ground state. In this study, we use angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the normal state electronic structure of this unconventional superconductor. Our findings reveal that the band structure of 4H-TaS$_2$ fundamentally differs from that of its constituent materials. Specifically, we observe a significant charge transfer from the 1T layers to the 1H layers that drives the 1T layers away from half-filling. In addition, we find a substantial reduction in inter-layer coupling in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ compared to the coupling in 2H-TaS$_2$ that results in a pronounced spin-valley locking within 4Hb-TaS$_2$</description>

      <title>Temperature evolution of the Fermi surface of the FeSe monolayer on STO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of superconductivity in FeSe monolayer on SrTiO$_3$ belongs to one of the unresolved mysteries in condensed-matter physics. Here by investigation of the temperature evolution of the dynamic charge response of FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ we demonstrate that the response of the monolayer itself is nearly temperature independent. This indicates a constant Fermi surface over a wide range of temperature, in stark contrast to that of the bulk FeSe and other Fe-based superconductors. Our results, which manifest the peculiarity of the electronic structure of the FeSe monolayer, may help for a microscopic understanding of the superconductivity in Fe-chalcogenide monolayers on oxide surfaces in general.</description>

      <title>Even- and Odd-denominator Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Graphene Moire Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum anomalous hall effect (FQAHE), a transport effect with fractionally quantized Hall plateau emerging under zero magnetic field, provides a radically new opportunity to engineer topological quantum electronics. By construction of topological flat band with moire engineering, intrinsic FQAHE has been observed in twisted MoTe2 system and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene/hBN moire superlattices with anomalous Hall resistivity quantization number C &lt;= 2/3 including the gapless composite Fermi-liquid state with C = 1/2. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new system of rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG)/hBN moire superlattices showing both fractional and integer quantum anomalous Hall effects when the lowest flat Chern band is fractionally and fully filled at zero magnetic field. The zero-field Hall resistance Rho_xy = h/Ce2 is quantized to values corresponding to C = 3/5, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 7/9 and 1 at moire filling factors v = 3/5, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 7/9 and 1, respectively. Particularly, the C = 3/4 FQAHE state at v = 3/4 moire filling featuring a minimum of longitudinal resistance Rho_xx and fractionally quantized Hall resistance Rho_xy = 4h/3e2, is observed for the first time under zero magnetic field. Such a state may be similar to the C = 3/4 fractional quantum hall (FQHE) state recently observed at high magnetic fields9,10 and possibly host fractional charge excitations obeying non-Abelian statistics. By tuning the electrical and magnetic fields at 0 &lt; v &lt; 1, we have observed a sign reversal of the Hall resistivity for v = 2/3 state, indicating a transition from quasi-electron-like excitations to quasi-hole ones. Our experiment has established RHG/hBN moire superlattices a promising platform to explore quasi-particles with fractional charge excitations and non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the shear viscoelasticity and the hydrodynamic modes in a holographic solid model with several sets of axions that all break the translations spontaneously on boundary. Comparing with the single-axion model, the shear modulus is enhanced at high temperatures and the shear viscosity is always suppressed in the presence of additional axions. However, the different sets of axions exhibit competitive relationship in determining the shear modulus at low temperatures. Furthermore, by calculating the black hole quasi-normal modes, it is found that adding more axions only increases the amount of diffusive modes. The number of the sound modes always remains unchanged.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as an ideal platform for creating engineered artificial electronic states. While vertical heterostructures have been extensively studied, realizing high-quality lateral heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces remains a major experimental challenge. Here, we advance a one-pot two-step molecular beam lateral epitaxy approach and successfully synthesize atomically well-defined 1T-VSe$_2$ -- 1H-NbSe$_2$ lateral heterostructures. We demonstrate the formation of defect-free lateral heterostructures and characterize their electronic structure using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy together with density functional theory calculations. We find additional electronic states at the one-dimensional interface as well as signatures of Kondo resonances in a side-coupled geometry. Our experiments explore the full potential of lateral heterostructures for realizing exotic electronic states in low-dimensional systems for further studies of artificial designer quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the conjectured classification of topological phases in two spatial dimensions with gappable boundary, in a simplified setting. Two gapped ground states of lattice Hamiltonians are in the same quantum phase of matter, or topological phase, if they can be connected by a constant-depth quantum circuit. It is conjectured that the Levin-Wen string-net models exhaust all possible gapped phases with gappable boundary, and these phases are labeled by unitary modular tensor categories. We prove this under the assumption that every phase has a representative state with zero correlation length satisfying the entanglement bootstrap axioms, or a strict form of area law. Our main technical development is to transform these states into string-net states using constant-depth quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how interacting particles approach thermal equilibrium is a major challenge of quantum simulators. Unlocking the full potential of such systems toward this goal requires flexible initial state preparation, precise time evolution, and extensive probes for final state characterization. We present a quantum simulator comprising 69 superconducting qubits which supports both universal quantum gates and high-fidelity analog evolution, with performance beyond the reach of classical simulation in cross-entropy benchmarking experiments. Emulating a two-dimensional (2D) XY quantum magnet, we leverage a wide range of measurement techniques to study quantum states after ramps from an antiferromagnetic initial state. We observe signatures of the classical Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, as well as strong deviations from Kibble-Zurek scaling predictions attributed to the interplay between quantum and classical coarsening of the correlated domains. This interpretation is corroborated by injecting variable energy density into the initial state, which enables studying the effects of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in targeted parts of the eigenspectrum. Finally, we digitally prepare the system in pairwise-entangled dimer states and image the transport of energy and vorticity during thermalization. These results establish the efficacy of superconducting analog-digital quantum processors for preparing states across many-body spectra and unveiling their thermalization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Physical and unphysical regimes of self-consistent many-body perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.04508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the standard framework of self-consistent many-body perturbation theory, the skeleton series for the self-energy is truncated at a finite order $\mathcal{N}$ and plugged into the Dyson equation, which is then solved for the propagator $G_{\mathcal{N}}\,$. We consider two examples of fermionic models, the Hubbard atom at half filling and its zero space-time dimensional simplified version. First, we show that $G_{\mathcal{N}}\,$ converges when $\mathcal{N}\to\infty$ to a limit $G_\infty\,$, which coincides with the exact physical propagator $G_{\rm exact}\ $ at small enough coupling, while $G_\infty \neq G_{\rm exact}\ $ at strong coupling. This follows from the findings of [Kozik, Ferrero and Georges, PRL 114, 156402 (2015)] and an additional subtle mathematical mechanism elucidated here. Second, we demonstrate that it is possible to discriminate between the $G_\infty=G_{\rm exact}\ $ and $G_\infty\neq G_{\rm exact}\ $ regimes thanks to a criterion which does not require the knowledge of $G_{\rm exact}\ $, as proposed in [Rossi et al., PRB 93, 161102(R) (2016)].</description>

      <title>Theory of Difference Frequency Quantum Oscillations</title>

Abstract: Quantum oscillations (QO) describe the periodic variation of physical observables as a function of inverse magnetic field in metals. The Onsager relation connects the basic QO frequencies with the extremal areas of closed Fermi surface pockets, and the theory of magnetic breakdown explains the observation of sums of QO frequencies at high magnetic fields. Here we develop a quantitative theory of difference frequency QOs in two- and three-dimensional metals with multiple Fermi pockets with parabolic or linearly dispersing excitations. We show that a non-linear interband coupling, e.g. in the form of interband impurity scattering, can give rise to otherwise forbidden QO frequencies which can persist to much higher temperatures compared to the basis frequencies. We discuss the experimental implications of our findings for various material candidates, for example multi-fold fermion systems, and the relation to magneto intersubband oscillations known for coupled two-dimensional electron gases.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling phases of trions and excitons in electron-hole bilayers at commensurate densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce density imbalanced electron-hole bilayers at a commensurate 2 : 1 density ratio as a platform for realizing novel phases involving electrons, excitons and trions. Three length scales are identified which characterize the interplay between kinetic energy, intralayer repulsion, and interlayer attraction. By a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical calculation, we find a variety of strong-coupling phases in different parameter regions, including quantum crystals of electrons, excitons, and trions. We also propose an "excitonic supersolid" phase that features electron crystallization and exciton superfluidity simultaneously. The material realization and experimental signature of these phases are discussed in the context of semiconductor transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.</description>

      <title>Resummation-based Quantum Monte Carlo for Entanglement Entropy Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01490v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the recently developed resummation-based quantum Monte Carlo method for the SU($N$) spin and loop-gas models, we develop a new algorithm, dubbed ResumEE, to compute the entanglement entropy (EE) with greatly enhanced efficiency. Our ResumEE exponentially speeds up the computation of the exponentially small value of the $\langle e^{-S^{(2)}}\rangle$, where $S^{(2)}$ is the 2nd order R\'enyi EE, such that the $S^{(2)}$ for a generic 2D quantum SU($N$) spin models can be readily computed with high accuracy. We benchmark our algorithm with the previously proposed estimators of $S^{(2)}$ on 1D and 2D SU($2$) Heisenberg spin systems to reveal its superior performance and then use it to detect the entanglement scaling data of the N\'eel-to-VBS transition on 2D SU($N$) Heisenberg model with continuously varying $N$. Our ResumEE algorithm is efficient for precisely evaluating the entanglement entropy of SU($N$) spin models with continuous $N$ and reliable access to the conformal field theory data for the highly entangled quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Stability of fractional Chern insulators with a non-Landau level continuum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of fractional Chern insulators is widely believed to be predicted by the resemblance of their single-particle spectra to Landau levels. We investigate the scope of this geometric stability hypothesis by analyzing the stability of a set of fractional Chern insulators that explicitly do not have a Landau level continuum limit. By computing the many-body spectra of Laughlin states in a generalized Hofstadter model, we analyze the relationship between single-particle metrics, such as trace inequality saturation, and many-body metrics, such as the magnitude of the many-body and entanglement gaps. We show numerically that the geometric stability hypothesis holds for Chern bands that are not continuously connected to Landau levels, as well as conventional Chern bands, albeit often requiring larger system sizes to converge for these configurations.</description>

      <title>Emergent symmetries and Interactions: An isolated fixed point Vs a manifold of strongly interacting fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study conditions of continuous emergent symmetries in gapless states, either as topological quantum critical points (TQCPs) or a stable phase with protecting symmetries and connections to smooth deformations of the gapped states around. We illustrate that for a wide class of gapless states that can be associated with fully-isolated scale invariant fixed points, there shall always be emergent continuous symmetries that are directly related to smooth deformations of gapped states with symmetries lower than the protecting ones $G_p$. For a 3D TQCP in DIII classes with $G_p=Z^T_2$, $U_{EM}=U(1)$ and $N_f=\frac{1}{2}$ fermions but without charge $U(1)$ symmetry, we explicitly construct a corresponding boundary representation based on a $4D$ topological state with lattice symmetry $H=Z^T_2 \ltimes U(1)$ and $N_f={1}$ fermions. Although emergent continuous symmetries appear to be robust at weakly interacting TQCPs, we further show the breakdown of such one-to-one correspondence between deformations of gapped states and emergent continuous symmetries when gapless states become strongly interacting. In a strongly interacting limit, gapless states can be represented by a smooth manifold of conformal-field-theory fixed points rather than a fully isolated one. A smooth manifold of strong coupling fixed points hinders emergence of a continuous emergent symmetry in the strongly interacting gapless limit, as deformations no longer leave a gapless state or a TQCP invariant, unlike in the more conventional weakly interacting case. This typically reduces continuous emergent symmetries to a discrete symmetry originating from duality transformations under the protection symmetry $G_p$.</description>

      <title>An integral algorithm of exponential observables for interacting fermions in quantum Monte Carlo simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exponential observables, formulated as $\log \langle e^{\hat{X}}\rangle$ where $\hat{X}$ is an extensive quantity, play a critical role in study of quantum many-body systems, examples of which include the free-energy and entanglement entropy. Given that $e^{X}$ becomes exponentially large (or small) in the thermodynamic limit, accurately computing the expectation value of this exponential quantity presents a significant challenge. In this Letter, we propose a comprehensive algorithm for quantifying these observables in interacting fermion systems, utilizing the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method. We have applied this novel algorithm to the 2D half-filled Hubbard model. At the strong coupling limit, our method showcases a significant accuracy improvement compared to conventional methods that are derived from the internal energy. We also illustrate that this novel approach delivers highly efficient and precise measurements of the nth R\'enyi entanglement entropy. Even more noteworthy is that this improvement comes without incurring increases in computational complexity. This algorithm effectively suppresses exponential fluctuations and can be easily generalized to other models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parton theory constructs candidate fractional quantum Hall states by decomposing the physical particles into unphysical partons, placing the partons in integer quantum Hall states, and then gluing the partons back into the physical particles. Field theoretical formulations execute the gluing process through the device of emergent gauge fields. Here we study numerically the process of going from the integer quantum Hall effect of two species of fermionic partons to the fractional quantum Hall effect of bosons by introducing an attractive interaction between the fermions of different species and continuously increasing its strength to glue them into bosons. To properly capture the physics in the bulk, we implement this process in a lattice version of the spherical geometry, which allows us to keep the full Hilbert space. Even though the two end-point states are topologically distinct, we find that, for the small system sizes accessible to our study, the energy gap remains open, indicating a crossover between these two states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlated electron systems may give rise to multiple effective interactions whose combined impact on quasiparticle properties can be difficult to disentangle. We introduce an unambiguous decomposition of the electronic self-energy which allows us to quantify the contributions of various effective interactions simultaneously. We use this tool to revisit the hole-doped Hubbard model within the dynamical cluster approximation, where commonly spin fluctuations are considered to be the origin of the pseudogap. While our fluctuation decomposition confirms that spin fluctuations indeed suppress antinodal electronic spectral weight, we show that they alone can not capture the pseudogap self-energy quantitatively. Nonlocal multi-boson Feynman diagrams yield substantial contributions and are needed for a quantitative description of the pseudogap.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations in the hole-doped cuprates and the confinement of spinons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long standing problem in the study of the under-hole-doped cuprates has been the description of the Fermi surfaces underlying the high magnetic field quantum oscillations. Harrison and Sebastian (arXiv:1103.4181) proposed that the higher temperature pseudogap 'Fermi arcs' are reconstructed into an electron pocket by field-induced charge density wave order. But computations on such a model (Zhang and Mei, arXiv:1411.2098) show an unobserved additional oscillation frequency from a Fermi surface arising from the backsides of the hole pockets completing the Fermi arcs. We describe a transition from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) model of the pseudogap metal, to a metal with bi-directional charge density wave order without fractionalization. We show that the confinement of the fermionic spinon excitations of the FL* across this transition can eliminate the unobserved oscillation frequency.</description>

      <title>Ancilla quantum measurements on interacting chains: Sensitivity of entanglement dynamics to the type and concentration of detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a quantum many-body lattice system that is coupled to ancillary degrees of freedom (``detectors''), which are periodically measured by means of strong projective measurements. The concentration $\rho_a$ of ancillae and their coupling $M$ to the main system are considered as parameters. We explore the dynamics of density and of entanglement entropy in the chain, for various values of $\rho_a$ and $M$ for two models of the detector-chain interaction that couple the local density in the chain to a detector degree of freedom. It is found that, for the density-density ($S_z s_z$-type in spin language) coupling, the critical values $M_c$ for the measurement-induced entanglement transition depends sensitively on $\rho_a$. Moreover, our results indicate that for a sufficiently small $\rho_a$ the transition in this model disappears, i.e., a finite density of detectors is needed to reach a disentangling phase. The behavior is qualitatively different for the second model, with density-hopping ($S_z s_x$-type) coupling. Specifically, the dynamics is much less sensitive to the concentration $\rho_a$ of detectors than in the first model. Furthermore, the dependence of entanglement on the coupling strength $M$ is strongly non-monotonic, indicating re-entrance of the entangling phase at large $M$.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Confinement Transitions in QCD from Symmetry Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories with fundamental matter there is typically no sharp way to distinguish confining and Higgs regimes, e.g. using generalized global symmetries acting on loop order parameters. It is standard lore that these two regimes are continuously connected, as has been explicitly demonstrated in certain lattice and continuum models. We point out that Higgsing and confinement sometimes lead to distinct symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases -- necessarily separated by a phase transition -- for ordinary global symmetries. We present explicit examples in 3+1 dimensions, obtained by adding elementary Higgs fields and Yukawa couplings to QCD while preserving parity P and time reversal T. In a suitable scheme, the confining phases of these theories are trivial SPTs, while their Higgs phases are characterized by non-trivial P- and T-invariant theta-angles $\theta_f, \theta_g = \pi$ for flavor or gravity background gauge fields, i.e. they are topological insulators or superconductors. Finally, we consider conventional three-flavor QCD (without elementary Higgs fields) at finite $U(1)_B$ baryon-number chemical potential $\mu_B$, which preserves P and T. At very large $\mu_B$, three-flavor QCD is known to be a completely Higgsed color superconductor that also spontaneously breaks $U(1)_B$. We argue that this high-density phase is in fact a gapless SPT, with a gravitational theta-angle $\theta_g = \pi$ that safely co-exists with the $U(1)_B$ Nambu-Goldstone boson. We explain why this SPT motivates unexpected transitions in the QCD phase diagram, as well as anomalous surface modes at the boundary of quark-matter cores inside neutron stars.</description>

      <title>A domain wall and chiral edge currents in holographic chiral phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate spatially inhomogeneous solutions in a top-down holographic model: the D3/D7 model which provides a holographic description of the chiral phase transition for a finite external magnetic field, chemical potential, and temperature. We numerically find a domain wall (or kink) solution in the three dimensional space, which incorporates between the chiral symmetry broken phase at the spatial infinity, under the homogeneous sources. Along with the inhomogeneity of the chiral condensate, the charge density is also spatially modulated. The modulated charge density and finite magnetic field lead to the chiral edge current close to the domain wall. We explore the dependences of those profiles on the chemical potential and temperature near the first and second order phase transition points. Our results indicate that the inhomogeneous solutions we found are in good agreement with those obtained by the Ginzburg--Landau theory in the vicinity of the transition points.</description>

      <title>Classifying One-Dimensional Quantum States Prepared by a Single Round of Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements and feedback have emerged as powerful resources for creating many-body quantum states. However, a detailed understanding has been restricted to fixed-point representatives of phases of matter. Here, we go beyond this and characterize the patterns of many-body entanglement that can be deterministically created from measurement. Focusing on one spatial dimension, a framework is developed for the case where a single round of measurements is the only entangling operation. We show this creates matrix product states and identify necessary and sufficient tensor conditions for preparability, which uniquely determine the preparation protocol. We use these conditions to both classify preparable quantum states and characterize their physical constraints. In particular, we find a trade-off between the richness of the preparable entanglement spectrum and correlation functions, which leads to a no-go theorem for preparing certain quantum states. More broadly, we connect properties of the preparation protocol to the resulting phase of matter, including trivial, symmetry-breaking, and symmetry-protected topological phases -- for both uniform and modulated symmetries. This work offers a resource-theoretic perspective on preparable quantum entanglement and shows how to systematically create states of matter, away from their fixed points, in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Anomalies of QCD$_3$ and QED$_3$</title>

Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetry provide powerful tool to constrain the dynamics of quantum systems, such as anomaly matching in the renormalization group flow and obstruction to symmetric mass generation. In this note we compute the anomalies in 2+1d time-reversal symmetric gauge theories with massless fermions in the fundamental and rank-two tensor representations, where the gauge groups are $SU(N),SO(N),Sp(N),U(1)$. The fermion parity is part of the gauge group and the theories are bosonic. The time-reversal symmetry satisfies $T^2=1$ or $T^2={\cal M}$ where ${\cal M}$ is an internal magnetic symmetry.
  We show that some of the bosonic gauge theories have time-reversal anomaly with $c_-\neq 0$ mod 8 that is absent in fermionic systems. The anomalies of the gauge theories can be nontrivial even when the number of Majorana fermions is a multiple of 16 and $\nu=0$.</description>
