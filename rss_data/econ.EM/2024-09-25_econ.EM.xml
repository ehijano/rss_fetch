      <title>Identifying Elasticities in Autocorrelated Time Series Using Causal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The price elasticity of demand can be estimated from observational data using instrumental variables (IV). However, naive IV estimators may be inconsistent in settings with autocorrelated time series. We argue that causal time graphs can simplify IV identification and help select consistent estimators. To do so, we propose to first model the equilibrium condition by an unobserved confounder, deriving a directed acyclic graph (DAG) while maintaining the assumption of a simultaneous determination of prices and quantities. We then exploit recent advances in graphical inference to derive valid IV estimators, including estimators that achieve consistency by simultaneously estimating nuisance effects. We further argue that observing significant differences between the estimates of presumably valid estimators can help to reject false model assumptions, thereby improving our understanding of underlying economic dynamics. We apply this approach to the German electricity market, estimating the price elasticity of demand on simulated and real-world data. The findings underscore the importance of accounting for structural autocorrelation in IV-based analysis.</description>

      <title>Large Bayesian Tensor VARs with Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Bayesian tensor vector autoregressions (TVARs) in which the VAR coefficients are arranged as a three-dimensional array or tensor, and this coefficient tensor is parameterized using a low-rank CP decomposition. We develop a family of TVARs using a general stochastic volatility specification, which includes a wide variety of commonly-used multivariate stochastic volatility and COVID-19 outlier-augmented models. In a forecasting exercise involving 40 US quarterly variables, we show that these TVARs outperform the standard Bayesian VAR with the Minnesota prior. The results also suggest that the parsimonious common stochastic volatility model tends to forecast better than the more flexible Cholesky stochastic volatility model.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Bi-level Sparse Group Regressions for Macroeconomic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Machine Learning approach for optimal macroeconomic forecasting in a high-dimensional setting where the covariates present a known group structure. Our model is general enough to encompass specific forecasting models, featuring either many covariates, or unknown nonlinearities, or series sampled at different frequencies. By relying on the novel concept of bi-level sparsity in time-series econometrics, we propose a prior that induces sparsity both at the group level and within groups. We demonstrate that the corresponding posterior distribution contracts at the minimax-optimal rate, is consistent, and has a support that includes the support of the model asymptotically. Our theory allows for correlation between groups, while predictors in the same group can be characterized by strong covariation as well as common characteristics and patterns. Finite sample performance is illustrated through comprehensive Monte Carlo experiments and a real-data nowcasting exercise of the US GDP growth rate.</description>

      <title>When does IV identification not restrict outcomes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many identification results in instrumental variables (IV) models hold without requiring any restrictions on the distribution of potential outcomes, or how those outcomes are correlated with selection behavior. This enables IV models to allow for arbitrary heterogeneity in treatment effects and the possibility of selection on gains in the outcome. I provide a necessary and sufficient condition for treatment effects to be point identified in a manner that does not restrict outcomes when the instruments take a finite number of values. The condition generalizes the well-known LATE monotonicity assumption, and unifies a wide variety of other known IV identification results. The result also yields a brute-force approach to reveal all selection models that allow for point identification of treatment effects without restricting outcomes, and then enumerate all of the identified parameters within each such selection model. The search uncovers new selection models that yield identification, provides impossibility results for others, and offers opportunities to relax assumptions on selection used in existing literature.</description>
