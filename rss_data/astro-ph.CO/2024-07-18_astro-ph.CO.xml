      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with Type Ia supernova and transverse BAO measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the angular diameter distance (ADD) derived from the transverse Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data with the luminosity distance (LD) from the Pantheon type Ia supernova (SNIa) sample. The binning method and Gaussian process are employed to match ADD data with LD data at the same redshift. First, we use nonparametric and parametric methods to investigate the impact of the specific prior values of the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ from SNIa observations and the sound horizon scale $r_{\rm s}$ from transverse BAO measurements on the CDDR tests. The results obtained from the parametric and non-parametric methods indicate that specific prior values of $M_{\rm B}$ and $r_{\rm s}$ lead to significant biases on the CDDR test. Then, to avoid these biases, we propose a method independent of $M_{\rm B}$ and $r_{\rm s}$ to test CDDR by considering the fiducial value of $\kappa\equiv10^{M_{\rm B} \over 5}r_{\rm s}$ as a nuisance parameter and then marginalizing its influence with a flat prior in the analysis. No violation of the CDDR is found, and the transverse BAO measurement can be used as a powerful tool to verify the validity of CDDR in the cosmological-model-independent method.</description>

      <title>SKYSURF VI: The Impact of Thermal Variations of HST on Background Light Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SKYSURF project constrained extragalactic background light (EBL) and diffuse light with the vast archive of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Thermal emission from HST itself introduces an additional uncertain background and hinders accurate measurement of the diffuse light level. Here, we use archival WFC3/IR engineering data to investigate and model changes in the temperature of various components in HST's optical path as a function of time (solar cycle) and time of the year (Earth-Sun distance). We also specifically investigate changes in temperature with HST's orbital phase and time since Earth occultation. We investigate possible correlations between HST component temperature and year, and temperature and month. The thermal background changes by less than one Kelvin in the WFC3 pick-off mirror, one of the most important contributors to the thermal background. We model these data to describe the impact that orbital phase, year, and time of year have on the HST and WFC3 component temperatures, and use this to derive the impact on the thermal dark signal and the resulting diffuse light measurements. Based on this improved modeling, we provide new upper limits on the level of diffuse light of 21 nW m-2 sr-1, 32 nW m-2 sr-1, and 25 nW m-2 sr-1 for F125W, F140W, and F160W. Additionally, by accounting for all known sources of measurement uncertainty, we report lower limits on the level of diffuse light of 12 nW m-2 sr-1, 20 nW m-2 sr-1, and 2 nW m-2 sr-1 for F125W, F140W, and F160W.</description>

      <title>The Angular Correlation Function as measured by the GLEAM-X Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The angular correlation is a method for measuring the distribution of structure in the Universe, through the statistical properties of the angular distribution of galaxies on the sky. We measure the angular correlation of galaxies from the second data release of the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array eXtended survey (GLEAM-X) survey, a low-frequency radio survey covering declinations below +30 degrees. We find an angular distribution consistent with the LambdaCDM cosmological model assuming the best fitting cosmological parameters from Planck Collaboration et al. (2020). We fit a bias function to the discrete tracers of the underlying matter distribution, finding a bias that evolves with redshift in either a linear or exponential fashion to be a better fit to the data than a constant bias. We perform a covariance analysis to obtain an estimation of the properties of the errors, by analytic, jackknife and sample variance means. Our results are consistent with previous studies on the topic, and also the predictions of the LambdaCDM cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Halo profiles: HR-DEMNUni simulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations, we computed neutrino profiles within virialized dark matter haloes. These new high-resolution simulations allowed us to revisit fitting formulas proposed in the literature and provided updated fitting parameters that extend to less massive haloes and lower neutrino masses than previously in the literature, in accordance with new cosmological limits. The trend we observe for low neutrino masses is that, for dark matter halo masses below $\sim 4\times10^{14}$$h^{-1}M_\odot$, the presence of the core becomes weaker and the profile over the whole radius is closer to a simple power law. We also characterized the neutrino density profile dependence on the solid angle within clustered structures: a forward-backward asymmetry larger than 10% was found when comparing the density profiles from neutrinos along the direction of motion of cold dark matter particles within the same halo. In addition, we looked for neutrino wakes around halo centres produced by the peculiar motion of the halo itself. Our results suggest that the wakes effect is observable in haloes with masses greater than $3\times10^{14}$ $h^{-1}M_\odot$ where a mean displacement of $0.06$\hmpc was found.</description>

      <title>Complex structures of boson stars and anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and explore the complex structures of boson stars, drawing inspiration from similar configurations of non-topological solitons in Minkowski space. These "molecular states" of boson stars have a multipolar structure and both positive and negative Noether charges within one star, and the opposite charges swap with time. Thanks to the gravitational attraction, they exist even in the case of a free scalar field. We also explore the effects of scalar self-interactions on these complex structures. We propose to use galactic-scale charge-swapping boson stars as a potential solution to the problem of the observed anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>Time-convolutionless cosmological master equations: Late-time resummations and decoherence for non-local kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a simple toy model of two scalar fields in de Sitter space, playing the roles of "system" and "environment" degrees of freedom, which interact with each other. We show that there are secular divergences in physically relevant observables which arise solely from the non-Markovian part of the memory kernel, contrary to popular belief that secular growth typically comes from local terms in evolution equations. Nevertheless, we show that these terms can still be non-perturbatively resummed, using the time-convolutionless master equation formalism, which improves upon previous approximations. At the same time, there are other physical quantities in the same model that are dominated by local terms in the memory kernel. Therefore, we conclude that, for cosmological backgrounds, either the dissipation or the noise kernel can end up being dominated by non-local terms depending on the nature of the system-environment coupling.</description>

      <title>Freezing-in Cannibal Dark Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-Interacting Dark Matter models can successfully explain dark matter (DM) production through interactions confined within the dark sector. However, they often lack measurable experimental signals due to their secluded nature. Including a feeble interaction with the visible sector through a Higgs portal leads not only to potential detection avenues and richer thermal production dynamics, but also to a possible explanation of the initial dark sector population through the freeze-in mechanism. In this work we study, by solving the full system of coupled Boltzmann equations for the number densities and temperatures of all the involved states, three scenarios of this type where the DM is: a real scalar with broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$, a complex scalar with unbroken $\mathbb{Z}_3$, and a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ scalar with an additional scalar mediator. All of these models have viable dark matter candidates in a cannibal phase while having different detection profiles. We show that cosmological bounds can be either exacerbated or evaded by changing the dark sector interactions, leading to potential signatures in long-lived particle and indirect detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Theories after GW170817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the inflationary framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories which produce a primordial gravitational wave speed that respects the constraint imposed by the GW170817 event, namely $\left| c_T^2 - 1 \right| &lt; 6 \times 10^{-15}$ in natural units. For these theories in general, the scalar Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $\xi (\phi)$ is arbitrary and unrelated to the scalar potential. We develop the inflationary formalism of this theory, and present analytic forms for the slow-roll indices, the observational indices and the $e$-foldings number, assuming solely a slow-roll era and also that the constraints imposed by the GW170817 event hold true. We present in detail an interesting class of models that produces a viable inflationary era. Finally, we investigate the behavior of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet coupling function during the reheating era, in which case the evolution of the Hubble rate satisfies a constant-roll-like relation $\dot{H}=\delta H^2$. As we show, the behavior of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet coupling during the reheating is different from that of the inflationary era. This is due to the fact that the evolution governing the reheating is different compared to the inflationary era.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Bootstrap of Massive Inflation Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation correlators with massive exchanges are central observables of cosmological collider physics, and are also important theoretical data for us to better understand quantum field theories in dS. However, they are difficult to compute directly due to many technical complications of the Schwinger-Keldysh integral. In this work, we initiate a new bootstrap program for massive inflation correlators with dispersion relations on complex momentum planes. We classify kinematic variables of a correlator into vertex energies and line energies, and develop two distinct types of dispersion relations for both of them, respectively called vertex dispersion and line dispersion relations. These dispersion methods allow us to obtain full analytical results of massive correlators from a knowledge of their oscillatory signals alone, while the oscillatory signal at the tree level can be related to simpler subgraphs via the cutting rule. We further apply this method to massive loop correlators, and obtain new analytical expressions for loop diagrams much simpler than existing results from spectral decomposition. In particular, we show that the analyticity demands the existence of an "irreducible background" in the loop correlator, which is unambiguously defined, free of UV divergence, and independent of renormalization schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12302v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a population of supernovae (SNe) whose peak luminosities are much larger than those of canonical SNe. Although SLSNe were simply defined by their peak luminosity at first, it is currently recognized that they show rich spectroscopic diversities including hydrogen-poor (Type I) and hydrogen-rich (Type II) subtypes. The exact mechanisms making SLSNe luminous are still not fully understood, but there are mainly four major suggested luminosity sources (radioactive decay of 56Ni, circumstellar interaction, magnetar spin-down, and fallback accretion). We provide an overview of observational properties of SLSNe and major theoretical models for them. Future transient surveys are expected to discover SLSNe at high redshifts which will provide a critical information in revealing their nature.</description>

      <title>Forecast Analysis of Astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background beyond general relativity: A Case Study on Brans-Dicke Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity, exemplified by Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, introduces additional scalar polarization modes that contribute scalar radiation alongside tensor modes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of how gravitational wave generation and propagation effects under Brans-Dicke gravity are encoded into the astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (AGWB). We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated coalescing binary systems to generate AGWB mock data with third-generation gravitational wave detectors and conducted a complete Bayesian analysis for the first time. We find the uncertainties in the population properties of binary black holes (BBH) significantly affect the ability to constrain BD gravity. Under the most favorable conditions, the upper limit may suggest $\omega_{\rm BD} &gt; 816$. Furthermore, we explore the detectability of potential scalar backgrounds arising from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, setting upper limits on scalar backgrounds expected to be two orders of magnitude lower than the total background contributed by both BBH and BNS in one year of observational data. We conclude that for ambiguous populations, employing waveform matching with individual sources provides a more robust approach to constrain Brans-Dicke gravity. However, the future detection of a potential scalar background within the AGWB could provide significant support for gravity theories beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Exploring Milky Way rotation curves with Gaia DR3: a comparison between $\Lambda$CDM, MOND, and General Relativistic approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the release of Gaia DR3, we extend the comparison between dynamical models for the Milky Way rotation curve initiated in the previous work. Utilising astrometric and spectro-photometric data for 719143 young disc stars within $|z|&lt;1$ kpc and up to $R \simeq 19$ kpc, we investigate the accuracy of MOND and $\Lambda$CDM frameworks in addition to previously studied models, such as the classical one with a Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo and a general relativistic model. We find that all models, including MOND and $\Lambda$CDM, are statistically equivalent in representing the observed rotational velocities. However, $\Lambda$CDM, characterized by an Einasto density profile and cosmological constraints on its parameters, assigns more dark matter than the model featuring a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, with the virial mass estimated at $1.5\text{-}2.5 \times 10^{12} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$ - a value significantly higher than recent literature estimates. Beyond $10\text{-}15$ kpc, non-Newtonian/non-baryonic contributions to the rotation curve are found to become dominant for all models consistently. Our results suggest the need for further exploration into the role of General Relativity, dark matter, and alternative theories of gravitational dynamics in shaping Milky Way's rotation curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of linear gravitational perturbations on cosmological backgrounds of massive fermionic fields. We observe that, when gravitational and matter action are expanded to quadratic order in gravitational perturbations on cosmological backgrounds, the graviton appears to have an off-shell mass. We derive a consistent set of two equations for the evolution of linear classical and quantum gravitational perturbations on general cosmological backgrounds, and demonstrate that the graviton mass disappears at the level of equations of motion (on-shell). In the case we consider the expansion of the Universe is driven by the one-loop backreaction of fermions, and the dynamical gravitons evolve on the same background. These equations govern the evolution of linear gravitational perturbations on general cosmological matter backgrounds. A concrete one-loop calculation is performed for the simple case of massive Dirac fermions when the temperature of the cosmological fluid changes adiabatically when compared with the expansion rate of the Universe.</description>

Abstract: We construct integrable chiral cosmological models with two scalar fields and potentials represented in terms of hyperbolic functions. Using the conformal transformation of the metric and the corresponding models with induced gravity terms, we obtain the general solutions in the spatially flat, open and closed Friedmann universes and the corresponding integrals of motion. The obtained general solutions can be written in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions of the conformal time.</description>

Abstract: The NEWS-G direct detection experiment uses spherical proportional counters to search for light dark matter candidates. New results from a 10 day physics run with a $135\,\mathrm{cm}$ in diameter spherical proportional counter at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane are reported. The target consists of $114\,\mathrm{g}$ of methane, providing sensitivity to dark matter spin-dependent coupling to protons. New constraints are presented in the mass range $0.17$ to $1.2\,\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$, with a 90% confidence level cross-section upper limit of $30.9\,\mathrm{pb}$ for a mass of $0.76\,\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$.</description>

      <title>A cosmic microwave background search for fine-structure constant evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some extensions of the standard model of particle physics, the values of the fundamental coupling constants vary in space and time. Some observations of quasars hint at time and spatial variation of the fine structure constant $\alpha$. Here, the Bekenstein-Sandvik-Barrow-Magueijo (BSBM) model (which posits the existence of a scalar field driving evolution in the fundamental electric charge $e$) is tested against quasar and Planck satellite cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. In this model, variations in $e$ are coupled to the matter density through a factor $\zeta_{\rm m}/{\omega}$, which is related to electromagnetic contributions to nucleon masses, and {the energy} scale of new physics. Simulations conducted here do not support claims that the electrostatic contribution to $\zeta_{m}$ is completely shielded. Other common approximations used in BSBM field evolution are found to be adequate. Principal components of the CMB data with respect to variations in $\alpha$ are used to obtain constraints of $\zeta_{\rm m}/{\omega}\lesssim 9.3 \times 10^{-9}$ for a massless field. A forecast anticipating the promise of the Simons Observatory (SO) CMB experiment shows that SO will be sensitive to values of $\zeta_{\rm m}/{\omega}\geq 2.2 \times 10^{-9}$.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Long-wavelength Matter Density Fluctuation Modes from the Scalar-Type Clustering Fossils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Revealing the large-scale structure from the 21cm intensity mapping surveys is only possible after the foreground cleaning. However, most current cleaning techniques relying on the smoothness of the foreground spectrum lead to a severe side effect of removing the large-scale structure signal along the line of sight. On the other hand, the clustering fossil, a coherent variation of the small-scale clustering over large scales, allows us to recover the long-wavelength density modes from the off-diagonal correlation between short-wavelength modes. In this paper, we study the requirements for an unbiased and optimal clustering-fossil estimator and show that (A) the estimator is unbiased only when using an accurate bispectrum model for the long-short-short mode coupling and (B) including the connected four-point correlation functions is essential for characterizing the noise power spectrum of the estimated long mode. The clustering fossil estimator based upon the leading-order bispectrum yields an unbiased estimation of the long-wavelength ($k\lesssim 0.01~[h/{\rm Mpc}]$) modes with the cross-correlation coefficient of $0.7$ at redshifts $z=0$ to $3$.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark energy with the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, by now detectable at $\sim 5\sigma$ within the context of $\Lambda{}$CDM cosmologies, to place strong constraints on dynamical dark energy theories. Working within an effective field theory framework for dark energy we find that including ISW constraints from galaxy-CMB cross-correlations significantly strengthens existing large-scale structure constraints, yielding bounds consistent with $\Lambda{}$CDM and approximately reducing the viable parameter space by $\sim 70\%$. This is a direct consequence of ${\cal O}(1)$ changes induced in these cross-correlations by otherwise viable dark energy models, which we discuss in detail. We compute constraints by adapting the $\Lambda{}$CDM ISW likelihood from [1] for dynamical dark energy models using galaxy data from 2MASS, WISE $\times$ SuperCOSMOS, SDSS-DR12, QSOs and NVSS, CMB data from Planck 18, and BAO and RSD large scale structure measurements from BOSS and 6dF. We show constraints both in terms of EFT-inspired $\alpha_i$ and phenomenological $\mu/\Sigma$ parametrisations. Furthermore we discuss the approximations involved and related aspects of bias modelling in detail and highlight what these constraints imply for the underlying dark energy theories.</description>

      <title>Negative cosmological constant in the dark energy sector: tests from JWST photometric and spectroscopic observations of high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed the existence of an unexpectedly large abundance of extremely massive galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 5$: these observations are in tension with the predictions not only of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, but also with those of a wide class of dynamical dark energy (DE) models, and are generally in better agreement with models characterized by a phantom behaviour. Here we consider a model, inspired by string theory and the ubiquity of anti-de Sitter vacua therein, featuring an evolving DE component with positive energy density on top of a negative cosmological constant, argued in an earlier exploratory analysis to potentially be able to explain the JWST observations. We perform a robust comparison of this model against JWST data, considering both photometric observations from the CEERS program, and spectroscopic observations from the FRESCO survey. We show that the model is able to accommodate the JWST observations, with a consistency probability of up to $98\%$, even in the presence of an evolving component with a quintessence-like behaviour (easier to accommodate theoretically compared to phantom DE), while remaining consistent with standard low-redshift probes. Our results showcase the tremendous potential of measurements of high-redshift galaxy abundances in tests of fundamental physics, and their valuable complementarity with standard cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>An analysis of parameter compression and full-modeling techniques with Velocileptors for DESI 2024 and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In anticipation of forthcoming data releases of current and future spectroscopic surveys, we present the validation tests and analysis of systematic effects within \texttt{velocileptors} modeling pipeline when fitting mock data from the \texttt{AbacusSummit} N-body simulations. We compare the constraints obtained from parameter compression methods to the direct fitting (Full-Modeling) approaches of modeling the galaxy power spectra, and show that the ShapeFit extension to the traditional template method is consistent with the Full-Modeling method within the standard $\Lambda$CDM parameter space. We show the dependence on scale cuts when fitting the different redshift bins using the ShapeFit and Full-Modeling methods. We test the ability to jointly fit data from multiple redshift bins as well as joint analysis of the pre-reconstruction power spectrum with the post-reconstruction BAO correlation function signal. We further demonstrate the behavior of the model when opening up the parameter space beyond $\Lambda$CDM and also when combining likelihoods with external datasets, namely the Planck CMB priors. Finally, we describe different parametrization options for the galaxy bias, counterterm, and stochastic parameters, and employ the halo model in order to physically motivate suitable priors that are necessary to ensure the stability of the perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>The Population II Extragalactic Distance Scale: A TRGB Distance to the Fornax Cluster with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differences between the local value of the Hubble constant measured via the distance ladder versus the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background with the assumption of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model have reached over 5$\sigma$ significance. To determine if this discrepancy is due to new physics or more mundane systematic errors, it is essential to remove as many sources of systematic uncertainty as possible by developing high-precision distance ladders that are independent of the traditional Cepheid and Type Ia supernovae route. Here we present JWST observations of three early-type Fornax Cluster galaxies, the first of fourteen observations from a Cycle 2 JWST program. Our modest integration times allow us to measure highly precise tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances, and will also be used to perform measurements of Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF). From these three galaxies, we determine an average TRGB distance modulus to the Fornax Cluster of $\mu$ = 31.424 $\pm$ 0.077 mag, or D = 19.3 $\pm$ 0.7 Mpc. With eleven more scheduled observations in nearby elliptical galaxies, our program will allow us set the zero point of the SBF scale to better than 2$\%$ for more distant measurements, charting a path towards a high-precision measurement of $H_{0}$ that is independent of the traditional Cepheid-SN Ia distance ladder.</description>

      <title>When to interfere with dark matter? The impact of wave dynamics on statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight candidates for dark matter can present wavelike features on astrophysical scales. Full wave based simulations of such candidates are currently limited to box sizes of 1--10 Mpc/$h$ on a side, limiting our understanding of the impact of wave dynamics on the scale of the cosmic web. We present a statistical analysis of density fields produced by perturbative forward models in boxes of 128 Mpc/$h$ side length. Our wave-based perturbation theory maintains interference on all scales, and is compared to fluid dynamics of Lagrangian perturbation theory. The impact of suppressed power in the initial conditions and interference effects caused by wave dynamics can then be disentangled. We find that changing the initial conditions captures most of the change in one-point statistics such as the skewness of the density field. However, different environments of the cosmic web, quantified by critical points of the smoothed density, appear to be more sensitive to interference effects sourced by the quantum potential. This suggests that certain large-scale summary statistics may need additional care when studying cosmologies with wavelike dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Perturbation Theory in Metric-Affine Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate cosmological perturbation theory around the spatially curved FLRW background in the context of metric-affine gauge theory of gravity which includes torsion and nonmetricity. Performing scalar-vector-tensor decomposition of the spatial perturbations, we find that the theory displays a rich perturbation spectrum with helicities 0, 1, 2 and 3, on top of the usual scalar, vector and tensor metric perturbations arising from Riemannian geometry. Accordingly, the theory provides a diverse phenomenology, e.g. the helicity-2 modes of the torsion and/or nonmetricity tensors source helicity-2 metric tensor perturbation at the linear level leading to the production of gravitational waves. As an immediate application, we study linear perturbation of the nonmetricity helicity-3 modes for a general parity-preserving action of metric-affine gravity which includes quadratic terms in curvature, torsion, and nonmetricity. We then find the conditions to avoid possible instabilities in the helicity-3 modes of the spin-3 field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant, $H_0$, tension is the tension among the local probes, Supernovae Ia, and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. It has been almost a decade, and this tension still puzzles the community. Here, we add intermediate redshift probes, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) and Quasars (QS0s), to check if and to what extent these higher redshift probes can reduce this tension. We use the three-dimensional fundamental plane relation among the prompt peak luminosity, the luminosity at the end of the plateau emission, and its rest frame duration. We find similar trend in GRB intrinsic parameters as previously seen in Pantheon-Plus intrinsic parameters. We find an apparent $3.14\sigma$ tension for the GRB intrinsic parameter $b$. Indeed, this tension disappears and the parameters are actually compatible within $2.26\sigma$. Another interesting point is that the 3D relation plays an important role in conjunction with Supernovae data with Pantheon Plus and that this apparent discrepancy show how it is important the correction for selection biases and redshift evolution. The incorporation of redshift evolution correction results in a reduction of the GRB tension to $2.26\sigma$ when adjusting correction parameters. We envision that with more data this indication of tension will possibly disappear when the evolutionary parameters of GRBs are computed with increased precision.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling relation incorporating the cusp-to-core transition of dark matter haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark matter haloes associated with galaxies have hitherto established strong correlations within a range of observed parameters, known as scaling relations of dark matter haloes. The origin of these scaling relations still contains significant ambiguities and requires comprehensive exploration for complete understanding. Utilising the correlation between the concentration and mass of dark matter haloes inferred from cosmological $N$-body simulations based on the cold dark matter paradigm ($c$-$M$ relation), we derive theoretical scaling relations among other physical quantities such as the surface mass density, the maximum circular velocity, and the scale radius of the dark matter halo. By comparing theoretical and observed scaling relations at various mass scales, it is found that the scaling relations observed in dwarf galaxies and galaxies originate in the $c$-$M$ relation of the dark matter halo. We predict that this theoretical scaling relation is also established in galaxy clusters. Moreover, we propose a novel theoretical scaling relation that incorporates the effects of the cusp-to-core transition, which is supposed to occur in cold dark matter haloes. Our discussion concludes with the exploration of potential observational verification of the cusp-to-core transition process in dark matter haloes.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Black Hole Mass at Solar Metallicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the current knowledge and uncertainties in detailed stellar evolution and wind modelling to evaluate the mass of the most massive stellar black hole (BH) at solar metallicity. Contrary to common expectations that it is the most massive stars that produce the most massive BHs, we find that the maximum $M_{\rm BH}^{\rm Max} \simeq 30 \pm 10\,M_{\odot}$ is found in the canonical intermediate range between $M_{\rm ZAMS} \simeq 30$ and $50\,M_{\odot}$ instead. The prime reason for this seemingly counter-intuitive finding is that very massive stars (VMS) have increasingly high mass-loss rates, leading to substantial mass evaporation before they expire as stars, ending as lighter BHs than their canonical O-star counterparts.</description>
