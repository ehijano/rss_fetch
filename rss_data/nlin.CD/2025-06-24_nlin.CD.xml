      <title>Stability Analysis of Three Coupled Kerr Oscillators: Implications for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the classical dynamics of optical nonlinear Kerr couplers, focusing on their potential relevance to quantum computing applications. The system consists of three Kerr-type nonlinear oscillators arranged in two configurations: a triangular arrangement, where each oscillator is coupled to the others, and a sandwich arrangement, where only the middle oscillator interacts with the two outer ones. The system is driven by an external periodic field and includes dissipative processes. Its evolution is governed by six non-autonomous differential equations derived from a Kerr Hamiltonian with nonlinear coupling terms. We show that even for identical Kerr media, the interplay between nonlinear couplings and mismatched fundamental and pump frequencies leads to rich and complex dynamics, including the emergence of multiple stable attractors. These attractors are highly sensitive to both the coupling configuration and initial conditions. A key contribution of this work is a detailed stability analysis based on the numerical calculation of Lyapunov exponents, which reveals transitions from regular to chaotic dynamics as damping is reduced. We identify critical damping thresholds for the onset of chaos and characterize phenomena such as chaotic beats. These results offer insights for potential experimental realizations and are directly relevant to emerging quantum technologies, where Kerr parametric oscillators play a central role in quantum gates, error correction protocols, and quantum neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>On the reconstruction map in JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An open question in AdS/CFT is how to reconstruct semiclassical bulk operators precisely enough that non-perturbative quantum effects can be computed. We propose a set of physically-motivated requirements for such a reconstruction map, and explicitly construct a map satisfying these requirements in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity. Our map is found by canonically quantizing "action-angle" variables for JT gravity, which are chosen to ensure that the spectrum of the fundamental quantum theory matches known results from the gravitational path integral. We then study unitary quantum dynamics in this theory, and obtain analytical predictions for the dynamics of the wormhole length, including its quantum fluctuations, leveraging techniques from quantum ergodicity theory. Level repulsion in the non-perturbative JT spectrum implies that the average wormhole length is non-monotonic in time, that fluctuations in wormhole length are non-perturbatively suppressed until nearly the Heisenberg time, and that the late-time-evolved Hartle-Hawking state has a heavy-tailed distribution of lengths. We discuss the implications of our results for the "complexity = volume" conjecture.</description>

      <title>Beyond Static Models: Hypernetworks for Adaptive and Generalizable Forecasting in Complex Parametric Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks (PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal amplification toward chaos in a chain of Duffing oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A chain of harmonic oscillators with nonreciprocal coupling exhibits characteristic amplification behavior that serves as a classical analog of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). We extend this concept of nonreciprocal amplification to nonlinear dynamics by employing double-well Duffing oscillators arranged in ring-structured units. The addition of units induces bifurcations of attractors, driving transitions from limit cycles to tori, chaos, and hyper-chaos. Unidirectional couplings between units enable the decomposition of attractors in phase space into projected subspaces corresponding to each unit. In the chaotic regime, amplitude saturation emerges, characterized by monotonically decreasing amplitudes within a unit -- in sharp contrast to} the increasing profiles seen in the linear NHSE. This work uncovers novel bifurcation behavior resulting from the intricate interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Holographic deep thermalization for secure and efficient quantum random state generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomness is a cornerstone of science, underpinning fields such as statistics, information theory, dynamical systems, and thermodynamics. In quantum science, quantum randomness, especially random pure states, plays a pivotal role in fundamental questions like black hole physics and quantum complexity, as well as in practical applications such as quantum device benchmarking and quantum advantage certification. The conventional approach for generating genuine random states, called `deep thermalization', faces significant challenges, including scalability issues due to the need for a large ancilla system and susceptibility to attacks, as demonstrated in this work. We introduce holographic deep thermalization, a secure and hardware-efficient quantum random state generator. By adopting a sequential application of a scrambling-measure-reset process, it continuously trades space with time, and substantially reduces the required ancilla size to as small as a system-size independent constant; At the same time, it guarantees security by removing quantum correlation between the data system and attackers. Thanks to the resource reduction, our circuit-based implementation on IBM Quantum devices achieves genuine $5$-qubit random state generation utilizing only a total of $8$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optimals and their role in sustaining turbulence in channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the energy transfer from the mean profile to velocity fluctuations in channel flow by calculating nonlinear optimal disturbances,i.e. the initial condition of a given finite energy that achieves the highest possible energy growth during a given fixed time horizon. It is found that for a large range of time horizons and initial disturbance energies, the nonlinear optimal exhibits streak spacing and amplitude consistent with DNS at least at Re_tau = 180, which suggests that they isolate the relevant physical mechanisms that sustain turbulence. Moreover, the time horizon necessary for a nonlinear disturbance to outperform a linear optimal is consistent with previous DNS-based estimates using eddy turnover time, which offers a new perspective on how some turbulent time scales are determined.</description>
