      <title>Variations of two-neutron separation energies and thermal-neutron capture cross sections versus the pairing gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the experimental correlation between the pairing gap values and two important observables in the study of nuclear structure (two neutron separation energies and thermal-neutron capture cross-sections). To this aim, we focused on the even-even nuclei in the vicinity of Z=50 and Z = 82 closed proton shells, for which the quantum phase transition phenomena are reported. The results show a significant correlation between the pairing gap and the well-known signatures of quantum phase transitions in the nuclei, which are the candidates for E(5) and X(5) critical points. Also, we have explained the special relation between the pairing gap and the cross-section of thermal neutrons in the considered isotopic chains.</description>

      <title>Emergence of thermal recoil jets in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the established paradigm of jet quenching in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, jets from initial hard parton scatterings are suppressed due to their interaction with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) as they traverse the hot medium, serving as crucial tomographic probes of QGP properties. The QGP is also capable of absorbing and reprocessing energy deposited by the hard jets into emergent jet-like objects, providing a novel production mechanism of thermal recoil jets. These emergent thermal recoil jets exhibit distinct transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) and jet-size ($R$) dependencies different from the hard jets, and naturally explain the puzzling observation of the enhanced yields of hadron or photon triggered jets at large azimuthal angle and solely at small $p_\mathrm{T}$ and large $R$. These thermal recoil jets are predicted to have unique substructures, such as their jet shape that increases with the radius and the thermal-like distribution of their constituents, which can be verified in future experimental analyses.</description>

      <title>Single-step Quantum Simulation of Two Nucleons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a scalable approach to solving the nuclear shell model, a highly complex and exponentially scaled many-body problem. This work presents a numerical simulation of the subspace search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE) combined with an adaptive derivative-assembles pseudo-trotter (ADAPT) ansatz to obtain the low-lying states of any nuclear system in a single optimization run. As an example, we apply this method in this work to a trivial identical nucleon system, two nucleons in the $0p_{3/2}$ orbital, mapped to 4 qubits depicting m-scheme single-particle states including a surface delta effective interaction using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The ADAPT-SSVQE algorithm, by utilizing a symmetry-preserving double-excitation ADAPT operator pool, uniquely optimizes a weighted energy sum, forcing the simultaneous convergence of two lowest states within the total angular momentum $M_J=0$ subspace. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by benchmarking against the exact diagonalization, confirming its potential for probing nuclear structure and pairing phenomena on current and near-future quantum devices without requiring multi-step procedure for excited states.</description>

      <title>$n\alpha$ Elastic Scattering: An Application of Variable Phase Approach to Local Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distance-dependent phase shifts, amplitude functions, and radial wave functions for neutron-alpha elastic scattering are studied using the Variable Phase Approach. The microscopic KKNN potential is employed to calculate scattering properties for the $S_{1/2}$, $P_{3/2}$, and $P_{1/2}$ partial waves over a range of laboratory energies. The variable phase equations are solved numerically using a fifth-order Runge-Kutta method, allowing a direct examination of how the nuclear interaction generates the scattering phase within the finite interaction region. The results exhibit physically consistent behavior of the phase shifts and yield well-behaved amplitude and wave functions. This study demonstrates that the Variable Phase Approach provides a physically transparent and reliable framework for describing neutron-alpha elastic scattering and for applications in inverse scattering problems.</description>

      <title>Perturbative EFT calculation of the deuteron longitudinal response function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the longitudinal response function of the deuteron up to next-to-next-to-leading order in chiral effective field theory (Chiral EFT). We use an approach that maintains exact renormalization group (RG) invariance at each order of the EFT expansion by treating all subleading corrections in perturbation theory. To that end, we extent the Lorentz Integral Transform (LIT) method to allow for such a perturbative treatment. In doing so, we further develop the existing work on strictly RG invariant Chiral EFT, which has so far focused primarily on binding energies and static properties, to inelastic processes. We carefully analyze the convergence properties of the theory and find good agreement with available experimental data. Our findings provide the foundation for similar studies of inelastic processes in a range of nuclei, based on perturbatively renormalized EFT schemes.</description>

      <title>Local Quantum Friction with Pairing: Unitary Dissipation in Large Fermi Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unitary framework for dissipative quantum dynamics that can be efficiently applied to large-scale Fermi systems. The method introduces local Hermitian operators that emulate frictional forces while strictly preserving the unitarity of time evolution. Unlike approaches based on the Lindblad equation, our formulation scales favorably with system size and can be seamlessly integrated into time-dependent density functional theory frameworks. We demonstrate that energy dissipation arises from the damping of particle currents and pairing-field fluctuations. Furthermore, we develop a variant of the scheme that allows the particle number to vary in time, enabling controlled density scans. The method is generic and versatile, as illustrated by applications to spin-imbalanced unitary Fermi gases and to nuclear matter in the neutron-star crust. The framework can be naturally extended to include stochastic noise, providing a foundation for studying fluctuation-dissipation dynamics and thermalization in strongly interacting Fermi superfluids.</description>

      <title>Shell model study of isobaric analog states for $T_z= \pm 2$ nuclei using isospin non-conserving interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to comprehend the process underlying mirror energy differences in mirror pairs, we have performed shell-model calculations for $T_z= \pm 2$ $sd$-shell nuclei in the mass range $A$= 20 to 36 and neutron number varying from $N$= 8 to 20. Isospin-symmetry breaking (ISB) is responsible for the mirror energy difference of excited states. We have investigated the {\color{black}isospin non-conserving} interactions: USDC and USDCm to explore the low-lying energy spectra, mirror energy differences, isoscalar ($M_0$), isovector ($M_1$) matrix elements, \textit{E2} transition probability, magnetic ($\mu$), and quadrupole moments ($Q$) of mirror-pair and compared them with their available experimental data. The impact of single-particle states on weakly bound and unbound nuclear states are investigated, especially those of the $s$-wave. We have also analyzed single proton/neutron separation energies and proton/neutron occupancy for ($T_z$=-2)/($T_z$=+2) $sd$-shell nuclei.</description>

      <title>Jet momentum reconstruction in the QGP background with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06466v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a Dense Neural Network (DNN) approach to reconstruct jet momentum within a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) background, using simulated data from PYTHIA and Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) Models for comparative analysis. We find that medium response particles from the LBT simulation, scattered out of the QGP background but belonging to medium-modified jets, lead to oversubtraction of the background if the DNN model is trained on vacuum jets from PYTHIA simulation. By training the DNN model on quenched jets generated using LBT or the combination of jet samples from PYTHIA and LBT, we significantly reduce this prediction bias and achieve more accurate background subtraction compared to conventional Area-based and Constituent Subtraction methods widely adopted in experimental measurements. We further study the performance of these machine learning models on evaluating the nuclear modification factor of jets, and find that while the unfolding procedure is necessary for correcting residuals in reconstructed jet momenta, models trained on samples incorporating quenched jets still achieve superior accuracy than those trained on vacuum jets even after unfolding.</description>

      <title>Dynamical study of hidden-strange pentaquarks as analogs of the hidden-charm states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent BESIII experiment~\cite{BESIII:2024muk} searching for hidden-strange exotic hadrons, we perform a systematic theoretical study of the hidden-strange pentaquark system within the framework of the quark delocalization color screening model (QDCSM) and the resonating group method (RGM). Our results demonstrate that the channel coupling effect plays a decisive role in the formation of bound and resonance states. It not only significantly enhances the short-range attraction but also induces essential attractive contributions from pion exchange. We predict three bound states with masses of $1759$ MeV, $2000$ MeV, and $2407$ MeV. Furthermore, we report the existence of a hidden-strange pentaquark resonance state, $\Xi K^{\ast}$, with quantum numbers $I(J^{P})=0(1/2^{-})$. This resonance is identified in the $S$-wave scattering phase shifts of the $\Lambda\eta_{s}$ and $\Lambda \phi$ open channels, with a predicted mass in the range of $2204\text{--}2208$ MeV. By accounting for both the scattering width from channel coupling and the intrinsic decay width of the constituent $K^{\ast}$, the total decay width is estimated to be $55\text{--}63$ MeV. These theoretical predictions provide important guidance for future experimental searches for such exotic states at facilities like BESIII.</description>

      <title>From DGLAP to Sudakov: Precision Predictions for Energy-Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlations in the distribution of energy produced in collider experiments provide a snapshot of the microscopic dynamics of QCD, and its evolution from asymptotically free quarks and gluons, to confined hadrons. There has recently been considerable progress in the interpretation and precision calculation of these correlations, using a specific class of observables called energy correlators (EECs). These observables are most cleanly studied in $e^+e^-$ collisions, where they can be measured over their full angular range. Of particular interest are kinematic limits of the correlator, both collinear, and back-to-back, where the correlator exhibits scaling behaviors governed by specific operators in QCD. Resolving these scalings requires measurements with exceptional angular resolution, which can be achieved by performing measurements on tracks (charged particles). In this paper we perform the first calculation of the track-based EEC over its entire kinematic range, achieving a record precision of of NNLL (collinear) + NNLO (fixed order) + NNNNLL (back-to-back) for the track-based EEC, and additionally incorporate the leading non-perturbative corrections and their resummation, including the Collins-Soper kernel computed using lattice QCD. We describe the breadth of physics probed by this observable, and highlight the impact of different components of our factorization theorem on the final distribution. Combined with recent measurements of the track-based EEC with archival LEP data, our calculation initiates the precision study of track-based observables at LEP, which will lead to new insights into the dynamics of QCD, and the precision extraction of its underlying parameters.</description>

      <title>Directional dead-cone effect in QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the propagation of heavy quarks through a dense, hydrodynamically flowing QCD medium, representative of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Working in the high-energy limit, we identify two novel mass-dependent effects arising from the heavy quark coupling to the local medium flow. The first is the emergence of a tensorial jet transport coefficient, $\hat{q}_{ij}$, which encodes the directional structure of transverse-momentum broadening. The second, named the directional dead-cone effect, corresponds to an anisotropic suppression of medium-induced radiation aligned with the hydrodynamic flow. We discuss how these effects manifest in jet observables and identify distinctive signature of heavy quark dynamics in an evolving medium.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group Evolution for In-medium Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles analysis of the renormalization group (RG) evolution of the two-point energy-energy correlator (EEC) in light-quark and gluon jets propagating through nuclear matter. Our work focuses on the analytic structure of the RG equations in the thin-medium regime, highlighting how collinear emissions in the presence of a dense QCD medium reshape the EEC observables. We work in the opacity expansion of the SCET$_{\rm G}$ formalism, where the propagating quarks and gluons interact with the medium via Glauber gluon exchanges. We compute the corresponding one-loop jet functions using the medium-induced splitting kernels at first order in opacity and perform resummation at leading logarithmic (LL) order. In particular, we identify an experimentally accessible regime of jet energies and EEC angles where one can directly investigate the medium-induced scale evolution and extract the corresponding opacity-one correction to the anomalous dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically, using the method of regions, the Coulomb-logarithmic enhancement regulated by plasma screening for EEC. We compare our theoretical predictions with experimental data in $p$-Pb collisions and make projections for O-O collisions to test whether energy correlators could serve as sensitive probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) dynamics in small collision systems, offering a robust and model-independent avenue for constraining jet evolution in QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Dispersion Spectra across Lorentz boosted frames: Spurious modes and the enigma of causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of linearized perturbations in relativistic field theories involving derivative corrections frequently leads to pathologies that, although generic, may not always be manifest, like in a local rest frame scenario. Hence, analyzing such theories conclusively in a more general state of equilibrium, like in a Lorentz boosted inertial frame, is imperative, albeit extracting the boosted modes could be quite nontrivial. Motivated by this problem, in this study, we develop a general framework for deriving the dispersion spectra in Lorentz-boosted inertial frames solely from the information of the local rest frame dispersion coefficients. Apart from the well-behaved modes, which are observed to follow an exact mapping across the boost, we show that in some cases, unphysical ``spurious" modes might turn up, which diverge at zero boost limit and thus lack any rest-frame analogue. Finally, we investigate the conflict between the existence of these spurious modes and the causality for a given relativistic theory. The key developments provided here are (i) a convenient way for obtaining the dispersion spectra across inertial frames, bypassing the traditional method of solving the boosted polynomial, and (ii) exploring the direct connection between the mode conservation and the causality of a theory with detailed proof. Due to the general approach, these results can find direct applications for a range of other effective theory formulations, like gauge theory plasmas, strongly coupled systems, and heavy quark effective theory.</description>

      <title>Sign Reversal of Boer-Mulders Functions from Semi-inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering to the Drell-Yan Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A striking prediction of QCD on the properties of the novel Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) distribution functions is that the time-reversal odd Sivers and Boer-Mulders functions extracted from semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) will undergo a sign reversal in the Drell-Yan (DY) process. This prediction has been tested by experiments that have focused on the Sivers functions so far. We examine the current status on the theoretical prediction and experimental extraction of the signs of the Boer-Mulders functions from SIDIS and DY. We show that the existing SIDIS and DY data are consistent with the predicted sign reversal of the Boer-Mulders functions for proton's valence quark distribution. Prospects for future experiments at EIC capable of testing the sign reversal of the pion Boer-Mulders functions are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose the analysis of the heavy quark photoproduction associated with a leading neutron in hadronic collisions at the LHC as an alternative to probe the pion gluon distribution in a kinematical range not covered by previous experiments. We perform an exploratory study of the charm and bottom photoproduction associated with a leading neutron in proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-lead ($pPb$) collisions, and present calculations for the rapidity distributions and cross-sections. Our predictions indicate that experimental studies of these processes are feasible, and that a future measurement of this final state will be useful to constrain the pion gluon distribution at small values of the Bjorken $x$ variable and to improve our understanding of the pion structure.</description>

      <title>Effects of mean-field momentum dependence on pion production in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>

Abstract: Pion production in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies provides an important probe of the collision dynamics and nuclear matter equation of state, especially the high-density behavior of the symmetry energy. Using the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model with a recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the so-called N$5$LO Skyrme pseudopotential, we investigate the effects of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials on the pion production in Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of $1.23$~GeV/nucleon. We find that a stronger momentum dependence, for which the nucleon mean-field potentials increase faster with momentum, generally suppresses pion production. This feature can be understood in terms of the mean-field-induced modification of nucleon high-momentum phase space during the compression stage: a stronger momentum dependence can reduce the relative fraction of high-momentum nucleons in heavy-ion collisions, thereby suppressing the production of $\Delta$ resonances and pions.</description>

      <title>Regulator constraints for the perturbative renormalizability of attractive triplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear effective field theory organizes the calculation of observables as a power series in terms of the ratio of soft and hard momentum scales. The rigorous implementation of this idea requires a mixture of perturbative and non-perturbative methods: on the one hand, nuclei are bound states that require the iteration of part of the nuclear potential, while on the other corrections that are small in the aforementioned power series should be perturbative in principle. Recently, it has been noted that these corrections are not cutoff independent as there are a set of exceptional cutoffs for which the couplings cannot be determined, as exemplified with the subleading order $^3P_0$ phase shifts in two-nucleon scattering. Yet, here it is shown by means of concrete calculations that exceptional cutoffs are a regulator-dependent feature. There exists a well-defined limit when the cutoff is removed, which implies that not every regulator choice (understood not only as the regulator itself, but in tandem with renormalization conditions) is acceptable within the effective field theory framework. The practical implications are minor, though: except if one is trying to explicitly probe the cutoff independence of the theory, most sensible regulator and cutoff choices are compatible with the renormalized limit within truncation errors.</description>

      <title>Spinor Representations for Fields with any Spin: Lorentz Tensor Basis for Operators and Covariant Multipole Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses a framework to parametrize and decompose operator matrix elements for particles with higher spin $(j &gt; 1/2)$ using chiral representations of the Lorentz group, i.e. the $(j,0)$ and $(0,j)$ representations and their parity-invariant direct sum. Unlike traditional approaches that require imposing constraints to eliminate spurious degrees of freedom, these chiral representations contain exactly the $2j+1$ components needed to describe a spin-$j$ particle. The central objects in the construction are the $t$-tensors, which are generalizations of the Pauli four-vector $\sigma^\mu$ for higher spin. For the generalized spinors of these representations, we demonstrate how the algebra of the $t$-tensors allows to formulate a generalization of the Dirac matrix basis for any spin. For on-shell bilinears, we show that a set consisting exclusively of covariant multipoles of order $0\leq m \leq 2j$ forms a complete basis. We provide explicit expressions for all bilinears of the generalized Dirac matrix basis, which are valid for any spin value. As a byproduct of our derivations we present an efficient algorithm to compute the $t$-tensor matrix elements. The formalism presented here paves the way to use a more unified approach to analyze the non-perturbative QCD structure of hadrons and nuclei across different spin values, with clear physical interpretation of the resulting distributions as covariant multipoles.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression, Quantum Statistics and Symmetries in Spin-3/2 Baryon Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics and enhanced symmetries in the non-relativistic $S$-wave scattering involving the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the $\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles, we identify an enhanced $\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the Identity gate.</description>

      <title>Hyperon spin correlation in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental data show an unexpectedly large spin alignment of $\phi$ mesons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, which can be explained by short-distance fluctuations of strong-force fields (vector $\phi$ fields) within the constituent-quark model. We calculate the hyperon spin correlations within the same model, taking into account hydrodynamic effects and a $\phi$ field fluctuating in space-time according to a Gaussian distribution. The $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ spin correlation induced by the $\phi$ field is shown to be negative as opposed to that of $\Lambda\Lambda$ or $\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$. We thus propose a new net spin-correlation observable as a sensitive probe to separate strong-force effects from hydrodynamic ones. With the strength of the field fluctuations extracted from the observed $\phi$ spin alignment, we predict the collision-energy dependence of the hyperon spin correlations and also investigate the dependence of the net spin correlation on azimuthal-angle and rapidity difference.</description>

Abstract: An exploratory study of the exclusive production of a vector - toponium $\psi_t$ state by photon - hadron interactions is performed considering proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC) energies. The scattering amplitude is calculated using the $k_T$ - factorization formalism assuming that the vector - toponium state can be described by a Gaussian light-cone wave function and considering different models for the unintegrated gluon distribution. Predictions for the rapidity distributions and total cross - sections are presented. Our results indicate that the experimental measurement of this final state will be very difficult for the expected integrated luminosities at the LHC and FCC.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin polarization from $\rho$ meson condensation in rotating hadronic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of vector mesons in extreme environments provides a unique probe of non-perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. We investigate the conditions for Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of spin-1 $\rho$ mesons in dense rotating hadronic matter, a regime relevant to the peripheral heavy-ion collisions and the interiors of rapidly rotating neutron stars. When the $\rho$ meson chemical potential ($\mu_\rho$) approaches its effective mass ($m_\rho^*$), a phase transition to BEC occurs. We demonstrate that this transition is non-trivially influenced by global rotation, which couples to the spin of the $\rho$ mesons, leading to a macroscopic spin alignment of the condensate along the axis of rotation. This interplay between condensation and rotation results in distinct polarization patterns, which can serve as a possible signature of a BEC in experiments. The results suggest that rapidly rotating neutron stars may harbor an anisotropic, spin-polarized $\rho$-condensed phase, which could impact their equation of state.</description>

      <title>Equation-of-state-informed pulse profile modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NICER has enabled mass-radius inferences for pulsars using pulse profile modeling (PPM), providing constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of cold, dense matter. To date, PPM and EOS inference have been carried out as two separate steps, with the former using EOS-agnostic priors. This approach has several drawbacks. Ideally, one would perform a fully hierarchical Bayesian inference where the pulse profile and EOS model parameters are jointly fit, but implementing such a framework is complex and computationally demanding. Here, we present an intermediate solution introducing an EOS-informed prior on mass-radius into the existing PPM pipeline using normalizing flows. By focusing on the parameter space consistent with certain EOSs, this approach both tightens constraints on neutron star parameters while reducing computational costs and requiring minimal additional implementation effort. We test this approach on two pulsars, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715, and with two EOS model families: a model based on the speed of sound inside the neutron star interior (CS) and a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model. Both EOS models implement constraints from chiral effective field theory calculations of dense matter. For both pulsar datasets, the inferred radius credible intervals are narrower than in the EOS-agnostic case, with CS favoring smaller radii and PP favoring larger radii. For PSR J0437-4715, the EOS-informed priors reveal a new, more extreme geometric mode that is statistically favored but physically questionable. Including the PPM posteriors in the subsequent EOS inference further tightens the mass-radius posteriors through the chiral effective field theory constraints. However, there is also a sensitivity to the high-density extensions, where the PP (CS) model produces a shift towards larger (smaller) radii and corresponding stiffening (softening) of the pressure-energy density relation.</description>

      <title>Inclusive $J/\psi$ productions in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 5.02, 7, and 13 TeV with the PACIAE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive $J/\psi$ production in proton-proton (pp) collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$, 7, and 13 TeV using the PACIAE 4.0 model. This model extends PYTHIA 8.3 by incorporating partonic and hadronic rescatterings before and after hadronization, respectively. Compared to our earlier study [K.-F. Ye et al., Phys. Rev. C 109, 035201 (2024)], which considered only the color-singlet processes, the present work includes both the color-singlet and color-octet contributions within the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework. In addition to NRQCD, we also consider the contributions from the cluster collapse and weak decays of $b$-hadrons. We find that the simulated inclusive $J/\psi$ transverse momentum differential cross sections agree well with the experimental data at both the middle and forward rapidities. We provide a quantitative analysis of the relative contributions for different production mechanisms and their energy and rapidity dependence in the inclusive $J/\psi$ production. Furthermore, we offer a quantification of the relative contributions of the various components and their energy and rapidity dependence in the NRQCD channels, including the direct production via the hard scattering and the feed-down from the decays of heavier charmonium states such as $\psi(2S)$, $\chi_{c0}$, $\chi_{c1}$, and $\chi_{c2}$. Finally, we examine the effects of partonic and hadronic rescatterings and offer the quantitative estimate of their impact on the $J/\psi$ production. These results are entirely new and represent a significant step forward in understanding the mechanisms of the inclusive $J/\psi$ production in high-energy pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Projected Density Matrix Sampling for Lattice Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $\beta$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $\beta$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.</description>
