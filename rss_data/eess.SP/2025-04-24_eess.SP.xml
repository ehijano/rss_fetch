      <title>A CNN-based Local-Global Self-Attention via Averaged Window Embeddings for Hierarchical ECG Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of global mortality, emphasizing the critical need for efficient diagnostic tools such as electrocardiograms (ECGs). Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly transformers, have revolutionized ECG analysis by capturing detailed waveform features as well as global rhythm patterns. However, traditional transformers struggle to effectively capture local morphological features that are critical for accurate ECG interpretation. We propose a novel Local-Global Attention ECG model (LGA-ECG) to address this limitation, integrating convolutional inductive biases with global self-attention mechanisms. Our approach extracts queries by averaging embeddings obtained from overlapping convolutional windows, enabling fine-grained morphological analysis, while simultaneously modeling global context through attention to keys and values derived from the entire sequence. Experiments conducted on the CODE-15 dataset demonstrate that LGA-ECG outperforms state-of-the-art models and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the local-global attention strategy. By capturing the hierarchical temporal dependencies and morphological patterns in ECG signals, this new design showcases its potential for clinical deployment with robust automated ECG classification.</description>

      <title>SeizureFormer: A Transformer Model for IEA-Based Seizure Risk Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16098v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SeizureFormer, a Transformer-based model for long-term seizure risk forecasting using interictal epileptiform activity (IEA) surrogate biomarkers and long episode (LE) biomarkers from responsive neurostimulation (RNS) systems. Unlike raw scalp EEG-based models, SeizureFormer leverages structured, clinically relevant features and integrates CNN-based patch embedding, multi-head self-attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks to model both short-term dynamics and long-term seizure cycles. Tested across five patients and multiple prediction windows (1 to 14 days), SeizureFormer achieved state-of-the-art performance with mean ROC AUC of 79.44 percent and mean PR AUC of 76.29 percent. Compared to statistical, machine learning, and deep learning baselines, it demonstrates enhanced generalizability and seizure risk forecasting performance under class imbalance. This work supports future clinical integration of interpretable and robust seizure forecasting tools for personalized epilepsy management.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming for Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) have been proposed as a revolutionary flexible antenna technology which facilitates line-of-sight links via numerous low-cost pinching antennas with adjustable activation positions over waveguides. This letter proposes a two-timescale joint transmit and pinching beamforming design for the maximization of sum rate of a PASS-based downlink multi-user multiple input single output system. A primal dual decomposition method is developed to decouple the two-timescale problem into two sub-problems: 1) A Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-guided dual learning-based approach is proposed to solve the short-term transmit beamforming design sub-problem; 2) The long-term pinching beamforming design sub-problem is tackled by adopting a stochastic successive convex approximation method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-timescale algorithm achieves a significant performance gain compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>Towards Accurate Forecasting of Renewable Energy : Building Datasets and Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Solar and Wind Power in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources is essential for grid stability and price prediction. Regional power supply forecasts are usually indirect through a bottom-up approach of plant-level forecasts, incorporate lagged power values, and do not use the potential of spatially resolved data. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for predicting solar and wind power production at country scale in France using machine learning models trained with spatially explicit weather data combined with spatial information about production sites capacity. A dataset is built spanning from 2012 to 2023, using daily power production data from RTE (the national grid operator) as the target variable, with daily weather data from ERA5, production sites capacity and location, and electricity prices as input features. Three modeling approaches are explored to handle spatially resolved weather data: spatial averaging over the country, dimension reduction through principal component analysis, and a computer vision architecture to exploit complex spatial relationships. The study benchmarks state-of-the-art machine learning models as well as hyperparameter tuning approaches based on cross-validation methods on daily power production data. Results indicate that cross-validation tailored to time series is best suited to reach low error. We found that neural networks tend to outperform traditional tree-based models, which face challenges in extrapolation due to the increasing renewable capacity over time. Model performance ranges from 4% to 10% in nRMSE for midterm horizon, achieving similar error metrics to local models established at a single-plant level, highlighting the potential of these methods for regional power supply forecasting.</description>

      <title>xLSTM-ECG: Multi-label ECG Classification via Feature Fusion with xLSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, highlighting the critical need for efficient and accurate diagnostic tools. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are indispensable in diagnosing various heart conditions; however, their manual interpretation is time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose xLSTM-ECG, a novel approach that leverages an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network for multi-label classification of ECG signals, using the PTB-XL dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first design and application of xLSTM modules specifically adapted for multi-label ECG classification. Our method employs a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to convert time-series ECG waveforms into the frequency domain, thereby enhancing feature extraction. The xLSTM architecture is specifically tailored to address the complexities of 12-lead ECG recordings by capturing both local and global signal features. Comprehensive experiments on the PTB-XL dataset reveal that our model achieves strong multi-label classification performance, while additional tests on the Georgia 12-Lead dataset underscore its robustness and efficiency. This approach significantly improves ECG classification accuracy, thereby advancing clinical diagnostics and patient care. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Phased Array Calibration based on Rotating-Element Harmonic Electric-Field Vector with Time Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibration is crucial for ensuring the performance of phased array since amplitude-phase imbalance between elements results in significant performance degradation. While amplitude-only calibration methods offer advantages when phase measurements are impractical, conventional approaches face two key challenges: they typically require high-resolution phase shifters and remain susceptible to phase errors inherent in these components. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Rotating element Harmonic Electric-field Vector (RHEV) strategy, which enables precise calibration through time modulation principles. The proposed technique functions as follows. Two 1-bit phase shifters are periodically phase-switched at the same frequency, each generating corresponding harmonics. By adjusting the relative delay between their modulation timings, the phase difference between the $+1$st harmonics produced by the two elements can be precisely controlled, utilizing the time-shift property of the Fourier transform. Furthermore, the +1st harmonic generated by sequential modulation of individual elements exhibits a linear relationship with the amplitude of the modulated element, enabling amplitude ambiguity resolution. The proposed RHEV-based calibration method generates phase shifts through relative timing delays rather than physical phase shifter adjustments, rendering it less susceptible to phase shift errors. Additionally, since the calibration process exclusively utilizes the $+1$st harmonic, which is produced solely by the modulated unit, the method demonstrates consistent performance regardless of array size. Extensive numerical simulations, practical in-channel and over-the-air (OTA) calibration experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and distinct advantages of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Micro-Ring Perceptron Sensor for High-Speed, Low-Power Radio-Frequency Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF) sensing enables long-range, high-resolution detection for applications such as radar and wireless communication. RF photonic sensing mitigates the bandwidth limitations and high transmission losses of electronic systems by transducing the detected RF signals into broadband optical carriers. However, these sensing systems remain limited by detector noise and Nyquist rate sampling with analog-to-digital converters, particularly under low-power and high-data rate conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the micro-ring perceptron (MiRP) sensor, a physics-inspired AI framework that integrates the micro-ring (MiR) dynamics-based analog processor with a machine-learning-driven digital backend. By embedding the nonlinear optical dynamics of MiRs into an end-to-end architecture, MiRP sensing maps the input signal into a learned feature space for the subsequent digital neural network. The trick is to encode the entire temporal structure of the incoming signal into each output sample in order to enable effectively sub-Nyquist sampling without loss of task-relevant information. Evaluations of three target classification datasets demonstrate the performance advantages of MiRP sensing. For example, on MNIST, MiRP detection achieves $94\pm0.1$\% accuracy at $1/49$ the Nyquist rate at the input RF signal of $1$~ pW, compared to $11\pm0.4$\% for the conventional RF detection method. Thus, our sensor framework provides a robust and efficient solution for the detection of low-power and high-speed signals in real-world sensing applications.</description>

      <title>A Self-supervised Learning Method for Raman Spectroscopy based on Masked Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy serves as a powerful and reliable tool for analyzing the chemical information of substances. The integration of Raman spectroscopy with deep learning methods enables rapid qualitative and quantitative analysis of materials. Most existing approaches adopt supervised learning methods. Although supervised learning has achieved satisfactory accuracy in spectral analysis, it is still constrained by costly and limited well-annotated spectral datasets for training. When spectral annotation is challenging or the amount of annotated data is insufficient, the performance of supervised learning in spectral material identification declines. In order to address the challenge of feature extraction from unannotated spectra, we propose a self-supervised learning paradigm for Raman Spectroscopy based on a Masked AutoEncoder, termed SMAE. SMAE does not require any spectral annotations during pre-training. By randomly masking and then reconstructing the spectral information, the model learns essential spectral features. The reconstructed spectra exhibit certain denoising properties, improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than twofold. Utilizing the network weights obtained from masked pre-training, SMAE achieves clustering accuracy of over 80% for 30 classes of isolated bacteria in a pathogenic bacterial dataset, demonstrating significant improvements compared to classical unsupervised methods and other state-of-the-art deep clustering methods. After fine-tuning the network with a limited amount of annotated data, SMAE achieves an identification accuracy of 83.90% on the test set, presenting competitive performance against the supervised ResNet (83.40%).</description>

      <title>A Non-Invasive Load Monitoring Method for Edge Computing Based on MobileNetV3 and Dynamic Time Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) technology has attracted much attention in the related research field by virtue of its unique advantage of utilizing single meter data to achieve accurate decomposition of device-level energy consumption. Cutting-edge methods based on machine learning and deep learning have achieved remarkable results in load decomposition accuracy by fusing time-frequency domain features. However, these methods generally suffer from high computational costs and huge memory requirements, which become the main obstacles for their deployment on resource-constrained microcontroller units (MCUs). To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm in the time-frequency domain and systematically compares and analyzes the performance of six machine learning techniques in home electricity scenarios. Through complete experimental validation on edge MCUs, this scheme successfully achieves a recognition accuracy of 95%. Meanwhile, this study deeply optimizes the frequency domain feature extraction process, which effectively reduces the running time by 55.55% and the storage overhead by about 34.6%. The algorithm performance will be further optimized in future research work. Considering that the elimination of voltage transformer design can significantly reduce the cost, the subsequent research will focus on this direction, and is committed to providing more cost-effective solutions for the practical application of NILM, and providing a solid theoretical foundation and feasible technical paths for the design of efficient NILM systems in edge computing environments.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Approach for Synthetic EEG Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) data is crucial for diagnosing mental health conditions but is costly and time-consuming to collect at scale. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to augment datasets for machine learning applications. However, generating high-quality synthetic EEG that preserves emotional and mental health signals remains challenging. This study proposes a method combining correlation analysis and random sampling to generate realistic synthetic EEG data.
  We first analyze interdependencies between EEG frequency bands using correlation analysis. Guided by this structure, we generate synthetic samples via random sampling. Samples with high correlation to real data are retained and evaluated through distribution analysis and classification tasks. A Random Forest model trained to distinguish synthetic from real EEG performs at chance level, indicating high fidelity.
  The generated synthetic data closely match the statistical and structural properties of the original EEG, with similar correlation coefficients and no significant differences in PERMANOVA tests. This method provides a scalable, privacy-preserving approach for augmenting EEG datasets, enabling more efficient model training in mental health research.</description>

      <title>Aerial Active STAR-RIS-assisted Satellite-Terrestrial Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integration of satellites and terrestrial networks is crucial for enhancing performance of next generation communication systems. However, the networks are hindered by the long-distance path loss and security risks in dense urban environments. In this work, we propose a satellite-terrestrial covert communication system assisted by the aerial active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (AASTAR-RIS) to improve the channel capacity while ensuring the transmission covertness. Specifically, we first derive the minimal detection error probability (DEP) under the worst condition that the Warden has perfect channel state information (CSI). Then, we formulate an AASTAR-RIS-assisted satellite-terrestrial covert communication optimization problem (ASCCOP) to maximize the sum of the fair channel capacity for all ground users while meeting the strict covert constraint, by jointly optimizing the trajectory and active beamforming of the AASTAR-RIS. Due to the challenges posed by the complex and high-dimensional state-action spaces as well as the need for efficient exploration in dynamic environments, we propose a generative deterministic policy gradient (GDPG) algorithm, which is a generative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve the ASCCOP. Concretely, the generative diffusion model (GDM) is utilized as the policy representation of the algorithm to enhance the exploration process by generating diverse and high-quality samples through a series of denoising steps. Moreover, we incorporate an action gradient mechanism to accomplish the policy improvement of the algorithm, which refines the better state-action pairs through the gradient ascent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms important benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a flexible thin-film underwater transducer based on a mesoporous PVDF membrane embedded with piezoelectrical-actuated microdomes. To enhance piezoelectric performance, ZnO nanoparticles were used as a sacrificial template to fabricate a sponge-like PVDF structure with increased \b{eta}-phase content and improved mechanical compliance. The device was modeled using finite element analysis and optimized through parametric studies of dome geometry, film thickness, and dome size. Acoustic performance was evaluated through underwater testing, demonstrating high SPL output and reliable data transmission even at low drive voltages. The proposed transducer offers a lightweight, low-cost, and energy-efficient solution for short-range underwater communication in next-generation Ocean IoT systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Resource Allocation for Over-the-Air Computation Networks with Fluid Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna (FA) array is envisioned as a promising technology for next-generation communication systems, owing to its ability to dynamically control the antenna locations. In this paper, we apply FA array to boost the performance of over-the-air computation networks. Given that channel uncertainty will impact negatively not only the beamforming design but also the antenna location optimization, robust resource allocation is performed to minimize the mean squared error of transmitted messages. Block coordinate descent is adopted to decompose the formulated non-convex problem into three subproblems, which are iteratively solved until convergence. Numerical results show the benefits of FA array and the necessity of robust resource allocation under channel uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents discrete codebook synthesis methods for self-interference (SI) suppression in a mmWave device, designed to support FD ISAC. We formulate a SINR maximization problem that optimizes the RX and TX codewords, aimed at suppressing the near-field SI signal while maintaining the beamforming gain in the far-field sensing directions. The formulation considers the practical constraints of discrete RX and TX codebooks with quantized phase settings, as well as a TX beamforming gain requirement in the specified communication direction. Under an alternating optimization framework, the RX and TX codewords are iteratively optimized, with one fixed while the other is optimized. When the TX codeword is fixed, we show that the RX codeword optimization problem can be formulated as an integer quadratic fractional programming (IQFP) problem. Using Dinkelbach's algorithm, we transform the problem into a sequence of subproblems in which the numerator and the denominator of the objective function are decoupled. These subproblems, subject to discrete constraints, are then efficiently solved by the spherical search (SS) method. This overall approach is referred to as FP-SS. When the RX codeword is fixed, the TX codeword optimization problem can similarly be formulated as an IQFP problem, whereas an additional TX beamforming constraint for communication needs to be considered. The problem is solved through Dinkelbach's transformation followed by the constrained spherical search (CSS), and we refer to this approach as FP-CSS. Finally, we integrate the FP-SS and FP-CSS methods into a joint RX-TX codebook design approach. Simulations show that, the proposed FP-SS and FP-CSS achieve the same SI suppression performance as the corresponding exhaustive search method, but with much lower complexity. Furthermore, the alternating optimization framework achieved even better SI suppression performance.</description>

      <title>Self-Nomination: Deep Learning for Decentralized CSI Feedback Reduction in MU-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based user-side feedback reduction framework, termed self-nomination. The goal of self-nomination is to reduce the number of users (UEs) feeding back channel state information (CSI) to the base station (BS), by letting each UE decide whether to feed back based on its estimated likelihood of being scheduled and its potential contribution to precoding in a multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) downlink. Unlike SNR- or SINR-based thresholding methods, the proposed approach uses rich spatial channel statistics and learns nontrivial correlation effects that affect eventual MU-MIMO scheduling decisions. To train the self-nomination network under an average feedback constraint, we propose two different strategies: one based on direct optimization with gradient approximations, and another using policy gradient-based optimization with a stochastic Bernoulli policy to handle non-differentiable scheduling. The framework also supports proportional-fair scheduling by incorporating dynamic user weights. Numerical results confirm that the proposed self-nomination method significantly reduces CSI feedback overhead. Compared to baseline feedback methods, self-nomination can reduce feedback by as much as 65%, saving not only bandwidth but also allowing many UEs to avoid feedback altogether (and thus, potentially enter a sleep mode). Self-nomination achieves this significant savings with negligible reduction in sum-rate or fairness.</description>

      <title>Lightweight and Self-Evolving Channel Twinning: An Ensemble DMD-Assisted Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional channel acquisition faces significant limitations due to ideal model assumptions and scalability challenges. A novel environment-aware paradigm, known as channel twinning, tackles these issues by constructing radio propagation environment semantics using a data-driven approach. In the spotlight of channel twinning technology, a radio map is recognized as an effective region-specific model for learning the spatial distribution of channel information. However, most studies focus on static channel map construction, with only a few collecting numerous channel samples and using deep learning for radio map prediction. In this paper, we develop a novel dynamic radio map twinning framework with a substantially small dataset. Specifically, we present an innovative approach that employs dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to model the evolution of the dynamic channel gain map as a dynamical system. We first interpret dynamic channel gain maps as spatio-temporal video stream data. The coarse-grained and fine-grained evolving modes are extracted from the stream data using a new ensemble DMD (Ens-DMD) algorithm. To mitigate the impact of noisy data, we design a median-based threshold mask technique to filter the noise artifacts of the twin maps. With the proposed DMD-based radio map twinning framework, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the low-complexity reproduction and evolution of the channel gain maps. Furthermore, we consider four radio map twin performance metrics to confirm the superiority of our framework compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>Robust Transmission Design for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface and Movable Antenna Enabled Symbiotic Radio Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of movable antenna (MA), a cutting-edge technology with the capability of altering antenna positions, in a symbiotic radio (SR) system enabled by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The goal is to fully exploit the capabilities of both MA and RIS, constructing a better transmission environment for the co-existing primary and secondary transmission systems. For both parasitic SR (PSR) and commensal SR (CSR) scenarios with the channel uncertainties experienced by all transmission links, we design a robust transmission scheme with the goal of maximizing the primary rate while ensuring the secondary transmission quality. To address the maximization problem with thorny non-convex characteristics, we propose an alternating optimization framework that utilizes the General S-Procedure, General Sign-Definiteness Principle, successive convex approximation (SCA), and simulated annealing (SA) improved particle swarm optimization (SA-PSO) algorithms. Numerical results validate that the CSR scenario significantly outperforms the PSR scenario in terms of primary rate, and also show that compared to the fixed-position antenna scheme, the proposed MA scheme can increase the primary rate by 1.62 bps/Hz and 2.37 bps/Hz for the PSR and CSR scenarios, respectively.</description>

      <title>Joint Topology and Power Optimization for Multi-UAV Collaborative Secure Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure communication scenario that a cluster of UAVs performs a virtual non-uniform linear array (NULA) to communicate with a base station (BS) in the presence of eavesdroppers (Eves). Our goal is to design the UAV topology, trajectory, and precoding to maximize the system channel capacity. To this end, we convert the original problem into equivalent two-stage problems. Specifically, we first try to maximize the channel gain by meticulously designing the UAV topology. We then study the joint optimization of the trajectory and precoding for total transmit power minimization while satisfying the constraints on providing quality of service (QoS) assurance to the BS, the leakage tolerance to Eves, the per-UAV transmit power, the initial/final locations, and the cylindrical no-fly zones. For the UAV topology design, we prove that the topology follows the Fekete-point distribution. The design of trajectory and precoding is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem which is generally intractable. Subsequently, the non-convex constraints are converted into convex terms, and a double-loop search algorithm is proposed to solve the transmit power minimization problem. Introduce random rotation offsets so as to perform a dynamic stochastic channel to enhance the security. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in promoting capacity.</description>

      <title>Performance Assessment of Hybrid and Digital Irregular Array Configurations for Beyond 100-GHz Multi-User MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of irregular phased array architectures is assessed in the context of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communications operating beyond 100 GHz. Realizing half-wavelength spaced planar phased arrays is challenging due to wavelength-integrated circuit (IC) size conflict at those frequencies where the antenna dimensions are comparable to IC size. Therefore, irregular array architectures such as thinned and clustered arrays are developed to mitigate the wavelength-IC size conflict. In the thinned arrays, radiating elements are permanently deactivated, while in clustered arrays, neighboring elements are grouped into subarrays. Furthermore, irregular arrays are integrated with hybrid beamforming architectures to manage the complexity introduced by full digital beamforming, where a single radio frequency chain is connected per power amplifier. An optimization problem is formulated to determine the optimal arrangement of antenna elements where the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and sidelobe levels (SLL) can be tuned. Clustered array configurations are optimized by genetic algorithm and Algorithm-X based methodologies, where the former relies on a randomized search and the latter exploits brute-force search, respectively. Furthermore, a prototype array is designed on a printed circuit board (PCB) to verify the proposed methodologies through full-wave simulations. To have a fair comparison, clustered arrays with a grouping of two and four elements are compared with thinned arrays with half and quarter thinning ratios, respectively. The combination of hybrid and irregular array architectures leads to minimal or no performance degradation in the case of hybrid fully connected architectures but severe SE and SLL degradation in the case of hybrid partially connected architectures, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the application of pinching-antenna systems (PASS) in multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) communications. Two sum-rate maximization problems are formulated under minimum mean square error (MMSE) decoding, with and without successive interference cancellation (SIC). To address the joint optimization of pinching antenna locations and user transmit powers, a fractional programming-based approach is proposed. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that PASS can significantly enhance uplink sum-rate performance compared to conventional fixed-antenna designs.</description>

      <title>UAV-Mounted IRS (UMI) in the Presence of Hovering Fluctuations: 3D Pattern Characterization and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) to leverage the benefits of this technology for future communication networks, such as 6G. Key advantages include enhanced spectral and energy efficiency, expanded network coverage, and flexible deployment. One of the main challenges in employing UAV-mounted IRS (UMI) technology is the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs. Focusing on this challenge, this paper explores the capabilities of UMI with passive/active elements affected by UAV fluctuations in both horizontal and vertical angles, considering the three-dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of the IRS. The relationship between UAV fluctuations and IRS pattern is investigated by taking into account the random angular vibrations of UAVs. A tractable and closed-form distribution function for the IRS pattern is derived, using linear approximation and by dividing it into several sectors. In addition, closed-form expressions for outage probability (OP) are obtained using central limit theorem (CLT) and Gamma approximation. The theoretical expressions are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings indicate that the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs have a notable impact on the performance of UMI systems. To avoid link interruptions due to UAV instability, IRS should utilize fewer elements, even though this leads to a decrease in directivity. As a result, unlike terrestrial IRS, incorporating more elements into aerial IRS systems does not necessarily improve performance due to the fluctuations in UAV. Numerical results show that the OP can be minimized by selecting the optimal number of IRS elements and using active elements.</description>

      <title>A Novel Sparse Sum and Difference Co-Array With Low Redundancy and Enhanced DOF for Non-Circular Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Array structures based on the sum and difference co-arrays provide more degrees of freedom (DOF). However, since the growth of DOF is limited by a single case of sum and difference co-arrays, the paper aims to design a sparse linear array (SLA) with higher DOF via exploring different cases of second-order cumulants. We present a mathematical framework based on second-order cumulant to devise a second-order extended co-array (SO-ECA) and define the redundancy of SO-ECA. Based on SO-ECA, a novel array is proposed, namely low redundancy sum and difference array (LR-SDA), which can provide closed-form expressions for the sensor positions and enhance DOF in order to resolve more signal sources in the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of non-circular (NC) signals. For LR-SDA, the maximum DOF under the given number of total physical sensors can be derived and the SO-ECA of LR-SDA is hole-free. Further, the corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions of signal reconstruction for LR-SDA are derived. Additionally, the redundancy and weight function of LR-SDA are defined, and the lower band of the redundancy for LR-SDA is derived. The proposed LR-SDA achieves higher DOF and lower redundancy than those of existing DCAs designed based on sum and difference co-arrays. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of LR-SDA on DOA estimation performance and enhanced DOF over other existing DCAs.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic MSE-Optimality of Parametric Bayesian Channel Estimation in mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean square error (MSE)-optimal estimator is known to be the conditional mean estimator (CME). This paper introduces a parametric channel estimation technique based on Bayesian estimation. This technique uses the estimated channel parameters to parameterize the well-known LMMSE channel estimator. We first derive an asymptotic CME formulation that holds for a wide range of priors on the channel parameters. Based on this, we show that parametric Bayesian channel estimation is MSE-optimal for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and/or long coherence intervals, i.e., many noisy observations provided within one coherence interval. Numerical simulations validate the derived formulations.</description>

      <title>Array Partitioning Based Near-Field Attitude and Location Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a passive source localization system, where a single base station (BS) is employed to estimate the positions and attitudes of multiple mobile stations (MSs). The BS and the MSs are equipped with uniform rectangular arrays, and the MSs are located in the near-field region of the BS array. To avoid the difficulty of tackling the problem directly based on the near-field signal model, we establish a subarray-wise far-field received signal model. In this model, the entire BS array is divided into multiple subarrays to ensure that each MS is in the far-field region of each BS subarray. By exploiting the angles of arrival (AoAs) of an MS antenna at different BS subarrays, we formulate the attitude and location estimation problem under the Bayesian inference framework. Based on the factor graph representation of the probabilistic problem model, a message passing algorithm named array partitioning based pose and location estimation (APPLE) is developed to solve this problem. An estimation-error lower bound is obtained as a performance benchmark of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed APPLE algorithm outperforms other baseline methods in the accuracy of position and attitude estimation.</description>

      <title>Association-Based Track-Before-Detect with Object Contribution Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiobject tracking provides situational awareness that enables new applications for modern convenience, applied ocean sciences, public safety, and homeland security. In many multiobject tracking applications, including radar and sonar tracking, after coherent prefiltering of the received signal, measurement data is typically structured in cells, where each cell represent, e.g., a different range and bearing value. While conventional detect-then-track (DTT) multiobject tracking approaches convert the cell-structured data within a detection phase into so-called point measurements in order to reduce the amount of data, track-before-detect (TBD) methods process the cell-structured data directly, avoiding a potential information loss. However, many TBD tracking methods are computationally intensive and achieve a reduced tracking accuracy when objects interact, i.e., when they come into close proximity. We here counteract these difficulties by introducing the concept of probabilistic object-to-cell contributions. As many conventional DTT methods, our approach uses a probabilistic association of objects with data cells, and a new object contribution model with corresponding object contribution probabilities to further associate cell contributions to objects that occupy the same data cell. Furthermore, to keep the computational complexity and filter runtimes low, we here use an efficient Poisson multi-Bernoulli filtering approach in combination with the application of belief propagation for fast probabilistic data association. We demonstrate numerically that our method achieves significantly increased tracking performance compared to state-of-the-art TBD tracking approaches, where performance differences are particularly pronounced when multiple objects interact.</description>

      <title>An Accelerated Camera 3DMA Framework for Efficient Urban GNSS Multipath Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust GNSS positioning in urban environments is still plagued by multipath effects, particularly due to the complex signal propagation induced by ubiquitous surfaces with varied radio frequency reflectivities. Current 3D Mapping Aided (3DMA) GNSS techniques show great potentials in mitigating multipath but face a critical trade-off between computational efficiency and modeling accuracy. Most approaches often rely on offline outdated or oversimplified 3D maps, while real-time LiDAR-based reconstruction boasts high accuracy, it is problematic in low laser reflectivity conditions; camera 3DMA is a good candidate to balance accuracy and efficiency but current methods suffer from extremely low reconstruction speed, a far cry from real-time multipath-mitigated navigation. This paper proposes an accelerated framework incorporating camera multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction and ray tracing. By hypothesizing on surface textures, an orthogonal visual feature fusion framework is proposed, which robustly addresses both texture-rich and texture-poor surfaces, lifting off the reflectivity challenges in visual reconstruction. A polygonal surface modeling scheme is further integrated to accurately delineate complex building boundaries, enhancing the reconstruction granularity. To avoid excessively accurate reconstruction, reprojected point cloud multi-plane fitting and two complexity control strategies are proposed, thus improving upon multipath estimation speed. Experiments were conducted in Lujiazui, Shanghai, a typical multipath-prone district. The results show that the method achieves an average reconstruction accuracy of 2.4 meters in dense urban environments featuring glass curtain wall structures, a traditionally tough case for reconstruction, and achieves a ray-tracing-based multipath correction rate of 30 image frames per second, 10 times faster than the contemporary benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of IEEE 802.11bn Non-Primary Channel Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a performance analysis of the Non-Primary Channel Access (NPCA) mechanism, a new feature introduced in IEEE 802.11bn to enhance spectrum utilization in Wi-Fi networks. NPCA enables devices to contend for and transmit on the secondary channel when the primary channel is occupied by transmissions from an Overlapping Basic Service Set (OBSS). We develop a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model that captures the interactions among OBSSs in dense WLAN environments when NPCA is enabled, incorporating new NPCA-specific states and transitions. In addition to the analytical insights offered by the model, we conduct numerical evaluations and simulations to quantify NPCA's impact on throughput and channel access delay across various scenarios. Our results show that NPCA can significantly improve throughput and reduce access delays in favorable conditions for BSSs that support the mechanism. Moreover, NPCA helps mitigate the OBSS performance anomaly, where low-rate OBSS transmissions degrade network performance for all nearby devices. However, we also observe trade-offs: NPCA may increase contention on secondary channels, potentially reducing transmission opportunities for BSSs operating there.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the distributed bandit convex optimization problem with time-varying constraints. In this problem, the global loss function is the average of all the local convex loss functions, which are unknown beforehand. Each agent iteratively makes its own decision subject to time-varying inequality constraints which can be violated but are fulfilled in the long run. For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, a distributed bandit online primal-dual projection algorithm with one-point sampling is proposed. We show that sublinear dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation are achieved if the path-length of the benchmark also increases in a sublinear manner. In addition, an $\mathcal{O}({T^{3/4 + g}})$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}( {{T^{1 - {g}/2}}} )$ network cumulative constraint violation bound are established, where $T$ is the total number of iterations and $g \in ( {0,1/4} )$ is a trade-off parameter. Moreover, a reduced static network regret bound $\mathcal{O}( {{T^{2/3 + 4g /3}}} )$ is established for strongly convex local loss functions. Finally, a numerical example is presented to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Non-linearity Effect Analysis of Gaussian Pulse Propagation In Optical Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, numerical analysis of nonlinear pulse propagation is carried out. This is done mainly by solving the nonlinear Schrodinger equation using the split step algorithm. In a nonlinear media, dispersive effects exist simultaneously with nonlinear effects. Refractive index dependence on intensity results in optical Kerr effect which causes narrowing of transmitted pulses by inducing self-phase modulation while second order group velocity dispersion causes the pulses to spread. In this project, group velocity dispersion is discussed followed by self-phase modulation. These individually detrimental effects are shown to combine beneficially for propagation of pulses here. Gaussian pulse is studied and propagated by using them as input in to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. The split step algorithm is described in depth. Explanation of each step is included along with the relevant equations defining these steps.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Evaluation of Indoor LoRaWAN Environment-Aware Propagation for 6G: MLR, ANOVA, and Residual Distribution Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16688v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling path loss in indoor LoRaWAN technology deployments is inherently challenging due to structural obstructions, occupant density and activities, and fluctuating environmental conditions. This study proposes a two-stage approach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor office at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First, we implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional propagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we demonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained variance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by fitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy, Student's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models with one to five components. Our results show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual heterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly outperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward ultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows that environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network design in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.</description>

      <title>Successive Jump and Mode Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose fully data-driven variational methods, termed successive jump and mode decomposition (SJMD) and its multivariate extension, successive multivariate jump and mode decomposition (SMJMD), for successively decomposing nonstationary signals into amplitude- and frequency-modulated (AM-FM) oscillations and jump components. Unlike existing methods that treat oscillatory modes and jump discontinuities separately and often require prior knowledge of the number of components (K) -- which is difficult to obtain in practice -- our approaches employ successive optimization-based schemes that jointly handle AM-FM oscillations and jump discontinuities without the need to predefine K. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms offer superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Secure Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10473v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising technology that exploits new spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to improve wireless communication and sensing performance. In this letter, we investigate an RA-enabled secure communication system where confidential information is transmitted from an RA-based access point (AP) to a single-antenna legitimate user in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the achievable secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs. Accordingly, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution in an iterative manner, where generalized Rayleigh quotient-based beamforming is applied and the RAs' deflection angles are optimized by the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Our simulation results show that the proposed RA-enabled secure communication system achieves a significantly higher achievable secrecy rate as compared to various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Two-timescale joint power control and beamforming design with applications to cell-free massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02080v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study we derive novel optimal algorithms for joint power control and beamforming design in modern large-scale MIMO systems, such as those based on the cell-free massive MIMO and XL-MIMO concepts. In particular, motivated by the need for scalable system architectures, we formulate and solve nontrivial two-timescale extensions of the classical uplink power minimization and max-min fair resource allocation problems. In our formulations, we let the beamformers be functions mapping partial instantaneous channel state information (CSI) to beamforming weights, and we jointly optimize these functions and the power control coefficients based on long-term statistical CSI. This long-term approach mitigates the severe scalability issues of competing short-term iterative algorithms in the literature, where a central controller endowed with global instantaneous CSI must solve a complex optimization problem for every channel realization, hence imposing very demanding requirements in terms of computational complexity and signaling overhead. Moreover, our approach outperforms the available long-term approaches, which do not jointly optimize powers and beamformers. The obtained optimal long-term algorithms are then illustrated and compared against existing short-term and long-term algorithms via numerical simulations in a cell-free massive MIMO setup with different levels of cooperation.</description>

      <title>Pre-Chirp-Domain Index Modulation for Full-Diversity Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing towards 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00313v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), tailored as a superior multicarrier technique utilizing chirp signals for high-mobility communications, is envisioned as a promising candidate for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless network. AFDM is based on the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) with two adjustable parameters of the chirp signals, termed as the pre-chirp and post-chirp parameters, respectively. We show that the pre-chirp counterpart can be flexibly manipulated for additional degree-of-freedom (DoF). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel AFDM scheme with the pre-chirp index modulation (PIM) philosophy (AFDM-PIM), which can implicitly convey extra information bits through dynamic pre-chirp parameter assignment, thus enhancing both spectral and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first demonstrate that the subcarrier orthogonality is still maintained by applying distinct pre-chirp parameters to various subcarriers in the AFDM modulation process. Inspired by this property, each AFDM subcarrier is constituted with a unique pre-chirp signal according to the incoming bits. By such arrangement, extra binary bits can be embedded into the index patterns of pre-chirp parameter assignment without additional energy consumption. For performance analysis, we derive the asymptotically tight upper bounds on the average bit error rates (BERs) of the proposed schemes with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, and validate that the proposed AFDM-PIM can achieve the optimal diversity order under doubly dispersive channels. Based on the derivations, we further propose an optimal pre-chirp alphabet design to enhance the BER performance via intelligent optimization algorithms. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed AFDM-PIM outperforms the classical benchmarks under doubly dispersive channel.</description>

      <title>Dual NUP Representations and Min-Maximization in Factor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Normals with unknown parameters (NUP) can be used to convert nontrivial model-based estimation problems into iterations of linear least-squares or Gaussian estimation problems. In this paper, we extend this approach by augmenting factor graphs with convex-dual variables and pertinent NUP representations. In particular, in a state space setting, we propose a new iterative forward-backward algorithm that is dual to a recently proposed backward-forward algorithm.</description>
