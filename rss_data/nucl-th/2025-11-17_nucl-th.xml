      <title>Constraining Neutron Capture Cross Sections for $^{88}\mathrm{Y}$ with Gamma-ray Strength Function in $(p,p^\prime\gamma)$ Surrogate Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate to extract $^{88}\mathrm{Y}(n,\gamma)$ cross sections using the $(p,p'\gamma)$ surrogate reaction with proper treatment of the spin-parity distribution of the compound nucleus $^{89}\mathrm{Y}$. Experimental data of both $\gamma$-decay probability and $\gamma$-ray strength function are used to constrain the nuclear model parameters within a computational framework combining the Bayesian optimization and Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which helps to significantly reduce the $(n,\gamma)$ data uncertainty. The $^{88}\mathrm{Y}(n,\gamma)$ cross sections are then extracted with a narrow uncertainty of 7.6\%-23.1\% within neutron energy range of 0.01 to 3.0 MeV for the first time, where no experimental data are available. Moreover, our method is verified with the $^{88}\mathrm{Sr}(p,\gamma)$ reaction, of which the measured data are available for comparison. This work opens interesting perspectives on the matter of extracting ($n,\gamma$) reaction cross sections on unstable nuclei as surrogate reaction experiments are becoming widely available.</description>

      <title>New constraints on equation of state of hot QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The longitudinal structure of the quark-gluon plasma(QGP) remains a key challenge in heavy-ion physics. In this Letter, we propose a novel observable, event-by-event mean transverse momentum fluctuations Var$_{\langle p_{T} \rangle}$, which is sensitive to the local pressure gradients and serves as a probe of longitudinal dynamics in the initial state of QGP. We demonstrate that the covariance of averaged transverse momentum at two rapidities $\mathrm{Cov}_{\langle p_T \rangle}(\eta_1, \eta_2)$ and its associated decorrelation measures, $R_{p_T}(\eta_1, \eta_2)$ and $r_{p_T}(\eta, \eta_{\mathrm{ref}})$, exhibit strong sensitivity to the stiffness of equation of state (EoS) of QGP, while showing negligible dependence on the QGP transport coefficients. This distinctive behavior, revealed through state-of-the-art (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, establishes a powerful approach for constraining the EoS of QCD matter. In the meantime, our results provide new insights into the longitudinal structure of the QGP and its properties under high baryon density.</description>

      <title>NJL-Chiral Soliton and the Nucleon Equation of State at supra-saturation density: Impact of Chiral Symmetry Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that, at sufficiently high baryon densities, the equation of state (EoS) of bulk nuclear matter can be identified with that of the nucleon core. In this work, we illustrate how the energy density and pressure distributions inside individual nucleons can be utilized to construct the EoS of supra-dense matter. In our framework, nucleons arise as topological solitons stabilized by vector mesons, which are dynamically generated through the path integral bosonization of an underlying Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The restoration of chiral symmetry is implemented dynamically via a self-consistent, density-dependent scalar field, which modifies the (isovector) and (isoscalar) channels of the soliton. We analyze the resulting changes in soliton properties for different NJL parameter sets and demonstrate that the progressive restoration of chiral symmetry leads to a stiffening of the soliton-based EoS, making it compatible with existing neutron star EoSs. An EoS constructed from the solutions of the energy-density and pressure profiles at the center of the nucleon is also explored.</description>

      <title>Low-energy enhancement in the magnetic dipole radiation of actinide nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical results of the magnetic dipole (M1) $\gamma$-ray strength function ($\gamma$SF) for actinide nuclei within the shell-model Monte Carlo (SMMC) method. We observe a low-energy enhancement (LEE) in the M1 $\gamma$SFs of the six nuclei studied here, which serves as the first evidence, theoretical or experimental, that the LEE persists in the actinides. We also identify a scissors mode resonance in all six nuclei, which we compare with recent Oslo-method experiments.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and Applicability of the Hartle-Thorne and Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu Methods for Modeling Rotating Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars, which are composed of extremely dense nuclear matter, serve as natural laboratories to study nuclear interactions beyond the terrestrial experiments. Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $\Omega=200$ Hz. These results reveal that, for detailed discussions on the internal structure and stability of rotating neutron stars, the fully general relativistic method such as KEH is indispensable.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating baryonic tubes supported by $\pi$- and $\omega$-mesons and its flat limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct self-gravitating topological solitons in the $SU(N)$ Einstein non-linear sigma model coupled to $\omega$-vector-mesons in $D=4$ space-time dimensions. These solutions represent tube-like configurations free of curvature singularities and possess a non-vanishing topological charge identified as the baryon number. We show that, using the maximal embedding Ansatz of $SU(2)$ into $SU(N)$ in the exponential representation, the tubes can be constructed for arbitrary values of the flavor number, $N$, with the topological charge being proportional to this number. The flat limit of this solution, which corresponds to an array of baryonic tubes in a finite volume, is analyzed in detail. Remarkably, although the energy of the solitons at a finite volume is an increasing function of $N$, the binding energy decreases as the number of flavors present in the theory increases, reaffirming that the inclusion of more than two flavors improves the predictions of the model.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of a $\pi^0\gamma $ pair in the saturation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the exclusive photoproduction of a $\pi^0 \gamma$ pair with large invariant mass, as a promising channel to study the effects of gluon saturation. It has recently been demonstrated that this process is incompatible with a collinear factorization approach in terms of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at the leading twist. In such a situation, a (generalized) $k_T$-dependent factorization at small $x$ is a valid alternative approach. We perform this calculation using the shockwave formalism, which resums multiple gluon exchanges between the projectile and the dense nuclear target. We find that the polarized amplitude changes sign as a function of back-to-back transverse momentum $|\vec{p}_t|$ of the pion-photon pair, resulting in a dip-like structure in the fully differential cross section as a function of $|\vec{p}_t|$.</description>

      <title>Unified nonparametric equation-of-state inference from the neutron-star crust to perturbative-QCD densities</title>

Abstract: Perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), while valid only at densities exceeding those found in the cores of neutron stars, could provide constraints on the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In this work, we examine the impact of pQCD information on the inference of the EOS using a nonparametric framework based on Gaussian processes (GPs). We examine the application of pQCD constraints through a "pQCD likelihood," and verify the findings of previous works; namely, a softening of the EOS at the central densities of the most massive neutron stars and a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass. Although the pQCD likelihood can be easily integrated into existing EOS inference frameworks, this approach requires an arbitrary selection of the density at which the constraints are applied. The EOS behavior is also treated differently on either side of the chosen density. To mitigate these issues, we extend the EOS model to higher densities, thereby constructing a "unified" description of the EOS from the neutron-star crust to densities relevant for pQCD. In this approach the pQCD constraints effectively become part of the prior. Since the EOS is unconstrained by any calculation or data between the densities applicable to neutron stars and pQCD, we argue for maximum modeling flexibility in that regime. We compare the unified EOS with the traditional pQCD likelihood, and although we confirm the EOS softening, we do not see a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass or any impact on macroscopic observables. Though residual model dependence cannot be ruled out, we find that pQCD suggests the speed of sound in the densest neutron-star cores has already started decreasing toward the asymptotic limit; we find that the speed of sound squared at the center of the most massive neutron star has an upper bound of $\sim 0.5$ at the $90\%$ level.</description>

      <title>Probing Neutron Skin through Event-by-Event Pion Asymmetry in Heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach for probing the neutron skin thickness of gold (Au) by analyzing the event-by-event distribution of $\pi^{-}$ and $\pi^{+}$ yield differences. This is achieved through SMASH simulations of ultra-peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=3$ GeV. Our results demonstrate that the mean value of $\Delta n_{\pi} = n_{\pi^{-}} - n_{\pi^{+}}$, along with the Pearson correlation and mutual information between $(\pi^{-}+\pi^{+})$ and $(\pi^{-}-\pi^{+})$, all scale linearly with the neutron skin thickness. Moreover, the slope of the line connecting two distinct $\Delta n_{\pi}$ values in the event-by-event distribution also exhibits a linear dependence on the neutron skin thickness. The most sensitive $\Delta n_{\pi}$ pairs are identified as $(-1, 1)$, $(-1, 2)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(0, 2)$. These findings establish a new pathway for determining the neutron skin thickness. Finally, by comparing SMASH and UrQMD simulations under identical initial conditions, we observe that individual slope values depend on the specific collision model. However, by extracting slopes from multiple $\Delta n_{\pi}$ pairs in experimental event-by-event data and inferring the corresponding neutron skin thickness, one can assess which model better aligns with the true physical value.</description>

      <title>Understanding neutrino pion production with the GiBUU model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pion production is a major source of systematic uncertainty in neutrino oscillation measurements. We report a systematic investigation of neutrino-induced pion production using MINERvA and MicroBooNE data within the GiBUU theoretical framework. The analysis begins by establishing baseline model parameters using inclusive and pionless data from MINERvA, MicroBooNE, and T2K experiments. We then examine the role of in-medium effects, including resonance broadening and nucleon-nucleon final-state interactions. While agreement with individual datasets can be achieved through specific model configurations, we demonstrate the difficulty of a unified description across all experiments: MINERvA measurements prefer minimum in-medium modifications, whereas MicroBooNE data require the maximum in-medium enhancement, revealing the complexity and richness of the underlying nuclear dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the $Nc^1$ scaling in the confined but chirally symmetric phase at high T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is lattice evidence that the QCD matter above the chiral restoration temperature Tch and below the deconfinement temperature Td, called stringy fluid, is characterized by an approximate chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of confinement in QCD with light quarks. The energy density, pressure and entropy density in the stringy fluid scale as Nc^1, which is in contrast to the Nc^0 scaling in the hadron gas and to the Nc^2 scaling in the quark-gluon plasma. Here we clarify the origin of the Nc^1 scaling. We employ a solvable field-theoretical large $N_c$ chirally symmetric and confining model. In vacuum the confining potential induces a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The mesons are spatially localized states of quarks and antiquarks. Still in the confining regime the system undergoes the chiral restoration phase transition at $T_{ch}$ because of Paili blocking of the quark levels required for the existence of the quark condensate, by the thermal excitation of quarks and antiquarks. The same Paili blocking leads to a delocalization of the color singlet low-spin meson-like states that become infinitely large in the chiral limit. Consequently the stringy fluid represents a very dense medium of the overlapping huge color-singlet low-spin quark-antiquark systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation that determines the rest-frame excitation energies of the color-singlet quark-antiquark system is Nc-independent both in vacuum and in the medium in the confining regime. The excitation energy of the quark-antiquark color-singlet systems scales as Nc^0, i.e. as meson mass in vacuum. The Nc^1 scaling of the energy density in the stringy fluid is provided by the fluctuations of the color-singlet quark-antiquark systems.</description>
