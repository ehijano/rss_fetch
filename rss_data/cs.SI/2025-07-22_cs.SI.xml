      <title>Discipline and Resistance: The Construction of a Digital Home for TikTok Refugees on Xiaohongshu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how TikTok refugees moved to Xiaohongshu after TikTok was about to be banned in the United States. It utilizes Foucault's idea of heterotopia to demonstrate how Xiaohongshu became a crisis space for cross-cultural discussions across the Great Firewall. Through Critical Discourse Analysis of 586 user comments, the study reveals how Chinese and international users collaboratively constructed and contested a new online order through language negotiation, identity positioning, and playful platform policing. The findings highlight distinct discursive strategies between domestic and overseas users, reflecting both cultural resistance and adaptation. This research contributes to the understanding of digital migration, heterotopic spaces in social media, and emerging dynamics of cross-cultural discourse during geopolitical crises.</description>

      <title>Rejection or Inclusion in the Emotion-Identity Dynamics of TikTok Refugees on RedNote</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines cross-cultural interactions between Chinese users and self-identified "TikTok Refugees"(foreign users who migrated to RedNote after TikTok's U.S. ban). Based on a dataset of 1,862 posts and 403,054 comments, we use large language model-based sentiment classification and BERT-based topic modelling to explore how both groups engage with the TikTok refugee phenomenon. We analyse what themes foreign users express, how Chinese users respond, how stances (Pro-China, Neutral, Pro-Foreign) shape emotional expression, and how affective responses differ across topics and identities. Results show strong affective asymmetry: Chinese users respond with varying emotional intensities across topics and stances: pride and praise dominate cultural threads, while political discussions elicit high levels of contempt and anger, especially from Pro-China commenters. Pro-Foreign users exhibit the strongest negative emotions across all topics, whereas neutral users express curiosity and joy but still reinforce mainstream discursive norms. Cross-topic comparisons reveal that appearance-related content produces the most emotionally balanced interactions, while politics generates the highest polarization. Our findings reveal distinct emotion-stance structures in Sino-foreign online interactions and offer empirical insights into identity negotiation in transnational digital publics.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Faculty Placement from Patterns in Co-authorship Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faculty hiring shapes the flow of ideas, resources, and opportunities in academia, influencing not only individual career trajectories but also broader patterns of institutional prestige and scientific progress. While traditional studies have found strong correlations between faculty hiring and attributes such as doctoral department prestige and publication record, they rarely assess whether these associations generalize to individual hiring outcomes, particularly for future candidates outside the original sample. Here, we consider faculty placement as an individual-level prediction task. Our data consist of temporal co-authorship networks with conventional attributes such as doctoral department prestige and bibliometric features. We observe that using the co-authorship network significantly improves predictive accuracy by up to 10% over traditional indicators alone, with the largest gains observed for placements at the most elite (top-10) departments. Our results underscore the role that social networks, professional endorsements, and implicit advocacy play in faculty hiring beyond traditional measures of scholarly productivity and institutional prestige. By introducing a predictive framing of faculty placement and establishing the benefit of considering co-authorship networks, this work provides a new lens for understanding structural biases in academia that could inform targeted interventions aimed at increasing transparency, fairness, and equity in academic hiring practices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Relevant Quantities of Friedkin-Johnsen Opinion Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online social networks have become an integral part of modern society, profoundly influencing how individuals form and exchange opinions across diverse domains ranging from politics to public health. The Friedkin-Johnsen model serves as a foundational framework for modeling opinion formation dynamics in such networks. In this paper, we address the computational task of efficiently determining the equilibrium opinion vector and associated metrics including polarization and disagreement, applicable to both directed and undirected social networks. We propose a deterministic local algorithm with relative error guarantees, scaling to networks exceeding ten million nodes. Further acceleration is achieved through integration with successive over-relaxation techniques, where a relaxation factor optimizes convergence rates. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world networks validate the practical effectiveness of our approaches, demonstrating significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Privacy Risk Assessment in Social Networks Using User Attributes Social Graphs and Text Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of social networking platforms has amplified privacy threats as users increasingly share sensitive information across profiles, content, and social connections. We present a Comprehensive Privacy Risk Scoring (CPRS) framework that quantifies privacy risk by integrating user attributes, social graph structures, and user-generated content. Our framework computes risk scores across these dimensions using sensitivity, visibility, structural similarity, and entity-level analysis, then aggregates them into a unified risk score. We validate CPRS on two real-world datasets: the SNAP Facebook Ego Network (4,039 users) and the Koo microblogging dataset (1M posts, 1M comments). The average CPRS is 0.478 with equal weighting, rising to 0.501 in graph-sensitive scenarios. Component-wise, graph-based risks (mean 0.52) surpass content (0.48) and profile attributes (0.45). High-risk attributes include email, date of birth, and mobile number. Our user study with 100 participants shows 85% rated the dashboard as clear and actionable, confirming CPRS's practical utility. This work enables personalized privacy risk insights and contributes a holistic, scalable methodology for privacy management. Future directions include incorporating temporal dynamics and multimodal content for broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Multimodal News Recommendation through Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15460v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized News Recommendation systems (PNR) have emerged as a solution to information overload by predicting and suggesting news items tailored to individual user interests. However, traditional PNR systems face several challenges, including an overreliance on textual content, common neglect of short-term user interests, and significant privacy concerns due to centralized data storage. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel multimodal federated learning-based approach for news recommendation. First, it integrates both textual and visual features of news items using a multimodal model, enabling a more comprehensive representation of content. Second, it employs a time-aware model that balances users' long-term and short-term interests through multi-head self-attention networks, improving recommendation accuracy. Finally, to enhance privacy, a federated learning framework is implemented, enabling collaborative model training without sharing user data. The framework divides the recommendation model into a large server-maintained news model and a lightweight user model shared between the server and clients. The client requests news representations (vectors) and a user model from the central server, then computes gradients with user local data, and finally sends their locally computed gradients to the server for aggregation. The central server aggregates gradients to update the global user model and news model. The updated news model is further used to infer news representation by the server. To further safeguard user privacy, a secure aggregation algorithm based on Shamir's secret sharing is employed. Experiments on a real-world news dataset demonstrate strong performance compared to existing systems, representing a significant advancement in privacy-preserving personalized news recommendation.</description>

      <title>Apology of Green Digitalization in the Context of Information and Climate Feedback Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amid accelerated digitalization, not only is the scale of data processing and storage increasing, but so too is the associated infrastructure load on the climate. Current climate models and environmental protocols almost entirely overlook the impact of information and communication technologies on the thermal and energy balance of the biosphere.
  This paper proposes the theory of information and climate feedback (ICF) as a new nonlinear model describing the loop of digitalization, energy consumption, the thermal footprint, the climatic response, and the vulnerability of digital infrastructure. The system is formalized via differential equations with delays and parameters of sensitivity, greenness, and phase stability.
  A multiscenario numerical analysis, phase reconstructions, and thermal cartography were conducted. Critical regimes, including digital overheating, fluctuational instability, and infrastructural collapse in the absence of adaptive measures, were identified.
  The paper concludes with the proposal of an international agreement titled the Green Digital Accord and a set of metrics for sustainable digitalization. This work integrates climatology, information technologies, and the political economy of sustainability.</description>

      <title>Enhancing POI Recommendation through Global Graph Disentanglement with POI Weighted Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next point of interest (POI) recommendation primarily predicts future activities based on users' past check-in data and current status, providing significant value to users and service providers. We observed that the popular check-in times for different POI categories vary. For example, coffee shops are crowded in the afternoon because people like to have coffee to refresh after meals, while bars are busy late at night. However, existing methods rarely explore the relationship between POI categories and time, which may result in the model being unable to fully learn users' tendencies to visit certain POI categories at different times. Additionally, existing methods for modeling time information often convert it into time embeddings or calculate the time interval and incorporate it into the model, making it difficult to capture the continuity of time. Finally, during POI prediction, various weighting information is often ignored, such as the popularity of each POI, the transition relationships between POIs, and the distances between POIs, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel next POI recommendation framework called Graph Disentangler with POI Weighted Module (GDPW). This framework aims to jointly consider POI category information and multiple POI weighting factors. Specifically, the proposed GDPW learns category and time representations through the Global Category Graph and the Global Category-Time Graph. Then, we disentangle category and time information through contrastive learning. After prediction, the final POI recommendation for users is obtained by weighting the prediction results based on the transition weights and distance relationships between POIs. We conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed GDPW outperforms other existing models, improving performance by 3% to 11%.</description>

      <title>ROBAD: Robust Adversary-aware Local-Global Attended Bad Actor Detection Sequential Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting bad actors is critical to ensure the safety and integrity of internet platforms. Several deep learning-based models have been developed to identify such users. These models should not only accurately detect bad actors, but also be robust against adversarial attacks that aim to evade detection. However, past deep learning-based detection models do not meet the robustness requirement because they are sensitive to even minor changes in the input sequence. To address this issue, we focus on (1) improving the model understanding capability and (2) enhancing the model knowledge such that the model can recognize potential input modifications when making predictions. To achieve these goals, we create a novel transformer-based classification model, called ROBAD (RObust adversary-aware local-global attended Bad Actor Detection model), which uses the sequence of user posts to generate user embedding to detect bad actors. Particularly, ROBAD first leverages the transformer encoder block to encode each post bidirectionally, thus building a post embedding to capture the local information at the post level. Next, it adopts the transformer decoder block to model the sequential pattern in the post embeddings by using the attention mechanism, which generates the sequence embedding to obtain the global information at the sequence level. Finally, to enrich the knowledge of the model, embeddings of modified sequences by mimicked attackers are fed into a contrastive-learning-enhanced classification layer for sequence prediction. In essence, by capturing the local and global information (i.e., the post and sequence information) and leveraging the mimicked behaviors of bad actors in training, ROBAD can be robust to adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on Yelp and Wikipedia datasets show that ROBAD can effectively detect bad actors when under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Homophily and Heterophily in Multimodal Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal graphs, which integrate unstructured heterogeneous data with structured interconnections, offer substantial real-world utility but remain insufficiently explored in unsupervised learning. In this work, we initiate the study of multimodal graph clustering, aiming to bridge this critical gap. Through empirical analysis, we observe that real-world multimodal graphs often exhibit hybrid neighborhood patterns, combining both homophilic and heterophilic relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework -- \textsc{Disentangled Multimodal Graph Clustering (DMGC)} -- which decomposes the original hybrid graph into two complementary views: (1) a homophily-enhanced graph that captures cross-modal class consistency, and (2) heterophily-aware graphs that preserve modality-specific inter-class distinctions. We introduce a \emph{Multimodal Dual-frequency Fusion} mechanism that jointly filters these disentangled graphs through a dual-pass strategy, enabling effective multimodal integration while mitigating category confusion. Our self-supervised alignment objectives further guide the learning process without requiring labels. Extensive experiments on both multimodal and multi-relational graph datasets demonstrate that DMGC achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability across diverse settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Uncnbb/DMGC.</description>

      <title>Conflicting narratives and polarization on social media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narratives are key interpretative devices by which humans make sense of political reality. In this work, we show how the analysis of conflicting narratives, i.e. conflicting interpretive lenses through which political reality is experienced and told, provides insight into the discursive mechanisms of polarization and issue alignment in the public sphere. Building upon previous work that has identified ideologically polarized issues in the German Twittersphere between 2021 and 2023, we analyze the discursive dimension of polarization by extracting textual signals of conflicting narratives from tweets of opposing opinion groups. Focusing on a selection of salient issues and events (the war in Ukraine, Covid, climate change), we show evidence for conflicting narratives along two dimensions: (i) different attributions of actantial roles to the same set of actants (e.g. diverging interpretations of the role of NATO in the war in Ukraine), and (ii) emplotment of different actants for the same event (e.g. Bill Gates in the right-leaning Covid narrative). Furthermore, we provide first evidence for patterns of narrative alignment, a discursive strategy that political actors employ to align opinions across issues. These findings demonstrate the use of narratives as an analytical lens into the discursive mechanisms of polarization.</description>

Abstract: Publications in the AI for Good space have tended to focus on the research and model development that can support high-impact applications. However, very few AI for Good papers discuss the process of deploying and collaborating with the partner organization, and the resulting real-world impact. In this work, we share details about the close collaboration with a humanitarian-to-humanitarian (H2H) organization and how to not only deploy the AI model in a resource-constrained environment, but also how to maintain it for continuous performance updates, and share key takeaways for practitioners.</description>

      <title>Community detection for directed networks revisited using bimodularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community structure is a key feature omnipresent in real-world network data. Plethora of methods have been proposed to reveal subsets of densely interconnected nodes using criteria such as the modularity index. These approaches have been successful for undirected graphs, but directed edge information has not yet been dealt with in a satisfactory way. Here, we revisit the concept of directed communities as a mapping between sending and receiving communities. This translates into a new definition that we term bimodularity. Using convex relaxation, bimodularity can be optimized with the singular value decomposition of the directed modularity matrix. Subsequently, we propose an edge-based clustering approach to reveal the directed communities including their mappings. The feasibility of the new framework is illustrated on a synthetic model and further applied to the neuronal wiring diagram of the \textit{C. elegans}, for which it yields meaningful feedforward loops of the head and body motion systems. This framework sets the ground for the understanding and detection of community structures in directed networks.</description>

      <title>The Language of Influence: Sentiment, Emotion, and Hate Speech in State Sponsored Influence Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-sponsored influence operations (SIOs) have become a pervasive and complex challenge in the digital age, particularly on social media platforms where information spreads rapidly and with minimal oversight. These operations are strategically employed by nation-state actors to manipulate public opinion, exacerbate social divisions, and project geopolitical narratives, often through the dissemination of misleading or inflammatory content. Despite increasing awareness of their existence, the specific linguistic and emotional strategies employed by these campaigns remain underexplored. This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of sentiment, emotional valence, and abusive language across 2 million tweets attributed to influence operations linked to China, Iran, and Russia, using Twitter's publicly released dataset of state-affiliated accounts. We identify distinct affective and rhetorical patterns that characterize each nation's digital propaganda. Russian campaigns predominantly deploy negative sentiment and toxic language to intensify polarization and destabilize discourse. In contrast, Iranian operations blend antagonistic and supportive tones to simultaneously incite conflict and foster ideological alignment. Chinese activities emphasize positive sentiment and emotionally neutral rhetoric to promote favorable narratives and subtly influence global perceptions. These findings reveal how state actors tailor their information warfare tactics to achieve specific geopolitical objectives through differentiated content strategies.</description>
