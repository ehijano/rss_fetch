      <title>Hearing Health in Home Healthcare: Leveraging LLMs for Illness Scoring and ALMs for Vocal Biomarker Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for home healthcare calls for tools that can support care delivery. In this study, we explore automatic health assessment from voice using real-world home care visit data, leveraging the diverse patient information it contains. First, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) notes derived from unstructured audio transcripts and structured vital signs into a holistic illness score that reflects a patient's overall health. This compact representation facilitates cross-visit health status comparisons and downstream analysis. Next, we design a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline to extract short speech segments from target speakers in home care recordings for acoustic analysis. We then employ an Audio Language Model (ALM) to produce plain-language descriptions of vocal biomarkers and examine their association with individuals' health status. Our experimental results benchmark both commercial and open-source LLMs in estimating illness scores, demonstrating their alignment with actual clinical outcomes, and revealing that SOAP notes are substantially more informative than vital signs. Building on the illness scores, we provide the first evidence that ALMs can identify health-related acoustic patterns from home care recordings and present them in a human-readable form. Together, these findings highlight the potential of LLMs and ALMs to harness heterogeneous in-home visit data for better patient monitoring and care.</description>

      <title>Joint Estimation of Piano Dynamics and Metrical Structure with a Multi-task Multi-Scale Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating piano dynamic from audio recordings is a fundamental challenge in computational music analysis. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-task network that jointly predicts dynamic levels, change points, beats, and downbeats from a shared latent representation. These four targets form the metrical structure of dynamics in the music score. Inspired by recent vocal dynamic research, we use a multi-scale network as the backbone, which takes Bark-scale specific loudness as the input feature. Compared to log-Mel as input, this reduces model size from 14.7 M to 0.5 M, enabling long sequential input. We use a 60-second audio length in audio segmentation, which doubled the length of beat tracking commonly used. Evaluated on the public MazurkaBL dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across all tasks. This work sets a new benchmark for piano dynamic estimation and delivers a powerful and compact tool, paving the way for large-scale, resource-efficient analysis of musical expression.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Per-Channel Energy Normalization Front-end for Robust Audio Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In audio signal processing, learnable front-ends have shown strong performance across diverse tasks by optimizing task-specific representation. However, their parameters remain fixed once trained, lacking flexibility during inference and limiting robustness under dynamic complex acoustic environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptive paradigm for audio front-ends that replaces static parameterization with a closed-loop neural controller. Specifically, we simplify the learnable front-end LEAF architecture and integrate a neural controller for adaptive representation via dynamically tuning Per-Channel Energy Normalization. The neural controller leverages both the current and the buffered past subband energies to enable input-dependent adaptation during inference. Experimental results on multiple audio classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed adaptive front-end consistently outperforms prior fixed and learnable front-ends under both clean and complex acoustic conditions. These results highlight neural adaptability as a promising direction for the next generation of audio front-ends.</description>

      <title>MVDR Beamforming for Cyclostationary Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional acoustic beamformers assume that noise is stationary within short time frames. This assumption prevents them from exploiting correlations between frequencies in almost-periodic noise sources such as musical instruments, fans, and engines. These signals exhibit periodically varying statistics and are better modeled as cyclostationary processes. This paper introduces the cyclic MVDR (cMVDR) beamformer, an extension of the conventional MVDR that leverages both spatial and spectral correlations to improve noise reduction, particularly in low-SNR scenarios. The method builds on frequency-shifted (FRESH) filtering, where shifted versions of the input are combined to attenuate or amplify components that are coherent across frequency. To address inharmonicity, where harmonic partials deviate from exact integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, we propose a data-driven strategy that estimates resonant frequencies via periodogram analysis and computes the frequency shifts from their spacing. Analytical and experimental results demonstrate that performance improves with increasing spectral correlation. On real recordings, the cMVDR achieves up to 5 dB gain in scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) over the MVDR and remains effective even with a single microphone. Code is available at https://github.com/Screeen/cMVDR.</description>

      <title>ProLAP: Probabilistic Language-Audio Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-audio joint representation learning frameworks typically depend on deterministic embeddings, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between audio and text. In real-world settings, however, the language-audio relationship is inherently many-to-many: one audio segment can be described by multiple captions and vice versa. To address this, we propose Probabilistic Language-Audio Pre-training (ProLAP), which models multiplicity as the spread of probability distributions in a joint language-audio embedding space. To train the intra-modal hierarchical relationship effectively, we also introduce two objectives: (i) hierarchical inclusion loss to promote semantic hierarchical understanding of inputs and (ii) mask repulsive loss to improve the efficiency of learning when optimizing the hierarchical inclusion loss. With this training strategy, our model can learn the hierarchical structure inherent in the data even from small datasets, in contrast to prior probabilistic approaches that rely on large-scale datasets. In our experiments, ProLAP outperforms existing deterministic approaches on audio-text retrieval tasks. Moreover, through experiments on the audio traversal task introduced in this paper, we demonstrate that ProLAP captures the plausible semantic hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Buffer for Online Generative Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Speech Enhancement was mainly reserved for predictive models. A key advantage of these models is that for an incoming signal frame from a stream of data, the model is called only once for enhancement. In contrast, generative Speech Enhancement models often require multiple calls, resulting in a computational complexity that is too high for many online speech enhancement applications. This work presents the Diffusion Buffer, a generative diffusion-based Speech Enhancement model which only requires one neural network call per incoming signal frame from a stream of data and performs enhancement in an online fashion on a consumer-grade GPU. The key idea of the Diffusion Buffer is to align physical time with Diffusion time-steps. The approach progressively denoises frames through physical time, where past frames have more noise removed. Consequently, an enhanced frame is output to the listener with a delay defined by the Diffusion Buffer, and the output frame has a corresponding look-ahead. In this work, we extend upon our previous work by carefully designing a 2D convolutional UNet architecture that specifically aligns with the Diffusion Buffer's look-ahead. We observe that the proposed UNet improves performance, particularly when the algorithmic latency is low. Moreover, we show that using a Data Prediction loss instead of Denoising Score Matching loss enables flexible control over the trade-off between algorithmic latency and quality during inference. The extended Diffusion Buffer equipped with a novel NN and loss function drastically reduces the algorithmic latency from 320 - 960 ms to 32 - 176 ms with an even increased performance. While it has been shown before that offline generative diffusion models outperform predictive approaches in unseen noisy speech data, we confirm that the online Diffusion Buffer also outperforms its predictive counterpart on unseen noisy speech data.</description>

      <title>Transformer Redesign for Late Fusion of Audio-Text Features on Ultra-Low-Power Edge Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying emotion recognition systems in real-world environments where devices must be small, low-power, and private remains a significant challenge. This is especially relevant for applications such as tension monitoring, conflict de-escalation, and responsive wearables, where cloud-based solutions are impractical. Multimodal emotion recognition has advanced through deep learning, but most systems remain unsuitable for deployment on ultra-constrained edge devices. Prior work typically relies on powerful hardware, lacks real-time performance, or uses unimodal input. This paper addresses that gap by presenting a hardware-aware emotion recognition system that combines acoustic and linguistic features using a late-fusion architecture optimised for Edge TPU. The design integrates a quantised transformer-based acoustic model with frozen keyword embeddings from a DSResNet-SE network, enabling real-time inference within a 1.8MB memory budget and 21-23ms latency. The pipeline ensures spectrogram alignment between training and deployment using MicroFrontend and MLTK. Evaluation on re-recorded, segmented IEMOCAP samples captured through the Coral Dev Board Micro microphone shows a 6.3% macro F1 improvement over unimodal baselines. This work demonstrates that accurate, real-time multimodal emotion inference is achievable on microcontroller-class edge platforms through task-specific fusion and hardware-guided model design.</description>

      <title>ParaStyleTTS: Toward Efficient and Robust Paralinguistic Style Control for Expressive Text-to-Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling speaking style in text-to-speech (TTS) systems has become a growing focus in both academia and industry. While many existing approaches rely on reference audio to guide style generation, such methods are often impractical due to privacy concerns and limited accessibility. More recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to control speaking style through natural language prompts; however, their high computational cost, lack of interpretability, and sensitivity to prompt phrasing limit their applicability in real-time and resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose ParaStyleTTS, a lightweight and interpretable TTS framework that enables expressive style control from text prompts alone. ParaStyleTTS features a novel two-level style adaptation architecture that separates prosodic and paralinguistic speech style modeling. It allows fine-grained and robust control over factors such as emotion, gender, and age. Unlike LLM-based methods, ParaStyleTTS maintains consistent style realization across varied prompt formulations and is well-suited for real-world applications, including on-device and low-resource deployment. Experimental results show that ParaStyleTTS generates high-quality speech with performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based systems while being 30x faster, using 8x fewer parameters, and requiring 2.5x less CUDA memory. Moreover, ParaStyleTTS exhibits superior robustness and controllability over paralinguistic speaking styles, providing a practical and efficient solution for style-controllable text-to-speech generation.

      <title>A Stage-Wise Learning Strategy with Fixed Anchors for Robust Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning robust speaker representations under noisy conditions presents significant challenges, which requires careful handling of both discriminative and noise-invariant properties. In this work, we proposed an anchor-based stage-wise learning strategy for robust speaker representation learning. Specifically, our approach begins by training a base model to establish discriminative speaker boundaries, and then extract anchor embeddings from this model as stable references. Finally, a copy of the base model is fine-tuned on noisy inputs, regularized by enforcing proximity to their corresponding fixed anchor embeddings to preserve speaker identity under distortion. Experimental results suggest that this strategy offers advantages over conventional joint optimization, particularly in maintaining discrimination while improving noise robustness. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements across various noise conditions, potentially due to its ability to handle boundary stabilization and variation suppression separately.</description>

      <title>Noise-Conditioned Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Robust Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust speaker verification under noisy conditions remains an open challenge. Conventional deep learning methods learn a robust unified speaker representation space against diverse background noise and achieve significant improvement. In contrast, this paper presents a noise-conditioned mixture-ofexperts framework that decomposes the feature space into specialized noise-aware subspaces for speaker verification. Specifically, we propose a noise-conditioned expert routing mechanism, a universal model based expert specialization strategy, and an SNR-decaying curriculum learning protocol, collectively improving model robustness and generalization under diverse noise conditions. The proposed method can automatically route inputs to expert networks based on noise information derived from the inputs, where each expert targets distinct noise characteristics while preserving speaker identity information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate consistent superiority over baselines, confirming that explicit noise-dependent feature modeling significantly enhances robustness without sacrificing verification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Low-Rank Factorization for Robust Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large speech foundation models achieve strong performance across many domains, but they often require adaptation to handle local needs such as code-switching, where speakers mix languages within the same utterance. Direct fine-tuning of these models risks overfitting to the target domain and overwriting the broad capabilities of the base model. To address this challenge, we explore Bayesian factorized adapters for speech foundation models, which place priors near zero to achieve sparser adaptation matrices and thereby retain general performance while adapting to specific domains. We apply our approach to the Whisper model and evaluate on different multilingual code-switching scenarios. Our results show only minimal adaptation loss while significantly reducing catastrophic forgetting of the base model. Compared to LoRA, our method achieves a backward gain of 54% with only a 4% drop on the new domain. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Bayesian adaptation for fine-tuning speech foundation models without sacrificing generalization.</description>

      <title>Adapting Language Balance in Code-Switching Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite achieving impressive results on standard benchmarks, large foundational models still struggle against code-switching test cases. When data scarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the reason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the embedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the models to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to provide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on code-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points where recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis emphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation, we leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to highlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those locations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context bias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby improving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and Chinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places more correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error.</description>

      <title>Lightweight and Robust Multi-Channel End-to-End Speech Recognition with Spherical Harmonic Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents SHTNet, a lightweight spherical harmonic transform (SHT) based framework, which is designed to address cross-array generalization challenges in multi-channel automatic speech recognition (ASR) through three key innovations. First, SHT based spatial sound field decomposition converts microphone signals into geometry-invariant spherical harmonic coefficients, isolating signal processing from array geometry. Second, the Spatio-Spectral Attention Fusion Network (SSAFN) combines coordinate-aware spatial modeling, refined self-attention channel combinator, and spectral noise suppression without conventional beamforming. Third, Rand-SHT training enhances robustness through random channel selection and array geometry reconstruction. The system achieves 39.26\% average CER across heterogeneous arrays (e.g., circular, square, and binaural) on datasets including Aishell-4, Alimeeting, and XMOS, with 97.1\% fewer computations than conventional neural beamformers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21090v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a post-training approach that adapts self-supervised learning (SSL) models for deepfake speech detection by bridging the gap between general pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning. We present AntiDeepfake models, a series of post-trained models developed using a large-scale multilingual speech dataset containing over 56,000 hours of genuine speech and 18,000 hours of speech with various artifacts in over one hundred languages. Experimental results show that the post-trained models already exhibit strong robustness and generalization to unseen deepfake speech. When they are further fine-tuned on the Deepfake-Eval-2024 dataset, these models consistently surpass existing state-of-the-art detectors that do not leverage post-training. Model checkpoints and source code are available online.</description>

Abstract: Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in embodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.
