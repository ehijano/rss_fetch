      <title>Advancing Tritium Self-Sufficiency in Fusion Power Plants: Insights from the BABY Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of fusion power, achieving tritium self-sufficiency stands as a pivotal challenge. Tritium breeding within molten salts is a critical aspect of next-generation fusion reactors, yet experimental measurements of \gls{tbr} have remained elusive. Here we present the results of the \gls{baby} experiment, which represents a pioneering effort in tritium research by utilizing high-energy (\SI{14}{\mega\electronvolt}) neutron irradiation of molten salts, a departure from conventional low-energy neutron approaches. Using a small-scale (\SI{100}{\milli\litre}) molten salt tritium breeding setup, we not only simulated, but also directly measured a \gls{tbr}. This innovative approach provides crucial experimental validation, offering insights unattainable through simulation alone. Moreover, our findings reveal a surprising outcome: tritium was predominantly collected as HT, contrary to the expected TF. This underscores the complexity of tritium behavior in molten salts, highlighting the need for further investigation. This work lays the foundation for a more sophisticated experimental setup, including increasing the volume of the breeder, enhancing neutron detection, and refining tritium collection systems. Such improvements are crucial for advancing our understanding of fusion reactor feasibility and paving the way for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-linear shattered pellet injection modelling in ASDEX Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shattered pellet injection (SPI) is selected for the disruption mitigation system in ITER, due to deeper penetration, expected assimilation efficiency and prompt material delivery. This article describes non-linear simulations of SPI in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak to test the mitigation efficiency of different injection parameters for neon-doped deuterium pellets using the JOREK code. The simulations are executed as fluid simulations. Additional marker particles are used to evolve the charge state distribution of impurities based on OpenADAS atomic data, i.e., no coronal equilibrium assumption is made. Regarding the pellet composition, neon fraction scans from 0 - 10% are performed. Numerical results show that the thermal quench (TQ) occurs in two stages. In the first stage, approximately half of the thermal energy is lost abruptly, primarily through convective and conductive transport in the stochastic fields. This stage is relatively independent of the injection parameters. In the second stage, where the majority of the remaining thermal energy is lost, radiation plays a dominant role. In cases of very low neon content, this second stage may not occur at all. A larger fraction ($\sim $20%) of the total material in the pellet is assimilated in the plasma for low neon fraction pellets (0.12%) since the full thermal collapse of the plasma occurs later than in high neon fraction scenarios. Nevertheless, the total number of assimilated neon atoms increases with increasing neon fraction. The effects of fragment size and penetration speed are further studied. Slower and smaller fragments promote edge cooling and the formation of a cold front. Faster fragments result in shorter TQ duration and higher assimilation as they reach the hotter plasma regions quicker. Using synthetic diagnostics, comparisons of general trend between simulations and experiments are conducted.</description>

      <title>Distortions in Charged-Particle Images of Laser Direct-Drive Inertial Confinement Fusion Implosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic charged particles generated by inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions encode information about the spatial morphology of the hot-spot and dense fuel during the time of peak fusion reactions. The knock-on deuteron imager (KoDI) was developed at the Omega Laser Facility to image these particles in order to diagnose low-mode asymmetries in the hot-spot and dense fuel layer of cryogenic deuterium--tritium ICF implosions. However, the images collected are distorted in several ways that prevent reconstruction of the deuteron source. In this paper we describe these distortions and a series of attempts to mitigate or compensate for them. We present several potential mechanisms for the distortions, including a new model for scattering of charged particles in filamentary electric or magnetic fields surrounding the implosion. A novel particle-tracing methodology is developed and utilized to create synthetic KoDI data based on the filamentary field model that reproduces the main experimentally observed image distortions. We conclude with a discussion of the outlook for KoDI, and potential considerations for other charged-particle diagnostics.</description>

      <title>CT-imaging in Electrostatic Thruster Ion-Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ion-optic grid-system is the essential part of electrostatic ion thrusters governing performance and lifetime. Therefore reliable measurements of the grid and aperture geometry over the lifetime are necessary to understand and predict the behavior of the system. Many different methods of measurement were introduced over the years to tackle the challenges encountered when diagnosing single electrodes or the whole assembly at once.
  Modern industrial X-ray micro-computer-tomographs (uCT) offer the possibility to obtain a three-dimensional density map of a grid-system or it's components down to microscopic scales of precision. This information allows a spectrum of new diagnostic opportunities, like complete verification of the manufactured parts against CAD models, detecting internal defects or density-changes or the inspection of the assembled ion-optics and its internal alignment, which is normally prohibited by the lack of optical access to all parts at once. Hence uCT imaging is a promising tool to complement established methods and open up new experimental possibilities, however it also has its own weaknesses and pitfalls. The methods developed for grid-erosion and -geometry measurement of a small state-of-the-art radio-frequency-ion-thruster, the obstacles encountered along the route will be discussed and possible solutions demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection: parameters in reconnection models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Works on the energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection attract more attentions in recent years. Discussions on this topic, however, are often based on many simplifications, such as assuming a circularly flowing bulk plasma and a fixed orientation angle. A significant gap remains between theoretical models and the magnetic reconnection occurring in real astrophysical scenarios. In our previous work, we investigated the influence of orientation angle on energy extraction and figured out the differences between the plunging and circularly flowing bulk plasma. We introduced the concept of covering factor to quantify the capability of an accretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole. In this work, as an improvement, we extend our discussions by treating the parameters in reconnection models as free parameters, bringing the theoretical model closer to the situations in real astrophysical systems. We employ two reconnection models, in which the geometric index and the guide field fraction are respectively induced. We separately present the dependences of energy extraction on the geometric index and the guide field fraction. More importantly, we propose to define the averaged covering factor weighted by reconnection rate to quantify the overall capability of an accretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole, under the assumption that the magnetic reconnection process occurs stochastically and randomly within the ergosphere.</description>

      <title>Direct Evidence of a Highest Wave-Driven Energetic Electron Flux at the Earth's Magnetopause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacecraft observations of high-energy electron flux enhancement up to 125 keV at Earth's magnetopause are typically linked to the magnetic reconnection. Here, we report the first ever observation of prolonged electron flux enhancement reaching very high energy up to 650 keV at magnetopause near the subsolar point, notably without reconnection signatures. The observation reveals that the high-energy electron flux enhancement near the magnetopause is associated with the simultaneous occurrence of electron cyclotron wave harmonics, whistler waves, and Langmuir waves. Theoretical modeling confirms the wave generation by electron temperature anisotropy and the electron loss cone distribution. This direct, in-situ observation of high-energy electron flux linked to cascaded wave-particle interactions will help us advance our understanding about the tiniest electron-scale intricacies affecting near-Earth space weather.</description>

      <title>Energy Dissipation in Strong Collisionless Shocks: The Crucial Role of Ion-to-Electron Scale Separation in Particle-in-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy dissipation in collisionless shocks is a key mechanism in various astrophysical environments. Its non-linear nature complicates analytical understanding and necessitate Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. This study examines the impact of reducing the ion-to-electron mass ratio ($m_r$), to decrease computational cost, on energy partitioning in 1D3V (one spatial and three velocity-space dimensions) PIC simulations of strong, non-relativistic, parallel electron-ion collisionless shocks using the SHARP code. We compare simulations with a reduced mass ratio ($m_r = 100$) to those with a realistic mass ratio ($m_r = 1836$) for shocks with high ($\mathcal{M}_A = 21.3$) and low ($\mathcal{M}_A = 5.3$) Alfv$\acute{\text{e}}$n Mach numbers. Our findings show that the mass ratio significantly affects particle acceleration and thermal energy dissipation. At high $\mathcal{M}_A$, a reduced mass ratio leads to more efficient electron acceleration and an unrealistically high ion flux at higher momentum. At low $\mathcal{M}_A$, it causes complete suppression of electron acceleration, whereas the realistic mass ratio enables efficient electron acceleration. The reduced mass ratio also results in excessive electron heating and lower heating in downstream ions at both Mach numbers, with slightly more magnetic field amplification at low $\mathcal{M}_A$. Consequently, the electron-to-ion temperature ratio is high at low $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to reduced ion heating and remains high at high $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to increased electron heating. In contrast, simulations with the realistic $m_r$ show that the ion-to-electron temperature ratio is independent of the upstream magnetic field, a result not observed in reduced $m_r$ simulations.</description>

      <title>Validation of the static forward Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solvers in FreeGSNKE and Fiesta using EFIT++ reconstructions from MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key aspect in the modelling of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in tokamak devices is having access to fast, accurate, and stable numerical simulation methods. There is an increasing demand for reliable methods that can be used to develop traditional or machine learning-based shape control feedback systems, optimise scenario designs, and integrate with other plasma edge or transport modelling codes. To handle such applications, these codes need to be flexible and, more importantly, they need to have been validated against both analytically known and real-world tokamak equilibria to ensure they are consistent and credible. In this paper, we are interested in solving the static forward Grad-Shafranov (GS) problem for free-boundary MHD equilibria. Our focus is on the validation of the static forward solver in the Python-based equilibrium code FreeGSNKE by solving equilibria from magnetics-only EFIT++ reconstructions of MAST-U shots. In addition, we also validate FreeGSNKE against equilibria simulated using the well-established MATLAB-based equilibrium code Fiesta. To do this, we develop a computational pipeline that allows one to load the same (a)symmetric MAST-U machine description into each solver, specify the required inputs (active/passive conductor currents, plasma profiles and coefficients, etc.) from EFIT++, and solve the GS equation for all available time slices across a shot. For a number of different MAST-U shots, we demonstrate that both FreeGSNKE and Fiesta can successfully reproduce various poloidal flux quantities and shape targets (e.g. midplane radii, magnetic axes, separatrices, X-points, and strikepoints) in agreement with EFIT++ calculations to a very high degree of accuracy. We also provide public access to the code/data required to load the MAST-U machine description in FreeGSNKE/Fiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown.</description>

      <title>Relaxation model for a homogeneous plasma with spherically symmetric velocity space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the transport equations from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation when the velocity space is spherically symmetric. The Shkarofsky's form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth collision operator is employed in the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. A closed-form relaxation model for homogeneous plasmas could be presented in terms of Gauss hypergeometric2F1 functions. This has been accomplished based on the Maxwellian mixture model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classic models such as two-temperature thermal equilibrium model and thermodynamic equilibrium model are special cases of our relaxation model and the zeroth-order Braginskii heat transfer model can also be derived. The present relaxation model is a nonequilibrium model based on the hypothesis that the plasmas system possesses finitely distinguishable independent features, without relying on the conventional near-equilibrium assumption.</description>

      <title>Measurements of power dissipated in an atmospheric pressure plasma jet device with double plasma discharge ignition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) are versatile devices with numerous applications. This work focuses on APPJs generated at the tip of long, flexible tubes using the jet transfer technique. The plasma source consists of a primary discharge and a secondary discharge forming the plasma jet. Discharge power measurements were carried out in a way that it was possible to separate the contribution of the primary discharge from the total power dissipated by the plasma source. Both power and effective current were analyzed under different operating conditions. The results show that the variation of the primary discharge power is much lower than the power dissipated by the plasma jet. Additionally, the electrical characteristics of the plasma device were analyzed. Notable differences were observed between the negative and positive phases of the discharge, with a more resistive load in the negative one, which suggests that the electrical equivalent circuit model changes according to the voltage polarity.</description>

      <title>Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters for Deep Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the development of Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters (AF-MPDTs) present themselves to be an increasingly promising propulsion technology for deep space exploration missions. Various entities, ranging from state-sponsored institutions to privately-owned startups, have developed AF-MPDTs across a wide range of power levels. Current developments in superconducting technologies, namely High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) coils such as REBCO, have enabled research into the integration of HTS coils into the applied-field module to generate MPD thrust. Developments in space cryocoolers have opened the doors for HTS use within a spaceflight design of an AF-MPDT, where the applied-field module is at 40 K. A TRL of 4-5 has been reached by some AF-MPDT prototypes; venturing beyond this will require higher cooling power space cryocoolers to be developed in parallel and appropriately integrated into the thruster. Moreover, bespoke thermal control is required to maintain the thruster's extreme temperature gradient where the cryocooled HTS are in close proximity to the thruster cathode. More effective space power supply units with higher power generation is a further limitation to reaching TRL 9. This review examines the underlying principles behind AF-MPDT propulsion and the recent global developments in AF-MPDT technology, with an in-depth analysis and critical discussion on the spaceflight components necessary to permit AF-MPDTs to become a widely-adopted spaceflight-ready propulsion technology.</description>

      <title>A conservative, implicit solver for 0D-2V multi-species nonlinear Fokker-Planck collision equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present an optimal implicit algorithm specifically designed to accurately solve the multi-species nonlinear 0D-2V axisymmetric Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth (FPR) collision equation while preserving mass, momentum, and energy. Our approach relies on the utilization of nonlinear Shkarofsky's formula of FPR (FPRS) collision operator in the spherical-polar coordinate. The key innovation lies in the introduction of a new function named King, with the adoption of the Legendre polynomial expansion for the angular coordinate and King function expansion for the speed coordinate. The Legendre polynomial expansion will converge exponentially and the King method, a moment convergence algorithm, could ensure the conservation with high precision in discrete form. Additionally, post-step projection onto manifolds is employed to exactly enforce symmetries of the collision operators. Through solving several typical problems across various nonequilibrium configurations, we demonstrate the high accuracy and superior performance of the presented algorithm for weakly anisotropic plasmas.</description>
