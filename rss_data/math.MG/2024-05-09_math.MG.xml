      <title>Extrinsic Bonnet-Myers Theorem and almost rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the extrinsic Bonnet-Myers Theorem for compact Riemannian manifolds with positive Ricci curvature. And we show the almost rigidity for compact hypersurfaces, which have positive sectional curvature and almost maximal extrinsic diameter in Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Expansion and torsion homology of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Riemannian manifold is a called a good rational expander in dimension $i$ if every $i$-cycle bounds a rational $i+1$-chain of comparatively small volume. We construct 3-manifolds which are good expanders in all dimensions. On the other hand, we show that expanders must be topologically complicated: they must have lots of torsion homology. We also give some applications to topological overlap problems, constructing examples of 3-manifolds with large width over $\mathbb R^2$.</description>

      <title>Shadowing of actions of hyperbolic groups on their boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the canonical action of every hyperbolic group on its Gromov boundary has the shadowing (aka pseudo-orbit tracing) property. In particular, this recovers the results of Mann et al. that such actions are topologically stable.</description>

      <title>The Riemannian geometry of Sinkhorn divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new metric between probability measures on a compact metric space that mirrors the Riemannian manifold-like structure of quadratic optimal transport but includes entropic regularization. Its metric tensor is given by the Hessian of the Sinkhorn divergence, a debiased variant of entropic optimal transport. We precisely identify the tangent space it induces, which turns out to be related to a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). As usual in Riemannian geometry, the distance is built by looking for shortest paths. We prove that our distance is geodesic, metrizes the weak-star topology, and is equivalent to a RKHS norm. Still it retains the geometric flavor of optimal transport: as a paradigmatic example, translations are geodesics for the quadratic cost on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We also show two negative results on the Sinkhorn divergence that may be of independent interest: that it is not jointly convex, and that its square root is not a distance because it fails to satisfy the triangle inequality.</description>

      <title>Sobolev mappings on metric spaces and Minkowski dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the class of compactly H\"older mappings between metric spaces and determine the extent to which they distort the Minkowski dimension of a given set. These mappings are defined purely with metric notions and can be seen as a generalization of Sobolev mappings, without the requirement for a measure on the source space. In fact, we show that if $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous mapping lying in some super-critical Newtonian-Sobolev space $N^{1,p}(X,\mu)$, under standard assumptions on the metric measure space $(X,d,\mu)$, it is then a compactly H\"older mapping. The dimension distortion result we obtain is new even for Sobolev mappings between weighted Euclidean spaces and generalizes previous results of Kaufman and Bishop-Hakobyan-Williams.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral Horofunction Compactification as a Polyhedral Ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:1607.00564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we answer positively a question raised by Kapovich and Leeb in a paper titled "Finsler bordifications of symmetric and certain locally symmetric spaces". Specifically, we show that for a finite-dimensional vector space with a polyhedral norm, its horofunction compactification is homeomorphic to the dual unit ball of the norm by an explicit map. To prove this, we establish a criterion for converging sequences in the horofunction compactification and generalize the basic notion of the moment map in the theory of toric varieties.</description>

      <title>Computing the Gromov--Hausdorff distance using gradient methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13660v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gromov--Hausdorff distance measures the difference in shape between metric spaces and poses a notoriously difficult problem in combinatorial optimization. We introduce its quadratic relaxation over a convex polytope whose solutions provably deliver the Gromov--Hausdorff distance. The optimality guarantee is enabled by the fact that the search space of our approach is not constrained to a generalization of bijections, unlike in other relaxations such as the Gromov--Wasserstein distance.
  We suggest conditional gradient descent for solving the relaxation in cubic time per iteration, and demonstrate its performance on metric spaces of hundreds of points. In particular, we use it to obtain a new bound of the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between the unit circle and the unit hemisphere equipped with Euclidean metric. Our approach is implemented as a Python package dGH.</description>
