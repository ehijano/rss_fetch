      <title>Scale Free Projections Arise from Bipartite Random Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree distribution of a real world network -- the number of links per node -- often follows a power law, with some hubs having many more links than traditional graph generation methods predict. For years, preferential attachment and growth have been the proposed mechanisms that lead to these scale free networks. However, the two sides of bipartite graphs like collaboration networks are usually not scale free, and are therefore not well-explained by these processes. Here we develop a bipartite extension to the Randomly Stopped Linking Model and show that mixtures of geometric distributions lead to power laws according to a Central Limit Theorem for distributions with high variance. The two halves of the actor-movie network are not scale free and can be represented by just 5 geometric distributions, but they combine to form a scale free actor-actor unipartite projection without preferential attachment or growth. This result supports our claim that scale free networks are the natural result of many Bernoulli trials with high variance of which preferential attachment and growth are only one example.</description>

      <title>Social media algorithms can curb misinformation, but do they?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent article in $\textit{Science}$ by Guess et al. estimated the effect of Facebook's news feed algorithm on exposure to misinformation and political information among Facebook users. However, its reporting and conclusions did not account for a series of temporary emergency changes to Facebook's news feed algorithm in the wake of the 2020 U.S. presidential election that were designed to diminish the spread of voter-fraud misinformation. Here, we demonstrate that these emergency measures systematically reduced the amount of misinformation in the control group of the study, which was using the news feed algorithm. This issue may have led readers to misinterpret the results of the study and to conclude that the Facebook news feed algorithm used outside of the study period mitigates political misinformation as compared to reverse chronological feed.</description>

      <title>Social Media Bot Policies: Evaluating Passive and Active Enforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) holds significant promise for transforming social media platforms. However, this advancement also introduces substantial security and ethical concerns, as it may facilitate malicious actors in the exploitation of online users. We aim to evaluate the strength of security protocols on prominent social media platforms in mitigating the deployment of MFM bots. We examined the bot and content policies of eight popular social media platforms: X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, Facebook, Threads, TikTok, Mastodon, Reddit, and LinkedIn. Using Selenium, we developed a web bot to test bot deployment and AI-generated content policies and their enforcement mechanisms. Our findings indicate significant vulnerabilities within the current enforcement mechanisms of these platforms. Despite having explicit policies against bot activity, all platforms failed to detect and prevent the operation of our MFM bots. This finding reveals a critical gap in the security measures employed by these social media platforms, underscoring the potential for malicious actors to exploit these weaknesses to disseminate misinformation, commit fraud, or manipulate users.</description>

      <title>The Nexus of AR/VR, Large Language Models, UI/UX, and Robotics Technologies in Enhancing Learning and Social Interaction for Children: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of large language models (LLMs), augmented reality (AR), and user interface/user experience (UI/UX) design in therapies for children, especially with disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is examined in this review study. 150 publications were found by a thorough literature search throughout PubMed, ACM, IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, and Google Scholar; 42 of them were chosen for in-depth study due to their methodological rigor and relevance. Three primary areas are covered in this review: how AR can improve social and learning results; how LLMs can help with communication; and how UI/UX design affects how effective these technologies are. Results reveal that while LLMs can provide individualized learning and communication support, AR has demonstrated promise in enhancing social skills, motivation, and attention. For children with ASD, accessible and interesting interventions depend heavily on effective UI/UX design. To optimize the benefits of these technologies in ASD therapies, the study emphasizes the need for additional research to address difficulties related to customization, accessibility, and integration.</description>

      <title>Measuring Research Interest Similarity with Transition Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to measure the similarity of papers and authors by simulating a literature search procedure on citation networks, which is an information retrieval inspired conceptualization of similarity. This transition probability (TP) based approach does not require a curated classification system, avoids clustering complications, and provides a continuous measure of similarity. We perform testing scenarios to explore several versions of the general TP concept and the Node2vec machine-learning technique. We found that TP measures outperform Node2vec in mapping the macroscopic structure of fields. The paper provides a general discussion of how to implement TP similarity measurement, with a particular focus on how to utilize publication-level information to approximate the research interest similarity of individual scientists. This paper is accompanied by a Python package capable of calculating all the tested metrics.</description>

      <title>easylayout: an R package for interactive force-directed layouts within RStudio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation
  Network visualization is critical for effective communication in various fields of knowledge. Currently, a gap separates network manipulation from network visualization in programming environments. Users often export network data to be laid out in external interactive software, like Cytoscape and Gephi. We argue the current R package ecosystem lacks an interactive layout engine well integrated with common data analysis workflows.
  Results
  We present easylayout, an R package that bridges network manipulation and visualization by leveraging interactive force simulations within the IDE itself (e.g., RStudio, VSCode). It is not yet another visualization library, but instead aims to interconnect existing libraries and streamline their usage into the R ecosystem. easylayout takes an igraph object and serializes it into a web application integrated with the IDE's interface through a Shiny server. The app lays out the network by simulating attraction and repulsion forces. Simulation parameters can be adjusted in real-time. An editing mode allows moving and rotating nodes. The implementation aims for performance, so that even lower-end devices are able to work with relatively large networks. Once the user finishes tweaking the layout, it is sent back to the R session to be plotted through popular libraries like ggraph, igraph or even the base package itself. The current implementation focuses on the R ecosystem, but using web technologies makes it easily portable to similar environments, like Python/Jupyter Notebooks. We expect this tool to reduce the time spent searching for suitable network layouts, ultimately allowing researchers to generate more compelling figures.
  Availability and implementation
  easylayout is freely available under an MIT license on GitHub (https://github.com/dalmolingroup/easylayout). The package is implemented in R/Shiny and JavaScript/Svelte.</description>

      <title>Neural Collaborative Filtering to Detect Anomalies in Human Semantic Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human trajectory anomaly detection has become increasingly important across a wide range of applications, including security surveillance and public health. However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscopic reorganization of network communities across different scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of structural heterogeneity is pervasive in real networks, and their community organization is no exception. Still, a vast majority of community detection methods assume neatly hierarchically organized communities of a characteristic scale for a given hierarchical level. In this work, we demonstrate that the reality of scale-dependent community reorganization is convoluted with simultaneous processes of community splitting and merging, challenging the conventional understanding of community-scale adjustment. We provide the mathematical argument on the modularity function, the results from the real-network analysis, and a simple network model for a comprehensive understanding of the nontrivial community reorganization process characterized by a local dip in the number of communities as the resolution parameter varies. This study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in the study of network communities, which emphasizes the importance of considering scale-dependent reorganization to better understand the genuine structural organization of networks.</description>

      <title>Positional Encoder Graph Quantile Neural Networks for Geographic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positional Encoder Graph Neural Networks (PE-GNNs) are a leading approach for modeling continuous spatial data. However, they often fail to produce calibrated predictive distributions, limiting their effectiveness for uncertainty quantification. We introduce the Positional Encoder Graph Quantile Neural Network (PE-GQNN), a novel method that integrates PE-GNNs, Quantile Neural Networks, and recalibration techniques in a fully nonparametric framework, requiring minimal assumptions about the predictive distributions. We propose a new network architecture that, when combined with a quantile-based loss function, yields accurate and reliable probabilistic models without increasing computational complexity. Our approach provides a flexible, robust framework for conditional density estimation, applicable beyond spatial data contexts. We further introduce a structured method for incorporating a KNN predictor into the model while avoiding data leakage through the GNN layer operation. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PE-GQNN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Soft Measures for Extracting Causal Collective Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling collective intelligence is essential for addressing complex social systems. Directed graphs called fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) offer a powerful tool for encoding causal mental models, but extracting high-integrity FCMs from text is challenging. This study presents an approach using large language models (LLMs) to automate FCM extraction. We introduce novel graph-based similarity measures and evaluate them by correlating their outputs with human judgments through the Elo rating system. Results show positive correlations with human evaluations, but even the best-performing measure exhibits limitations in capturing FCM nuances. Fine-tuning LLMs improves performance, but existing measures still fall short. This study highlights the need for soft similarity measures tailored to FCM extraction, advancing collective intelligence modeling with NLP.</description>

      <title>Fusing Dynamics Equation: A Social Opinions Prediction Algorithm with LLM-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context where social media is increasingly becoming a significant platform for social movements and the formation of public opinion, accurately simulating and predicting the dynamics of user opinions is of great importance for understanding social phenomena, policy making, and guiding public opinion. However, existing simulation methods face challenges in capturing the complexity and dynamics of user behavior. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes an innovative simulation method for the dynamics of social media user opinions, the FDE-LLM algorithm, which incorporates opinion dynamics and epidemic model. This effectively constrains the actions and opinion evolution process of large language models (LLM), making them more aligned with the real cyber world. In particular, the FDE-LLM categorizes users into opinion leaders and followers. Opinion leaders are based on LLM role-playing and are constrained by the CA model, while opinion followers are integrated into a dynamic system that combines the CA model with the SIR model. This innovative design significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation. Experiments were conducted on four real Weibo datasets and validated using the open-source model ChatGLM. The results show that, compared to traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) opinion dynamics algorithms and LLM-based opinion diffusion algorithms, our FDE-LLM algorithm demonstrates higher accuracy and interpretability.</description>
