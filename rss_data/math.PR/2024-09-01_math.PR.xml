      <title>Concentration and mean field approximation results for Markov processes on large networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Markov processes on weighted directed hypergraphs where the state of at most one vertex can change at a time. Our setting is general enough to include simplicial epidemic processes, processes on multilayered networks or even the dynamics of the edges of a graph.
  Our results are twofold. Firstly, we prove concentration bounds for the number of vertices in a certain state under mild assumptions. Our results imply that even the empirical averages of subpopulations of diverging but possibly sublinear size are well concentrated around their mean. In the case of undirected weighted graphs, we completely characterize when said averages concentrate around their expected value.
  Secondly, we prove (under assumptions which are tight in some significant cases) upper bounds for the error of the N-Intertwined Mean Field Approximation (NIMFA). In particular, for symmetric unweighted graphs, the error has the same order of magnitude as the reciprocal of the average degree, improving the previously known state of the art bound of the inverse square root of the average degree.</description>

      <title>Local times in critical generations of a random walk in random environment on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a null-recurrent randomly biased walk $\mathbb{X}$ on a Galton-Watson tree in the (sub)-diffusive regime and we prove that properly renormalized, the local time in a critical generation converges in law towards some function of a stable continuous-state branching process. We also provide an explicit equivalent of the probability that critical generations are reached by the random walk $\mathbb{X}$.</description>

      <title>Max-semistable extreme value laws for autoregressive processes with Cantor-like marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a family of autoregressive processes with marginal distributions resembling the Cantor function. It is shown that the marginal distribution is in the domain of attraction of a max-semistable distribution. The main result is that the extreme value law for the autoregressive process is obtained by including an extremal index in the law for an i.i.d.\ process with the same marginal distribution. Connections with extremes in deterministic dynamical systems and the relevance of max-semistable distributions in that context are also pointed out.</description>

      <title>Aliasing Effects for Samples of Spin Random Fields on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates aliasing effects emerging from the reconstruction from discrete samples of spin spherical random fields defined on the two-dimensional sphere. We determine the location in the frequency domain and the intensity of the aliases of the harmonic coefficients in the Fourier decomposition of the spin random field and evaluate the consequences of aliasing errors in the angular power spectrum when the samples of the random field are obtained by using some very popular sampling procedures on the sphere, the equiangular and the Gauss-Jacobi sampling schemes. Finally, we demonstrate that band-limited spin random fields are free from aliases, provided that a sufficiently large number of nodes is used in the selected quadrature rule.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of causal distributionally robust optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the causal distributionally robust optimization (DRO) in both discrete- and continuous- time settings. The framework captures model uncertainty, with potential models penalized in function of their adapted Wasserstein distance to a given reference model. Strength of the penalty is controlled using a real-valued parameter, which is simply the radius of the uncertainty ball in the special case of an indicator penalty. Our main results derive the first-order sensitivity of the value of causal DRO with respect to the penalization parameter, i.e., we compute the sensitivity to model uncertainty. Moreover, we investigate the case where a martingale constraint is imposed on the underlying model, as is the case for pricing measures in mathematical finance. We introduce different scaling regimes, which allow us to obtain the continuous-time sensitivities as nontrivial limits of their discrete-time counterparts. We illustrate our results with examples.
  Our proofs rely on novel methods. In particular, we introduce pathwise Malliavin derivative, which agree a.s. with its classical counterpart under the Wiener measure, and we extend the adjoint operator, the Skorokhod integral, to regular martingale integrators and show it satisfies a stochastic Fubini theorem.</description>

      <title>The variational principle for a marked Gibbs point process with infinite-range multibody interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Gibbs variational principle for the Asakura--Oosawa model in which particles of random size obey a hardcore constraint of non-overlap and are additionally subject to a temperature-dependent area interaction. The particle size is unbounded, leading to infinite-range interactions, and the potential cannot be written as a $k$-body interaction for fixed $k$. As a byproduct, we also prove the existence of infinite-volume Gibbs point processes satisfying the DLR equations. The essential control over the influence of boundary conditions can be established using the geometry of the model and the hard-core constraint.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of log-correlated fields from multiplicative chaos measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider log-correlated random fields $X$ and the associated multiplicative chaos measures $\mu_{\gamma,X}$. Our results reconstruct the underlying field $X$ from the multiplicative chaos measure $\nu_{\gamma,X}$. The new feature of our results is that we allow the dimension $d$ to be arbitrary and cover also the critical case $\gamma=\sqrt{2d}$. In the sub-critical regime $\gamma&lt;\sqrt{2d}$, we allow the fields to be mildly non-Gaussian, that is, the field has the decomposition $X=G+H$ with a log-correlated Gaussian field $G$ and a H\"older-continuos (not necessarily Gaussian) field $H$.</description>

      <title>The random periodic solutions for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study well-posedness of random periodic solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of McKean-Vlasov type driven by a two-sided Brownian motion, where the random periodic behaviour is characterised by the equations' long-time behaviour. Given the well-known connection between McKean-Vlasov SDEs and interacting particle systems, we show propagation of chaos and that the key properties of the interacting particle systems recover those of the McKean-Vlasov SDEs in the particle limit. All results in the present work are shown under two settings: fully and partially dissipative case. Each setting has its challenges and limitations. For instance, weakening full dissipativity to partial dissipativity demands stronger structural assumptions on the equations' dynamics and yields random periodic behaviour in the weak sense instead of pathwise sense (as in the full dissipativity case). The proof mechanisms are close but fundamentally different.</description>

      <title>Optimal Ratcheting of Dividends with Irreversible Reinsurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an insurance company that faces two key constraints: a ratcheting dividend constraint and an irreversible reinsurance constraint. The company allocates part of its reserve to pay dividends to its shareholders while strategically purchasing reinsurance for its claims. The ratcheting dividend constraint ensures that dividend cuts are prohibited at any time. The irreversible reinsurance constraint ensures that reinsurance contracts cannot be prematurely terminated or sold to external entities. The dividend rate level and the reinsurance level are modelled as nondecreasing processes, thereby satisfying the constraints. The incurred claims are modelled via a Brownian risk model. The main objective is to maximize the cumulative expected discounted dividend payouts until the time of ruin. The reinsurance and dividend levels belong to either a finite set or a closed interval. The optimal value functions for the finite set case and the closed interval case are proved to be the unique viscosity solutions of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and the convergence between these optimal value functions is established. For the finite set case, a threshold strategy is proved to be optimal, while for the closed interval case, an $\epsilon$-optimal strategy is constructed. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the optimality conditions and optimal strategies.</description>

      <title>On the fixation probability of an advantageous allele in a population with skewed offspring distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an advantageous allele that arises in a haploid population of size $N$ evolving in continuous time according to a skewed reproduction mechanism, which generates under neutrality genealogies lying in the domain of attraction of a Beta$(2-\alpha, \alpha)$-coalescent for $\alpha \in (1,2)$. We prove in a setting of moderate selection that the fixation probability $\pi_N$ of the advantageous allele is asymptotically equal to $\alpha^{1/(\alpha-1)} s_N^{1/(\alpha-1)} $ , where $s_N$ is the selection strength of the advantageous allele. Our proof uses duality with a suitable $\Lambda$-ancestral selection graph.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit for an open facilitated exclusion process with slow and fast boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the symmetric facilitated exclusion process (FEP) on the finite one-dimensional lattice $\lbrace 1,\dots ,N-1\rbrace$ when put in contact with boundary reservoirs, whose action is subject to an additional kinetic constraint in order to enforce ergodicity, and whose speed is of order $N^{-\theta}$ for some parameter $\theta$. We derive its hydrodynamic limit as $N\to\infty$, in the diffusive space-time scaling, when the initial density profile is supercritical. More precisely, the macroscopic density of particles evolves in the bulk according to a fast diffusion equation as in the periodic case, which is now subject to boundary conditions that can be of Dirichlet, Robin or Neumann type depending on the parameter $\theta$. In the Dirichlet case, the FEP exhibits a very peculiar behaviour: unlike for the classical SSEP, and due to the two-phased nature of FEP, the reservoirs impose boundary densities which do not coincide with their equilibrium densities. The proof is based on the classical entropy method, but requires significant adaptations to account for the FEP's non-product stationary states and to deal with the non-equilibrium setting.</description>

      <title>Extending the noise of splitting to its completion and stability of Brownian maxima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic noise of splitting, defined initially on the (basic) algebra of unions of intervals of the real line, is extended to a maximal class of domains. The $\sigma$-fields of this largest extension constitute the completion, in the sense of noise-type Boolean algebras, of the range of the unextended (basic) splitting noise. A Lebesgue measurable domain to which the extension is possible is characterized by a certain stability property: under independent perturbation of Brownian increments off the domain, of the times of Brownian local maxima belonging to the domain; together with the same property for the complement of the domain. A set that is equal to an open set modulo a Lebesgue negligible one, with the same being true of its complement, has this stability property, but others have it too: the extension is non-trivial. Some domains are totally unstable with respect to the indicated perturbation, and to them the extension cannot be made.</description>

      <title>Regularization by Nonlinear Noise for PDEs: Well-posedness and Finite Time Extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the regularization by nonlinear noise for a class of partial differential equations that may only have local solutions. In particular, we obtain the global existence, uniqueness and the Feller property for stochastic 3D Navier-Stokes equations, which provide positive answers to some longstanding open problems in this field.
  Moreover, we discover a new phenomenon that for a potentially explosive deterministic system, an appropriate intervention of nonlinear noise can not only prevent blow-up but also lead to the finite time extinction of the associated stochastic system. Our main results have broad applications, including stochastic $p$-Laplace equations with heat sources, stochastic surface growth models and stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations.</description>

      <title>Complexity of High-Dimensional Identity Testing with Coordinate Conditional Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the identity testing problem for high-dimensional distributions. Given as input an explicit distribution $\mu$, an $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and access to sampling oracle(s) for a hidden distribution $\pi$, the goal in identity testing is to distinguish whether the two distributions $\mu$ and $\pi$ are identical or are at least $\varepsilon$-far apart. When there is only access to full samples from the hidden distribution $\pi$, it is known that exponentially many samples (in the dimension) may be needed for identity testing, and hence previous works have studied identity testing with additional access to various "conditional" sampling oracles. We consider a significantly weaker conditional sampling oracle, which we call the $\mathsf{Coordinate\ Oracle}$, and provide a computational and statistical characterization of the identity testing problem in this new model.
  We prove that if an analytic property known as approximate tensorization of entropy holds for an $n$-dimensional visible distribution $\mu$, then there is an efficient identity testing algorithm for any hidden distribution $\pi$ using $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ queries to the $\mathsf{Coordinate\ Oracle}$. Approximate tensorization of entropy is a pertinent condition as recent works have established it for a large class of high-dimensional distributions. We also prove a computational phase transition: for a well-studied class of $n$-dimensional distributions, specifically sparse antiferromagnetic Ising models over $\{+1,-1\}^n$, we show that in the regime where approximate tensorization of entropy fails, there is no efficient identity testing algorithm unless $\mathsf{RP}=\mathsf{NP}$. We complement our results with a matching $\Omega(n/\varepsilon)$ statistical lower bound for the sample complexity of identity testing in the $\mathsf{Coordinate\ Oracle}$ model.</description>
