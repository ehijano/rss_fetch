      <title>Sample Complexity of Branch-length Estimation by Maximum Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the branch-length estimation problem on a bifurcating tree: a character evolves along the edges of a binary tree according to a two-state symmetric Markov process, and we seek to recover the edge transition probabilities from repeated observations at the leaves. This problem arises in phylogenetics, and is related to latent tree graphical model inference. In general, the log-likelihood function is non-concave and may admit many critical points. Nevertheless, simple coordinate maximization has been known to perform well in practice, defying the complexity of the likelihood landscape. In this work, we provide the first theoretical guarantee as to why this might be the case. We show that deep inside the Kesten-Stigum reconstruction regime, provided with polynomially many $m$ samples (assuming the tree is balanced), there exists a universal parameter regime (independent of the size of the tree) where the log-likelihood function is strongly concave and smooth with high probability. On this high-probability likelihood landscape event, we show that the standard coordinate maximization algorithm converges exponentially fast to the maximum likelihood estimator, which is within $O(1/\sqrt{m})$ from the true parameter, provided a sufficiently close initial point.</description>

      <title>Sampling from high-dimensional, multimodal distributions using automatically tuned, tempered Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is widely used for sampling from high dimensional target distributions with densities known up to proportionality. While HMC exhibits favorable scaling properties in high dimensions, it struggles with strongly multimodal distributions. Tempering methods are commonly used to address multimodality, but they can be difficult to tune, especially in high dimensional settings. In this study, we propose a method that combines tempering with HMC to enable efficient sampling from high dimensional, strongly multimodal distributions. Our approach simulates the dynamics of a time-varying Hamiltonian in which the temperature increases and then decreases over time. In the first phase, the simulated trajectory gradually explores low-density regions farther from the mode; the second phase guides it back toward a local mode. We develop efficient tuning strategies based on a time-scale transformation under which the Hamiltonian becomes approximately stationary. This leads to a tempered Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (THMC) algorithm with automatic tuning. We demonstrate numerically that our method scales more effectively with dimension than adaptive parallel tempering and tempered sequential Monte Carlo. Finally, we apply our THMC to sample from strongly multimodal posterior distributions arising in Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>Robust Matrix Completion for Discrete Rating-Scale Data: Coping with Fake Profiles in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are essential tools in the digital landscape for connecting users with content that more closely aligns with their preferences. Matrix completion is a widely used statistical framework for such systems, aiming to predict a user's preferences for items they have not yet rated by leveraging the observed ratings in a partially filled user-item rating matrix. Realistic applications of matrix completion in recommender systems must address several challenges that are too often neglected: (i) the discrete nature of rating-scale data, (ii) the presence of malicious users who manipulate the system to their advantage through the creation of fake profiles, and (iii) missing-not-at-random patterns, where users are more likely to rate items they expect to enjoy. Our goal in this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel matrix completion method, robust discrete matrix completion (RDMC), designed specifically to handle the discrete nature of sparse rating-scale data and to remain reliable in the presence of adversarial manipulation. We evaluate RDMC through carefully designed experiments and realistic case studies. Our work therefore, secondly, offers a statistically-sound blueprint for future studies on how to evaluate matrix completion methods for recommender systems under realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Performance Of The Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm Without Smoothness Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the problem of sampling from distributions whose densities are not necessarily smooth nor logconcave. We propose a simple Langevin-based algorithm that does not rely on popular but computationally challenging techniques, such as the Moreau-Yosida envelope or Gaussian smoothing, and show consequently that the performance of samplers like ULA does not necessarily degenerate arbitrarily with low regularity. In particular, we show that the Lipschitz or H\"older continuity assumption can be replaced by a geometric one-sided Lipschitz condition that allows even for discontinuous log-gradients. We derive non-asymptotic guarantees for the convergence of the algorithm to the target distribution in Wasserstein distances. Non-asymptotic bounds are also provided for the performance of the algorithm as an optimizer, specifically for the solution of associated excess risk optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Signed Exponential Random Graph Models under Local Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional network analysis focuses on binary edges, while real-world relationships are more nuanced, encompassing cooperation, neutrality, and conflict. The rise of negative edges in social media discussions spurred interest in analyzing signed interactions, especially in polarized debates. However, the vast data generated by digital networks presents challenges for traditional methods like Stochastic Block Models (SBM) and Exponential Family Random Graph Models (ERGM), particularly due to the homogeneity assumption and global dependence, which become increasingly unrealistic as network size grows. To address this, we propose a novel method that combines the strengths of SBM and ERGM while mitigating their weaknesses by incorporating local dependence based on non-overlapping blocks. Our approach involves a two-step process: first, decomposing the network into sub-networks using SBM approximation, and then estimating parameters using ERGM methods. We validate our method on large synthetic networks and apply it to a signed Wikipedia network of thousands of editors. Through the use of local dependence, we find patterns consistent with structural balance theory.</description>
