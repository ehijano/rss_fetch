      <title>Condensed Group Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensed mathematics as developed by Clausen and Scholze yields a version of derived functors over the category of continuous $G$-modules for a Hausdorff topological group $G$. We study the resulting notion of group cohomology and its relation to continuous group cohomology and the condensed/sheaf/singular cohomology of classifying spaces. While condensed group cohomology is generally a more refined invariant than continuous group cohomology, we show that for a broad class of topological groups, continuous group cohomology with solid coefficients, such as locally profinite continuous $G$-modules, can be realized as a derived functor in the condensed setting. We also revisit cornerstones of condensed mathematics, paying special attention to set-theoretic size issues. To this end, we review a framework for working with accessible (hyper)sheaves on large sites satisfying suitable accessibility conditions and show that the associated categories retain many topos-like properties. Moreover, we generalize identifications of condensed with sheaf cohomology obtained by Clausen and Scholze.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Foundations of Fuzzy Simplicial Sets for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy simplicial sets have become an object of interest in dimensionality reduction and manifold learning, most prominently through their role in UMAP. However, their definition through tools from algebraic topology without a clear probabilistic interpretation detaches them from commonly used theoretical frameworks in those areas. In this work we introduce a framework that explains fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets. In particular, this perspective shows that the fuzzy weights of UMAP arise from a generative model that samples Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales, yielding cumulative distribution functions of pairwise distances. More generally, the framework connects fuzzy simplicial sets to probabilistic models on the face poset, clarifies the relation between Kullback-Leibler divergence and fuzzy cross-entropy in this setting, and recovers standard t-norms and t-conorms via Boolean operations on the underlying simplicial sets. We then show how new embedding methods may be derived from this framework and illustrate this on an example where we generalize UMAP using \v{C}ech filtrations with triplet sampling. In summary, this probabilistic viewpoint provides a unified probabilistic theoretical foundation for fuzzy simplicial sets, clarifies the role of UMAP within this framework, and enables the systematic derivation of new dimensionality reduction methods.</description>

      <title>On the topological complexity of directed parametrized motion planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a parametrized analogue of the directed topological complexity, originally developed by Goubault, Farber, and Sagnier. We establish the fibrewise basic dihomotopy invariance of directed parametrized topological complexity and explore its relationship with the parametrized topological complexity. In addition, we introduce the concept of the directed Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) category, prove its basic dihomotopy invariance, and investigate its connections with both directed topological complexity and directed parametrized topological complexity. We further investigate additional properties of our invariant and examine its connections with several other invariants that arise naturally in the context of topological robotics. Moreover, we compute the directed parametrized topological complexity of the Hopf fibrations and the Fadell-Neuwirth fibrations having specific directed fibration structures.</description>

      <title>Fibered ribbon pretzels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify fibered ribbon pretzel knots up to mutation. The classification is complete, except perhaps for members of Lecuona's ``exceptional'' family of [Lec15]. The result is obtained by combining lattice embedding techniques with Gabai's classification of fibered pretzel knots, and exhibiting ribbon disks, some of which lie outside of known patterns for standard pretzel projections.</description>

      <title>Filtration-Based Representation Learning for Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a filtration on temporal graphs based on $\delta$-temporal motifs (recurrent subgraphs), yielding a multi-scale representation of temporal structure. Our temporal filtration allows tools developed for filtered static graphs, including persistent homology and recent graph filtration kernels, to be applied directly to temporal graph analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on temporal graph classification tasks.</description>
