      <title>Groupoid Cardinality and Random Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If we treat the symmetric group $S_n$ as a probability measure space where each element has measure $1/n!$, then the number of cycles in a permutation becomes a random variable. The Cycle Length Lemma describes the expected values of products of these random variables. Here we categorify the Cycle Length Lemma by showing that it follows from an equivalence between groupoids.</description>

      <title>The $S_\bullet$-construction as an equivalence between 2-Segal spaces and stable augmented double Segal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note is a contribution for a proceedings volume of the workshop "Higher Segal Spaces and their Applications to Algebraic K-Theory, Hall Algebras, and Combinatorics". The content is a streamlined exposition based on a talk about a result by Bergner-Osorno-Ozornova-Rovelli-Scheimbauer from WITII. We discuss how a generalized version of Waldhausen's S-construction describes a correspondence between 2-Segal spaces and certain double Segal spaces, which satisfy further conditions of stability and augmentation.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of non-negligible objects of moderate growth in braided categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field, and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a Cauchy complete $k$-linear braided category with finite dimensional morphism spaces and ${{\rm End}(\bf 1)}=k$. We call an indecomposable object $X$ of $\mathcal C$ non-negligible if there exists $Y\in \mathcal{C}$ such that $\bf 1$ is a direct summand of $Y\otimes X$. We prove that every non-negligible object $X\in \mathcal{C}$ such that ${\rm dim}{\rm End}(X^{\otimes n})&lt;n!$ for some $n$ is automatically rigid. In particular, if $\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple of moderate growth and weakly rigid, then $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid. As applications, we simplify Huang's proof of rigidity of representation categories of certain vertex operator algebras, and we get that for a finite semisimple monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$, the data of a $\mathcal{C}$-modular functor is equivalent to a modular fusion category structure on $\mathcal{C}$, answering a question of Bakalov and Kirillov. Finally, we show that if $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid and has moderate growth, then the quantum trace of any nilpotent endomorphism in $\mathcal{C}$ is zero. Hence $\mathcal{C}$ admits a semisimplification, which is a semisimple braided tensor category of moderate growth.</description>

      <title>Towards structure-preserving quantum encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing the potential computational advantage of quantum computers for machine learning tasks relies on the uploading of classical data onto quantum computers through what are commonly referred to as quantum encodings. The choice of such encodings may vary substantially from one task to another, and there exist only a few cases where structure has provided insight into their design and implementation, such as symmetry in geometric quantum learning. Here, we propose the perspective that category theory offers a natural mathematical framework for analyzing encodings that respect structure inherent in datasets and learning tasks. We illustrate this with pedagogical examples, which include geometric quantum machine learning, quantum metric learning, topological data analysis, and more. Moreover, our perspective provides a language in which to ask meaningful and mathematically precise questions for the design of quantum encodings and circuits for quantum machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Presentations of Type Dependency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.09948v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: C-systems were defined by Cartmell as the algebraic structures that correspond exactly to generalised algebraic theories. B-systems were defined by Voevodsky in his quest to formulate and prove an initiality conjecture for type theories. They play a crucial role in Voevodsky's construction of a syntactic C-system from a term monad.
  In this work, we construct an equivalence between the category of C-systems and the category of B-systems, thus proving a conjecture by Voevodsky. We construct this equivalence as the restriction of an equivalence between more general structures, called CE-systems and E-systems, respectively. To this end, we identify C-systems and B-systems as "stratified" CE-systems and E-systems, respectively; that is, systems whose contexts are built iteratively via context extension, starting from the empty context.</description>

      <title>Higher categories of push-pull spans, I: Construction and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first part of a project aimed at formalizing Rozansky-Witten models in the functorial field theory framework. Motivated by work of Calaque-Haugseng-Scheimbauer, we construct a family of symmetric monoidal $(\infty,3)$-categories parametrized by an $\infty$-category with finite limits and a functor into symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories, such that the functor admits pushforwards. This $(\infty,3)$-category contains correspondences in the base $\infty$-category equipped with local systems, which compose via a push-pull formula. We apply this general construction to provide an approximation to the $3$-category of Rozansky-Witten models whose existence was conjectured by Kapustin-Rozansky-Saulina; this approximation behaves like a "commutative" version of the conjectured $3$-category and is related to work of Stefanich on higher quasicoherent sheaves.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Equality in Substructural Logic via Lipschitz Doctrines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.05388v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Substructural logics naturally support a quantitative interpretation of formulas, as they are seen as consumable resources. Distances are the quantitative counterpart of equivalence relations: they measure how much two objects are similar, rather than just saying whether they are equivalent or not. Hence, they provide the natural choice for modelling equality in a substructural setting. In this paper, we develop this idea, using the categorical language of Lawvere's doctrines. We work in a minimal fragment of Linear Logic enriched by graded modalities, which are needed to write a resource sensitive substitution rule for equality, enabling its quantitative interpretation as a distance. We introduce both a deductive calculus and the notion of Lipschitz doctrine to give it a sound and complete categorical semantics. The study of 2-categorical properties of Lipschitz doctrines provides us with a universal construction, which generates examples based for instance on metric spaces and quantitative realisability. Finally, we show how to smoothly extend our results to richer substructural logics, up to full Linear Logic with quantifiers.</description>

      <title>Projective model structures on diffeological spaces and smooth sets and the smooth Oka principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we prove that the category of diffeological spaces does not admit a model structure transferred via the smooth singular complex functor from simplicial sets, resolving in the negative a conjecture of Christensen and Wu, in contrast to Kihara's model structure on diffeological spaces constructed using a different singular complex functor. Next, motivated by applications in quantum field theory and topology, we embed diffeological spaces into sheaves of sets (not necessarily concrete) on the site of smooth manifolds and study the proper combinatorial model structure on such sheaves transferred via the smooth singular complex functor from simplicial sets. We show the resulting model category to be Quillen equivalent to the model category of simplicial sets. We then show that this model structure is cartesian, all smooth manifolds are cofibrant, and establish the existence of model structures on categories of algebras over operads. Finally, we use these results to establish analogous properties for model structures on simplicial presheaves on smooth manifolds, as well as presheaves valued in left proper combinatorial model categories, and prove a generalization of the smooth Oka principle established in arXiv:1912.10544. We apply these results to establish classification theorems for differential-geometric objects like closed differential forms, principal bundles with connection, and higher bundle gerbes with connection on arbitrary cofibrant diffeological spaces.</description>
