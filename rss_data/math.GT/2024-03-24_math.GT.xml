      <title>Locally homogeneous Axiom A flows I: projective Anosov subgroups and exponential mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By constructing a non-empty domain of discontinuity in a suitable homogeneous space, we prove that every torsion-free projective Anosov subgroup is the monodromy group of a locally homogeneous contact Axiom A dynamical system with a unique basic hyperbolic set on which the flow is conjugate to the refraction flow of Sambarino. Under the assumption of irreducibility, we utilize the work of Stoyanov to establish spectral estimates for the associated complex Ruelle transfer operators, and by way of corollary: exponential mixing, exponentially decaying error term in the prime orbit theorem, and a spectral gap for the Ruelle zeta function. With no irreducibility assumption, results of Dyatlov-Guillarmou imply the global meromorphic continuation of zeta functions with smooth weights, as well as the existence of a discrete spectrum of Ruelle-Pollicott resonances and (co)-resonant states. We apply our results to space-like geodesic flows for the convex cocompact pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of Danciger-Gu\'eritaud-Kassel, and the Benoist-Hilbert geodesic flow for strictly convex real projective manifolds.</description>

      <title>3d Modularity Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of the three-dimensional theory with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019, surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular forms, and vertex algebras, have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive array of examples have been studied, but several general important structural questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds it was observed that the different $\hat Z$-invariants for the same three-manifolds are quantum modular forms that span a subspace of a Weil representation for the modular group $SL_2(Z)$, corresponding to the structure of vector-valued quantum modular forms. We elucidate the meaning of this vector-valued quantum modular form strcuture by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued quantum modular form is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat Z$-invariants, with and without defects, of a given three-manifold. Second, it was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold, suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for an infinite family of three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third, we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator algebras associated to these invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.</description>

      <title>Extending finite free actions of surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of finite groups of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of some closed orientable surface $S$ that act freely and which extends as a group of homeomorphisms of some compact orientable $3$-manifold with boundary $S$, but which cannot extend to a handlebody.</description>

      <title>Two geometric models for graded skew-gentle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Part 1, we classify (indecomposable) objects in the perfect derived category $\mathrm{per}\Lambda$ of a graded skew-gentle algebra $\Lambda$, generalizing technique/results of Burban-Drozd and Deng to the graded setting. We also use the usual punctured marked surface $\mathbf{S}^\lambda$ with grading (and a full formal arc system) to give a geometric model for this classification.
  In Part2, we introduce a new surface $\mathbf{S}^\lambda_*$ with binaries from $\mathbf{S}^\lambda$ by replacing each puncture $P$ by a boundary component $*_P$ (called a binary) with one marked point, and composing an equivalent relation $D_{*_P}^2=\mathrm{id}$, where $D_{*_p}$ is the Dehn twist along $*_P$. Certain indecomposable objects in $\mathrm{per}\Lambda$ can be also classified by graded unknotted arcs on $\mathbf{S}^\lambda_*$. Moreover, using this new geometric model, we show that the intersections between any two unknotted arcs provide a basis of the morphisms between the corresponding arc objects, i.e. formula $\mathrm{Int}=\mathrm{dim}\mathrm{Hom}$ holds.</description>

      <title>Short incompressible graphs and $2$-free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a finite connected $2$-complex $X$ endowed with a piecewise Riemannian metric and whose fundamental group is freely indecomposable, of rank at least $3$, and in which every $2$-generated subgroup is free. In this paper we show that we can always find a connected graph $\Gamma\subset X$ such that $\pi_1 \Gamma\simeq {\mathbb F}_2 \hookrightarrow\pi_1 X$ (in short, a $2$-incompressible graph) whose length satisfies the following curvature-free inequality: $\ell(\Gamma)\leq 4\sqrt{2\text{Area}(X)}$. This generalizes a previous inequality proved by Gromov for closed Riemannian surfaces with negative Euler characteristic. As a consequence we obtain that the volume entropy of such $2$-complexes with unit area is always bounded away from zero.</description>
