      <title>Renormalization Group Approach to Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While we have several complementary models of confinement, some of which are phenomenologically appealing, we do not have the ability to calculate analytically even simple aspects of confinement, let alone have a framework to eventually prove confinement. The problem we are facing is to evolve the theory from the perturbative regime to the long distance confining regime. This is generally achieved by renormalization group transformations. With the gradient flow we now have a technique to address the problem from first principles. The primary focus is on the running coupling $\alpha_S(\mu)$, from which confinement can be concluded alone. A central point is that the gluon condensate is scale invariant, which reflects its self-similar behavior across different scales. Building on that, we derive $\alpha_S(\mu) \simeq \Lambda_S^2/\mu^2$, which evolves to the infrared fixed point $1/\alpha_S = 0$ in accordance with infrared slavery. This shows that the only important factor is the presence of homogeneous vacuum fields, represented by condensates, which is a universal feature that QCD shares with many other models. The analytical statements are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Using orthogonal projectors in multigrid multilevel Monte Carlo for trace estimation in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a multigrid multilevel Monte Carlo method for stochastic trace estimation in lattice QCD based on orthogonal projections. This formulation extends the previously proposed oblique decomposition and it is assessed on three representative problems: the connected pseudoscalar correlator, the trace of the full Dirac operator's inverse $\mathrm{tr}(D^{-1})$, and disconnected fermion loops. For the connected correlator, variance reductions grow systematically with the time separation and lead to cost savings of up to a factor of 30 at large separations, outperforming both the plain Hutchinson's estimator and the oblique formulation. For $\mathrm{tr}(D^{-1})$, reductions are more modest but remain systematic, with stronger effects on more ill-conditioned systems. Disconnected loops show no improvement, since their variance is dominated by local same-slice contributions not targeted by the decomposition.</description>

      <title>The phase transitions of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase transitions of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice using the non-perturbative first principle Monte Carlo simulations. Here $J_1 &lt; 0$ and $J_2 &gt; 0$ are the nearest and next-to-nearest couplings, respectively. In particular, the values of $J_2/|J_1| = 0.20, 0.22, 0.23, 0.24, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8,$ and 1.0 are considered in our study. Based on the numerical outcomes, we find that the phase transitions for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.20, 0.22, 0.23,$ and 0.24 are second order and are governed by the 2D Ising universality class. In addition, we find evidence to support the facts that there are transitions for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.5, 0.8$ and 1.0 and these phase transitions are second order. Our results also indicate phase transition is unlikely to take place for $g=0.3$. We are not able to obtain results for $J_2/|J_1|$ $\in$ (0.24, 0.3) because the associated integrated autocorrelation times or (and) the equilibrium times are extremely large at the low-temperature region. A comparison between the outcomes presented here and the available results in the literature is briefly conducted as well.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Signatures of QCD Phase Transitions in Compact Astrophysical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretical signatures of first-order QCD phase transitions in high-density astrophysical systems through a framework combining lattice QCD, effective field theories, and multimessenger constraints. Hybrid equations of state with Maxwell and Gibbs constructions, constrained by lattice QCD at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential up to mu_B/T &lt; 3, interpolate consistently between chiral effective field theory at nuclear densities and perturbative QCD at asymptotic densities. Applying these models to static neutron stars via Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and to binary mergers via relativistic hydrodynamics, we find distinctive signatures: (i) twin star branches with 0.5-2.0 km radius differences at fixed mass, (ii) equation of state softening in coexistence regions reducing maximum masses by 0.2-0.4 solar masses, (iii) delayed post-merger gravitational-wave frequency shifts of 200-400 Hz, and (iv) enhanced neutrino emission during phase transitions. Confronted with multimessenger constraints from GW170817, NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, and perturbative QCD, our models suggest strong first-order transitions are marginally consistent with current data but produce signatures detectable by next-generation detectors. Neutron star core sound speeds satisfy c_s^2 &lt; 0.5c^2, with transient conformal bound violations in 2-4 times saturation density. This framework yields quantitative predictions for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, establishing foundations for precision QCD matter tests and possible quark matter discovery.</description>

      <title>Leading-renormalon-free Trace-anomaly-subtracted $\sigma$-mass for Heavy Quarks up to Five Loops in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the leading IR-renormalon divergence in the perturbative pole mass of a massive quark resides entirely in the contribution from the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor in QCD. Consequently, the recently proposed trace-anomaly-subtracted $\sigma$-mass definition for heavy quarks is not only scheme- and scale-invariant, but also free from the leading IR-renormalon ambiguity. We further derive a formula connecting this $\sigma$-mass to the perturbative pole mass, solely in terms of the QCD $\beta$-function, quark-mass anomalous dimension $\gamma_m$ and a proper rewritten form of the pole-to-$\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ mass conversion factor. Utilizing this formula along with the ingredients available in the literature, we present the explicit five-loop result for the perturbative relationship between the $\sigma$-mass and the perturbative pole mass in QCD under the approximation of keeping only a single quark massive. Given the theoretical merits of this mass definition and the availability of high-precision conversion relations, we encourage its application to high-energy processes with heavy quarks, e.g., $H \rightarrow b\bar{b} + X_{\mathrm{QCD}}$, and to current-current correlators used in determining heavy-quark masses and decay widths.</description>

      <title>Collective motion in the massive Schwinger model via Tensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the real-time dynamics of a massive Schwinger model using the Time-Evolving Block Decimation tensor network algorithm. Starting from a non-equilibrium initial state with localized energy excitation on top of vacuum, we track the subsequent evolution to investigate two distinct physical phenomena. First, by analyzing the system's energy-momentum tensor, we show that this system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior analogous to Bjorken flow at large coupling-to-mass ratio, a signature that diminishes as the coupling weakens, or mass increases. Second, by examining the evolution of the electric field and charge density, we observe the signal of spontaneous parity symmetry breaking phase transition in a dynamical system. The parity-restored regime is marked by ''string breaking'' and efficient charge screening, while the parity-broken regime displays stable propagation of nearly free charges and persistent electric fields connecting them.</description>

      <title>Onset of Bjorken Flow in Quantum Evolution of the Massive Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The onset of hydrodynamics in the hot medium created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is a crucial theoretical question. A first-principle simulation requires a real-time, non-perturbative calculation of the quantum system. In this Letter, we perform such simulations using the tensor network method, which enables large-scale quantum many-body simulations by retaining only the most essential quantum states for collective behaviors. We focus on the massive Schwinger model, a low-dimensional analog of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), as they share important properties such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Starting from an initial state that puts a localized excitation atop the vacuum and mimics the energy deposition from colliding nuclei, we observe hydrodynamic behavior consistent with Bjorken flow in all relevant degrees of freedom: energy density, fluid velocity, and bulk pressure. The time scale for hydrodynamic onset aligns with the thermalization time of the quantum distribution function.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum-field-theory dynamics on a spin-phonon quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum field theories in nature is challenging with classical methods, but is a promising application for quantum computers. Unfortunately, simulating interacting bosonic fields involves a high boson-to-qubit encoding overhead. Furthermore, when mapping to qubits, the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of bosons is necessarily truncated, with truncation errors that grow with energy and time. A qubit-based quantum computer, augmented with an active bosonic register, and with qubit, bosonic, and mixed qubit-boson quantum gates, offers a more powerful platform for simulating bosonic theories. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a hybrid analog-digital trapped-ion quantum computer, where qubits are encoded in the internal states of the ions, and the bosons in the ions' motional states. Specifically, we simulate nonequilibrium dynamics of a (1+1)-dimensional Yukawa model, a simplified model of interacting nucleons and pions, and measure fermion- and boson-occupation-state probabilities. These dynamics populate high bosonic-field excitations starting from an empty state, and the experimental results capture well such high-occupation states. This simulation approaches the regime where classical methods become challenging, bypasses the need for a large qubit overhead, and removes truncation errors. Our results, therefore, open the way to achieving demonstrable quantum advantage in qubit-boson quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Discovering the $D_0^\ast(2100)$ in $B$ semileptonic decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass and width of the lightest scalar open-charm state listed in the Review of Particle Physics, the $D_0^\ast(2300)$, are in puzzling tension with predictions from unitarized chiral perturbation theory (UChPT) and lattice QCD, which favor a lighter state at around $2100$ MeV. However, to date, no direct experimental evidence for this lighter state exists. In an effort to facilitate a direct observation, we introduce angular asymmetries of $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays that allow for a direct extraction of the $D\pi$ S-wave phase shift and discuss a novel measurement strategy for the Belle II experiment. We conduct a sensitivity study, finding that the Belle II experiment can determine the pole location with sufficient precision to firmly establish the $D_0^\ast(2100)$ using the currently available data set. We also investigate the possibility and necessary statistics of measuring the $D\pi$ isospin 1/2 scattering length with an accuracy sufficient to distinguish between the predictions from both UChPT and lattice QCD and the measurement by ALICE using femtoscopy.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Partial Transpose in the Overlap Matrix Framework for Entanglement Negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, in previous studies, only the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems has been considered, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced by Shapourian et al. [Phys. Rev. B 95, 165101 (2017)], it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors and mechanical properties of the nucleon in a meson dominance approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the gravitational form factors and mechanical properties of the nucleon, focusing on both some general issues as well as on modeling with meson dominance. We show that the lattice QCD results for the nucleon gravitational form factors at $m_\pi=170$~MeV, available for space-like momentum transfer squared up to 2GeV, are explained in a natural way within the meson dominance approach. We carry out the proper Raman spin decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor and in each spin channel use a minimum number of resonances consistent with the perturbative QCD short-distance constraints. These constraints are related to the super-convergence sum rules, following from the asymptotic perturbative QCD fall-off of the form factors. The value of the nucleon $D$-term following from the fits is -3.0(4). Next, we obtain the two-dimensional transverse gravitational densities of the nucleon in the transverse coordinate $b$. With the super-convergence sum rules, we derive new sum rules for these densities at the origin and for their derivatives, involving logarithmic weighting in the corresponding spectral density integrals. From analysis of the threshold behavior in the time-like region and the properties of the $\pi\pi \to N\bar{N}$ reaction, we infer the behavior of the transverse densities at asymptotically large coordinates. We also carry out the meson dominance analysis of the two- and three-dimensional mechanical properties of the nucleon (the pressure and stress) and explore their connection to the spectral densities via dispersion relations.</description>
