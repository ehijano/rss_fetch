      <title>Algorithms and complexity for monitoring edge-geodetic sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monitoring edge-geodetic set of a graph is a subset $M$ of its vertices such that for every edge $e$ in the graph, deleting $e$ increases the distance between at least one pair of vertices in $M$. We study the following computational problem \textsc{MEG-set}: given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, decide whether $G$ has a monitoring edge geodetic set of size at most $k$. We prove that the problem is NP-hard even for 2-apex 3-degenerate graphs, improving a result by Haslegrave (Discrete Applied Mathematics 2023). Additionally, we prove that the problem cannot be solved in subexponential-time, assuming the Exponential-Time Hypothesis, even for 3-degenerate graphs. Further, we prove that the optimization version of the problem is APX-hard, even for 4-degenerate graphs. Complementing these hardness results, we prove that the problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm for interval graphs, a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for general graphs with clique-width plus diameter as the parameter, and a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for chordal graphs with treewidth as the parameter. We also provide an approximation algorithm with factor $\ln m\cdot OPT$ and $\sqrt{n\ln m}$ for the optimization version of the problem, where $m$ is the number of edges, $n$ the number of vertices, and $OPT$ is the size of a minimum monitoring edge-geodetic set of the input graph.</description>

      <title>Making Quickhull More Like Quicksort: A Simple Randomized Output-Sensitive Convex Hull Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Ray-shooting Quickhull, which is a simple, randomized, outputsensitive version of the Quickhull algorithm for constructing the convex hull of a set of n points in the plane. We show that the randomized Ray-shooting Quickhull algorithm runs in O(n log h) expected time, where h is the number of points on the boundary of the convex hull. Keeping with the spirit of the original Quickhull algorithm, our algorithm is quite simple and is, in fact, closer in spirit to the well-known randomized Quicksort algorithm. Unlike the original Quickhull algorithm, however, which can run in ${\Theta}(n^2) time$ for some input distributions, the expected performance bounds for the randomized Ray-shooting Quickhull algorithm match or improve the performance bounds of more complicated algorithms. Importantly, the expectation in our output-sensitive performance bound does not depend on assumptions about the distribution of input points. Still, we show that, like the deterministic Quickhull algorithm, our randomized Ray-shooting Quickhull algorithm runs in O(n) expected time for n points chosen uniformly at random from a bounded convex region. We also provide experimental evidence that the randomized Ray-shooting Quickhull algorithm is on par or faster than deterministic Quickhull in practice, depending on the input distribution.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Unique Games Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the NP-hardness of computational problems such as 3SAT and MaxCut was established, a natural next step was to explore whether these problems remain hard to approximate. While the quantum extensions of some of these problems are known to be hard-indeed undecidable-their inapproximability remains largely unresolved. In this work, we introduce definitions for the quantum extensions of Label-Cover and Unique-Label-Cover. We show that these problems play a similarly crucial role in studying the inapproximability of quantum constraint satisfaction problems as they do in the classical setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fast Implementation of Private Information Retrieval and Functional Bootstrapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation has found greater efficiency and security across various fields. We show that, in a near-term hybrid cloud computing scenario with only one single quantum server and an entirely classical client, critical bottlenecks in privacy-preserving computation can be addressed.
  First, we propose an efficient quantum functional bootstrapping algorithm with a runtime polynomial in the plaintext-size, providing an exponential quantum speedup over classical algorithms. Second, we present a secure and fast quantum private information retrieval protocol with logarithmic query time. The security relies on the learning with errors (LWE) problem with polynomial modulus, greatly improving the security of classical fast PIR protocol based on ring-LWE with super-polynomial modulus.
  Technically, we extend an important classical homomorphic operation, known as blind rotation, to the quantum case by an encrypted conditional rotation technique. This technique holds promise for broader applications in quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>TwinArray Sort: An Ultrarapid Conditional Non-Comparison Based Sorting Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computer science, sorting algorithms are crucial for data processing and machine learning. Large datasets and high efficiency requirements provide challenges for comparison-based algorithms like Quicksort and Merge sort, which achieve O(n log n) time complexity. Non-comparison-based algorithms like Spreadsort and Counting Sort have memory consumption issues and a relatively high computational demand, even if they can attain linear time complexity under certain circumstances. We present TwinArray Sort, a novel conditional non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that effectively uses array indices. When it comes to worst-case time and space complexities, TwinArray Sort achieves O(n+k). The approach remains efficient under all settings and works well with datasets with randomly sorted, reverse-sorted, or nearly sorted distributions. TwinArray Sort can handle duplicates and optimize memory efficiently since thanks to its two auxiliary arrays for value storage and frequency counting, as well as a conditional distinct array verifier. TwinArray Sort constantly performs better than conventional algorithms, according to experimental assessments and particularly when sorting unique arrays under all data distribution scenarios. The approach is suitable for massive data processing and machine learning dataset management due to its creative use of dual auxiliary arrays and a conditional distinct array verification, which improves memory use and duplication handling. TwinArray Sort overcomes conventional sorting algorithmic constraints by combining cutting-edge methods with non-comparison-based sorting advantages. Its reliable performance in a range of data distributions makes it an adaptable and effective answer for contemporary computing requirements.</description>

      <title>Parameterised distance to local irregularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is \emph{locally irregular} if no two of its adjacent vertices have the same degree. In [Fioravantes et al. Complexity of finding maximum locally irregular induced subgraph. {\it SWAT}, 2022], the authors introduced and studied the problem of finding a locally irregular induced subgraph of a given a graph $G$ of maximum order, or, equivalently, computing a subset $S$ of $V(G)$ of minimum order, whose deletion from $G$ results in a locally irregular graph; $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal vertex-irregulator of $G$}. In this work we provide an in-depth analysis of the parameterised complexity of computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a given graph $G$. Moreover, we introduce and study a variation of this problem, where $S$ is a substet of the edges of $G$; in this case, $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal edge-irregulator of $G$}. In particular, we prove that computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a graph $G$ is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity, neighborhood diversity or cluster deletion number of $G$, while it is $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the feedback vertex set number or the treedepth of $G$. In the case of computing an optimal edge-irregulator of a graph $G$, we prove that this problem is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity of $G$, while it is NP-hard even if $G$ is a planar bipartite graph of maximum degree $4$, and $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the size of the solution, the feedback vertex set or the treedepth of $G$. Our results paint a comprehensive picture of the tractability of both problems studied here, considering most of the standard graph-structural parameters.</description>

      <title>A Note on Output Length of One-Way State Generators and EFIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16025v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the output length of one-way state generators (OWSGs), their weaker variants, and EFIs.
  - Standard OWSGs. Recently, Cavalar et al. (arXiv:2312.08363) give OWSGs with $m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(\log \lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the security parameter, and conjecture that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log \log \lambda)$-qubit outputs. We prove their conjecture in a stronger manner by showing that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log \lambda)$-qubit outputs. This means that their construction is optimal in terms of output length.
  - Inverse-polynomial-advantage OWSGs. Let $\epsilon$-OWSGs be a parameterized variant of OWSGs where a quantum polynomial-time adversary's advantage is at most $\epsilon$. For any constant $c\in \mathbb{N}$, we construct $\lambda^{-c}$-OWSGs with $((c+1)\log \lambda+O(1))$-qubit outputs assuming the existence of OWFs. We show that this is almost tight by proving that there do not exist $\lambda^{-c}$-OWSGs with at most $(c\log \lambda-2)$-qubit outputs.
  - Constant-advantage OWSGs. For any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, we construct $\epsilon$-OWSGs with $O(\log \log \lambda)$-qubit outputs assuming the existence of subexponentially secure OWFs. We show that this is almost tight by proving that there do not exist $O(1)$-OWSGs with $((\log \log \lambda)/2+O(1))$-qubit outputs.
  - Weak OWSGs. We refer to $(1-1/\mathsf{poly}(\lambda))$-OWSGs as weak OWSGs. We construct weak OWSGs with $m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(1)$ assuming the existence of exponentially secure OWFs with linear expansion. We show that this is tight by proving that there do not exist weak OWSGs with $O(1)$-qubit outputs.
  - EFIs. We show that there do not exist $O(\log \lambda)$-qubit EFIs. We show that this is tight by proving that there exist $\omega(\log \lambda)$-qubit EFIs assuming the existence of exponentially secure PRGs.</description>

      <title>Approximation algorithms for noncommutative CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noncommutative constraint satisfaction problems (NC-CSPs) are higher-dimensional operator extensions of classical CSPs. Despite their significance in quantum information, their approximability remains largely unexplored. A notable example of a noncommutative CSP that is not solvable in polynomial time is NC-Max-$3$-Cut. We present a $0.864$-approximation algorithm for this problem. Our approach extends to a broader class of both classical and noncommutative CSPs. We introduce three key concepts: approximate isometry, relative distribution, and $\ast$-anticommutation, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Single Family Algebra Operation on BDDs and ZDDs Leads To Exponential Blow-Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary decision diagram (BDD) and zero-suppressed binary decision diagram (ZDD) are data structures to represent a family of (sub)sets compactly, and it can be used as succinct indexes for a family of sets. To build BDD/ZDD representing a desired family of sets, there are many transformation operations that take BDDs/ZDDs as inputs and output BDD/ZDD representing the resultant family after performing operations such as set union and intersection. However, except for some basic operations, the worst-time complexity of taking such transformation on BDDs/ZDDs has not been extensively studied, and some contradictory statements about it have arisen in the literature. In this paper, we show that many transformation operations on BDDs/ZDDs, including all operations for families of sets that appear in Knuth's book, cannot be performed in worst-case polynomial time in the size of input BDDs/ZDDs. This refutes some of the folklore circulated in past literature and resolves an open problem raised by Knuth. Our results are stronger in that such blow-up of computational time occurs even when the ordering, which has a significant impact on the efficiency of treating BDDs/ZDDs, is chosen arbitrarily.</description>

      <title>Knapsack with Vertex Cover, Set Cover, and Hitting Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$, with vertex weights $(w(u))_{u\in\mathcal{V}}$, vertex values $(\alpha(u))_{u\in\mathcal{V}}$, a knapsack size $s$, and a target value $d$, the \vcknapsack problem is to determine if there exists a subset $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathcal{V}$ of vertices such that $\mathcal{U}$ forms a vertex cover, $w(\mathcal{U})=\sum_{u\in\mathcal{U}} w(u) \le s$, and $\alpha(\mathcal{U})=\sum_{u\in\mathcal{U}} \alpha(u) \ge d$. In this paper, we closely study the \vcknapsack problem and its variations, such as \vcknapsackbudget, \minimalvcknapsack, and \minimumvcknapsack, for both general graphs and trees. We first prove that the \vcknapsack problem belongs to the complexity class \NPC and then study the complexity of the other variations. We generalize the problem to \setc and \hs versions and design polynomial time $H_g$-factor approximation algorithm for the \setckp problem and d-factor approximation algorithm for \hstp using primal dual method. We further show that \setcks and \hsmb are hard to approximate in polynomial time. Additionally, we develop a fixed parameter tractable algorithm running in time $8^{\mathcal{O}({\rm tw})}\cdot n\cdot {\sf min}\{s,d\}$ where ${\rm tw},s,d,n$ are respectively treewidth of the graph, the size of the knapsack, the target value of the knapsack, and the number of items for the \minimalvcknapsack problem.</description>

      <title>Topics in Non-local Games: Synchronous Algebras, Algebraic Graph Identities, and Quantum NP-hardness Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10114v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the correspondence between synchronous games and their associated $*$-algebra. Building upon the work of (Helton et al., New York J. Math. 2017), we propose results on algebraic and locally commuting graph identities. Based on the noncommutative Nullstellens\"atze (Watts, Helton and Klep, Annales Henri Poincar\'e 2023), we build computational tools that check the non-existence of perfect $C^*$ and algebraic strategies of synchronous games using Gr\"obner basis methods and semidefinite programming. We prove the equivalence between the hereditary and $C^*$ models questioned in (Helton et al., New York J. Math. 2017). We also extend the quantum-version NP-hardness reduction $\texttt{3-SAT}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-Coloring}^*$ due to (Ji, arXiv 2013) by exhibiting another instance of such reduction $\texttt{3-SAT}^* \leq_p \texttt{Clique}^*$.</description>
