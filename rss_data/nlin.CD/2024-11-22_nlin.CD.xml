      <title>Generalization of the Gauss Map: A jump into chaos with universal features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gauss map (or continued fraction map) is an important dissipative one-dimensional discrete-time dynamical system that exhibits chaotic behaviour and which generates a symbolic dynamics consisting of infinitely many different symbols. Here we introduce a generalization of the Gauss map which is given by $x_{t+1}=\frac{1}{x_t^\alpha} - \Bigl[\frac{1}{x_t^\alpha} \Bigr]$ where $\alpha \geq 0$ is a parameter and $x_t \in [0,1]$ ($t=0,1,2,3,\ldots$). The symbol $[\dots ]$ denotes the integer part. This map reduces to the ordinary Gauss map for $\alpha=1$. The system exhibits a sudden `jump into chaos' at the critical parameter value $\alpha=\alpha_c \equiv 0.241485141808811\dots$ which we analyse in detail in this paper. Several analytical and numerical results are established for this new map as a function of the parameter $\alpha$. In particular, we show that, at the critical point, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$ (i.e., the Cauchy distribution), which becomes infinitely narrow as $\alpha \to \alpha_c^+$. Moreover, in the chaotic region for large values of the parameter $\alpha$ we analytically derive approximate formulas for the invariant density, by solving the corresponding Perron-Frobenius equation. For $\alpha \to \infty$ the uniform density is approached. We provide arguments that some features of this transition scenario are universal and are relevant for other, more general systems as well.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Markowitz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Markowitz portfolio optimization constrains daily portfolio variance to a target value, optimising returns, Sharpe or variance within this constraint. However, this approach overlooks the relationship between variance at different time scales, typically described by $\sigma(\Delta t) \propto (\Delta t)^{H}$ where $H$ is the Hurst exponent, most of the time assumed to be \(\frac{1}{2}\). This paper introduces a multifrequency optimization framework that allows investors to specify target portfolio variance across a range of frequencies, characterized by a target Hurst exponent $H_{target}$, or optimize the portfolio at multiple time scales. By incorporating this scaling behavior, we enable a more nuanced and comprehensive risk management strategy that aligns with investor preferences at various time scales. This approach effectively manages portfolio risk across multiple frequencies and adapts to different market conditions, providing a robust tool for dynamic asset allocation. This overcomes some of the traditional limitations of Markowitz, when it comes to dealing with crashes, regime changes, volatility clustering or multifractality in markets. We illustrate this concept with a toy example and discuss the practical implementation for assets with varying scaling behaviors.</description>

      <title>Transients versus network interactions give rise to multistability through trapping mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In networked systems, the interplay between the dynamics of individual subsystems and their network interactions has been found to generate multistability in various contexts. Despite its ubiquity, the specific mechanisms and ingredients that give rise to multistability from such interplay remain poorly understood. In a network of coupled excitable units, we show that this interplay generating multistability occurs through a competition between the units' transient dynamics and their coupling. Specifically, the diffusive coupling between the units manages to reinject them in the excitability region of their individual state space and effectively trap them there. We show that this trapping mechanism leads to the coexistence of multiple types of oscillations: periodic, quasiperiodic, and even chaotic, although the units separately do not oscillate. Interestingly, we show that the attractors emerge through different types of bifurcations - in particular, the periodic attractors emerge through either saddle-node of limit cycles bifurcations or homoclinic bifurcations - but in all cases the reinjection mechanism is present.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the Generalized Pareto Distribution-based estimators for the local dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two dynamical indicators, the local dimension and the extremal index, used to quantify persistence in phase space have been developed and applied to different data across various disciplines. These are computed using the asymptotic limit of exceedances over a threshold, which turns to be a Generalized Pareto Distribution in many cases. However the derivation of the asymptotic distribution requires mathematical properties which are not present even in highly idealized dynamical systems, and unlikely to be present in real data. Here we examine in detail issues that arise when estimating these quantities for some known dynamical systems with a particular focus on how the geometry of an invariant set can affect the regularly varying properties of the invariant measure. We demonstrate that singular measures supported on sets of non-integer dimension are typically not regularly varying and that the absence of regular variation makes the estimates resolution dependent. We show as well that the most common extremal index estimation method is ambiguous for continuous time processes sampled at fixed time steps, which is an underlying assumption in its application to data.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in aperiodically driven classical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven classical many-body systems can host a rich zoo of prethermal dynamical phases. In this work, we extend the paradigm of classical prethermalization to aperiodically driven systems. We establish the existence of a long-lived prethermal regime in spin systems subjected to random multipolar drives (RMDs). We demonstrate that the thermalization time scales as $(1/T)^{2n+2}$, where $n$ is the multipolar order and $T$ is the intrinsic time-scale associated with the drive. In the $n \rightarrow \infty$ limit, the drive becomes quasi-periodic and the thermalization time becomes exponentially long ($\sim \exp(\beta/T)$). We further establish the robustness of prethermalization by demonstrating that these thermalization time scaling laws hold for a wide range of initial state energy densities. Intriguingly, the thermalization process in these classical systems is parametrically slower than their quantum counterparts, thereby highlighting important differences between classical and quantum prethermalization. Finally, we propose a protocol to harness this classical prethermalization to realize time rondeau crystals.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</description>
