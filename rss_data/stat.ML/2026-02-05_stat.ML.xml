      <title>Transcendental Regularization of Finite Mixtures:Theoretical Guarantees and Practical Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite mixture models are widely used for unsupervised learning, but maximum likelihood estimation via EM suffers from degeneracy as components collapse. We introduce transcendental regularization, a penalized likelihood framework with analytic barrier functions that prevent degeneracy while maintaining asymptotic efficiency. The resulting Transcendental Algorithm for Mixtures of Distributions (TAMD) offers strong theoretical guarantees: identifiability, consistency, and robustness. Empirically, TAMD successfully stabilizes estimation and prevents collapse, yet achieves only modest improvements in classification accuracy-highlighting fundamental limits of mixture models for unsupervised learning in high dimensions. Our work provides both a novel theoretical framework and an honest assessment of practical limitations, implemented in an open-source R package.</description>

      <title>A Hitchhiker's Guide to Poisson Gradient Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poisson-distributed latent variable models are widely used in computational neuroscience, but differentiating through discrete stochastic samples remains challenging. Two approaches address this: Exponential Arrival Time (EAT) simulation and Gumbel-SoftMax (GSM) relaxation. We provide the first systematic comparison of these methods, along with practical guidance for practitioners. Our main technical contribution is a modification to the EAT method that theoretically guarantees an unbiased first moment (exactly matching the firing rate), and reduces second-moment bias. We evaluate these methods on their distributional fidelity, gradient quality, and performance on two tasks: (1) variational autoencoders with Poisson latents, and (2) partially observable generalized linear models, where latent neural connectivity must be inferred from observed spike trains. Across all metrics, our modified EAT method exhibits better overall performance (often comparable to exact gradients), and substantially higher robustness to hyperparameter choices. Together, our results clarify the trade-offs between these methods and offer concrete recommendations for practitioners working with Poisson latent variable models.</description>

      <title>Byzantine Machine Learning: MultiKrum and an optimal notion of robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregation rules are the cornerstone of distributed (or federated) learning in the presence of adversaries, under the so-called Byzantine threat model. They are also interesting mathematical objects from the point of view of robust mean estimation. The Krum aggregation rule has been extensively studied, and endowed with formal robustness and convergence guarantees. Yet, MultiKrum, a natural extension of Krum, is often preferred in practice for its superior empirical performance, even though no theoretical guarantees were available until now. In this work, we provide the first proof that MultiKrum is a robust aggregation rule, and bound its robustness coefficient. To do so, we introduce $\kappa^\star$, the optimal *robustness coefficient* of an aggregation rule, which quantifies the accuracy of mean estimation in the presence of adversaries in a tighter manner compared with previously adopted notions of robustness. We then construct an upper and a lower bound on MultiKrum's robustness coefficient. As a by-product, we also improve on the best-known bounds on Krum's robustness coefficient. We show that MultiKrum's bounds are never worse than Krum's, and better in realistic regimes. We illustrate this analysis by an experimental investigation on the quality of the lower bound.</description>

      <title>Privacy utility trade offs for parameter estimation in degree heterogeneous higher order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In sensitive applications involving relational datasets, protecting information about individual links from adversarial queries is of paramount importance. In many such settings, the available data are summarized solely through the degrees of the nodes in the network. We adopt the $\beta$ model, which is the prototypical statistical model adopted for this form of aggregated relational information, and study the problem of minimax-optimal parameter estimation under both local and central differential privacy constraints. We establish finite sample minimax lower bounds that characterize the precise dependence of the estimation risk on the network size and the privacy parameters, and we propose simple estimators that achieve these bounds up to constants and logarithmic factors under both local and central differential privacy frameworks. Our results provide the first comprehensive finite sample characterization of privacy utility trade offs for parameter estimation in $\beta$ models, addressing the classical graph case and extending the analysis to higher order hypergraph models. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on synthetic data and a real world communication network.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-type heterogeneous interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for the joint inference of network topology, multi-type interaction kernels, and latent type assignments in heterogeneous interacting particle systems from multi-trajectory data. This learning task is a challenging non-convex mixed-integer optimization problem, which we address through a novel three-stage approach. First, we leverage shared structure across agent interactions to recover a low-rank embedding of the system parameters via matrix sensing. Second, we identify discrete interaction types by clustering within the learned embedding. Third, we recover the network weight matrix and kernel coefficients through matrix factorization and a post-processing refinement. We provide theoretical guarantees with estimation error bounds under a Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) assumption and establish conditions for the exact recovery of interaction types based on cluster separability. Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets, including heterogeneous predator-prey systems, demonstrate that our method yields an accurate reconstruction of the underlying dynamics and is robust to noise.</description>

      <title>Statistical Guarantees for Reasoning Probes on Looped Boolean Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistical behaviour of reasoning probes in a stylized model of looped reasoning, given by Boolean circuits whose computational graph is a perfect $\nu$-ary tree ($\nu\ge 2$) and whose output is appended to the input and fed back iteratively for subsequent computation rounds. A reasoning probe has access to a sampled subset of internal computation nodes, possibly without covering the entire graph, and seeks to infer which $\nu$-ary Boolean gate is executed at each queried node, representing uncertainty via a probability distribution over a fixed collection of $\mathtt{m}$ admissible $\nu$-ary gates. This partial observability induces a generalization problem, which we analyze in a realizable, transductive setting.
  We show that, when the reasoning probe is parameterized by a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based hypothesis class and queries $N$ nodes, the worst-case generalization error attains the optimal rate $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log(2/\delta)}/\sqrt{N})$ with probability at least $1-\delta$, for $\delta\in (0,1)$. Our analysis combines snowflake metric embedding techniques with tools from statistical optimal transport. A key insight is that this optimal rate is achievable independently of graph size, owing to the existence of a low-distortion one-dimensional snowflake embedding of the induced graph metric. As a consequence, our results provide a sharp characterization of how structural properties of the computational graph govern the statistical efficiency of reasoning under partial access.</description>

      <title>Fixed Budget is No Harder Than Fixed Confidence in Best-Arm Identification up to Logarithmic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The best-arm identification (BAI) problem is one of the most fundamental problems in interactive machine learning, which has two flavors: the fixed-budget setting (FB) and the fixed-confidence setting (FC).
  For $K$-armed bandits with the unique best arm, the optimal sample complexities for both settings have been settled down, and they match up to logarithmic factors.
  This prompts an interesting research question about the generic, potentially structured BAI problems: Is FB harder than FC or the other way around?
  In this paper, we show that FB is no harder than FC up to logarithmic factors.
  We do this constructively: we propose a novel algorithm called FC2FB (fixed confidence to fixed budget), which is a meta algorithm that takes in an FC algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ and turn it into an FB algorithm.
  We prove that this FC2FB enjoys a sample complexity that matches, up to logarithmic factors, that of the sample complexity of $\mathcal{A}$.
  This means that the optimal FC sample complexity is an upper bound of the optimal FB sample complexity up to logarithmic factors.
  Our result not only reveals a fundamental relationship between FB and FC, but also has a significant implication: FC2FB, combined with existing state-of-the-art FC algorithms, leads to improved sample complexity for a number of FB problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Subgroup Analysis via Optimal Trees with Global Parameter Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying and making statistical inferences on differential treatment effects (commonly known as subgroup analysis in clinical research) is central to precision health. Subgroup analysis allows practitioners to pinpoint populations for whom a treatment is especially beneficial or protective, thereby advancing targeted interventions. Tree based recursive partitioning methods are widely used for subgroup analysis due to their interpretability. Nevertheless, these approaches encounter significant limitations, including suboptimal partitions induced by greedy heuristics and overfitting from locally estimated splits, especially under limited sample sizes. To address these limitations, we propose a fused optimal causal tree method that leverages mixed integer optimization (MIO) to facilitate precise subgroup identification. Our approach ensures globally optimal partitions and introduces a parameter fusion constraint to facilitate information sharing across related subgroups. This design substantially improves subgroup discovery accuracy and enhances statistical efficiency. We provide theoretical guarantees by rigorously establishing out of sample risk bounds and comparing them with those of classical tree based methods. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms popular baselines in simulations. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility through a case study on the Health and Aging Brain Study Health Disparities (HABS-HD) dataset, where our approach yields clinically meaningful insights.</description>

      <title>Attack-Resistant Uniform Fairness for Linear and Smooth Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern systems, such as digital platforms and service systems, increasingly rely on contextual bandits for online decision-making; however, their deployment can inadvertently create unfair exposure among arms, undermining long-term platform sustainability and supplier trust. This paper studies the contextual bandit problem under a uniform $(1-\delta)$-fairness constraint, and addresses its unique vulnerabilities to strategic manipulation. The fairness constraint ensures that preferential treatment is strictly justified by an arm's actual reward across all contexts and time horizons, using uniformity to prevent statistical loopholes. We develop novel algorithms that achieve (nearly) minimax-optimal regret for both linear and smooth reward functions, while maintaining strong $(1-\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness guarantees, and further characterize the theoretically inherent yet asymptotically marginal "price of fairness". However, we reveal that such merit-based fairness becomes uniquely susceptible to signal manipulation. We show that an adversary with a minimal $\tilde{O}(1)$ budget can not only degrade overall performance as in traditional attacks, but also selectively induce insidious fairness-specific failures while leaving conspicuous regret measures largely unaffected. To counter this, we design robust variants incorporating corruption-adaptive exploration and error-compensated thresholding. Our approach yields the first minimax-optimal regret bounds under $C$-budgeted attack while preserving $(1-\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness. Numerical experiments and a real-world case demonstrate that our algorithms sustain both fairness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Maximin Relative Improvement: Fair Learning as a Bargaining Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When deploying a single predictor across multiple subpopulations, we propose a fundamentally different approach: interpreting group fairness as a bargaining problem among subpopulations. This game-theoretic perspective reveals that existing robust optimization methods such as minimizing worst-group loss or regret correspond to classical bargaining solutions and embody different fairness principles. We propose relative improvement, the ratio of actual risk reduction to potential reduction from a baseline predictor, which recovers the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution. Unlike absolute-scale methods that may not be comparable when groups have different potential predictability, relative improvement provides axiomatic justification including scale invariance and individual monotonicity. We establish finite-sample convergence guarantees under mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Provable Target Sample Complexity Improvements as Pre-Trained Models Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained models have become indispensable for efficiently building models across a broad spectrum of downstream tasks. The advantages of pre-trained models have been highlighted by empirical studies on scaling laws, which demonstrate that larger pre-trained models can significantly reduce the sample complexity of downstream learning. However, existing theoretical investigations of pre-trained models lack the capability to explain this phenomenon. In this paper, we provide a theoretical investigation by introducing a novel framework, caulking, inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as adapter-based fine-tuning, low-rank adaptation, and partial fine-tuning. Our analysis establishes that improved pre-trained models provably decrease the sample complexity of downstream tasks, thereby offering theoretical justification for the empirically observed scaling laws relating pre-trained model size to downstream performance, a relationship not covered by existing results.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Optimal Transport: Fast Intrinsic Dimension and Wasserstein Distance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving large scale Optimal Transport (OT) in machine learning typically relies on sampling measures to obtain a tractable discrete problem. While the discrete solver's accuracy is controllable, the rate of convergence of the discretization error is governed by the intrinsic dimension of our data. Therefore, the true bottleneck is the knowledge and control of the sampling error. In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing novel estimators for both sampling error and intrinsic dimension. The key finding is a simple, tuning-free estimator of $\text{OT}_c(\rho, \hat\rho)$ that utilizes the semi-dual OT functional and, remarkably, requires no OT solver. Furthermore, we derive a fast intrinsic dimension estimator from the multi-scale decay of our sampling error estimator. This framework unlocks significant computational and statistical advantages in practice, enabling us to (i) quantify the convergence rate of the discretization error, (ii) calibrate the entropic regularization of Sinkhorn divergences to the data's intrinsic geometry, and (iii) introduce a novel, intrinsic-dimension-based Richardson extrapolation estimator that strongly debiases Wasserstein distance estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our geometry-aware pipeline effectively mitigates the discretization error bottleneck while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Bandit-Based Approach to Educational Recommender Systems: Contextual Thompson Sampling for Learner Skill Gain Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, instructional practices in Operations Research (OR), Management Science (MS), and Analytics have increasingly shifted toward digital environments, where large and diverse groups of learners make it difficult to provide practice that adapts to individual needs. This paper introduces a method that generates personalized sequences of exercises by selecting, at each step, the exercise most likely to advance a learner's understanding of a targeted skill. The method uses information about the learner and their past performance to guide these choices, and learning progress is measured as the change in estimated skill level before and after each exercise. Using data from an online mathematics tutoring platform, we find that the approach recommends exercises associated with greater skill improvement and adapts effectively to differences across learners. From an instructional perspective, the framework enables personalized practice at scale, highlights exercises with consistently strong learning value, and helps instructors identify learners who may benefit from additional support.</description>

      <title>Anytime-Valid Conformal Risk Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction sets provide a means of quantifying the uncertainty in predictive tasks. Using held out calibration data, conformal prediction and risk control can produce prediction sets that exhibit statistically valid error control in a computationally efficient manner. However, in the standard formulations, the error is only controlled on average over many possible calibration datasets of fixed size. In this paper, we extend the control to remain valid with high probability over a cumulatively growing calibration dataset at any time point. We derive such guarantees using quantile-based arguments and illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework to settings involving distribution shift. We further establish a matching lower bound and show that our guarantees are asymptotically tight. Finally, we demonstrate the practical performance of our methods through both simulations and real-world numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performative predictions influence the very outcomes they aim to forecast. We study performative predictions that affect a sample (e.g., only existing users of an app) and/or the whole population (e.g., all potential app users). This raises the question of how well models generalize under performativity. For example, how well can we draw insights about new app users based on existing users when both of them react to the app's predictions? We address this question by embedding performative predictions into statistical learning theory. We prove generalization bounds under performative effects on the sample, on the population, and on both. A key intuition behind our proofs is that in the worst case, the population negates predictions, while the sample deceptively fulfills them. We cast such self-negating and self-fulfilling predictions as min-max and min-min risk functionals in Wasserstein space, respectively. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between performatively changing the world and learning from it: the more a model affects data, the less it can learn from it. Moreover, our analysis results in a surprising insight on how to improve generalization guarantees by retraining on performatively distorted samples. We illustrate our bounds in a case study on prediction-informed assignments of unemployed German residents to job trainings, drawing upon administrative labor market records from 1975 to 2017 in Germany.</description>

      <title>Bayesian PINNs for uncertainty-aware inverse problems (BPINN-IP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main contribution of this paper is to develop a hierarchical Bayesian formulation of PINNs for linear inverse problems, which is called BPINN-IP. The proposed methodology extends PINN to account for prior knowledge on the nature of the expected NN output, as well as its weights. Also, as we can have access to the posterior probability distributions, naturally uncertainties can be quantified. Also, variational inference and Monte Carlo dropout are employed to provide predictive means and variances for reconstructed images. Un example of applications to deconvolution and super-resolution is considered, details of the different steps of implementations are given, and some preliminary results are presented.</description>

      <title>A principled framework for uncertainty decomposition in TabPFN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TabPFN is a transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance on supervised tabular tasks by amortizing Bayesian prediction into a single forward pass. However, there is currently no method for uncertainty decomposition in TabPFN. Because it behaves, in an idealised limit, as a Bayesian in-context learner, we cast the decomposition challenge as a Bayesian predictive inference (BPI) problem. The main computational tool in BPI, predictive Monte Carlo, is challenging to apply here as it requires simulating unmodeled covariates. We therefore pursue the asymptotic alternative, filling a gap in the theory for supervised settings by proving a predictive CLT under quasi-martingale conditions. We derive variance estimators determined by the volatility of predictive updates along the context. The resulting credible bands are fast to compute, target epistemic uncertainty, and achieve near-nominal frequentist coverage. For classification, we further obtain an entropy-based uncertainty decomposition.</description>

      <title>Targeted Synthetic Control Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthetic control method (SCM) estimates causal effects in panel data with a single-treated unit by constructing a counterfactual outcome as a weighted combination of untreated control units that matches the pre-treatment trajectory. In this paper, we introduce the targeted synthetic control (TSC) method, a new two-stage estimator that directly estimates the counterfactual outcome. Specifically, our TSC method (1) yields a targeted debiasing estimator, in the sense that the targeted updating refines the initial weights to produce more stable weights; and (2) ensures that the final counterfactual estimation is a convex combination of observed control outcomes to enable direct interpretation of the synthetic control weights. TSC is flexible and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models. Methodologically, TSC starts from an initial set of synthetic-control weights via a one-dimensional targeted update through the weight-tilting submodel, which calibrates the weights to reduce bias of weights estimation arising from pre-treatment fit. Furthermore, TSC avoids key shortcomings of existing methods (e.g., the augmented SCM), which can produce unbounded counterfactual estimates. Across extensive synthetic and real-world experiments, TSC consistently improves estimation accuracy over state-of-the-art SCM baselines.</description>

      <title>Causal explanations of outliers in systems with lagged time-dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Root-cause analysis in controlled time dependent systems poses a major challenge in applications. Especially energy systems are difficult to handle as they exhibit instantaneous as well as delayed effects and if equipped with storage, do have a memory. In this paper we adapt the causal root-cause analysis method of Budhathoki et al. [2022] to general time-dependent systems, as it can be regarded as a strictly causal definition of the term "root-cause". Particularly, we discuss two truncation approaches to handle the infinite dependency graphs present in time-dependent systems. While one leaves the causal mechanisms intact, the other approximates the mechanisms at the start nodes. The effectiveness of the different approaches is benchmarked using a challenging data generation process inspired by a problem in factory energy management: the avoidance of peaks in the power consumption. We show that given enough lags our extension is able to localize the root-causes in the feature and time domain. Further the effect of mechanism approximation is discussed.</description>

      <title>Conditional Counterfactual Mean Embeddings: Doubly Robust Estimation and Learning Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete understanding of heterogeneous treatment effects involves characterizing the full conditional distribution of potential outcomes. To this end, we propose the Conditional Counterfactual Mean Embeddings (CCME), a framework that embeds conditional distributions of counterfactual outcomes into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Under this framework, we develop a two-stage meta-estimator for CCME that accommodates any RKHS-valued regression in each stage. Based on this meta-estimator, we develop three practical CCME estimators: (1) Ridge Regression estimator, (2) Deep Feature estimator that parameterizes the feature map by a neural network, and (3) Neural-Kernel estimator that performs RKHS-valued regression, with the coefficients parameterized by a neural network. We provide finite-sample convergence rates for all estimators, establishing that they possess the double robustness property. Our experiments demonstrate that our estimators accurately recover distributional features including multimodal structure of conditional counterfactual distributions.</description>

      <title>Multi-layer Cross-Attention is Provably Optimal for Multi-modal In-context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress has rapidly advanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying in-context learning in modern attention-based neural networks. However, existing results focus exclusively on unimodal data; in contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of in-context learning for multi-modal data remain poorly understood. We introduce a mathematically tractable framework for studying multi-modal learning and explore when transformer-like architectures can recover Bayes-optimal performance in-context. To model multi-modal problems, we assume the observed data arises from a latent factor model. Our first result comprises a negative take on expressibility: we prove that single-layer, linear self-attention fails to recover the Bayes-optimal predictor uniformly over the task distribution. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, linearized cross-attention mechanism, which we study in the regime where both the number of cross-attention layers and the context length are large. We show that this cross-attention mechanism is provably Bayes optimal when optimized using gradient flow. Our results underscore the benefits of depth for in-context learning and establish the provable utility of cross-attention for multi-modal distributions.</description>

      <title>GeoIB: Geometry-Aware Information Bottleneck via Statistical-Manifold Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information Bottleneck (IB) is widely used, but in deep learning, it is usually implemented through tractable surrogates, such as variational bounds or neural mutual information (MI) estimators, rather than directly controlling the MI I(X;Z) itself. The looseness and estimator-dependent bias can make IB "compression" only indirectly controlled and optimization fragile.
  We revisit the IB problem through the lens of information geometry and propose a \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}ottleneck (\textbf{GeoIB}) that dispenses with mutual information (MI) estimation. We show that I(X;Z) and I(Z;Y) admit exact projection forms as minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances from the joint distributions to their respective independence manifolds. Guided by this view, GeoIB controls information compression with two complementary terms: (i) a distribution-level Fisher-Rao (FR) discrepancy, which matches KL to second order and is reparameterization-invariant; and (ii) a geometry-level Jacobian-Frobenius (JF) term that provides a local capacity-type upper bound on I(Z;X) by penalizing pullback volume expansion of the encoder. We further derive a natural-gradient optimizer consistent with the FR metric and prove that the standard additive natural-gradient step is first-order equivalent to the geodesic update. We conducted extensive experiments and observed that the GeoIB achieves a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane than the mainstream IB baselines on popular datasets. GeoIB improves invariance and optimization stability by unifying distributional and geometric regularization under a single bottleneck multiplier. The source code of GeoIB is released at "https://anonymous.4open.science/r/G-IB-0569".</description>

      <title>The Role of Target Update Frequencies in Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The target network update frequency (TUF) is a central stabilization mechanism in (deep) Q-learning. However, their selection remains poorly understood and is often treated merely as another tunable hyperparameter rather than as a principled design decision. This work provides a theoretical analysis of target fixing in tabular Q-learning through the lens of approximate dynamic programming. We formulate periodic target updates as a nested optimization scheme in which each outer iteration applies an inexact Bellman optimality operator, approximated by a generic inner loop optimizer. Rigorous theory yields a finite-time convergence analysis for the asynchronous sampling setting, specializing to stochastic gradient descent in the inner loop. Our results deliver an explicit characterization of the bias-variance trade-off induced by the target update period, showing how to optimally set this critical hyperparameter. We prove that constant target update schedules are suboptimal, incurring a logarithmic overhead in sample complexity that is entirely avoidable with adaptive schedules. Our analysis shows that the optimal target update frequency increases geometrically over the course of the learning process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eldan's stochastic localization is a probabilistic construction that has proved instrumental to modern breakthroughs in high-dimensional geometry and the design of sampling algorithms. Motivated by sampling under non-Euclidean geometries and the mirror descent algorithm in optimization, we develop a functional generalization of Eldan's process that replaces Gaussian regularization with regularization by any positive integer multiple of a log-Laplace transform. We further give a mixing time bound on the Markov chain induced by our localization process, which holds if our target distribution satisfies a functional Poincar\'e inequality. Finally, we apply our framework to differentially private convex optimization in $\ell_p$ norms for $p \in [1, 2)$, where we improve state-of-the-art query complexities in a zeroth-order model.</description>

      <title>Group Contrastive Learning for Weakly Paired Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GROOVE, a semi-supervised multi-modal representation learning approach for high-content perturbation data where samples across modalities are weakly paired through shared perturbation labels but lack direct correspondence. Our primary contribution is GroupCLIP, a novel group-level contrastive loss that bridges the gap between CLIP for paired cross-modal data and SupCon for uni-modal supervised contrastive learning, addressing a fundamental gap in contrastive learning for weakly-paired settings. We integrate GroupCLIP with an on-the-fly backtranslating autoencoder framework to encourage cross-modally entangled representations while maintaining group-level coherence within a shared latent space. Critically, we introduce a comprehensive combinatorial evaluation framework that systematically assesses representation learners across multiple optimal transport aligners, addressing key limitations in existing evaluation strategies. This framework includes novel simulations that systematically vary shared versus modality-specific perturbation effects enabling principled assessment of method robustness. Our combinatorial benchmarking reveals that there is not yet an aligner that uniformly dominates across settings or modality pairs. Across simulations and two real single-cell genetic perturbation datasets, GROOVE performs on par with or outperforms existing approaches for downstream cross-modal matching and imputation tasks. Our ablation studies demonstrate that GroupCLIP is the key component driving performance gains. These results highlight the importance of leveraging group-level constraints for effective multi-modal representation learning in scenarios where only weak pairing is available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Partition Trees, a tree-based framework for conditional density estimation over general outcome spaces, supporting both continuous and categorical variables within a unified formulation. Our approach models conditional distributions as piecewise-constant densities on data adaptive partitions and learns trees by directly minimizing conditional negative log-likelihood. This yields a scalable, nonparametric alternative to existing probabilistic trees that does not make parametric assumptions about the target distribution. We further introduce Partition Forests, an ensemble extension obtained by averaging conditional densities. Empirically, we demonstrate improved probabilistic prediction over CART-style trees and competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic tree methods and Random Forests, along with robustness to redundant features and heteroscedastic noise.</description>

      <title>Principles of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, significantly expanding the frontiers of what is achievable in artificial intelligence. Yet, despite these advances, critical challenges remain -- most notably, ensuring robustness to small input perturbations and generalization to out-of-distribution data. These critical challenges underscore the need to understand the underlying fundamental principles that govern robustness and generalization. Among the theoretical tools available, Lipschitz continuity plays a pivotal role in governing the fundamental properties of neural networks related to robustness and generalization. It quantifies the worst-case sensitivity of network's outputs to small input perturbations. While its importance is widely acknowledged, prior research has predominantly focused on empirical regularization approaches based on Lipschitz constraints, leaving the underlying principles less explored. This thesis seeks to advance a principled understanding of the principles of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks within the paradigm of machine learning, examined from two complementary perspectives: an internal perspective -- focusing on the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks during training (i.e., training dynamics); and an external perspective -- investigating how Lipschitz continuity modulates the behavior of neural networks with respect to features in the input data, particularly its role in governing frequency signal propagation (i.e., modulation of frequency signal propagation).</description>

      <title>Multi-Integration of Labels across Categories for Component Identification (MILCCI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many fields collect large-scale temporal data through repeated measurements (trials), where each trial is labeled with a set of metadata variables spanning several categories. For example, a trial in a neuroscience study may be linked to a value from category (a): task difficulty, and category (b): animal choice. A critical challenge in time-series analysis is to understand how these labels are encoded within the multi-trial observations, and disentangle the distinct effect of each label entry across categories. Here, we present MILCCI, a novel data-driven method that i) identifies the interpretable components underlying the data, ii) captures cross-trial variability, and iii) integrates label information to understand each category's representation within the data. MILCCI extends a sparse per-trial decomposition that leverages label similarities within each category to enable subtle, label-driven cross-trial adjustments in component compositions and to distinguish the contribution of each category. MILCCI also learns each component's corresponding temporal trace, which evolves over time within each trial and varies flexibly across trials. We demonstrate MILCCI's performance through both synthetic and real-world examples, including voting patterns, online page view trends, and neuronal recordings.</description>

      <title>Separation-Utility Pareto Frontier: An Information-Theoretic Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04408v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Pareto frontier (optimal trade-off) between utility and separation, a fairness criterion requiring predictive independence from sensitive attributes conditional on the true outcome. Through an information-theoretic lens, we prove a characterization of the utility-separation Pareto frontier, establish its concavity, and thereby prove the increasing marginal cost of separation in terms of utility. In addition, we characterize the conditions under which this trade-off becomes strict, providing a guide for trade-off selection in practice. Based on the theoretical characterization, we develop an empirical regularizer based on conditional mutual information (CMI) between predictions and sensitive attributes given the true outcome. The CMI regularizer is compatible with any deep model trained via gradient-based optimization and serves as a scalar monitor of residual separation violations, offering tractable guarantees during training. Finally, numerical experiments support our theoretical findings: across COMPAS, UCI Adult, UCI Bank, and CelebA, the proposed method substantially reduces separation violations while matching or exceeding the utility of established baseline methods. This study thus offers a provable, stable, and flexible approach to enforcing separation in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Universality of General Spiked Tensor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rank-one spiked tensor model in the high-dimensional regime, where the noise entries are independent and identically distributed with zero mean, unit variance, and finite fourth moment.This setting extends the classical Gaussian framework to a substantially broader class of noise distributions.Focusing on asymmetric tensors of order $d$ ($\ge 3$), we analyze the maximum likelihood estimator of the best rank-one approximation.Under a mild assumption isolating informative critical points of the associated optimization landscape, we show that the empirical spectral distribution of a suitably defined block-wise tensor contraction converges almost surely to a deterministic limit that coincides with the Gaussian case.As a consequence, the asymptotic singular value and the alignments between the estimated and true spike directions admit explicit characterizations identical to those obtained under Gaussian noise. These results establish a universality principle for spiked tensor models, demonstrating that their high-dimensional spectral behavior and statistical limits are robust to non-Gaussian noise.
  Our analysis relies on resolvent methods from random matrix theory, cumulant expansions valid under finite moment assumptions, and variance bounds based on Efron-Stein-type arguments. A key challenge in the proof is how to handle the statistical dependence between the signal term and the noise term.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flow Through Diagram Expansions: Learning Regimes and Explicit Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general mathematical framework to analyze scaling regimes and derive explicit analytic solutions for gradient flow (GF) in large learning problems. Our key innovation is a formal power series expansion of the loss evolution, with coefficients encoded by diagrams akin to Feynman diagrams. We show that this expansion has a well-defined large-size limit that can be used to reveal different learning phases and, in some cases, to obtain explicit solutions of the nonlinear GF. We focus on learning Canonical Polyadic (CP) decompositions of high-order tensors, and show that this model has several distinct extreme lazy and rich GF regimes such as free evolution, NTK and under- and over-parameterized mean-field. We show that these regimes depend on the parameter scaling, tensor order, and symmetry of the model in a specific and subtle way. Moreover, we propose a general approach to summing the formal loss expansion by reducing it to a PDE; in a wide range of scenarios, it turns out to be 1st order and solvable by the method of characteristics. We observe a very good agreement of our theoretical predictions with experiment.</description>

      <title>Improved Dimension Dependence for Bandit Convex Optimization with Gradient Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-variation online learning has drawn increasing attention due to its deep connections to game theory, optimization, etc. It has been studied extensively in the full-information setting, but is underexplored with bandit feedback. In this work, we focus on gradient variation in Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO) with two-point feedback. By proposing a refined analysis on the non-consecutive gradient variation, a fundamental quantity in gradient variation with bandits, we improve the dimension dependence for both convex and strongly convex functions compared with the best known results (Chiang et al., 2013). Our improved analysis for the non-consecutive gradient variation also implies other favorable problem-dependent guarantees, such as gradient-variance and small-loss regrets. Beyond the two-point setup, we demonstrate the versatility of our technique by achieving the first gradient-variation bound for one-point bandit linear optimization over hyper-rectangular domains. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our results in more challenging tasks such as dynamic/universal regret minimization and bandit games, establishing the first gradient-variation dynamic and universal regret bounds for two-point BCO and fast convergence rates in bandit games.</description>

      <title>Theory of Optimal Learning Rate Schedules and Scaling Laws for a Random Feature Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Setting the learning rate for a deep learning model is a critical part of successful training, yet choosing this hyperparameter is often done empirically with trial and error. In this work, we explore a solvable model of optimal learning rate schedules for a powerlaw random feature model trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We consider the optimal schedule $\eta_T^\star(t)$ where $t$ is the current iterate and $T$ is the total training horizon. This schedule is computed both numerically and analytically (when possible) using optimal control methods. Our analysis reveals two regimes which we term the easy phase and hard phase. In the easy phase the optimal schedule is a polynomial decay $\eta_T^\star(t) \simeq T^{-\xi} (1-t/T)^{\delta}$ where $\xi$ and $\delta$ depend on the properties of the features and task. In the hard phase, the optimal schedule resembles warmup-stable-decay with constant (in $T$) initial learning rate and annealing performed over a vanishing (in $T$) fraction of training steps. We investigate joint optimization of learning rate and batch size, identifying a degenerate optimality condition. Our model also predicts the compute-optimal scaling laws (where model size and training steps are chosen optimally) in both easy and hard regimes. Going beyond SGD, we consider optimal schedules for the momentum $\beta(t)$, where speedups in the hard phase are possible. We compare our optimal schedule to various benchmarks in our task including (1) optimal constant learning rates $\eta_T(t) \sim T^{-\xi}$ (2) optimal power laws $\eta_T(t) \sim T^{-\xi} t^{-\chi}$, finding that our schedule achieves better rates than either of these. Our theory suggests that learning rate transfer across training horizon depends on the structure of the model and task. We explore these ideas in simple experimental pretraining setups.</description>

      <title>Maximum-Volume Nonnegative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04795v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data embedding technique. Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing.</description>

      <title>Score-Based Change-Point Detection and Region Localization for Spatio-Temporal Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study sequential change-point detection for spatio-temporal point processes, where actionable detection requires not only identifying when a distributional change occurs but also localizing where it manifests in space. While classical quickest change detection methods provide strong guarantees on detection delay and false-alarm rates, existing approaches for point-process data predominantly focus on temporal changes and do not explicitly infer affected spatial regions. We propose a likelihood-free, score-based detection framework that jointly estimates the change time and the change region in continuous space-time without assuming parametric knowledge of the pre- or post-change dynamics. The method leverages a localized and conditionally weighted Hyv\"arinen score to quantify event-level deviations from nominal behavior and aggregates these scores using a spatio-temporal CUSUM-type statistic over a prescribed class of spatial regions. Operating sequentially, the procedure outputs both a stopping time and an estimated change region, enabling real-time detection with spatial interpretability. We establish theoretical guarantees on false-alarm control, detection delay, and spatial localization accuracy, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through simulations and real-world spatio-temporal event data.</description>

      <title>Subliminal Effects in Your Data: A General Mechanism via Log-Linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training modern large language models (LLMs) has become a veritable smorgasbord of algorithms and datasets designed to elicit particular behaviors, making it critical to develop techniques to understand the effects of datasets on the model's properties. This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets.
  We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.</description>

Abstract: Several recent papers have proposed increasing the expressive power of graph neural networks by exploiting subgraphs or other topological structures. In parallel, researchers have investigated higher order permutation equivariant networks. In this paper we tie these two threads together by providing a general framework for higher order permutation equivariant message passing in subgraph neural networks. In this paper we introduce a new type of mathematical object called $P$-tensors, which provide a simple way to define the most general form of permutation equivariant message passing in both the above two categories of networks. We show that the P-Tensors paradigm can achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark molecular datasets.</description>

      <title>Predictive Low Rank Matrix Learning under Partial Observations: Mixed-Projection ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a partially observed matrix under the low rank assumption in the presence of fully observed side information that depends linearly on the true underlying matrix. This problem consists of an important generalization of the Matrix Completion problem, a central problem in Statistics, Operations Research and Machine Learning, that arises in applications such as recommendation systems, signal processing, system identification and image denoising. We formalize this problem as an optimization problem with an objective that balances the strength of the fit of the reconstruction to the observed entries with the ability of the reconstruction to be predictive of the side information. We derive a mixed-projection reformulation of the resulting optimization problem and present a strong semidefinite cone relaxation. We design an efficient, scalable alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm that produces high quality feasible solutions to the problem of interest. Our numerical results demonstrate that in the small rank regime ({\color{black}$k \leq 10$}), our algorithm outputs solutions that achieve on average {\color{black}$2.3\%$} lower objective value and {\color{black}$41\%$} lower $\ell_2$ reconstruction error than the solutions returned by the best performing benchmark method on synthetic data. The runtime of our algorithm is competitive with and often superior to that of the benchmark methods. Our algorithm is able to solve problems with $n = 10000$ rows and $m = 10000$ columns in less than a minute. On large scale real world data, our algorithm produces solutions that achieve $67\%$ lower out of sample error than benchmark methods in $97\%$ less execution time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13732v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Backward Conformal Prediction}$, a method that guarantees conformal coverage while providing flexible control over the size of prediction sets. Unlike standard conformal prediction, which fixes the coverage level and allows the conformal set size to vary, our approach defines a rule that constrains how prediction set sizes behave based on the observed data, and adapts the coverage level accordingly. Our method builds on two key foundations: (i) recent results by Gauthier et al. [2025] on post-hoc validity using e-values, which ensure marginal coverage of the form $\mathbb{P}(Y_{\rm test} \in \hat C_n^{\tilde{\alpha}}(X_{\rm test})) \ge 1 - \mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ for any data-dependent miscoverage $\tilde{\alpha}$, and (ii) a novel leave-one-out estimator $\hat{\alpha}^{\rm LOO}$ of the marginal miscoverage $\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ based on the calibration set, ensuring that the theoretical guarantees remain computable in practice. This approach is particularly useful in applications where large prediction sets are impractical such as medical diagnosis. We provide theoretical results and empirical evidence supporting the validity of our method, demonstrating that it maintains computable coverage guarantees while ensuring interpretable, well-controlled prediction set sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning expressive kernels while retaining tractable inference remains a central challenge in scaling Gaussian processes (GPs) to large and complex datasets. We propose a scalable GP regressor based on deep basis kernels (DBKs). Our DBK is constructed from a small set of neural-network-parameterized basis functions with an explicit low-rank structure. This formulation immediately enables linear-complexity inference with respect to the number of samples, possibly without inducing points. DBKs provide a unifying perspective that recovers sparse deep kernel learning and Gaussian Bayesian last-layer methods as special cases. We further identify that naively maximizing the marginal likelihood can lead to oversimplified uncertainty and rank-deficient solutions. To address this, we introduce a mini-batch stochastic objective that directly targets the predictive distribution with decoupled regularization. Empirically, DBKs show advantages in predictive accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and computational efficiency across a range of large-scale regression benchmarks.</description>

      <title>DP-SPRT: Differentially Private Sequential Probability Ratio Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Wald's celebrated Sequential Probability Ratio Test for sequential tests of two simple hypotheses, under privacy constraints. We propose DP-SPRT, a wrapper that can be calibrated to achieve desired error probabilities and privacy constraints, addressing a significant gap in previous work. DP-SPRT relies on a private mechanism that processes a sequence of queries and stops after privately determining when the query results fall outside a predefined interval. This OutsideInterval mechanism improves upon naive composition of existing techniques like AboveThreshold, achieving a factor-of-2 privacy improvement and thus potentially benefiting other continual monitoring procedures. We prove generic upper bounds on the error and sample complexity of DP-SPRT that can accommodate various noise distributions based on the practitioner's privacy needs. We exemplify them in two settings: Laplace noise (pure Differential Privacy) and Gaussian noise (R\'enyi differential privacy). In the former setting, by providing a lower bound on the sample complexity of any $\varepsilon$-DP test with prescribed type I and type II errors, we show that DP-SPRT is near optimal when both errors are small and the two hypotheses are close. Moreover, we conduct an experimental study revealing its good practical performance.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Additive Regression Trees for functional ANOVA model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a powerful statistical model that leverages the strengths of Bayesian inference and regression trees. It has received significant attention for capturing complex non-linear relationships and interactions among predictors. However, the accuracy of BART often comes at the cost of interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose ANOVA Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (ANOVA-BART), a novel extension of BART based on the functional ANOVA decomposition, which is used to decompose the variability of a function into different interactions, each representing the contribution of a different set of covariates or factors. Our proposed ANOVA-BART enhances interpretability, preserves and extends the theoretical guarantees of BART, and achieves comparable prediction performance. Specifically, we establish that the posterior concentration rate of ANOVA-BART is nearly minimax optimal, and further provides the same convergence rates for each interaction that are not available for BART. Moreover, comprehensive experiments confirm that ANOVA-BART is comparable to BART in both accuracy and uncertainty quantification, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in component selection. These results suggest that ANOVA-BART offers a compelling alternative to BART by balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and theoretical consistency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction can be used to construct prediction sets that cover the true outcome with a desired probability, but can sometimes lead to large prediction sets that are costly in practice. The most useful outcome is a singleton prediction-an unambiguous decision-yet existing efficiency-oriented methods primarily optimize average set size. Motivated by this, we propose a new nonconformity score that aims to minimize the probability of producing non-singleton sets. Starting from a non-convex constrained optimization problem as a motivation, we provide a geometric reformulation and associated algorithm for computing the nonconformity score and associated split conformal prediction sets in O(K) time for K-class problems. Using this score in split conformal prediction leads to our proposed Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction (SOCOP) method. We evaluate our method in experiments on image classification and LLM multiple-choice question-answering, comparing with standard nonconformity scores such as the (negative) label probability estimates and their cumulative distribution function; both of which are motivated by optimizing length. The results show that SOCOP increases singleton frequency (sometimes by over 20%) compared to the above scores, with minimal impact on average set size.</description>

      <title>DAISI: Data Assimilation with Inverse Sampling using Stochastic Interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is a cornerstone of scientific and engineering applications, combining model forecasts with sparse and noisy observations to estimate latent system states. Classical high-dimensional DA methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, rely on Gaussian approximations that are violated for complex dynamics or observation operators. To address this limitation, we introduce DAISI, a scalable filtering algorithm built on flow-based generative models that enables flexible probabilistic inference using data-driven priors. The core idea is to use a stationary, pre-trained generative prior that first incorporates forecast information through a novel inverse-sampling step, before assimilating observations via guidance-based conditional sampling. This allows us to leverage any forecasting model as part of the DA pipeline without having to retrain or fine-tune the generative prior at each assimilation step. Experiments on challenging nonlinear systems show that DAISI achieves accurate filtering results in regimes with sparse, noisy, and nonlinear observations where traditional methods struggle.</description>

      <title>A Novel Framework Using Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows to Train Transport Reversible Jump Proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework that employs variational inference (VI) with (conditional) normalizing flows (NFs) to train both between-model and within-model proposals for reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, enabling efficient trans-dimensional Bayesian inference. In contrast to the transport reversible jump (TRJ) of Davies et al. (2023), which optimizes forward KL divergence using pilot samples from the complex target distribution, our approach minimizes the reverse KL divergence, requiring only samples from a simple base distribution and largely reducing computational cost. Especially, we develop a novel trans-dimensional VI method with conditional NFs to fit the conditional transport proposal of Davies et al. (2023). We use RealNVP flows to learn the model-specific transport maps used for constructing proposals so that the calculation is parallelizable. Our framework also provides accurate estimates of marginal likelihoods, which may facilitate efficient model comparison and help design rejection-free proposals. Extensive numerical studies demonstrate that the TRJ method trained under our framework achieves faster mixing compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Learning from Neighbors with PHIBP: Predicting Infectious Disease Dynamics in Data-Sparse Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling sparse count data, which arise across numerous scientific fields, presents significant statistical challenges. This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Alignment for Diffusion Models via Variationally Stable Doob's Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference-time alignment for diffusion models aims to adapt a pre-trained reference diffusion model toward a target distribution without retraining the reference score network, thereby preserving the generative capacity of the reference model while enforcing desired properties at the inference time. A central mechanism for achieving such alignment is guidance, which modifies the sampling dynamics through an additional drift term. In this work, we introduce variationally stable Doob's matching, a novel framework for provable guidance estimation grounded in Doob's $h$-transform. Our approach formulates guidance as the gradient of logarithm of an underlying Doob's $h$-function and employs gradient-regularized regression to simultaneously estimate both the $h$-function and its gradient, resulting in a consistent estimator of the guidance. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for the estimated guidance. Moreover, we analyze the resulting controllable diffusion processes and prove non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for the generated distributions in the 2-Wasserstein distance. Finally, we show that variationally stable guidance estimators are adaptive to unknown low dimensionality, effectively mitigating the curse of dimensionality under low-dimensional subspace assumptions.</description>

      <title>Unified Unbiased Variance Estimation for Maximum Mean Discrepancy: Robust Finite-Sample Performance with Imbalanced Data and Exact Acceleration under Null and Alternative Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is a kernel-based nonparametric statistic for two-sample testing, whose inferential accuracy depends critically on variance characterization. Existing work provides various finite-sample estimators of the MMD variance, often differing under the null and alternative hypotheses and across balanced or imbalanced sampling schemes. In this paper, we study the variance of the MMD statistic through its U-statistic representation and Hoeffding decomposition, and establish a unified finite-sample characterization covering different hypotheses and sample configurations. Building on this analysis, we propose an exact acceleration method for the univariate case under the Laplacian kernel, which reduces the overall computational complexity from $\mathcal O(n^2)$ to $\mathcal O(n \log n)$.</description>

      <title>Low-Dimensional Adaptation of Rectified Flow: A Diffusion and Stochastic Localization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Rectified flow (RF) has gained considerable popularity largely due to its generation efficiency and state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which RF automatically adapts to the intrinsic low dimensionality of the support of the target distribution to accelerate sampling. We show that, using a carefully designed choice of the time-discretization scheme and with sufficiently accurate drift estimates, the RF sampler enjoys an iteration complexity of order $O(k/\varepsilon)$ (up to log factors), where $\varepsilon$ is the precision in total variation distance and $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution. In addition, we show that the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) procedure is equivalent to a stochastic version of RF by establishing a novel connection between these processes and stochastic localization. Building on this connection, we further design a stochastic RF sampler that also adapts to the low-dimensionality of the target distribution under milder requirements on the accuracy of the drift estimates, and also with a specific time schedule. We illustrate with simulations on the synthetic data and text-to-image data experiments the improved performance of the proposed samplers implementing the newly designed time-discretization schedules.</description>

      <title>It's all In the (Exponential) Family: An Equivalence between Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Control Variates for Sketching Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) and control variate estimators (CVE) have been used in conjunction with known information across sketching algorithms and applications in machine learning. We prove that under certain conditions in an exponential family, an optimal CVE will achieve the same asymptotic variance as the MLE, giving an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the MLE. Experiments show the EM algorithm is faster and numerically stable compared to other root finding algorithms for the MLE for the bivariate Normal distribution, and we expect this to hold across distributions satisfying these conditions. We show how the EM algorithm leads to reproducibility for algorithms using MLE / CVE, and demonstrate how the EM algorithm leads to finding the MLE when the CV weights are known.</description>

      <title>Privacy Amplification by Missing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy preservation is a fundamental requirement in many high-stakes domains such as medicine and finance, where sensitive personal data must be analyzed without compromising individual confidentiality. At the same time, these applications often involve datasets with missing values due to non-response, data corruption, or deliberate anonymization. Missing data is traditionally viewed as a limitation because it reduces the information available to analysts and can degrade model performance. In this work, we take an alternative perspective and study missing data from a privacy preservation standpoint. Intuitively, when features are missing, less information is revealed about individuals, suggesting that missingness could inherently enhance privacy. We formalize this intuition by analyzing missing data as a privacy amplification mechanism within the framework of differential privacy. We show, for the first time, that incomplete data can yield privacy amplification for differentially private algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dictionary Learning under Symmetries via Group Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dictionary learning problem can be viewed as a data-driven process to learn a suitable transformation so that data is sparsely represented directly from example data. In this paper, we examine the problem of learning a dictionary that is invariant under a pre-specified group of transformations. Natural settings include Cryo-EM, multi-object tracking, synchronization, pose estimation, etc. We specifically study this problem under the lens of mathematical representation theory. Leveraging the power of non-abelian Fourier analysis for functions over compact groups, we prescribe an algorithmic recipe for learning dictionaries that obey such invariances. We relate the dictionary learning problem in the physical domain, which is naturally modelled as being infinite dimensional, with the associated computational problem, which is necessarily finite dimensional. We establish that the dictionary learning problem can be effectively understood as an optimization instance over certain matrix orbitopes having a particular block-diagonal structure governed by the irreducible representations of the group of symmetries. This perspective enables us to introduce a band-limiting procedure which obtains dimensionality reduction in applications. We provide guarantees for our computational ansatz to provide a desirable dictionary learning outcome. We apply our paradigm to investigate the dictionary learning problem for the groups SO(2) and SO(3). While the SO(2)-orbitope admits an exact spectrahedral description, substantially less is understood about the SO(3)-orbitope. We describe a tractable spectrahedral outer approximation of the SO(3)-orbitope, and contribute an alternating minimization paradigm to perform optimization in this setting. We provide numerical experiments to highlight the efficacy of our approach in learning SO(3)-invariant dictionaries, both on synthetic and on real world data.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Error Estimation: Excess Risk Bounds without Class Complexity as Input</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04636v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing confidence intervals that are simultaneously valid across a class of estimates is central to tasks such as multiple mean estimation, generalization guarantees, and adaptive experimental design. We frame this as an ``error estimation problem," where the goal is to determine a high-probability upper bound on the maximum error for a class of estimates. We propose an entirely data-driven approach that derives such bounds for both finite and infinite class settings, naturally adapting to a potentially unknown correlation structure of random errors. Notably, our method does not require class complexity as an input, overcoming a major limitation of existing approaches. We present our simple yet general solution and demonstrate applications to simultaneous confidence intervals, excess-risk control and optimizing exploration in contextual bandit algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Implicit networks are a class of neural networks whose outputs are defined by the fixed point of a parameterized operator. They have enjoyed success in many applications including natural language processing, image processing, and numerous other applications. While they have found abundant empirical success, theoretical work on its generalization is still under-explored. In this work, we consider a large family of implicit networks defined parameterized contractive fixed point operators. We show a generalization bound for this class based on a covering number argument for the Rademacher complexity of these architectures.</description>

      <title>Learning to Explore with Lagrangians for Bandits under Unknown Linear Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pure exploration in bandits formalises multiple real-world problems, such as tuning hyper-parameters or conducting user studies to test a set of items, where different safety, resource, and fairness constraints on the decision space naturally appear. We study these problems as pure exploration in multi-armed bandits with unknown linear constraints, where the aim is to identify an $r$-optimal and feasible policy as fast as possible with a given level of confidence. First, we propose a Lagrangian relaxation of the sample complexity lower bound for pure exploration under constraints. Second, we leverage properties of convex optimisation in the Lagrangian lower bound to propose two computationally efficient extensions of Track-and-Stop and Gamified Explorer, namely LATS and LAGEX. Then, we propose a constraint-adaptive stopping rule, and while tracking the lower bound, use optimistic estimate of the feasible set at each step. We show that LAGEX achieves asymptotically optimal sample complexity upper bound, while LATS shows asymptotic optimality up to novel constraint-dependent constants. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments with different reward distributions and constraints that validate efficient performance of LATS and LAGEX.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural stochastic differential equations, or diffusion models, to sample from a Boltzmann distribution without access to target samples. Existing methods for training such models enforce time-reversal of the generative and noising processes, using either differentiable simulation or off-policy reinforcement learning (RL). We prove equivalences between families of objectives in the limit of infinitesimal discretization steps, linking entropic RL methods (GFlowNets) with continuous-time objects (partial differential equations and path space measures). We further show that an appropriate choice of coarse time discretization during training allows greatly improved sample efficiency and the use of time-local objectives, achieving competitive performance on standard sampling benchmarks with reduced computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a hybrid non-Euclidean optimization method which generalizes gradient norm clipping by combining steepest descent and conditional gradient approaches. The method achieves the best of both worlds by establishing a descent property under a generalized notion of ($L_0$,$L_1$)-smoothness. Weight decay is incorporated in a principled manner by identifying a connection to the Frank-Wolfe short step. In the stochastic case, we show an order optimal $O(n^{-1/4})$ convergence rate by leveraging a momentum based gradient estimator. We discuss how to instantiate the algorithms for deep learning, which we dub Clipped Scion, and demonstrate their properties on image classification and language modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/ClippedScion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context, recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and edge features for improved expressivity. However, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably, SpectRe is strictly more expressive than PH and spectral information on graphs alone. We also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant learning tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/SpectRe/.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has traditionally solved black-box problems where function evaluation is expensive and, therefore, observations are few. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in applying BO to problems where function evaluation is cheaper and observations are more plentiful. In this regime, scaling to many observations $N$ is impeded by Gaussian-process (GP) surrogates: GP hyperparameter fitting scales as $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ (reduced to roughly $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ in modern implementations), and it is repeated at every BO iteration. Many methods improve scaling at acquisition time, but hyperparameter fitting still scales poorly, making it the bottleneck. We propose Epistemic Nearest Neighbors (ENN), a lightweight alternative to GPs that estimates function values and uncertainty (epistemic and aleatoric) from $K$-nearest-neighbor observations. ENN scales as $\mathcal{O}(N)$ for both fitting and acquisition. Our BO method, TuRBO-ENN, replaces the GP surrogate in TuRBO with ENN and its Thompson-sampling acquisition with $\mathrm{UCB} = \mu(x) + \sigma(x)$. For the special case of noise-free problems, we can omit fitting altogether by replacing $\mathrm{UCB}$ with a non-dominated sort over $\mu(x)$ and $\sigma(x)$. We show empirically that TuRBO-ENN reduces proposal time (i.e., fitting time + acquisition time) by one to two orders of magnitude compared to TuRBO at up to 50,000 observations.</description>

      <title>LIT-LVM: Structured Regularization for Interaction Terms in Linear Predictors using Latent Variable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to the elastic net, hierarchical lasso, and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.</description>

      <title>Minimax and Bayes Optimal Best-Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24007v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates minimax and Bayes optimal strategies for fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive procedure consisting of a sampling phase followed by a recommendation phase, and we design an adaptive experiment within this framework to efficiently identify the best arm, defined as the one with the highest expected outcome. In our proposed strategy, the sampling phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, in which we allocate samples uniformly across arms to eliminate clearly suboptimal arms and to estimate outcome variances. Before entering the second stage, we solve a Gaussian minimax game, which yields a sampling ratio and a decision rule. In the second stage, samples are allocated according to this sampling ratio. After the sampling phase, the procedure enters the recommendation phase, where we select an arm using the decision rule. We prove that this single strategy is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for the simple regret, and we establish upper bounds that coincide exactly with our lower bounds, including the constant terms.</description>

      <title>Unifying Re-Identification, Attribute Inference, and Data Reconstruction Risks in Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06969v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms are difficult to interpret and calibrate because existing methods for mapping standard privacy parameters to concrete privacy risks -- re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction -- are both overly pessimistic and inconsistent. In this work, we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and (2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary, including worst-case, levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, R\'enyi DP, and concentrated DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., an accuracy increase from 52% to 70% in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification, attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.</description>

      <title>Multiple Choice Learning of Low-Rank Adapters for Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose LoRA-MCL, a training scheme that extends next-token prediction in language models with a method designed to decode diverse, plausible sentence continuations at inference time. Traditional language modeling is an intrinsically ill-posed problem: given a context, multiple ``futures'' may be equally plausible. Our approach leverages Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and the Winner-Takes-All loss to efficiently handle ambiguity through Low-Rank Adaptation. We provide a theoretical interpretation of applying MCL to language modeling, assuming the data is generated from a mixture of distributions. We illustrate the proposed approach using mixtures of Markov chains. We then demonstrate with experiments on visual and audio captioning, as well as machine translation, that our method achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs. The accompanying code and a general-purpose package for applying LoRA-MCL to a wide range of language models are made available.</description>

      <title>Online Budget Allocation with Censored Semi-Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic budget-allocation problem over $K$ tasks. At each round $t$, the learner chooses an allocation $X_t \in \Delta_K$. Task $k$ succeeds with probability $F_k(X_{t,k})$, where $F_1,\dots,F_K$ are nondecreasing budget-to-success curves, and upon success yields a random reward with unknown mean $\mu_k$. The learner observes which tasks succeed, and observes a task's reward only upon success (censored semi-bandit feedback). This model captures, for instance, splitting payments across crowdsourcing workers or distributing bids across simultaneous auctions, and subsumes stochastic multi-armed bandits and semi-bandits.
  We design an optimism-based algorithm that operates under censored semi-bandit feedback. Our main result shows that in diminishing-returns regimes, the regret of this algorithm scales polylogarithmically with the horizon $T$ without any ad hoc tuning. For general nondecreasing curves, we prove that the same algorithm (with the same tuning) achieves a worst-case regret upper bound of $\tilde O(K\sqrt{T})$. Finally, we establish a matching worst-case regret lower bound of $\Omega(K\sqrt{T})$ that holds even for full-feedback algorithms, highlighting the intrinsic hardness of our problem outside diminishing returns.</description>

      <title>Improving Detection of Watermarked Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking has recently emerged as an effective strategy for detecting the generations of large language models (LLMs). The strength of a watermark typically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and the set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice, especially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection based on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether detection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark ones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing performance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Domain Generalization Under Posterior Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) is the problem of generalizing from several distributions (or domains), for which labeled training data are available, to a new test domain for which no labeled data is available. For the prevailing benchmark datasets in DG, there exists a single classifier that performs well across all domains.
  In this work, we study a fundamentally different regime where the domains satisfy a \emph{posterior drift} assumption, in which the optimal classifier might vary substantially with domain. We establish a decision-theoretic framework for DG under posterior drift, and investigate the practical implications of this framework through experiments on language and vision tasks.</description>

      <title>When Do Credal Sets Stabilize? Fixed-Point Theorems for Credal Set Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms rely on iterative updates of uncertainty representations, ranging from variational inference and expectation-maximization, to reinforcement learning, continual learning, and multi-agent learning. In the presence of imprecision and ambiguity, credal sets -- closed, convex sets of probability distributions -- have emerged as a popular framework for representing imprecise probabilistic beliefs. Under such imprecision, many learning problems in imprecise probabilistic machine learning (IPML) may be viewed as processes involving successive applications of update rules on credal sets. This naturally raises the question of whether this iterative process converges to stable fixed points -- or, more generally, under what conditions on the updating mechanism such fixed points exist, and whether they can be attained. We provide the first analysis of this problem, and illustrate our findings using Credal Bayesian Deep Learning as a concrete example. Our work demonstrates that incorporating imprecision into the learning process not only enriches the representation of uncertainty, but also reveals structural conditions under which stability emerges, thereby offering new insights into the dynamics of iterative learning under imprecision.</description>

      <title>metabeta -- A fast neural model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression. Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually required time, enabling new use cases for Bayesian mixed-effects modeling.</description>

      <title>Achieving Logarithmic Regret in KL-Regularized Zero-Sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization). Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study both two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games: for matrix games, we propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the traditional $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret without the $\beta^{-1}$ dependence.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Tabular Data Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation is an important tool for privacy-preserving data sharing. While diffusion models have set recent benchmarks, flow matching (FM) offers a promising alternative. This paper presents different ways to implement flow matching for tabular data synthesis. We provide a comprehensive empirical study that compares flow matching (FM and variational FM) with a state-of-the-art diffusion method (TabDDPM and TabSyn) in tabular data synthesis. We evaluate both the standard Optimal Transport (OT) and the Variance Preserving (VP) probability paths, and also compare deterministic and stochastic samplers -- something possible when learning to generate using \textit{variational} flow matching -- characterising the empirical relationship between data utility and privacy risk. Our key findings reveal that flow matching, particularly TabbyFlow, outperforms diffusion baselines. Flow matching methods also achieves better performance with remarkably low function evaluations ($\leq$ 100 steps), offering a substantial computational advantage. The choice of probability path is also crucial, as using the OT path demonstrates superior performance, while VP has potential for producing synthetic data with lower disclosure risk. Lastly, our results show that making flows stochastic not only preserves marginal distributions but, in some instances, enables the generation of high utility synthetic data with reduced disclosure risk.</description>

      <title>Convergence Guarantees for Federated SARSA with Local Training and Heterogeneous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical analysis of Federated SARSA (FedSARSA) with linear function approximation and local training. We establish convergence guarantees for FedSARSA in the presence of heterogeneity, both in local transitions and rewards, providing the first sample and communication complexity bounds in this setting. At the core of our analysis is a new, exact multi-step error expansion for single-agent SARSA, which is of independent interest. Our analysis precisely quantifies the impact of heterogeneity, demonstrating the convergence of FedSARSA with multiple local updates. Crucially, we show that FedSARSA achieves linear speed-up with respect to the number of agents, up to higher-order terms due to Markovian sampling. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Optimization, Generalization and Differential Privacy Bounds for Gradient Descent on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a structured alternative to standard MLPs, yet a principled theory for their training dynamics, generalization, and privacy properties remains limited. In this paper, we analyze gradient descent (GD) for training two-layer KANs and derive general bounds that characterize their training dynamics, generalization, and utility under differential privacy (DP). As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\sqrt{d}/(n\epsilon)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes. Experiments further illustrate how these theoretical insights can guide practical choices, including network width selection and early stopping.</description>
