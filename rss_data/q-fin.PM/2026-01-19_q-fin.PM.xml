      <title>Fast Times, Slow Times: Timescale Separation in Financial Timeseries Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial time series exhibit multiscale behavior, with interaction between multiple processes operating on different timescales. This paper introduces a method for separating these processes using variance and tail stationarity criteria, framed as generalized eigenvalue problems. The approach allows for the identification of slow and fast components in asset returns and prices, with applications to parameter drift, mean reversion, and tail risk management. Empirical examples using currencies, equity ETFs and treasury yields illustrate the practical utility of the method.</description>

      <title>Automated Liquidity: Market Impact, Cycles, and De-pegging Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three traits of decentralized finance are studied. First, the market impact function is derived for optimal-growth liquidity providers. For a standard random walk, the classic square-root impact is recovered. An extension is then derived to fit general fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. These findings break with the linearized liquidity models used in most decentralized exchanges. Second, a Constant Product Market Maker is viewed as a multi-phase Carnot engine, where one phase matches the exchange of tokens by a liquidity taker, and another the change of pool size by a liquidity provider. Third, stablecoin de-pegging is a form of catastrophe risk. By using growth optimization, default odds are linked to the cost of catastrophe bonds. De-pegging insurance can act as a counterweight and a key marketing tool when the law forbids the payment of interest on stablecoins.</description>

      <title>Event-Driven Market Co-Movement Dynamics in Critical Mineral Equities: An Empirical Framework Using Change Point Detection and Cross-Sectional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines market behavior in critical mineral investments using a novel analytical framework that combines change-point detection (PELT algorithm) with cross-sectional analysis. This research analyzes ESG-ranked critical mineral ETFs from March 31, 2014, to April 19, 2024, using the S&amp;P 500 as a benchmark to evaluate market co-movements. The findings demonstrate that different critical mineral investments experienced change points at distinct times, but three major dates, July 23, 2015; March 17, 2020; and December 1, 2020, were common and aligned with global events such as the oil market shock, the COVID-19 pandemic, and later market adjustments. Herding behavior among investors increased after these shocks, following the 2015 and 2020 crises, but shifted to anti-herding after positive vaccine news in late 2020 and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The sensitivity analysis shows that investor coordination is strongest during market downturns but exhibits greater variation during stable periods or after major developments, with these dynamics sensitive to the length of the observation period. Additionally, anti-herding became more apparent during crises, suggesting investors reacted to specific risks rather than moving in lockstep, especially in response to geopolitical shocks.</description>
