      <title>Is diamagnetism really acausal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamagnetism, in which the magnetisation in a medium opposes the direction of an applied magnetic field, is a weak but familiar effect in a wide class of materials. Being weak it is also a linear response to any applied field. The problem is that the existence of diamagnetism is in direct conflict with the requirements of causality as embodied in the familiar Kramers-Kronig relations. Nature does not care about our confusion and diamagnetism exists and physics is constrained by the requirements of causality (that effect cannot precede its cause). This puzzle has received intermittent attention from time to time, with a variety of arguments made to resolve the paradox. None of these, no matter how plausible, reveal the mechanism that resolves the existence of diamagnetism without sacrificing causality. The full resolution is presented in this letter.</description>

      <title>Flat band mediated photon-photon interactions in 2D waveguide QED networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>Fiber-coupled broadband quantum memory for polarization-encoded photonic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various near-term quantum networking applications will benefit from low-loss, fiber-coupled photonic quantum memory devices with high efficiencies. We demonstrate a fiber-coupled loop-and-switch quantum memory platform with a pass-through efficiency of ~54% and an overall storage efficiency that scales as ~0.5^(N+1) where N is the number of storage cycles. We highlight the trade-off between memory lifetime and qubit accessibility in this platform by using two different storage cycle times of ~40 nanoseconds and ~0.5 microseconds, and demonstrate high-fidelity storage and retrieval of ultra-broadband single-photon polarization qubits in both cases.</description>

      <title>Temporal coherence of single photons emitted by hexagonal Boron Nitride defects at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) emerge as promising quantum light sources at room temperature, with potential applications in quantum communications, among others. The temporal coherence of emitted photons (i.e. their capacity to interfere and distribute photonic entanglement) is essential for many of these applications. Hence, it is crucial to study and determine the temporal coherence of this emission under different experimental conditions. In this work, we report the coherence time of the single photons emitted by an hBN defect in a nanocrystal at room temperature, measured via Michelson interferometry. The visibility of this interference vanishes when the temporal delay between the interferometer arms is a few hundred femtoseconds, highlighting that the phonon dephasing processes are four orders of magnitude faster than the spontaneous decay time of the emitter. We also analyze the single photon characteristics of the emission via correlation measurements, defect blinking dynamics, and its Debye-Waller factor. Our room temperature results highlight the presence of a strong phonon-electron coupling, suggesting the need to work at cryogenic temperatures to enable quantum photonic applications based on photon interference.</description>

      <title>Distributed Realization of Color Codes for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color codes are a leading class of topological quantum error-correcting codes with modest error thresholds and structural compatibility with two-dimensional architectures, which make them well-suited for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Here, we propose and analyze a distributed architecture for realizing the (6.6.6) color code. The architecture involves interconnecting patches of the color code housed in different quantum processing units (QPUs) via entangled pairs. To account for noisy interconnects, we model the qubits in the color code as being subject to a bit-flip noise channel, where the qubits on the boundary (seam) between patches experience elevated noise compared to those in the bulk. We investigate the error threshold of the distributed color code under such asymmetric noise conditions by employing two decoders: a tensor-network-based decoder and a recently introduced concatenated Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) algorithm. Our simulations demonstrate that elevated noise on seam qubits leads to a slight reduction in threshold for the tensor-network decoder, whereas the concatenated MWPM decoder shows no significant change in the error threshold, underscoring its effectiveness under asymmetric noise conditions. Our findings thus highlight the robustness of color codes in distributed architectures and provide valuable insights into the practical realization of FTQC involving noisy interconnects between QPUs.</description>

      <title>Two exact quantum signal processing results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) is a framework for implementing certain polynomial functions via quantum circuits. To construct a QSP circuit, one needs (i) a target polynomial $P(z)$, which must satisfy $\lvert P(z)\rvert\leq 1$ on the complex unit circle $\mathbb{T}$ and (ii) a complementary polynomial $Q(z)$, which satisfies $\lvert P(z)\rvert^2+\lvert Q(z)\rvert^2=1$ on $\mathbb{T}$. We present two exact mathematical results within this context. First, we obtain an exact expression for a certain uniform polynomial approximant of $1/x$, which is used to perform matrix inversion via quantum circuits. Second, given a generic target polynomial $P(z)$, we construct the complementary polynomial $Q(z)$ exactly via integral representations, valid throughout the entire complex plane.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Directed Graph States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a family of quantum states defined by directed graphs, where the oriented edges represent interactions between ordered qubits. As a measure of entanglement, we adopt the Entanglement Distance - a quantity derived from the Fubini - Study metric on the system's projective Hilbert space.
  We demonstrate that this measure is entirely determined by the vertex degree distribution and remains invariant under vertex relabeling, underscoring its topological nature. Consequently, the entanglement depends solely on the total degree of each vertex, making it insensitive to the distinction between incoming and outgoing edges.
  These findings offer a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations and entanglement in complex systems, with promising implications for the design and analysis of quantum networks.</description>

      <title>From noisy observables to accurate ground state energies: a quantum classical signal subspace approach with denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for ground state energy (GSE) estimation that remains robust to highly noisy data and exhibits low sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. Our approach -- Fourier Denoising Observable Dynamic Mode Decomposition (FDODMD) -- combines Fourier-based denoising thresholding to suppress spurious noise modes with observable dynamic mode decomposition (ODMD), a quantum-classical signal subspace method. By applying ODMD to an ensemble of denoised time-domain trajectories, FDODMD reliably estimates the system's eigenfrequencies. We also provide an error analysis of FDODMD. Numerical experiments on molecular systems demonstrate that FDODMD achieves convergence in high-noise regimes inaccessible to baseline methods under a limited quantum computational budget, while accelerating spectral estimation in intermediate-noise regimes. Importantly, this performance gain is entirely classical, requiring no additional quantum overhead and significantly reducing overall quantum resource demands.</description>

      <title>Quantum data generation in a denoising model with multiscale entanglement renormalization network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technology has entered the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) information processing. The technological revolution of machine learning represented by generative models heralds a great prospect of artificial intelligence, and the huge amount of data processes poses a big challenge to existing computers. The generation of large quantities of quantum data will be a challenge for quantum artificial intelligence. In this work, we present an efficient noise-resistant quantum data generation method that can be applied to various types of NISQ quantum processors, where the target quantum data belongs to a certain class and our proposal enables the generation of various quantum data belonging to the target class. Specifically, we propose a quantum denoising probability model (QDM) based on a multiscale entanglement renormalization network (MERA) for the generation of quantum data. To show the feasibility and practicality of our scheme, we demonstrate the generations of the classes of GHZ-like states and W-like states with a success rate above 99%. Our MREA QDM can also be used to denoise multiple types of quantum data simultaneously. We show the success rate of denoising both GHZ-like and W-like states with a single qubit noise environment of noise level within 1/4 can approximate to be 100%, and with two other types of noise environment with noise level within 1/4 can be above 90%. Our quantum data generation scheme provides new ideas and prospects for quantum generative models in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>High-efficient long-distance device-independent quantum secret sharing based on single-photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum secret sharing (DI QSS) relaxes security assumptions of experimental devices to provide the highest security level for QSS. Previous DI QSS protocols require to generate multi-partite entangled states and then implement the long-distance entanglement distribution. The extremely low generation probability of current multi-partite entanglement source and photon transmission loss largely limit DI QSS's practical key generation rate and secure photon transmission distance. In the paper, we propose a high-efficient long-distance DI QSS protocol based on practical nearly on-demand single-photon sources (SPSs), which adopts the single photons and heralded architecture to construct long-distance multi-partite entanglement channels. Our SPS DI QSS protocol can automatically eliminate the negative influence from photon transmission loss and largely increase the secure photon transmission distance. Moreover, we adopt active improvement strategies such as random key generation basis, postselection, and advanced postselection to further increase the practical key generation rate and lower the experimental requirement. Comparing with previous DI QSS protocols based on entanglement sources, our SPS DI QSS protocol can increase the practical communication efficiency by six orders of magnitude, and increase the secure photon transmission distance by at least 151 times. This SPS DI QSS protocol is feasible with the current experimental technologies. Our protocol makes it possible to realize high-efficient long-distance DI network in the near future.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Quantum Device Benchmarking via LXEB with Particle-Number-Conserving Random Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear cross-entropy benchmarking (LXEB) with random quantum circuits is a standard method for evaluating quantum computers. However, LXEB requires classically simulating the ideal output distribution of a given quantum circuit with high numerical precision, which becomes infeasible beyond approximately 50 qubits, even on state-of-the-art supercomputers. As a result, LXEB cannot be directly applied to evaluate large-scale quantum devices, which now exceed 100 qubits and continue to grow rapidly in size. To address this limitation, we introduce a constraint known as particle-number conservation into the random quantum circuits used for benchmarking. This restriction significantly reduces the size of the Hilbert space for a fixed particle number, enabling classical simulations of circuits with over 100 qubits when the particle number is $O(1)$. Furthermore, we propose a modified version of LXEB, called MLXEB, which enables fidelity estimation under particle-number-conserving dynamics. Through numerical simulations, we investigate the conditions under which MLXEB provides accurate fidelity estimates.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Parameter Initialization in Quantum Chemical Simulations via LSTM-FC-VQE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a meta-learning framework that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to accelerate parameter initialization in quantum chemical simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). By training the LSTM on optimized parameters from small molecules, the model learns to predict high-quality initializations for larger systems, reducing the number of required VQE iterations. Our enhanced LSTM-FC-VQE architecture introduces a fully connected layer, improving adaptability across molecules with varying parameter sizes. Experimental results show that our approach achieves faster convergence and lower energy errors than traditional initialization, demonstrating its practical potential for efficient quantum simulations in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Security Analysis of Mode-Pairing Quantum Key Distribution with Flexible Pairing Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode-pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) is advantageous for long-distance secure communication, leveraging its simple implementation and quadratic scaling capacity. The post-measurement pairing in MP-QKD alleviates the photon-coincidence demands, which is essential for surpassing the fundamental limit to the key-rate transmission. In this work, we propose an improved decoy-state MP-QKD protocol featuring a flexible and efficient pairing strategy. We prove the security of the proposed scheme by presenting an entanglement model for decoy-state MP-QKD. The simulation results show that the secret key rate (SKR) can be enhanced among all distances. Notably, compared with the original scheme [Nature Communication 13, 3903 (2022)], the improvement of SKR is greater than 65\% within 375 km in the asymptotic case and greater than 50\% within 400 km in the finite case. And the achievable distance can be extended in the finite case, especially with a small block length. The simulation results demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed scheme, which is expected to promote the practical applicability of MP-QKD. Furthermore, the entanglement model could provide a theoretical framework for further security and performance analysis of decoy-state MP-QKD.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lattice Kinetic Scheme for Solving Two-dimensional and Three-dimensional Incompressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is particularly well-suited for implementation on quantum circuits owing to its simple algebraic operations and natural parallelism. However, most quantum LBMs fix $\tau$ = 1 to avoid nonlinear collision, which restricts the simulation to a fixed mesh size for a given Reynolds number. To preserve the simplicity of setting $\tau$ = 1 while enhancing flexibility, we propose a quantum lattice kinetic scheme (LKS) by introducing a constant parameter $A$ into the equilibrium distribution function (EDF), enabling independent adjustment of the fluid's viscosity. This modification removes the constraint on mesh size, making it possible to simulate flows with arbitrary Reynolds numbers. The Chapman-Enskog analysis confirms the modified EDF still recovers the Navier-Stokes equations without compromising collision accuracy. We evaluate the method on 2D and 3D Taylor-Green vortex and lid-driven cavity flows, demonstrating that quantum LKS attains the same accuracy and convergence order as classical LKS. The first application of quantum LBM to 3D incompressible flows represents a significant step forward in large-scale fluid dynamics simulation.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of squeezed states via enhanced bosonic encoding in a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully digital approach for simulating single-mode squeezed states on a superconducting quantum processor using an enhanced bosonic encoding strategy. By mapping up to 2^{n} photonic Fock states onto n qubits, our framework leverages Gray-code-based encodings to reduce gate overhead compared to conventional one-hot or binary mappings. We further optimize resource usage by restricting the simulation on Fock states with even number of photons only, effectively doubling the range of photon numbers that can be represented for a given number of qubits. To overcome noise and finite coherence in current hardware, we employ a variational quantum simulation protocol, which adapts shallow, parameterized circuits through iterative optimization. Implemented on the Zuchongzhi-2 superconducting platform, our method demonstrates squeezed-state dynamics across a parameter sweep from vacuum state preparation (r=0) to squeezing levels exceeding the Fock space truncation limit (r&gt;1.63). Experimental results, corroborated by quantum state tomography and Wigner-function analysis, confirm high-fidelity state preparation and demonstrate the potential of Gray-code-inspired techniques for realizing continuous-variable physics on near-term, qubit-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Beyond real: Alternative unitary cluster Jastrow models for molecular electronic structure calculations on near-term quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-term quantum devices require wavefunction ans\"atze that are expressive while also of shallow circuit depth in order to both accurately and efficiently simulate molecular electronic structure. While unitary coupled cluster (e.g., UCCSD) has become a standard, the high gate count associated with the implementation of this limits its feasibility on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. K-fold unitary cluster Jastrow (uCJ) ans\"atze mitigate this challenge by providing $O(kN^2)$ circuit scaling and favorable linear depth circuit implementation. Previous work has focused on the real orbital-rotation (Re-uCJ) variant of uCJ, which allows an exact (Trotter-free) implementation. Here we extend and generalize the $k$-fold uCJ framework by introducing two new variants, Im-uCJ and g-uCJ, which incorporate imaginary and fully complex orbital rotation operators, respectively. Similar to Re-uCJ, both of the new variants achieve quadratic gate-count scaling. Our results focus on the simplest $k=1$ model, and show that the uCJ models frequently maintain energy errors within chemical accuracy. Both g-uCJ and Im-uCJ are more expressive in terms of capturing electron correlation and are also more accurate than the earlier Re-uCJ ansatz. We further show that Im-uCJ and g-uCJ circuits can also be implemented exactly, without any Trotter decomposition. Numerical tests using $k=1$ on $H_2$, $H_3^+$, $Be_2$, $C_2H_4$, $C_2H_6$ and $C_6H_6$ in various basis sets confirm the practical feasibility of these shallow Jastrow-based ans\"atze for applications on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds for Quantum Learning via R\'enyi Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work advances the theoretical understanding of quantum learning by establishing a new family of upper bounds on the expected generalization error of quantum learning algorithms, leveraging the framework introduced by Caro et al. (2024) and a new definition for the expected true loss. Our primary contribution is the derivation of these bounds in terms of quantum and classical R\'enyi divergences, utilizing a variational approach for evaluating quantum R\'enyi divergences, specifically the Petz and a newly introduced modified sandwich quantum R\'enyi divergence. Analytically and numerically, we demonstrate the superior performance of the bounds derived using the modified sandwich quantum R\'enyi divergence compared to those based on the Petz divergence. Furthermore, we provide probabilistic generalization error bounds using two distinct techniques: one based on the modified sandwich quantum R\'enyi divergence and classical R\'enyi divergence, and another employing smooth max R\'enyi divergence.</description>

      <title>Local consistency and axioms of functional dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local consistency arises in diverse areas, including Bayesian statistics, relational databases, and quantum foundations. Likewise, the notion of functional dependence arises in all of these areas. We adopt a general approach to study logical inference in a setting that enables both global inconsistency and local consistency. Our approach builds upon pairwise consistent families of K-relations, i.e, relations with tuples annotated with elements of some positive commutative monoid. The framework covers, e.g., families of probability distributions arising from quantum experiments and their possibilistic counterparts. As a first step, we investigate the entailment problem for functional dependencies (FDs) in this setting. Notably, the transitivity rule for FDs is no longer sound, but can be replaced by two novel axiom schemes. We provide a complete axiomatisation and a PTIME algorithm for the entailment problem of unary FDs. In addition, we explore when contextual families over the Booleans have realisations as contextual families over various monoids.</description>

      <title>Walsh-Floquet Theory of Periodic Kick Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic kick drives are ubiquitous in digital quantum control, computation, and simulation, and are instrumental in studies of chaos and thermalization for their efficient representation through discrete gates. However, in the commonly used Fourier basis, kick drives lead to poor convergence of physical quantities. Instead, here we use the Walsh basis of periodic square-wave functions to describe the physics of periodic kick drives. In the strongly kicked regime, we find that it recovers Floquet dynamics of single- and many-body systems more accurately than the Fourier basis, due to the shape of the system's response in time. To understand this behavior, we derive an extended Sambe space formulation and an inverse-frequency expansion in the Walsh basis. We explain the enhanced performance within the framework of single-particle localization on the frequency lattice, where localization is correlated with small truncation errors. We show that strong hybridization between states of the kicked system and Walsh modes gives rise to Walsh polaritons that can be studied on digital quantum simulators. Our work lays the foundations of Walsh-Floquet theory, which is naturally implementable on digital quantum devices and suited to Floquet state manipulation using discrete gates.</description>

      <title>Analytical Fidelity Calculations for Photonic Linear Cluster State Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By precisely timed optical excitation of their spin, optical emitters such as semiconductor quantum dots or atoms can be harnessed as sources of linear photonic cluster states. This significantly reduces the required resource overhead to reach fault-tolerant optical quantum computing. Here, we develop an algorithm that analytically tracks the global density matrix through the process of the protocol for generating linear-cluster states by Lindner and Rudolph. From this we derive a model to calculate the entangling gate fidelity and the state fidelity of the generated linear optical cluster states. Our model factors in various sources of error, such as spin decoherence and the finite excited state lifetime. Additionally, we highlight the presence of partial reinitialization of spin coherence with each photon emission, eliminating the hard limitation of coherence time. Our framework provides valuable insight into the cost-to-improvement trade-offs for device design parameters as well as the identification of optimal working points. For a combined state-of-the-art quantum dot with a spin coherence time of T_2^*=535 ns and an excited state lifetime of {\tau}=23 ps, we show that a near-unity entangling gate fidelity as well as near-unity state fidelity for 3-photon and 7-photon linear cluster states can be reached.</description>

      <title>Sonification of entanglement dynamics in many-qubit systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics poses significant challenges for audio-visual representation, particularly concerning quantum entanglement. Sonification -- the auditory representation of data -- offers a promising complementary approach. This paper investigates sonification techniques applied to dynamical entanglement generation in many-qubit systems with the help of phase space methods and entanglement measure. We study dynamics of entanglement generation in many-qubit system in dynamical protocol governed by two models: the one-axis twisting model, and a quantum kicked-rotor exhibiting both regular and quantum chaotic behavior. We present a procedure of entanglement dynamics sonification, allowing mapping the phase-space representation of a many-qubit quantum state and von Neuman entanglement entropy to sound. Results demonstrate how sonification enhances perception of dynamic entanglement offering intuitive and artistic insight into quantum correlations behaviors.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Framework for Teleportation in Quantum Core Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-core quantum computing architectures offer a promising and scalable solution to the challenges of integrating large number of qubits into existing monolithic chip design. However, the issue of transferring quantum information across the cores remains unresolved. Quantum Teleportation offers a potential approach for efficient qubit transfer, but existing methods primarily rely on centralized interconnection mechanisms for teleportation, which may limit scalability and parallel communication. We proposes a decentralized framework for teleportation in multi-core quantum computing systems, aiming to address these limitations. We introduce two variants of teleportation within the decentralized framework and evaluate their impact on reducing end-to-end communication delay and quantum circuit depth. Our findings demonstrate that the optimized teleportation strategy, termed two-way teleportation, results in a substantial 40% reduction in end-to-end communication latency for synthetic benchmarks and a 30% reduction for real benchmark applications, and 24% decrease in circuit depth compared to the baseline teleportation strategy. These results highlight the significant potential of decentralized teleportation to improve the performance of large-scale quantum systems, offering a scalable and efficient solution for future quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing with atomic qubit arrays: confronting the cost of connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes present a review of the status of quantum computing with arrays of neutral atom qubits, an approach which has demonstrated remarkable progress in the last few years. Scaling digital quantum computing to qubit counts and control fidelities that will enable solving outstanding scientific questions, and provide commercial value, is an outstanding challenge, not least because of the requirement of connecting and entangling distant qubits. Long-range Rydberg gates and physical motion outfit atomic qubit arrays with tools for establishing connectivity. These tools operate on different timescales and with distinct levels of parallelization. We analyze several prototypical architectures from the perspective of achieving fast connectivity for circuits with large scale entanglement, as well as fast cycle times for measurement based quantum error correcting codes. Extending Rydberg interactions to multiple atomic species has emerged as a promising route to achieving this latter requirement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have led to an exponential increase in computational demands, driving the need for innovative computing platforms. Quantum computing, with its Hilbert space scaling exponentially with the number of particles, emerges as a promising solution. In this work, we implement a quantum extreme machine learning (QELM) protocol leveraging indistinguishable photon pairs and multimode fiber as a random densly connected layer. We experimentally study QELM performance based on photon coincidences -- for distinguishable and indistinguishable photons -- on an image classification task. Simulations further show that increasing the number of photons reveals a clear quantum advantage. We relate this improved performance to the enhanced dimensionality and expressivity of the feature space, as indicated by the increased rank of the feature matrix in both experiment and simulation.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-vacancy centre in lonsdaleite: a novel nanoscale sensor?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal diamond, often called lonsdaleite, is an exotic allotrope of carbon, predicted to be harder than cubic (conventional) diamond with a wider bandgap. Due to its pure sp$^3$ bonded lattice, it should be expected to host sub-bandgap defect centres (colour centres). Here we perform \textit{ab initio} modeling of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) colour centres in hexagonal diamond nanocrystals; for both the neutral and negatively charged species (NV$^0$ and NV$^-$). We identify three distinct configurations for the NV center: two of which are analogous to NV in diamond, and one which is a configuration that can only exist in the hexagonal form. The diamond-like NV systems comprise three symmetry equivalent centers which reside on the same carbon plane, and one defect that is split across two planes and replaces a carbon-carbon bond. There is an additional NV centre where the N and V each have four nearest neighbour carbon atoms. The presence of this latter configuration would provide an unambiguous determination of the hexagonal nature of lonsdaleite. Quantum chemical analysis show all derivatives to be thermochemically stable, and each with their own unique photophysical properties, spectral profiles, and magneto-optical characteristics. By assuming that the ground state properties of the NV$^-$ in hexagonal diamond are comparable to those of NV$^-$ in cubic diamond, albeit with increased strain, we predict ground state fine structure splitting for two of the centres of 2.74~GHz and 4.56~MHz, compared with 2.87~GHz for cubic diamond. The possibility of optically detected magnetic resonance with NV$^-$ in lonsdaleite would provide a new carbon-based quantum sensing system, and an unambiguous method to resolve outstanding issues around the structure of lonsdaleite as hexagonal diamond.</description>

      <title>Quantum compressed sensing tomographic reconstruction algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a non-destructive technique for observing internal images and has proven highly valuable in medical diagnostics. Recent advances in quantum computing have begun to influence tomographic reconstruction techniques. The quantum tomographic reconstruction algorithm is less affected by artifacts or noise than classical algorithms by using the square function of the difference between pixels obtained by projecting CT images in quantum superposition states and pixels obtained from experimental data. In particular, by using quantum linear systems, a fast quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model formulation for quantum tomographic reconstruction is possible. In this paper, we formulate the QUBO model for quantum compressed sensing tomographic reconstruction, which is a linear combination of the QUBO model for quantum tomographic reconstruction and the QUBO model for total variation in quantum superposition-state CT images. In our experiments, we used sinograms obtained by using the Radon transform of Shepp-Logan images and body CT images. We evaluate the performance of the new algorithm by reconstructing CT images using a hybrid solver with the QUBO model computed from each sinogram. The new algorithm was able to obtain a solution within 5 projection images for 30 by 30 image samples and within 6 projection images for 60 by 60 image samples, reconstructing error-free CT images. We anticipate that quantum compressed sensing tomographic reconstruction algorithms could significantly reduce the total radiation dose when quantum computing performance advances.</description>

Abstract: Quantum correlations of 3-beam symmetric Gaussian states are analyzed using their quantum universal invariants. These invariants, 1-, 2-, and 3-beam purities, are expressed in terms of the beams' intensity moments up to sixth order. The 3-beam symmetric Gaussian states with varying amounts of the noise are experimentally generated using entangled photon pairs from down-conversion, their invariants are determined, and their quantum correlations are quantified. The coexistence of bi- and tripartite entanglement and genuine tripartite entanglement are observed in these states that resemble the noisy GHZ/W states.</description>

      <title>Distance-based measures and Epsilon-measures for measurement-based quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a structured and elegant framework for quantifying quantum resources. While state-based resource theories have been extensively studied, their measurement-based resource theories remain relatively underexplored. In practical scenarios where a quantum state or a set of measurements is only partially known, conventional resource measures often fall short in capturing the resource content. In such cases, \epsilon-measures offer a robust alternative, making them particularly valuable. In this work, we investigate the quantification of measurement-based resources using distance-based measures, followed by a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of \epsilon-measures. We also extend our analysis by exploring the connections between \epsilon-measures and some key quantities relevant to resource manipulation tasks. Importantly, the analysis of resources based on sets of measurements are tedious compared to that of single measurements as the former allows more general transformations such as controlled implementation. Yet our framework applies not only to resources associated with individual measurements but also to those arising from sets of measurements. In short, our analysis is applicable to existing resource theories of measurements and is expected to be useful for all resource theories of measurements that are yet to be developed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a minimax approach for characterizing the capacities of fully quantum arbitrarily varying channels (FQAVCs) under different shared resource models. In contrast to previous methods, our technique avoids de Finetti-type reductions, allowing us to treat quantum jammers with infinite-dimensional systems. Consequently, we show that the entanglement-assisted and shared-randomness-assisted capacities of FQAVCs match those of the corresponding compound channels, even in the presence of general quantum adversaries.</description>

Abstract: We show that any $N$-dimensional unitary matrix can be realized using a finite sequence of concatenated identical multiport beamsplitters. Our construction is based on a Lie group theorem and is explicitly demonstrated for the two- and three-dimensional cases. We further establish that the widely used Clements decomposition naturally arises as a special case of this general framework. As an application, we present a reconfigurable linear optical circuit that implements a three-dimensional unitary emerging in the unambiguous discrimination of two nonorthogonal qubit states.</description>

      <title>TensorMixedStates: a Julia library for simulating pure and mixed quantum states using matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce TensorMixedStates, a Julia library built on top of ITensor which allows the simulation of quantum systems in presence of dissipation using matrix product states (MPS). It offers three key features: i) it implements the MPS representation for mixed states along with associated operations, in particular the time evolution according to a Lindblad equation or discrete time evolution using non-unitary gates (quantum channels), ii) it is based on ITensor, which has proven its effectiveness and which gives access to efficient low-level tensor manipulation as well state-of-the-art algorithms (like DMRG, TDVP, quantum numbers conservation and automated parallelization), finally iii) it presents a user-friendly interface allowing writing sophisticated simulations for pure and mixed quantum states in a few lines of code.</description>

      <title>Path superposition as resource for perfect quantum teleportation with separable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation is a quintessential quantum communication protocol that enables the transmission of an arbitrary quantum state between two distant parties without physically transmitting the state with the help of shared entanglement and limited classical communication. We show that it is possible to relax the entanglement requirement in quantum teleportation if we have access to a certain strain of superposition of quantum processes. Two types of superposition of quantum processes are generally considered in the literature: superposition of paths identified with quantum maps and superposition of indefinite causal orders of the maps. We find that when superposition of paths is incorporated in the protocol, perfect quantum teleportation becomes possible with nonzero probability, even when the two parties share certain classes of separable states, including pure product states. In contrast, the assistance of superposition of indefinite causal order of quantum maps in teleportation protocol does not enable any quantum advantage for shared pure product states. Furthermore, we show that separable Werner states can also yield quantum advantage in quantum teleportation assisted by the superposition of paths. Finally, we establish that the presence of quantum coherence in the control qubit is both necessary and sufficient to achieve quantum advantage in quantum teleportation assisted with superposition of paths. Our results highlight that while entanglement is a fundamental resource in standard quantum teleportation, superposition of paths can serve as an alternate resource for the same.</description>

      <title>Solving Large-Scale QUBO with Transferred Parameters from Multilevel QAOA of low depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising quantum approach for tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, hardware constraints such as limited scaling and susceptibility to noise pose significant challenges when applying QAOA to large instances. To overcome these limitations, scalable hybrid multilevel strategies have been proposed. In this work, we propose a fast hybrid multilevel algorithm with QAOA parameterization throughout the multilevel hierarchy and its reinforcement with genetic algorithms, which results in a high-quality, low-depth QAOA solver. Notably, we propose parameter transfer from the coarsest level to the finer level, showing that the relaxation-based coarsening preserves the problem structural information needed for QAOA parametrization. Our strategy improves the coarsening phase and leverages both Quantum Relax \&amp; Round and genetic algorithms to incorporate $p=1$ QAOA samples effectively. The results highlight the practical potential of multilevel QAOA as a scalable method for combinatorial optimization on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive exploration of interaction networks reveals a connection between entanglement and network structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems are typically studied assuming translational symmetry in the interaction network. Recent experimental advances in various platforms for quantum simulators have enabled the realization of irregular interaction networks, which are intractable to implement with conventional crystal lattices. Another hallmark of these advances is the ability to observe the time-dependent behaviour of quantum many-body systems. However, the relationship between irregular interaction networks and quantum many-body dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the connection between the structure of the interaction network and the eigenstate entanglement of the quantum Ising model by exploring all possible interaction networks up to seven spins. We find that the eigenstate entanglement depends on the structure of the Hilbert space diagram, particularly the structure of the equienergy subgraph. We further reveal a correlation linking the structure of the Hilbert space diagram to the number of unconstrained spin pairs. Our results demonstrate that the minimum eigenstate entanglement of the quantum Ising model is governed by the specific structure of the interaction network. We anticipate that our findings provide a starting point for exploring quantum many-body systems with arbitrary interactions and finite system size. Moreover, our approach may be applicable to other quantum many-body systems, such as the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Unbiased observable estimation via noisy channel mixtures for fault-tolerant quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary errors, such as those arising from fault-tolerant compilation of quantum algorithms, systematically bias observable estimates. Correcting this bias typically requires additional resources, such as an increased number of non-Clifford gates. In this work, we present an alternative method for correcting bias in the expectation values of observables. The method leverages a decomposition of the ideal quantum channel into a probabilistic mixture of noisy quantum channels. Using this decomposition, we construct unbiased estimators as weighted sums of expectation values obtained from the noisy channels. We provide a detailed analysis of the method, identify the conditions under which it is effective, and validate its performance through numerical simulations. In particular, we demonstrate unbiased observable estimation in the presence of unitary errors by simulating the time dynamics of the Ising Hamiltonian. Our strategy offers a resource-efficient way to reduce the impact of unitary errors, improving methods for estimating observables in noisy near-term quantum devices and fault-tolerant implementation of quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper a relation between entangled states and geometry is studied. In particular, the area of 2D parallelogram is obtained from an entangled 4-qubit state. In addition, the vector area of a 3D parallelogram is derived from entangled 6-qubit states. Moreover, the volume of a 3D parallelepiped is deduced from an entangled 9-qubit state. Furthermore, it has been provided the quantum circuit in qiskit code for these entangled states. It is worth mentioning that parallelograms and parallelepipeds serve as fundamental building blocks for more sophisticated geometric structures.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable dissipative dynamics and one-form strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking in interacting two-dimensional spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of a class of interacting "gamma-matrix" spin models coupled to a Markovian environment. For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. We however identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Reactant Entanglement in the Coherent Control of Ultracold Bimolecular Chemical Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is a crucial resource for achieving quantum advantages in quantum computation, quantum sensing, and quantum communication. As shown in this Letter, entanglement is also a valuable resource for the coherent control of the large class of bimolecular chemical reactions. We introduce an entanglement-enhanced coherent control scheme, in which the initial preparation of the superposition state is divided into two steps: the first entangles the reactants, and the second is responsible for coherent control. This approach can overcome the limitations of traditional coherent control of scattering caused by non-interfering pathways, known as satellite terms. By tuning the amount of entanglement between reactants, the visibility of coherent control in chemical reactions can be modulated and optimized. Significantly, there exists an optimal amount of entanglement, which ensures complete indistinguishability of the reaction pathways, maximizing the extent of control. This entanglement-enhanced coherent control scheme is computationally illustrated using the ultracold KRb + KRb reaction, where a perfect control over the parity of the product rotational states is achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and assembly of a cavity microscope for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms. The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of $19.786$mm, a finesse of $2.35\times 10^4$ and operates $214\mu\text{m}$ away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</description>

      <title>Exact multiple anomalous mobility edges in a flat band geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous mobility edges(AMEs), separating localized from {multifractal critical states}, represent a novel form of localization transition in quasiperiodic systems. However, quasi-periodic models exhibiting exact {AMEs} remain relatively rare, limiting the understanding of these transitions. In this work, we leverage the geometric structure of flat band models to construct exact {AMEs}. Specifically, we introduce an anti-symmetric diagonal quasi-periodic mosaic modulation, which consists of both quasi-periodic and constant potentials, into a cross-stitch flat band lattice. When the constant potential is zero, the system resides entirely in a localized phase, with its dispersion relation precisely determined. For non-zero constant potentials, we use a simple method to derive analytical solutions for a class of {AMEs}, providing exact results for both the {AMEs} and the system's localization and critical properties. Additionally, we propose a classical electrical circuit design to experimentally realize the system. This study offers valuable insights into the existence and characteristics of {AMEs} in quasi-periodic systems.</description>

Abstract: Embedding semiconductor quantum dots into bullseye resonators has significantly advanced the development of bright telecom quantum light sources for fiber-based quantum networks. To further improve the device flexibility and stability, the bullseye approach should be combined with a pin diode structure to enable Stark tuning, deterministic charging, and enhanced coherence. In this work, we fabricate and characterize photonic structures incorporating hole gratings that efficiently support charge carrier transport while maintaining excellent optical performance. We report bright, Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission in the telecom C-band under above-band and phonon-assisted excitation. Additionally, we present electrically contacted resonators, demonstrating wide range tuneability of quantum dot transitions in the telecom O-band. These results mark significant steps toward scalable and tunable quantum light sources for real-world quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Emergent Thermalization Thresholds in Unitary Dynamics of Inhomogeneously Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the avalanche scenario for many-body localization (MBL) instability, we reverse the conventional set-up and ask whether a large weakly-disordered chain can thermalize a smaller, strongly-disordered chain when the composite system evolves unitarily. Using transport as a dynamical probe, we identify three distinct thermalization regimes as a function of the disorder strength of the smaller chain: (i) complete thermalization with self-averaging at weak disorder, (ii) realization-dependent thermalization with strong sample-to-sample fluctuations at intermediate disorder, and (iii) absence of thermalization at strong disorder. We find that the non-self-averaging regime broadens with the size of the weakly-disordered chain, revealing a nuanced interplay between disorder and system size. These results highlight how inhomogeneous disorder can induce emergent thermalization thresholds in closed quantum systems, providing direct access to disorder regimes where thermalization or its absence can be reliably observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a time-domain generalization of the extended Koopmans' theorem within the framework of the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) theory. This formulation naturally yields well-defined time-dependent hole states formed by removing one electron from the multielectron system, enabling the instantaneous construction of reduced density matrices for the photofragments during MCTDHF simulations with negligible computational overhead. Leveraging this foundation, we derive the equation of motion for the time-dependent Dyson orbitals and develop a systematic approach to extract hole-resolved observables directly from the time-dependent \textit{ab initio} wavefunctions, such as channel-resolved photoelectron momentum distributions. The proposed method is universally applicable to both projection-based and flux-based schemes, offering a powerful tool for disentangling correlated electron-hole dynamics in ultrafast multichannel ionization processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By simulating the real-time multielectron wavefunction with the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) approach, we conduct an \textit{ab initio} study of the single-photon ionization process of a body-fixed water molecule ($\mathrm{H_2O}$) driven by attosecond pulses. To this end, we present a full-dimensional implementation of the MCTDHF method based on one-center expansions, allowing for the simulation of arbitrarily polarized lasers and multi-center polyatomic potentials. With a rigorous definition of the time-dependent hole state (TDHS) using the time-domain generalization of extended Koopmans' theorem (TD-EKT), we derive the reduced ion density matrix within the MCTDHF framework, which inherently encodes the total and channel-resolved photoionization cross sections of $\mathrm{H_2O}$. The cross sections obtained are benchmarked against existing experimental and theoretical results, validating the TDHS formalism. Furthermore, by adjusting the phase delay and intensity ratio of a pair of orthogonally polarized attosecond pulses, we explore the ultrafast control of attosecond coherence between electronic states of $\mathrm{H_2O^+}$.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Structure in Gravitational Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational radiation from known astrophysical sources is conventionally treated classically. This treatment corresponds, implicitly, to the hypothesis that a particular class of quantum-mechanical states -- the so-called coherent states -- adequately describe the gravitational radiation field. We propose practicable, quantitative tests of that hypothesis using resonant bar detectors monitored in coincidence with LIGO-style interferometers. Our tests readily distinguish fields that contain significant thermal components or squeezing. We identify concrete circumstances in which the classical (i.e., coherent state) hypothesis is likely to fail. Such failures are of fundamental interest, in that addressing them requires us to treat the gravitational field quantum-mechanically, and they open a new window into the dynamics of gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of lattice models which possess subsystem non-invertible symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order and analyze their interface modes protected by the symmetry, whose codimension turns out to be more than one. We also propose 2+1d lattice models which belong to two different weak SPT phases distinguished by a combination of translational symmetry and non-invertible symmetry. We show that the interface between them exhibits an exotic Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly coming from the symmetry which cannot be written as a direct product of an internal symmetry and the lattice translational symmetry.</description>

      <title>The fate of the Fermi surface coupled to a single-wave-vector cavity mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic field of standing-wave or ring cavities induces a spatially modulated, infinite-range interaction between atoms in an ultracold Fermi gas, with a single wavelength comparable to the Fermi length. This interaction has no analog in other systems of itinerant particles and has so far been studied only in the regime where it is attractive at zero distance. Here, we fully solve the problem of competing instabilities of the Fermi surface induced by single-wavelength interactions. We find that while the density-wave (superradiant) instability dominates on the attractive side, it is absent for repulsive interactions, where the competition is instead won by non-superradiant superfluid phases at low temperatures, with Fermion pairs forming at both vanishing and finite center-of-mass momentum. Moreover, even in the absence of such symmetry-breaking instabilities, we find the Fermi surface to be always nontrivially deformed from an isotropic shape. We estimate this full phenomenology to be within reach of dedicated state-of-the-art experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable many-body dynamics from space-time duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advances, both theoretical and experimental, in our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics. Given this problem's high complexity, it is surprising that a substantial amount of this progress can be ascribed to exact analytical results. Here we review dual-unitary circuits as a particular setting leading to exact results in quantum many-body dynamics. Dual-unitary circuits constitute minimal models in which space and time are treated on an equal footings, yielding exactly solvable yet possibly chaotic evolution. They were the first in which current notions of quantum chaos could be analytically quantified, allow for a full characterisation of the dynamics of thermalisation, scrambling, and entanglement (among others), and can be experimentally realised in current quantum simulators. Dual-unitarity is a specific fruitful implementation of the more general idea of space-time duality in which the roles of space and time are exchanged to access relevant dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Finding the Optimal Variable Ordering for Binary Decision Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.12658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) is a directed acyclic graph that represents a Boolean function. OBDDs are also known as special cases of oblivious read-once branching programs in the field of complexity theory. Since OBDDs have many nice properties as data structures, they have been extensively studied for decades in both theoretical and practical fields, such as VLSI design, formal verification, machine learning, and combinatorial problems. Arguably, the most crucial problem in using OBDDs is that they may vary exponentially in size depending on their variable ordering (i.e., the order in which the variable are to read) when they represent the same function. Indeed, it is NP hard to find an optimal variable ordering that minimizes an OBDD for a given function. Hence, numerous studies have sought heuristics to find an optimal variable ordering. From practical as well as theoretical points of view, it is also important to seek algorithms that output optimal solutions with lower (exponential) time complexity than trivial brute-force algorithms do. Friedman and Supowit provided a clever deterministic algorithm with time/space complexity $O^\ast(3^n)$, where $n$ is the number of variables of the function, which is much better than the trivial brute-force bound $O^\ast(n!2^n)$. This paper shows that a further speedup is possible with quantum computers by demonstrating the existence of a quantum algorithm that produces a minimum OBDD together with the corresponding variable ordering in $O^\ast(2.77286^n)$ time and space with an exponentially small error. Moreover, this algorithm can be adapted to constructing other minimum decision diagrams such as zero-suppressed BDDs, which provide compact representations of sparse sets and are often used in the field of discrete optimization and enumeration.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on Learning Pauli Channels with Individual Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the noise affecting a quantum device is of fundamental importance for scaling quantum technologies. A particularly important class of noise models is that of Pauli channels, as randomized compiling techniques can effectively bring any quantum channel to this form and are significantly more structured than general quantum channels. In this paper, we show fundamental lower bounds on the sample complexity for learning Pauli channels in diamond norm. We consider strategies that may not use auxiliary systems entangled with the input to the unknown channel and have to perform a measurement before reusing the channel. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{3n}\varepsilon^{-2})$ to learn an $n$-qubit Pauli channel. In particular, this shows that the recently introduced learning procedure by Flammia and Wallman is essentially optimal. In the adaptive setting, we show a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{2.5n}\varepsilon^{-2})$ for $\varepsilon=\mathcal{O}(2^{-n})$, and a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{2n}\varepsilon^{-2} )$ for any $\varepsilon&gt; 0$. This last lower bound holds even in a stronger model where in each step, before performing the measurement, the unknown channel may be used arbitrarily many times sequentially interspersed with unital operations.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Compression of Free Fermionic Quantum Circuits: Particle Creation, Arbitrary Lattices and Controlled Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently we developed a local and constructive algorithm based on Lie algebraic methods for compressing Trotterized evolution under Hamiltonians that can be mapped to free fermions. The compression algorithm yields a circuit which scales linearly in the number of qubits, has a depth independent of evolution time and compresses time-dependent Hamiltonians. The algorithm is limited to simple nearest-neighbor spin interactions and fermionic hopping. In this work, we extend our methods to compress evolution with long-range fermionic hopping, thereby enabling the embedding of arbitrary lattices onto a chain of qubits for fermion models. Moreover, we show that controlled time evolution, as well as fermion creation and annihilation operators can also be compressed. We demonstrate our results by adiabatically preparing the ground state for a half-filled fermionic chain, simulating a $4 \times 4$ tight binding model on ibmq washington, and calculating the topological Zak phase on a Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer. With these new developments, our results enable the simulation of a wider range of models of interest and the efficient compression of subcircuits.</description>

      <title>The measurement postulates of quantum mechanics are not redundant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masanes, Galley and M\"uller [1] argue that the measurement postulates of non-relativistic quantum mechanics follow from the structural postulates together with an assumption they call the "possibility of state estimation". Their argument also relies on what they term a "theory-independent characterization of measurements for single and multipartite systems". We refute their conclusion, giving explicit examples of non-quantum measurement and state update rules that satisfy all their assumptions. We also show that their "possibility of state estimation" assumption is neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure a sensible notion of state estimation within a theory whose states are described by the quantum formalism. We further show their purportedly "theory-independent" characterization assumes several properties of quantum measurements that exclude plausible alternative types of measurement. We illustrate all these points with specific alternative measurement postulates and post-measurement state update rules. We conclude that, contrary to some folklore, quantum mechanics is by no means an island in theory-space. It can consistently be extended by rules for obtaining information about quantum states other than via POVMs. Whether such rules are realised in nature, for example in linking quantum theory and gravity, is an empirical question that cannot be resolved by theoretical analysis alone.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Algorithm for Unitary Gate Design with Time-Independent Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Larger multi-qubit quantum gates allow shallower, more efficient quantum circuits, which could decrease the prohibitive effect of noise on algorithms for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and fault-tolerant error correction schemes. Such multi-qubit gates can potentially be generated by time-independent Hamiltonians comprising only physical (one- and two-local) interaction terms. Here, we present an algorithm that finds the time-independent Hamiltonian for a target quantum gate on $n$ qubits by using the geodesic on the Riemannian manifold of $\mathrm{SU}(2^n)$. Differential programming is used to determine how the Hamiltonian should be updated in order to follow the geodesic to the target unitary as closely as possible. We show that our geodesic algorithm outperforms gradient descent methods for standard multi-qubit gates such as Toffoli and Fredkin. The geodesic algorithm is then used to find previously unavailable multi-qubit gates implementing high fidelity parity checks, which could be used in a wide array of quantum codes and increase the clock speed of fault-tolerant quantum computers. The geodesic algorithm is demonstrated on an example relevant to current experimental hardware, illustrating a circuit speed up.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14971v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a concept of non-coherent evolution of macroscopic quantum systems. We show that for weakly interacting systems, such evolution is a Markovian stochastic process. The transition rates between system states, which characterize the process, are determined by Fermi's golden rule. Such evolution is time-irreversible and leads to the equidistribution of probabilities across every state of the system. Furthermore, we investigate the time dependence of the mean numbers of particles in single-particle states and find that, under the given assumptions, it is governed by the Boltzmann collision integral. In this theory, non-coherence is the mechanism that transforms time-reversible unitary evolution into time-irreversible stochastic evolution. Thus, we present a possible solution to the famous arrow-of-time problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group-V materials such as niobium and tantalum have become popular choices for extending the performance of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms allowing for quantum processors and memories with reduced error rates and more modes. The complex surface chemistry of niobium however makes identifying the main modes of decoherence difficult at millikelvin temperatures and single-photon powers. We use niobium coaxial quarter-wave cavities to study the impact of etch chemistry, prolonged atmospheric exposure, and the significance of cavity conditions prior to and during cooldown, in particular niobium hydride evolution, on single-photon coherence. We demonstrate cavities with quality factors of Q_int&gt;1.4X10^9 in the single-photon regime, a 15 fold improvement over aluminum cavities of the same geometry. We rigorously quantify the sensitivity of our fabrication process to various loss mechanisms and demonstrate a 2-4X reduction in the two-level system (TLS) loss tangent and a 3-5X improvement in the residual resistance over traditional BCP etching techniques. Finally, we demonstrate transmon integration and coherent cavity control while maintaining a cavity coherence of 11.3ms. The accessibility of our method, which can easily be replicated in academic-lab settings, and the demonstration of its performance mark an advancement in 3D cQED.</description>

      <title>Noisy atomic magnetometry with Kalman filtering and measurement-based feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing a magnetic field with an atomic magnetometer operated in real time presents significant challenges, primarily due to sensor non-linearity, the presence of noise, and the need for one-shot estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive approach that integrates measurement, estimation and control strategies. Specifically, this involves implementing a quantum non-demolition measurement based on continuous light-probing of the atomic ensemble. The resulting photocurrent is then directed into an Extended Kalman Filter to produce instantaneous estimates of the system's dynamical parameters. These estimates, in turn, are utilised by a Linear Quadratic Regulator, whose output is applied back to the system through a feedback loop. This procedure automatically steers the atomic ensemble into a spin-squeezed state, yielding a quantum enhancement in precision. Furthermore, thanks to the feedback proposed, the atoms exhibit entanglement even when the measurement data is discarded. To prove that our approach constitutes the optimal strategy in realistic scenarios, we derive ultimate bounds on the estimation error applicable in the presence of both local and collective decoherence, and show that these are indeed attained. Additionally, we demonstrate that for large ensembles the EKF not only reliably predicts its own estimation error in real time, but also accurately estimates spin-squeezing at short timescales.</description>

Abstract: A class of quantum resource theories, based on non-convex star-shape sets, presented in this work captures the key quantum properties that cannot be studied by standard convex theories. We provide operational interpretations for a resource of this class and demonstrate its advantage to improve performance of correlated quantum discrimination tasks and testing of quantum combs. Proposed techniques provide useful tools to describe quantum discord, total correlations in composite quantum systems and to estimate the degree of non-Markovianity of an analyzed quantum dynamics. Other applications include the problem of unistochasticity of a given bistochastic matrix, with relevance for quantization of classical dynamics and studies of violation of CP-symmetry in high energy physics. In all these cases, the non-linear witnesses introduced here outperform the standard linear witnesses. Importance of our findings for quantum information theory is also emphasized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise is one of the main obstacles to realizing quantum devices that achieve a quantum computational advantage. A possible approach to minimize the noise effect is to employ shallow-depth quantum circuits since noise typically accumulates as circuit depth grows. In this work, we investigate the complexity of shallow-depth linear-optical circuits under the effects of photon loss and partial distinguishability. By establishing a correspondence between a linear-optical circuit and a bipartite graph, we show that the effects of photon loss and partial distinguishability are equivalent to removing the corresponding vertices. Using this correspondence and percolation theory, we prove that for constant-depth linear-optical circuits with single photons, there is a threshold of loss (noise) rate above which the linear-optical systems can be decomposed into smaller systems with high probability, which enables us to simulate the systems efficiently. Consequently, our result implies that even in shallow-depth circuits where noise is not accumulated enough, its effect may be sufficiently significant to make them efficiently simulable using classical algorithms due to its entanglement structure constituted by shallow-depth circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the fast-paced field of quantum computing, identifying the architectural characteristics that will enable quantum processors to achieve high performance across a diverse range of quantum algorithms continues to pose a significant challenge. Given the extensive and costly nature of experimentally testing different designs, this paper introduces the first Design Space Exploration (DSE) for quantum-dot spin-qubit architectures. Utilizing the upgraded SpinQ compilation framework, this study explores a substantial design space comprising 29,312 spin-qubit-based architectures and applies an innovative optimization tool, ArtA (Artificial Architect), to speed up the design space traversal. ArtA can leverage 17 optimization configurations, significantly reducing exploration times by up to 99.1% compared to a traditional brute-force approach while maintaining the same result quality. After a comprehensive evaluation of best-matching optimization configurations per quantum circuit, ArtA suggests specific as well as universal architectural features that provide optimal performance across the examined circuits. Our work demonstrates that combining DSE methodologies with optimization algorithms can be effectively used to generate meaningful design insights for quantum processor development.</description>

      <title>Automated Synthesis of Fault-Tolerant State Preparation Circuits for Quantum Error Correction Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central ingredient in fault-tolerant quantum algorithms is the initialization of a logical state for a given quantum error-correcting code from a set of noisy qubits. A scheme that has demonstrated promising results for small code instances that are realizable on currently available hardware composes a non-fault-tolerant state preparation step with a verification step that checks for spreading errors. Known circuit constructions of this scheme are mostly obtained manually, and no algorithmic techniques for constructing depth- or gate-optimal circuits exist. As a consequence, the current state of the art exploits this scheme only for specific code instances and mostly for the special case of distance 3 codes. In this work, we propose an automated approach for synthesizing fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for arbitrary CSS codes. We utilize methods based on satisfiability solving (SAT) techniques to construct fault-tolerant state preparation circuits consisting of depth- and gate-optimal preparation and verification circuits. We also provide heuristics that can synthesize fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for code instances where no optimal solution can be obtained in an adequate timeframe. Moreover, we give a general construction for non-deterministic state preparation circuits beyond distance 3. Numerical evaluations using $d=3$ and $d=5$ codes confirm that the generated circuits exhibit the desired scaling of the logical error rates. The resulting methods are publicly available as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc. Such methods are an important step in providing fault-tolerant circuit constructions that can aid in near-term demonstration of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Simulation of 1D Long-Range Interacting Systems at Any Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method that ensures efficient computation of one-dimensional quantum systems with long-range interactions across all temperatures. Our algorithm operates within a quasi-polynomial runtime for inverse temperatures up to $\beta={\rm poly}(\ln(n))$. At the core of our approach is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm, which typically does not guarantee efficiency. We have created a new truncation scheme for the matrix product operator of the quantum Gibbs states, which allows us to control the error analytically. Additionally, our method can be applied to simulate the time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, achieving significantly better precision than that offered by the Lieb-Robinson bound.</description>

      <title>General recipe for immediate entanglement death-birth transitions via Bell states: environmental Heisenberg exchange as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environment is known to play a dual role in both extinguishing and establishing entanglement, leading to entanglement sudden death (ESD) and entanglement sudden birth (ESB). In this paper, we propose a recipe for the initial states of two qubits to undergo ESD, ESB, or transition of finite duration (TFD) between them. While this recipe is \emph{generally independent of the interaction}, a spin-star model with environmental Heisenberg exchange is chosen for illustration. Utilizing the Bell states, we introduce the entanglement switch parameter (ESP), whose sign indicates whether the qubit bipartite entanglement is switched on or off. The classical (quantum) weighting of the Bell states encodes the ESP for initial mixed (pure) states. When more than two Bell states are adopted, the ESP permits states to penetrate through the entanglement-unentanglement boundary. In this case, the penetrability of a small ESP ensures the immediate occurrence of ESD or ESB and indicates the TFD if the local time-even symmetry in the entanglement monotone is also satisfied. When no more than two Bell states are employed, the penetrability is lost, and TFD is only identified in some mixed states but not in pure states; here for pure states, the environmental quantum degrees of freedom are associated with the number of Bell states. Thanks to the simplicity of this model, analytic results are provided. We also analyze the symmetries that can convert or alter ESD into ESB, and vice versa. The recipe enhances the controllability of entanglement dynamics and facilitates entanglement engineering.</description>

      <title>The State of Factoring on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the current state of factoring integers on both digital and analog quantum computers. For digital quantum computers, we study the effect of errors for which one can formally prove that Shor's factoring algorithm fails. For analog quantum computers, we experimentally test three factorisation methods and provide evidence for a scaling performance that is absolutely and asymptotically better than random guessing but still exponential. We conclude with an overview of future perspectives on factoring large integers on quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hybrid continuous variable-discrete variable entanglement generation protocol using linear optics and homodyne measurements, capable of producing multiple high-fidelity Bell pairs per protocol iteration, with an approximate $0.5$ success probability. The effectiveness of the protocol is determined by the squeezing strength. To increase the number of Bell pairs, approximately 3 dB of extra squeezing is needed for each additional Bell pair. The protocol also generates single Bell pairs with an approximate $0.75$ probability for squeezing strengths $\lessapprox 15dB$, achievable with current technology.</description>

      <title>A Universal Quantum Computer From Relativistic Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an explicit construction of a relativistic quantum computing architecture using a variational quantum circuit approach that is shown to allow for universal quantum computing. The variational quantum circuit consists of tunable single-qubit rotations and entangling gates that are implemented successively. The single qubit rotations are parameterized by the proper time intervals of the qubits' trajectories and can be tuned by varying their relativistic motion in spacetime. The entangling layer is mediated by a relativistic quantum field instead of through direct coupling between the qubits. Within this setting, we give a prescription for how to use quantum field-mediated entanglement and manipulation of the relativistic motion of qubits to obtain a universal gate set, for which compact non-perturbative expressions that are valid for general spacetimes are also obtained. We also derive a lower bound on the channel fidelity that shows the existence of parameter regimes in which all entangling operations are effectively unitary, despite the noise generated from the presence of a mediating quantum field. Finally, we consider an explicit implementation of the quantum Fourier transform with relativistic qubits.</description>

      <title>Implementing transferable annealing protocols for combinatorial optimisation on neutral atom quantum processors: a case study on smart-charging of electric vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quantum optimization paradigm, variational quantum algorithms face challenges with hardware-specific and instance-dependent parameter tuning, which can lead to computational inefficiencies. The promising potential of parameter transferability across problem instances with similar local structures has been demonstrated in the context of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. In this paper we build on these advancements by extending the concept to annealing-based protocols, employing Bayesian optimization to design robust quasi adiabatic schedules. Our study reveals that, for maximum independent set problems on graph families with shared geometries, optimal parameters naturally concentrate, enabling efficient transferability between similar instances and from smaller to larger ones. Experimental results on the Orion Alpha platform validate the effectiveness of our approach, scaling to problems with up to $100$ qubits. We apply this method to address a smart-charging optimization problem on a real dataset. These findings highlight a scalable, resource-efficient path for hybrid optimization strategies applicable in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Heading towards an Algebraic Heisenberg Cut</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous papers we have explained how a sequence of theorems by John von Neumann on infinite tensor products (ITP) can be understood as providing elements to support both sectorisation of the Hilbert space of large quantum systems, and a mechanism of self decoherence thereof. These two effects may help understanding the articulation of the classical and quantum realms. However, as they involve considering an infinite number of quantum degrees of freedom, legitimate concerns can be raised on their applicability. In this paper, we address explicitly the interface between both realms through the example of a simplified model of a photon polarisation measurement device. Guided by the fact that there is von Neumann sectorisation at infinity, and by the necessity of classical contexts to perform measurements, we show that this limit can be under control, and that although the full force of the sectorisation theorems requires taking the infinite limit, early signs of the macroscopic behaviour appear before infinity. In our example, this shows up in photodiodes through diverging electron avalanches that simultaneously make the system classical, localise it randomly in a macroscopic sector and provide a macroscopic signal. This lays the grounds for justifying the inclusion in quantum physics of the ITP formalism, which involves non-separable Hilbert spaces and potentially type-III von Neumann algebras. Such an approach could make sense of the quantum-classical transition as a primarily algebraic one.</description>

      <title>RH: An Architecture for Redesigning Quantum Circuits on Quantum Hardware Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present an architecture that enables the redesign of large-scale quantum circuits on quantum hardware based on the entangling quantum generative adversarial network (EQ-GAN). Specifically, by prepending a random quantum circuit module to the standard EQ-GAN framework, we extend its capability from quantum state learning to unitary transformation learning. The completeness of this architecture is theoretically proved. Moreover, an efficient local random circuit is proposed, which significantly enhances the practicality of our architecture. For concreteness, we apply this architecture to three crucial applications in circuit optimization, including the equivalence checking of (non-) parameterized circuits, as well as the variational reconstruction of quantum circuits. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by excellent results in both classical and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware implementations. We believe our work will facilitate the implementation and validation of the advantages of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Tensor decomposition technique for qubit encoding of maximal-fidelity Lorentzian orbitals in real-space quantum chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To simulate the real- and imaginary-time evolution of a many-electron system on a quantum computer based on the first-quantized formalism, we need to encode molecular orbitals (MOs) into qubit states for typical initial-state preparation. We propose an efficient scheme for encoding an MO as a many-qubit state from a Gaussian-type solution that can be obtained from a tractable solver on a classical computer. We employ the discrete Lorentzian functions (LFs) as a fitting basis set, for which we maximize the fidelity to find the optimal Tucker-form state to represent a target MO. For $n_{\mathrm{prod}}$ three-dimensional LFs, we provide the explicit circuit construction for the state preparation involving $\mathcal{O} (n_{\mathrm{prod}})$ CNOT gates. Furthermore, we introduce a tensor decomposition technique to construct a canonical-form state to approximate the Tucker-form state with controllable accuracy. Rank-$R$ decomposition reduces the CNOT gate count to $\mathcal{O} (R n_{\mathrm{prod}}^{1/3}).$ We demonstrate via numerical simulations that the proposed scheme is a powerful tool for encoding MOs of various quantum chemical systems, paving the way for first-quantized calculations using hundreds or more logical qubits.</description>

Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a small number of seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. Nature naturally does not mind this, and experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in media. In the process, we expose some of the short-comings in earlier analyses that have kept the paradox alive.</description>

Abstract: We review the current status of security proofs for practical decoy-state Quantum Key Distribution using the BB84 protocol, focusing on optical implementations with weak coherent pulses and threshold photodetectors. The primary aim of this review is to highlight gaps in the existing literature. Such gaps may arise, for instance, from mismatches between detailed protocol specifications and proof technique elements, reliance on earlier results based on different assumptions, or protocol choices that overlook real world requirements. While substantial progress has been made, our overview draws attention to the details that still demand careful attention.</description>

Abstract: Ref. 1 asked whether deleting gates from a random quantum circuit architecture can ever make the architecture a better approximate $t$-design. We show that it can. In particular, we construct a family of architectures such that the approximate $2$-design depth decreases when certain gates are deleted. We also give some intuition for this construction and discuss the relevance of this result to the approximate $t$-design depth of the 1D brickwork. Deleting gates always decreases scrambledness in the short run, but can sometimes cause it to increase in the long run. Finally, we give analogous results for spectral gaps and when deleting edges of interaction graphs.</description>

Abstract: The Transformer model, renowned for its powerful attention mechanism, has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various artificial intelligence tasks but faces challenges such as high computational cost and memory usage. Researchers are exploring quantum computing to enhance the Transformer's design, though it still shows limited success with classical data. With a growing focus on leveraging quantum machine learning for quantum data, particularly in quantum chemistry, we propose the Molecular Quantum Transformer (MQT) for modeling interactions in molecular quantum systems. By utilizing quantum circuits to implement the attention mechanism on the molecular configurations, MQT can efficiently calculate ground-state energies for all configurations. Numerical demonstrations show that in calculating ground-state energies for H2, LiH, BeH2, and H4, MQT outperforms the classical Transformer, highlighting the promise of quantum effects in Transformer structures. Furthermore, its pretraining capability on diverse molecular data facilitates the efficient learning of new molecules, extending its applicability to complex molecular systems with minimal additional effort. Our method offers an alternative to existing quantum algorithms for estimating ground-state energies, opening new avenues in quantum chemistry and materials science.</description>

      <title>Unified Quantum Dynamics: The Emergence of the Born Rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the Born rule is traditionally introduced as a separate postulate of quantum mechanics, we show it emerges naturally from a modified Schr\"odinger equation that includes "small-signal truncation". This parallels the way quantum decoherence gives rise to the branches of the multiverse in the "Many-Worlds Interpretation", eliminating the need for a separate measurement postulate. Our approach thus offers a unified framework in which both the emergence of multiple branches of the multiverse and their statistical properties follow from a single fundamental law of motion. We model "small-signal truncation" in a somewhat stylized manner, but we argue that the precise details of its underlying physical mechanism do not affect the emergence of the Born rule.</description>

      <title>Enantiospecific Two-Photon Electric-Dipole Selection Rule of Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distinguishing between enantiomers is crucial in the study of chiral molecules in chemistry and pharmacology. Many optical approaches rely on enantiospecific cyclic electric-dipole transitions induced by three microwave or laser beams. However, these approaches impose stringent requirements, including phase locking, three-photon resonance, and precise control over beam intensities and operation times, which enhance the complexity and restrict the applicability. In this letter, we present a novel optical method that {\it eliminates these constraints entirely.} Specifically, we demonstrate that in the presence of a static electric field, there is a selection rule for two-photon electric-dipole transitions that differs between enantiomers. This distinction arises because the static electric field breaks the symmetry associated with the combined action of a specific rotation and time-reversal transformation. Leveraging the enantiospecific two-photon selection rule, one can selectively excite a desired enantiomer using two beams, without the need for phase locking, resonance condition, and the precise control of their intensities and operation times. Our method significantly enhances the feasibility and applicability of optical approaches for enantiomer differentiation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field orientation dependence of continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance with nitrogen-vacancy ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) measurements with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spins in diamond are used for sensing DC magnetic fields from nearby magnetic targets. However, this technique suffers from ambiguities in the extraction of the magnetic field components when resonances due to different NV orientation classes overlap with each other. Here, we perform detailed experimental and theoretical studies of such effects on NV ensembles experiencing low bias magnetic fields. In particular, through symmetry considerations, we systematically examine the ODMR response of different NV orientation classes as a function of the orientation of the magnetic field vector. Our studies are of importance for performing a careful and detailed analysis of the ODMR spectra in order to infer the vector magnetic field information. Our results find application in the studies of magnetic samples that require a low applied bias field and also can be potentially adapted to defect spins in other solid-state systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A path-integral approach to quantum acoustics is developed here. In contrast to the commonly utilized particle perspective, this emerging field brings forth a long neglected but essential wave paradigm for lattice vibrations. Within the coherent state picture, we formulate a non-Markovian, stochastic master equation that captures the exact dynamics of any system with coupling linear in the bath coordinates and nonlinear in the system coordinates. We further demonstrate the capability of the presented master equation by applying the corresponding procedure to the eminent Fr\"ohlich model. In general, we establish a solid foundation for quantum acoustics as a kindred framework to quantum optics, while paving the way for deeper first-principle explorations of non-perturbative system dynamics driven by lattice vibrations.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer-Accelerated Quantum Many-Body Ground-State Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. While further investigations are required, the present work suggests that collective features may be associated with high but simple large-scale entanglement which can be captured by stabilizer states, while the interplay with single-particle motion may be responsible for inducing non-stabilizerness. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.</description>

      <title>Fermion Doubling in Quantum Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Quantum Cellular Automaton (QCA) is essentially an operator driving the evolution of particles on a lattice, through local unitaries. Because $\Delta_x=\Delta_t=\varepsilon$, QCAs constitute a privileged framework to cast the digital quantum simulation of relativistic quantum particles and their interactions with gauge fields, e.g., $(3+1)$D Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). But before they can be adopted, simulation schemes for high-energy physics need prove themselves against specific numerical issues, of which the most infamous is Fermion Doubling (FD). FD is well understood in particular in the discrete-space but continuous-time settings of real-time/Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), as the appearance of spurious solutions for all $\Delta_x=\varepsilon\neq 0$. We rigorously extend this analysis to the real-time discrete-space and discrete-time schemes that QCAs are. We demonstrate the existence of FD issues in QCAs. By applying a covering map on the Brillouin zone, we provide a flavoring-without-staggering way of fixing FD that does not break chiral symmetry. We explain how this method coexists with the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem, and illustrate this with a neutrino-like QCA.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of an industry-grade fabrication of superconducting qubits on 200 mm wafers utilizing CMOS-established processing methods. By automated waferprober resistance measurements at room temperature, we demonstrate a Josephson junction fabrication yield of 99.7% (shorts and opens) across more than 10000 junctions and a qubit frequency prediction accuracy of 1.6%. In cryogenic characterization, we provide statistical results regarding energy relaxation times of the qubits with a median T1 of up to 100 us and individual devices consistently approaching 200 us in long-term measurements. This represents the best performance reported so far for superconducting qubits fabricated by industry-grade, wafer-level subtractive processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete time quasi-crystals are non-equilibrium quantum phenomena with quasi-periodic order in the time dimension, and are an extension of the discrete time-crystal phase. As a natural platform to explore the non-equilibrium phase of matter, the Rydberg atomic array has implemented the quantum simulation of the discrete-time crystal phase, associated with quantum many-body scar state. However, the existence of discrete time quasi-crystal on the Rydberg cold atom experiment platform has yet to be conceived. Here, we propose a method to generate the discrete time quasi-crystal behavior by coupling two discrete time-crystals, where associated two external driving frequencies have the maximum incommensurability. While we analysis its robustness and compute the phase diagram of corresponding observables. We significantly calculate the entanglement entropy between two parts of the system. Remarkably, we find the emergence of the aperiodic response is indeed caused by interaction between systems via Rydberg blockade effect. Our method thus offers the possibilities to explore the novel phases in quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Circuit Optimization in Quantum Compilers: A Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore multilevel circuit optimization (MLCO), where we deploy multiple gate sets and progressively lower the source circuit through the gate sets to the target circuit. At each level, we first perform an appropriate set of circuit simplifications and then lower the simplified circuit into the next level, decomposing the gates not supported there. We demonstrate its effectiveness, using as a case study the source circuit for Hamiltonian simulation to solve a partial differential equation, which is densely populated with multi-controlled gates and is transformed by the state-of-the-art circuit compiler to the target circuit with the quadratic number of CX gates in the number of qubits. MLCO makes visible higher-level circuit structures, providing us with insights about how to simplify the circuits and how to decompose the gates. By putting the right circuit structure in place and selecting the right decomposition algorithm, we could cause massive cancellation of entangling gates, thereby having achieved the quadratic reduction in the number of CX gates.</description>

Abstract: Two indispensable algorithms in an introductory course on Quantum Computing are Grover's search algorithm and quantum phase estimation. Quantum counting is a simple yet beautiful blend of these two algorithms, and it is therefore an attractive topic for a student project in such a course. However, a sign that is irrelevant when implementing Grover's algorithm becomes relevant. We briefly review these algorithms, highlighting the aforementioned sign.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement takes a key role in quantum physics while how much information it can extract from many-body systems is still an open question, particularly for quantum criticalities and emergent symmetries. In this work, we systematically study the entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative (DEE) near quantum phase transitions in various quantum many-body systems. An exact one-parameter scaling relation between the DEE and system size at the critical point has been derived for the first time, which successfully obtains the critical exponent via data collapse. What's more, we find that the EE peaks at the (emergent) symmetry-enhanced first-order transition which reflects higher symmetry breaking. This work provides a new paradigm for quantum many-body research from the perspective of EE and DEE.</description>

      <title>Impact of micromotion on the excitation of Rydberg states of ions in a Paul trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation and computation. Their capabilities can be further augmented by making use of electronically highly excited Rydberg states, which enable the realization of long-ranged electric dipolar interactions. Most experimental and theoretical studies so far focus on the excitation of ionic Rydberg states in linear Paul traps, which generate confinement by a combination of static and oscillating electric fields. These two fields need to be carefully aligned to minimize so-called micromotion, caused by the time-dependent electric field. The purpose of this work is to systematically understand the qualitative impact of micromotion on the Rydberg excitation spectrum, when the symmetry axes of the two electric fields do not coincide. Considering this scenario is not only important in the case of possible field misalignment, but becomes inevitable for Rydberg excitations in 2D and 3D ion crystals. We develop a minimal model describing a single trapped Rydberg ion, which we solve numerically via Floquet theory and analytically using a perturbative approach. We calculate the excitation spectra and analyze in which parameter regimes addressable and energetically isolated Rydberg lines persist, which are an important requirement for conducting coherent manipulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable and generalizable physics-aware deep learning has long been considered a significant challenge with various applications across diverse domains ranging from robotics to molecular dynamics. Central to almost all physical systems are symplectic forms, the geometric backbone that underpins fundamental invariants like energy and momentum. In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, MetaSym. In particular, MetaSym combines a strong symplectic inductive bias obtained from a symplectic encoder, and an autoregressive decoder with meta-attention. This principled design ensures that core physical invariants remain intact, while allowing flexible, data-efficient adaptation to system heterogeneities. We benchmark MetaSym with highly varied and realistic datasets, such as a high-dimensional spring-mesh system (Otness et al., 2021), an open quantum system with dissipation and measurement backaction, and robotics-inspired quadrotor dynamics. Our results demonstrate superior performance in modeling dynamics under few-shot adaptation, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines that use larger models.</description>

      <title>Apparent teleportation of indistinguishable particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleportation, introduced in science fiction literature, is an instantaneous change of the position of a macroscopic object. Two teleportation-like phenomena were predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, recently, quantum particle teleportation. The former is investigated experimentally and has applications in quantum communication and computing.
  Here, we introduced the third teleportation-like phenomenon - apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of the Standard Model's indistinguishable elementary particles and antiparticles. We give an example of a process leading to the apparent teleportation within a 1+1D toy model of particle space-time evolution. It utilizes the local transport of particles and antiparticles and the local creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Furthermore, we suggest a method to observe the apparent teleportation in nucleus-nucleus collisions at properly selected collision energies. The method requires the measurement of correlations between momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in collisions with a single charm-anticharm quark pair being produced. The ultimate prediction following the apparent teleportation hypothesis is the uncorrelated emission of charm and anticharm hadrons. It can be tested by contemporary experiments.
  Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles. In particular, the apparent teleportation may explain the rapid thermalisation of the system created in collisions of two atomic nuclei and the quark-gluon plasma hadronisation paradox. Theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to observe the apparent teleportation processes and study their properties.</description>

      <title>Learning transitions in classical Ising models and deformed toric codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional probability distributions describe the effect of learning an initially unknown classical state through Bayesian inference. Here we demonstrate the existence of a learning transition, having signatures in the long distance behavior of conditional correlation functions, in the two-dimensional classical Ising model. This transition, which arises when learning local energy densities, extends all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model for learning also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our methods can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.</description>

Abstract: Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, first recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the interaction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In systems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between light and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is manipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a nematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being used as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the operation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid crystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division multiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of optical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary excitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it has not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical vortex beams using Brillouin light scattering by magnons without phase singularities. We observe scattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by conservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons and magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the interaction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the novel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation bandwidth.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, advancements in quantum chip technology, such as Willow, have contributed to reducing quantum computation error rates, potentially accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing. As a result, the design of quantum algorithms suitable for real-world applications has become a crucial research direction. This study focuses on the implementation of Shor algorithm, aiming to improve modular computation efficiency and demonstrate the factorization of a 4096-bit integer under specific constraints. Experimental results, when compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, indicate a significant improvement in efficiency while enabling the factorization of longer integers.</description>

      <title>General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.</description>

      <title>High-Order Hermite Optimization: Fast and Exact Gradient Computation in Open-Loop Quantum Optimal Control using a Discrete Adjoint Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the High-Order Hermite Optimization (HOHO) method, an open-loop discrete adjoint method for quantum optimal control. Our method is the first of its kind to efficiently compute exact (discrete) gradients when using continuous, parameterized control pulses while solving the forward equations (e.g. Schrodinger's equation or the Linblad master equation) with an arbitrarily high-order Hermite Runge-Kutta method. The HOHO method is implemented in [QuantumGateDesign.jl](https://github.com/leespen1/QuantumGateDesign.jl), an open-source software package for the Julia programming language, which we use to perform numerical experiments comparing the method to [Juqbox.jl](https://github.com/LLNL/Juqbox.jl). For realistic model problems we observe speedups up to 775x.</description>

      <title>QuXAI: Explainers for Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (HQML) models opens new horizons of computational intelligence but their fundamental complexity frequently leads to black box behavior that undermines transparency and reliability in their application. Although XAI for quantum systems still in its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY. The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use of quantum-enhanced AI technology.

      <title>Quantum Lifshitz points in an altermagnetic metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of two tri-critical quantum Lifshitz points in recently discovered $d$-wave altermagnetic metals subjected to an external magnetic field. These points connect a spatially modulated Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a uniform polarized Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting phase, and the normal metallic phase in a nontrivial manner. Depending on whether the FFLO state is primarily induced by the magnetic field or by $d$-wave altermagnetism, we classify the corresponding Lifshitz points as field-driven or altermagnetism-driven, respectively. Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.</description>
