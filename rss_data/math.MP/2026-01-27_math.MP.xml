      <title>Euler-Poincar\'e Formulation of Barotropic Fluids Coupled with ADM Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric mechanics framework for the reduction of general relativistic hydrodynamic variational principles, from the variation of worldlines approach in 4D spacetime to 3-dimensional Eulerian descriptions. We consider a self-gravitating, barotropic fluid and obtain the Euler-Poincar\'e equations of the system by Lagrangian reduction. Using the decomposition of general relativity into 3 + 1 dimensions, with a direction of time defined, the gauge invariance of the action over spacetime diffeomorphisms permits a 3-dimensional description of the fluid diffeomorphism by gauge fixing. The configuration space thus mirrors the Newtonian case, and by employing the Euler-Poincar\'e theorem, we derive the Eulerian equations of motion, in the same form as the PDEs from Newtonian fluid dynamics. The equations of motion are then derived, where the fluid variables are measured in a separate frame of reference from the variables involving gravity. Furthermore, the general relativistic barotropic fluid exhibits a Kelvin-Noether circulation conservation, which we derive in both the inertial and moving frames of reference. Finally, potential applications to Numerical Relativity are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Lorentzian SU(3)-covariant noncommutative KP hierarchy and hypercomplex gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a formal framework for a noncommutative Kadomtsev--Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy which is covariant under the action of $SU(3)$ and compatible with a Lorentzian structure encoded in a twisted quaternionic (or Clifford) algebra. The starting point is a formal pseudodifferential operator $L$ built from an abstract derivation $D$ of Dirac type and coefficients in an associative algebra $\A$ that combines spin degrees of freedom (twisted quaternions, Clifford algebras) and color degrees of freedom (an internal $SU(3)$ factor, possibly realized via the octonions). In this way we obtain a hierarchy of formal partial differential equations which are Lorentz invariant and $SU(3)$ covariant and can be interpreted as integrable sectors of nonabelian gauge theories in $(3+1)$ dimensions and of their dimensional reductions.</description>

      <title>The stability priority of spatial-temporal coupled compact element methods over decoupled compact element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing industrial demands, two families of high-order numerical schemes are widely used within the computational fluid dynamics community. One is the method of line, which relies on Runge-Kutta (RK) time-stepping applied to a semi-discrete, spatio-temporally decoupled formulation. The other is the family of Lax-Wendroff (LW) type method, which are inherently spatial-temporal coupled and are constructed within a multi-stage multi-derivative (MSMD) framework. This paper, for the first time, conducted a comparative Fourier stability analysis of RK and LW method to distinguish the dispersion and dissipation effects of numerical schemes respectively. Through rigorous theoretical derivation and consistent numerical validation, we draw the following conclusions: While explicit RK line methods are straightforward like Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and flux reconstruction (FR) method, they employ from a decoupling of spatial and temporal accuracy, thus discarding flow field evolution information and requiring small time steps. In contrast, spatial-temporal coupled compact methods, such as the gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) and the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver, utilize initial-value information from space far more effectively for time evolution. Even with just one additional order of spatial-temporal coupled information, they show better stability compared to RK methods. This provides new insights for CFD algorithm design, emphasizing the need for consistency between the dependence in the physical domain and that in numerical domain.</description>

      <title>Representations of the Flat Space Wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From any graph $G$ arises a flat space wavefunction, obtained by integrating a product of propagators associated to the vertices and edges of $G$. This function is a key ingredient in the computation of cosmological correlators, and several representations for it have been proposed. We formulate three such representations and prove their correctness. In particular, we show that the flat space wavefunction can be read off from the canonical form of the cosmological polytope, and we settle a conjecture of Fevola, Pimentel, Sattelberger, and Westerdijk regarding a partial fraction decomposition for the flat space wavefunction. The terms of the decomposition correspond to certain collections of connected subgraphs associated to $G$ and its spanning subgraphs, reflecting the fact that the flat space wavefunction contains information about how $G$ is connected.</description>

      <title>The Stability Limit of Prepotentials for Hurwitz-Frobenius Manifolds: An Infinite-Dimensional Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of prepotential derivatives for Frobenius manifolds associated with A_N and D_N singularities has been utilized to construct (2+1)-dimensional dispersionless integrable hierarchies. Although the generalization of this construction to genus-zero Hurwitz-Frobenius manifolds was shown to yield the genus-zero Whitham hierarchy, a direct geometric explanation of this correspondence has been lacking. In this note, we provide a direct proof of this identification within the framework of infinite-dimensional Frobenius manifolds. We demonstrate that the stability of prepotentials is an intrinsic property of the tau-structure of the Whitham hierarchy. Furthermore, we extend this identification to the hierarchies arising from the stability of solutions to the open WDVV equations with the extensions of the Whitham hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Wave functions and k-point functions for the AKNS hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an arbitrary solution to the AKNS hierarchy, the logarithmic derivatives of the tau-function of the solution can be computed by the matrix-resolvent method [14,21]. In this paper, we introduce a pair of wave functions of the solution and we use them to express the corresponding matrix resolvent. Based on this, we derive a new formula for the k-point correlation function of the AKNS hierarchy expressed in terms of wave functions. As an application, we show that the tau-function of an arbitrary solution to the AKNS hierarchy is a KP tau-function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that biorthogonal ensembles on the real line with a specific derivative structure admit an explicit correlation kernel of double contour integral form. We will demonstrate that this expression is a valuable starting point for asymptotic analysis and that our class of biorthogonal ensembles admits a large variety of limit kernels, by proving that two new classes of limit kernels can occur. The first type is a deformation of the hard edge Bessel kernel which arises in polynomial ensembles describing the eigenvalues of the sum of two random matrices, while the second type arises for Muttalib-Borodin type deformations of polynomial ensembles.</description>

      <title>Massless Representations in Conformal Space and Their de Sitter (dS) Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monograph develops a self-contained, mathematically rigorous framework for massless representations of the conformal group U(2,2) and their restriction to the de Sitter group Sp(2,2). It systematically constructs ladder (massless) representations, computes invariant bilinear forms and Casimir operators, and provides explicit constructions of vertex operators and two-point functions for low-helicity fields. The monograph employs a novel Clifford-split-octonion approach, embedding 8-component Majorana spinors within an alternative composition algebra, which allows for fully explicit algebraic, spinorial, and geometric constructions. The text bridges foundational representation theory, explicit computational methods, and physical applications in quantum field theory and cosmology. While targeted at researchers in mathematical physics, quantum cosmology, and quantum field theory, the exposition is pedagogically structured to guide advanced graduate students through subtle algebraic and representation-theoretic ideas, making complex constructions accessible without sacrificing rigor.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Transition to Intermittency for a Stochastic Heat Equation Driven by the Square of a Gaussian Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spatial behavior of the solution $\psi(x,t)$ to the stochastic heat equation $\partial_t\psi(x,t)-\frac{1}{2}\partial^2_{x^2} \psi(x,t)=g\, S(x,t)^2\, \psi(x,t)$, with $0\le t\le T$, $x\in\mathbb{R}$, and $\psi(x,0)=1$. Here, $g&gt;0$ is a coupling constant and $S(x,t)$ is a stationary, homogeneous, and ergodic Gaussian field. Focusing on $\mathcal{E}(x,g)\equiv \psi(x,T)$ at a finite time $T&gt;0$, we identify the critical coupling $g_c(T)$ above which the average of $\mathcal{E}(0,g)$ diverges. We show that in the subcritical regime $g&lt;g_c(T)$, $\mathcal{E}(x,g)$ is spatially ergodic, with no intermittency, while in the supercritical regime $g&gt;g_c(T)$ it becomes spatially intermittent and loses ergodicity. Our results differ from the extensively studied case where $S(x,t)^2$ is replaced by $S(x,t)$, in which intermittency appears only asymptotically as $T\to +\infty$, with no finite-time intermittency.</description>

      <title>Quantitative uniform exponential acceleration of averages along decaying waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09398v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, utilizing a specific exponential weighting function, we investigate the uniform exponential convergence of weighted Birkhoff averages along decaying waves and delve into several related variants. A key distinction from traditional scenarios is evident here: despite reduced regularity in observables, our method still maintains exponential convergence. In particular, we develop new techniques that yield very precise rates of exponential convergence, as evidenced by numerical simulations. Furthermore, this innovative approach extends to quantitative analyses involving different weighting functions employed by others, surpassing the limitations inherent in prior research. It also enhances the exponential convergence rates of weighted Birkhoff averages along quasi-periodic orbits via analytic observables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the uniform exponential acceleration beyond averages along quasi-periodic or almost periodic orbits, particularly from a quantitative perspective.</description>

      <title>Cubic Dirac Operators and Dirac Cohomology for Basic Classical Lie Superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Dirac cohomology of supermodules over basic classical Lie superalgebras, formulated in terms of cubic Dirac operators associated with parabolic subalgebras. Specifically, we establish a super-analog of the Casselman-Osborne theorem for supermodules with an infinitesimal character and use it to show that the Dirac cohomology of highest-weight supermodules is always non-trivial. In particular, we explicitly compute the Dirac cohomology of finite-dimensional simple supermodules for basic Lie superalgebras of type 1 with a typical highest weight, as well as of simple supermodules in the parabolic BGG category. We further investigate the relationship between Dirac cohomology and Kostant (co)homology, proving that, under suitable conditions, Dirac cohomology embeds into Kostant (co)homology. Moreover, we show that this embedding lifts to an isomorphism when the supermodule is unitarizable.</description>

      <title>Weighted Birkhoff averages: Deterministic and probabilistic perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03210v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we survey physically related applications of a class of weighted quasi-Monte Carlo methods from a theoretical, deterministic perspective, and establish quantitative universal rapid convergence results via various regularity assumptions. Specifically, we introduce weighting with compact support to the Birkhoff ergodic averages of quasi-periodic, almost periodic, and periodic systems, thereby achieving universal rapid convergence, including both arbitrary polynomial and exponential types. This is in stark contrast to the typically slow convergence in classical ergodic theory. As new contributions, we not only discuss more general weighting functions but also provide quantitative improvements to existing results; the explicit regularity settings facilitate the application of these methods to specific problems. We also revisit the physically related problems and, for the first time, establish universal exponential convergence results for the weighted computation of Fourier coefficients, in both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional cases. In addition to the above, we explore results from a probabilistic perspective, including the weighted strong law of large numbers and the weighted central limit theorem, by building upon the historical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article develops a comprehensive theory of multiary graded polyadic algebras, extending the classical concept of group-graded algebras to higher-arity structures. We introduce the notion of grading by multiary groups and investigate various compatibility conditions between the arity of algebra operations and grading group operations. Key results include quantization rules connecting arities, classification of graded homomorphisms, and concrete examples including ternary superalgebras and polynomial algebras over $n$-ary matrices. The theory reveals fundamentally new phenomena not present in the binary case, such as the existence of higher power gradings and nontrivial constraints on arity compatibility.</description>

Abstract: We define the one-leg orbifold topological vertex in refined Gromov-Witten theory \cite{BS24}. There are two cases where the leg is effective or gerby. The main result of this paper is the computation of the effective case. In the smooth case, this result matches the one-leg refined vertex in \cite{IKV09}. As an application, we compute the refined Gromov-Witten invariants of the local football.</description>

Abstract: Induced gravity, defined as a globally scale-invariant ``first-generation'' scalar-tensor theory, is investigated within the framework of the thermodynamics of modified gravity theories. The ``temperature of gravity'' and its evolution equation are derived for this model, and the resulting expressions are used to analyse General-Relativity equilibrium states and to investigate the possible existence of an attractor mechanism toward Einstein's theory with a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Nested ansatz method for Baker-Akhiezer functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain that the logic behind the derivation of the Noumi-Shiraishi function can be applied directly to the Baker-Akhiezer function (BAF). This amounts to changing an ansatz for BAF to a nested one, where the BAF of N + 1 variables is recursively expressed as a sum over BAFs of N variables. This may be seen as a generalization of symmetrization trick from [1], but for the generally non-symmetric BAF. We demonstrate that, for usual non-twisted (a = 1) BAFs, this method correctly reproduces the Noumi-Shiraishi formula directly from linear equations, resolving the ambiguity related to non-simple roots. For the first non-trivial twisted case (N = 3, a = 2) this method also fixes this ambiguity, moreover, answers for the first few layers of coefficients are in the form of direct quantization of [1].</description>

      <title>Resolvent, spectrum and resonances for the acoustic operator with piecewise constant coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the acoustic operator $A_{v,\rho }:=v^{2}\rho\nabla\!\cdot\rho^{-1}\nabla$ with transmission conditions at the boundary of $\Omega=\Omega_{1}\cup\dots\cup\Omega_{n}$, where the $\Omega_{\ell}$'s are connected disjoint open bounded Lipschitz domains, the positive functions $v$ and $\rho$ are constant on each connected component of $\Omega$ and $v=\rho=1$ on ${\mathbb R}^{3}\backslash\overline\Omega$. Through a formula for the resolvents difference $(-A_{v,\rho }+z)^{-1}-(-\Delta+z)^{-1}$, we provide a Limiting Absorption Principle, determine the spectrum, which turns out to be purely absolutely continuous, and, in the case the connected components of $\Omega$ are of class ${\mathcal C}^{1,\alpha}$, characterize the resonance set. The second part of the paper is devoted to the case where $\Omega=\Omega(\varepsilon)$ is connected with a small size $\varepsilon$ and the $\varepsilon$-analytic functions $v=v(\varepsilon)$ and/or $\rho=\rho(\varepsilon)$ converge to $0_{+}$ inside $\Omega(\varepsilon)$ as $\varepsilon\downarrow 0$; there, we provide the analytic $\varepsilon$-expansions of the resonances of $A_{v,\rho }$ according to different choices of the rate of convergence towards zero of the material parameters.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and stability in bottom detection through surface measurements of water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric inverse problem of recovering the bottom shape from surface measurements of water waves. Using the general water-waves system on a bounded subdomain of the fluid domain, we address this inverse problem, focusing on the identifiability and the stability issues. We establish uniqueness and derive logarithmic stability estimates in the determination of the bathymetry on any fixed smooth, bounded, open domain
  ${\mathcal O}\subset {\mathbb R} ^d$, $d=1,2$, from the knowledge of the free surface, its first time derivative, the velocity potential at a given instant $t_0$ within $\mathcal O $, and the knowledge of the bottom along $\partial \mathcal O$. No further assumptions are required for uniqueness. For stability, we impose only a \textit{local fatness} condition on the region between the bottom profiles, allowing us to adapt the size estimates method.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Algorithms beyond Unitary Circuits: the Laplace Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-inspired algorithms can deliver substantial speedups over classical state-of-the-art methods by executing quantum algorithms with tensor networks on conventional hardware. Unlike circuit models restricted to unitary gates, tensor networks naturally accommodate non-unitary maps. This flexibility lets us design quantum-inspired methods that start from a quantum algorithmic structure, yet go beyond unitarity to achieve speedups. Here we introduce a tensor-network approach to compute the discrete Laplace transform, a non-unitary, aperiodic transform (in contrast to the Fourier transform). We encode a length-$N$ signal on two paired $n$-qubit registers and decompose the overall map into a non-unitary exponential Damping Transform followed by a Quantum Fourier Transform, both compressed in a single matrix-product operator. This decomposition admits strong MPO compression to low bond dimension resulting in significant acceleration. We demonstrate simulations up to $N=2^{30}$ input data points, with up to $2^{60}$ output data points, and quantify how bond dimension controls runtime and accuracy, including precise and efficient pole identification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Poisson vertex algebra (PVA) structures on arc spaces from $1$-shifted symplectic (QP) data. A Hamiltonian satisfying the classical master equation induces a canonical PVA $\lambda$-bracket, matching the Hamiltonian-operator formalism for integrable hierarchies. As applications, we find the resulting PVA sheaves on $\mathbb P^1$ and reinterpret our classical $R$-matrix as Maurer-Cartan data in a deformation-theoretic geometric framework, yielding AKS-type integrable hierarchies from the corresponding $R$-deformations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Radar System Using Born-Feynman path integrals approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper relates to a quantum radar deployment by the Born-Feynman path integrals approach based on quantum dots. The radar system comprises a quantum dot-based entangled photon generator, a transmission module, a delay line, a detection module, and a signal processing unit. The quantum dot-based entangled photon generator produces entangled photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion or stimulated emission. The signal transmission module, equipped with a microwave antenna and beamforming elements, directs the signal photon toward a target. The delay line module synchronizes the retained idler photon with the returning signal photon, preserving quantum coherence. The detection module collects the reflected signal photon and uses a cryogenically cooled superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) for detection. Finally, the signal processing unit analyzes the quantum correlation between the scattered and idler photons to enable precise quantum state comparison.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness and Numerical Approximation of a Coupled Darcy-Convection-Diffusion System with Exponential Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates density driven flow in porous media, focusing on the roles of viscosity contrast, density contrast, and linear adsorption. In this setup, the fluid on top is heavier and more viscous than the fluid below. Under the effect of gravity, this system becomes unstable, and finger-like structures appear. The phenomenon is described mathematically by coupling Darcy's law with a convection-diffusion reaction equation. The nonlinearity in this model arises mainly from the concentration dependence of viscosity and the convective transport term. The existence of a unique pair of weak solutions is shown in both two and three dimensions using the Galerkin approximation method and truncation technique. Moreover, an application of the maximum principle shows non-negativity of the concentration. Additionally, we analyze the long-time behavior of the solution and prove that the concentration converges exponentially to zero in the $L^p$-norm for all $1 \le p \le \infty$ as $t \to \infty.$ To complement the theoretical analysis, we perform numerical simulations based on a pressure formulation. By tracking total kinetic energy and mixing measures over time, we discuss the instability and the mixing efficiency, respectively. The present study reveals that although increasing the density contrast amplifies the total kinetic energy, the marginal impact diminishes with successive increments of density contrast. Similarly, while adsorption acts to suppress mixing, its efficiency in doing so tends to saturate with further increases. These non-linear sensitivities are predicted by our theoretical estimates and confirmed by the numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Once-reinforced random walk in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the once-reinforced random walk on $\mathbb Z^d$, which is a self-interacting walk that has a higher probability to cross edges that were already visited. We prove that the walk is transient when $d\ge 6$ and when the reinforcement is small, establishing a conjecture of Sidoravicius in these dimensions. Moreover, in this case we prove that the walk behaves diffusively and can be coupled with Brownian motion.
  One of the main ideas in the proof is a certain capacity estimate which shows that the trajectory of the walk is nowhere heavy. We also use a game-theoretic-type ingredient that we call ``the demon" to force spatial independence in the process.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this note is:
  (a) to propose a generalization of tetrahedron equations from \cite{S} and of their solutions. Due to appearance of a larger number of parameters the $R$-matrices from \cite{S} will be replaced by "$R$-correspondences".
  (b) To rephrase these equations in terms of Wronskian evolutions in the spirit of \cite{SV}.
  (c) To discuss some elementary structures of cohomological flavour lying behind our considerations. We call them "quaternities", or "bibitorsors"; they might be not without an independent interest.</description>

      <title>Large Coupling Convergence Beyond Definiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18055v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study convergence of operator families of the form $A_\beta = A + \beta B$ towards an effective operator defined on $\ker(B)$, as the coupling constant $\beta$ tends to infinity. Crucially, we focus on the setting where neither $A$ nor $B$ can be assumed to be positive- (or negative-) semi-definite. We are hence outside the classical form-theoretic framework, where results based on Kato's monotone convergence theorem would be applicable. Thus, instead of form methods, our approach builds on classical resolvent identities to study convergence of the family $\{A_\beta\}_{\beta}$. Our findings are that: (i) \emph{Strong} resolvent convergence holds (without further spectral assumptions) if $A + \beta B$ is self-adjoint and the compression of $A$ onto $\ker(B)$ is well behaved. (ii) Under the more detailed assumption that $0 \in \sigma(B)$ is isolated, \emph{norm} resolvent convergence can be established even if $A+\beta B$ is merely closed, provided the quasinilpotent part of $B$ at zero vanishes and certain conditions on the interplay of $A$ and $B$ are met. Importantly, if $B$ is not self-adjoint we find that the limit operator not only depends on $\ker(B)$ as a Hilbert space, but crucially also on the precise form of the Riesz projector at $0 \in \sigma(B)$ onto $\ker(B)$.</description>

Abstract: We study dimer models on infinite minimal graphs with Fock's weights for degenerating families of M-curves of any genus based on works of Boutillier-Cimasoni-de Tili\`{e}re and Bobenko A.I.- Bobenko N.-Suris for a fixed M-curve. We show that these dimer models for families of M-curves behave consistently under their degeneration shrinking real circles to points, and that they can be calculated as power series in the associated deformation parameters which are regarded as the perturbation of Kenyon's critical dimer models.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Chern Characters and Elliptic Atiyah--Witten Formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact, connected, and simply connected Lie group. A principal $G$-bundle over a manifold $X$, equipped with a connection, together with a positive-energy representation of the loop group $LG$, gives rise to a circle-equivariant gerbe module on the free loop space $LX$. From this data we construct the elliptic Chern character on $LX$, and a refinement, the elliptic Bismut--Chern character, on the double loop space $L^2X$.
  Generalizing the classical Atiyah--Witten formula from the free loop space $LX$ to the double loop space $L^2X$, we establish an elliptic Atiyah--Witten formula. The elliptic holonomy on $L^2X$ is defined by $\tau$-deformed equivariant twisted parallel transport on $LX$. We show that the four Pfaffian sections, corresponding to the four spin structures on an elliptic curve, are identified with the four elliptic holonomies arising from the four virtual level-one positive-energy representations when $G=\mathrm{Spin}(2n)$. These constructions are intimately connected to the moduli of $G_{\mathbb{C}}$-bundles over elliptic curves and conformal blocks in the context of Chern--Simons gauge theory.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to propose and carry out a program which allows us to yield a larger target quantum group of Drinfeld-Jimbo type via grafting two given smaller ones. To this effect, we first set up some basics of a multi-tensor product theory of the generalized double-bosonization construction (see [HH2] for the latter). Such a grafting method, depending on the choice of grafting node in the Dynkin diagram, including rank-induction and type-crossing constructions as special cases, provides a one-stop resolving strategy of the generation question of Majid's quantum tree, which grows up from the root part $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and decorates with the quantum groups of various Dynkin diagrams (of finite types) as the branches.</description>

      <title>Improved stability estimates at elliptic equilibria of Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with an improvement of the "a-priori stability bounds" on the variation of the action variables and on the stability time obtained from a given Birkhoff normal form around the elliptic equilibrium point of an Hamiltonian system satisfying a non-resonance condition of finite order N. In particular, we improve the standard a-priori lower bound on the stability time from a purely linear dependence on the inverse of the polynomial norm of the remainder of the normal form to the sum of a linear term (which is still present but with a different constant coefficient) and a quadratic one. The prevalence between the linear and the quadratic term depends on the resonance properties of all the monomials in the remainder of the normal form with degree from N to a finite order M. We also provide a comparative example of the new estimates and the traditional a priori ones in the framework of computer-assisted proofs.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a recent conjecture of Misumi and Yumoto relating the number of zero modes of lattice Dirac operators to the sum of the Betti numbers of the underlying spacetime manifold, we study formal Dirac operators on a class of graphs admitting such in terms of their zero modes. Our main result is that for graphs on which translations commute, the conjecture of Misumi and Yumoto can be shown and indeed can be strengthened to obtain bounds on the individual Betti numbers rather than merely on their sum. Interpretations of the zero modes in terms of graph quotients and of the representation theory of abelian groups are given, and connections with a homology theory for such graphs are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Birational Weyl Group Action on the Symplectic Groupoid and Cluster Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A. Bondal introduced a symplectic groupoid of triangular bilinear forms. This induces the Poisson structure on $\mathcal{A}_n$, the space of $n \times n$ unipotent upper-triangular matrices. L. Chekhov and M. Shapiro described log-canonical coordinates on this symplectic groupoid via the $\mathcal{A}_n$-quiver. In this paper, we introduce a birational Weyl group action on the symplectic groupoid. It is generated by cluster transformations associated with certain cycles of the quiver. We prove that every matrix entry of $\mathcal{A}_n$ is invariant under this action. Conversely, we prove that matrix entries generate the Poisson subalgebra of Weyl group invariants in the ring of regular functions on the cluster variety $\mathcal X_{|\mathcal A_n|}$.
  V. Fock and L. Chekhov defined a Poisson map $\phi_n$ from the Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}_{g,s}$ with genus $g$ and $s \in \{1,2\}$ boundary components into $\mathcal{A}_n$. We aim to describe the cluster structure of $\text{Im}(\phi_n)$ by applying a Hamiltonian reduction to $\mathcal A_n$. Since every element in $\text{Im}(\phi_n)$ satisfies the rank condition $\text{rank}(A+A^T) \le 4$, it provides a natural criterion for our Hamiltonian reduction. The solution set of the rank condition has distinct irreducible components, so the reduction might be component-dependent. However, we show that the Weyl group acts transitively on these components. This implies that the Hamiltonian reductions are conjugate; thus, it suffices to determine the reduction on a single component.
  Furthermore, we prove that the longest element of the Weyl group corresponds to a cluster DT-transformation on the $\mathcal{A}_{2k}$-quiver. In contrast, we show that no reddening sequence exists for odd $n$.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Analysis of Doubled 4d Chern-Simons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture that doubled four-dimensional Chern-Simons produces new integrable models, we perform its Hamiltonian analysis and find the theory's Poisson algebra. This requires carefully accounting for a set of boundary conditions that identify two gauge fields. Two methods for doing so are given, one of which is based on edge-modes and the other on a recharacterisation of the boundary conditions as constraints. We find that the Poisson algebra is that of an affine Gaudin model subject to a constraint, generalising the Goddard-Kent-Olive construction (from conformal field theory) to the world of integrable models. We also conjecture the existence of extended quantum groups and a generalisation of the affine Harish-Chandra Isomorphism.</description>

      <title>RG flows of minimal $\mathcal W$-algebra CFTs via non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we study renormalization group (RG) flows between 2d conformal field theories enjoying extended higher-spin $\mathcal{W}$-symmetry. We propose a new class of RG flows between the diagonal minimal models of $\mathcal{W}_N$-algebra that take the form $\mathcal{W}_N(p,q)\to\mathcal{W}_N(p,kp-q)$. These are obtained by matching the anomalies of the non-invertible symmetry ${\mathrm{Rep}}[SU(N)_{p-N}]$ (and its discrete quotients) that is preserved by special relevant primary fields. This large non-invertible symmetry includes the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry of the minimal models. Our new flows furnish a significant generalization of the ones recently found in the case of Virasoro algebra, and include all previously known RG flows of $\mathcal{W}_N$. They have the remarkable property of being uniform in the rank $N$ of the $\mathcal{W}$-algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a commutative algebra $\mathcal{A}$, we exhibit a canonical structure of post-Lie algebra on the space $\mathcal{A}\otimes {\rm Der}(\mathcal{A})$ where ${\rm Der}(\mathcal{A})$ is the space of derivations on $\mathcal{A}$, in order to use the machinery given by Oudom-Guin (2008) and Ebrahimi-Fard--Lundervold--Munthe-Kaas (2015), and to define a Hopf algebra structure on the associated enveloping algebra with a natural action on $\mathcal{A}$. We apply these results to the setting of Linares-Otto-Tempelmayr (2023), giving a simpler and more efficient construction of their action and extending the recent work by Bruned-Katsetsiadis (2023). This approach gives an optimal setting to perform explicit computations in the associated structure group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05646v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we study the low density Bose gas in the thermodynamic limit interacting via two-body and three-body interaction potentials. We prove that the leading order of the ground state energy is entirely characterised by both the scattering length of the two-body potential and the scattering energy of the three-body potential. The corresponding result for two-body interactions was proven in seminal papers of Dyson (1957) and of Lieb-Yngvason (1998), and the result for three-body interactions was proven by Nam-Ricaud-Triay (2022). The present result resolves a conjecture of Nam-Ricaud-Triay (2022).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18685v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of AQFTs and prefactorization algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits the equivalence problem between algebraic quantum field theories and prefactorization algebras defined over globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. We develop a radically new approach whose main innovative features are 1.) a structural implementation of the additivity property used in earlier approaches and 2.) a reduction of the global equivalence problem to a family of simpler spacetime-wise problems. When applied to the case where the target category is a symmetric monoidal $1$-category, this yields a generalization of the equivalence theorem from [Commun. Math. Phys. 377, 971 (2019)]. In the case where the target is the symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category of cochain complexes, we obtain a reduction of the global $\infty$-categorical equivalence problem to simpler, but still challenging, spacetime-wise problems. The latter would be solved by showing that certain functors between $1$-categories exhibit $\infty$-localizations, however the available detection criteria are inconclusive in our case.</description>

Abstract: The gauge covariant magnetic perturbation theory is tailored for one-body Schr\"odinger operators perturbed by long-range magnetic fields. In this work we present a self-contained exposition of the method, by outlining its technical foundations and discussing the physical heuristics behind the proofs. We apply it in order to prove the stability of spectral gaps and to study the location of the discrete spectrum. We also analyze the (lack of) continuity with respect to the magnetic field of spectral projections corresponding to finite spectral islands, which is a particularly important situation for systems modelling Chern insulators. Finally, we show how to construct approximate projections that have an explicit dependence with respect to the magnetic field parameter.</description>

      <title>On the characteristic form of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued zero-curvature representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\mathfrak{g}$-valued zero-curvature representations (ZCRs) for partial differential equations in two independent variables from the perspective of their extension to the entire infinite jet space, focusing on their characteristic elements. Since conservation laws -- more precisely, conserved currents -- and their generating functions for a given equation are precisely the $\mathbb{R}$-valued ZCRs and their characteristic elements, a natural question arises: to what extent can results known for conservation laws be extended to general $\mathfrak{g}$-valued ZCRs.
  For a fixed matrix Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g} \subset \mathfrak{gl}(n)$, we formulate ZCRs as equivalence classes of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued function pairs on the infinite jet space that satisfy the Maurer--Cartan condition. Our main result establishes that every such ZCR admits a characteristic representative -- i.e., a representative in which the Maurer--Cartan condition takes a characteristic form -- generalizing the characteristic form known for conservation laws. This form is preserved under gauge transformations and can thus be regarded as a kind of normal form for ZCRs. We derive a new necessary condition, independent of the Maurer--Cartan equation, that must be satisfied by any characteristic representative. This condition is trivial in the abelian case but nontrivial whenever $\mathfrak{g}$ is nonabelian. These findings not only confirm structural assumptions used in previous works but also suggest potential applications in the classification and computation of ZCRs.</description>

Abstract: We study polygon equations and their connections to simplex equations, which generalize the pentagon and Yang--Baxter equations, respectively. First, we show that certain "commutative" pairs of solutions of (dual) polygon equations give rise to solutions of higher-order polygon equations. Next, we define an explicit compatibility condition between solutions of the $n$-gon and dual $n$-gon equations and use it to construct solutions of the $(n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-simplex equations. This extends earlier work by Kashaev--Sergeev and Dimakis--M\"uller-Hoissen.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement as a Cohomological Obstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recast quantum entanglement as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information. We address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced correction as an experimental validation. Detailed numerical implementations for concrete quantum many-body models are presented in the companion paper \cite{2026arXiv260113467I}.</description>

We prove that the cumulative distributions function of the ballistically scaled position $X(n)/{n}$ after $n$ steps converges at a rate of $n^{-1/3}$ in the L\'evy metric as $n\to\infty$. In the special case of step-coin quantum walks with two-dimensional coin space, we recover the same convergence rate for the supremum distance and prove optimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a commutative unital algebra $\mathcal O$, a proper ideal $\mathcal I$ in $\mathcal O$, and a positively graded differential variety over $\mathcal O/\mathcal I$, we provide a $\mathbb Z$-graded extension, whose negative part is an arborescent Koszul-Tate resolution of $\mathcal O/ \mathcal I$. This extension is obtained through an algorithm exploiting the explicit homotopy retract data of the arborescent Koszul-Tate resolution, so that the number of homological computations in the construction is significantly reduced. For a positively graded differential variety over $\mathcal O$ that preserves the ideal $\mathcal I$, the extension admits a manifest description in terms of decorated trees and computed data.
  As a by-product, to every Lie-Rinehart algebra over the coordinate ring of an affine variety $ W \subseteq M = \mathbb{C}^d$, one associates an explicit differential $\mathbb{Z}$-graded variety over $M$ whose negative component is the arborescent Koszul-Tate resolution of the coordinate ring $\mathbb C[x_1, \ldots, x_d]/\mathcal I_W$ of $W$, and whose positive component is the universal dg-variety of the given Lie-Rinehart algebra. Concrete examples are given.</description>

      <title>A Non-Reciprocal Elliptic Spectral Solution of the Right-Angle Penetrable Wedge Transmission Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional time-harmonic scalar transmission problem for an impedance-matched penetrable right-angle wedge: the exterior medium has wavenumber k_0 and the interior sector |theta| &lt; pi/4 has wavenumber k_1 = nu*k_0 with nu &gt; 1, with continuity of the total field and its normal derivative across each face. A Sommerfeld-Malyuzhinets reduction leads to a 2x2 matrix Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem on the Snell surface Sigma_nu. For the right angle the surface has genus one, and we give an explicit theta-function uniformization and a closed-form Mittag-Leffler construction of the full family of elliptic RH solutions with finite forcing (prescribed poles and residues), subject to a single residue-sum constraint encoding the Meixner edge condition. We then consider the additional forcing data required to model plane-wave incidence. Numerical reciprocity tests show that the minimal one-point plane-wave prescription does not yield a physically closed solution: the natural sheet-swap pairing u# = u + omega_2 produces nontrivial scattered densities but violates the far-field reciprocity benchmark, whereas the Hardy pairing u# = omega_1 - u enforces reciprocity but collapses the scattered field to zero. The paper therefore provides an exact elliptic spectral framework and a reproducible reciprocity diagnostic, while identifying what must be added (multi-point forcing and/or modified pairing incorporating both wedge faces) to obtain a reciprocity-consistent plane-wave solution.</description>

Abstract: Statistical ensembles of reduced density matrices of bipartite quantum systems play a central role in entanglement estimation, but do not capture the non-stationary nature of entanglement relevant to realistic quantum information processing. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamical extension of the Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble, a baseline statistical model for entanglement estimation, arising from non-intersecting squared Bessel processes and perform entanglement estimation via average entanglement entropy and quantum purity. The investigation is enabled by finding spectral moments of the proposed dynamical ensemble, which serves as a new approach for systematic computation of entanglement metrics. Along the way, we also obtain new results for the underlying multiple orthogonal polynomials of modified Bessel weights, including structure and recurrence relations, and a Christoffel-Darboux formula for the correlation kernels.</description>

      <title>Low regularity ill-posedness and shock formation for 3D ideal compressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) significantly boosts the understanding and development of solar physics, planetary dynamics and controlled nuclear fusion. Dynamical properties of the MHD system involve nonlinear interactions of waves with multiple travelling speeds (the fast and slow magnetosonic waves, the Alfv\'{e}n wave and the entropy wave). One intriguing topic is the shock phenomena accompanied by the magnetic field, which have been affirmed by astronomical observations. However, permitting the residence of all above multi-speed waves, mathematically, whether one can prove shock formation for three dimensional (3D) MHD is still open. The multiple-speed nature of the MHD system makes it fascinating and challenging. In this paper, we report our recent progress in answering the above question. For 3D ideal compressible MHD, we construct planar symmetric examples of shock formation allowing the presence of all characteristic waves with multiple wave speeds. This also answers a question raised by Majda on conservation law in 1984. Building on our construction, we further prove that the Cauchy problem for 3D ideal MHD is $H^2$ ill-posed. And this is caused by the shock formation. In particular, when the magnetic field is absent, we also provide a desired low-regularity ill-posedness result for the 3D compressible Euler equations, and it is sharp with respect to the regularity of the fluid velocity. Our proof for 3D MHD is based on a coalition of a carefully designed algebraic approach and a geometric approach. To trace the nonlinear interactions of various waves, we algebraically decompose the 3D ideal MHD equations into a $7\times 7$ non-strictly hyperbolic system. Via detailed calculations, we reveal its hidden subtle structures. With them we give a complete description of MHD dynamics up to the earliest singular event, when a shock forms.</description>

Abstract: In a fractional Sobolev space $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with $s\leq\frac74$, we prove the low-regularity ill-posedness for the 2D compressible Euler equations and the 2D ideal compressible MHD system.

      <description>arXiv:2305.18062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the classical conformal welding problem for a composition of two random homeomorphisms generated by independent Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures with small parameter values. In other words, given two such measures on the boundary of the unit disk we show that there exist conformal maps to complementary domains on the Riemann sphere such that the pushforward of the normalised measures agree on their common boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a short introduction of the exterior form formalism focus on its applications in physics and then mostly aimed to physics students. As a rule of a game played here we never use a coordinate frame neither in the definitions nor in the proofs but only at the end in order to recover the classical physics equations. This approach is unusual but we think is helpful for the understanding and very valuable to grab the physical meanings of the mathematical object.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of compiling graphs under the parity transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish a mathematical framework that utilizes concepts from graph theory to formalize the parity transformation, an encoding strategy for compiling optimization problems on quantum devices. We introduce the transformation as a mapping that encompasses all possible compiled hypergraphs and investigate its uniqueness properties in more detail. Specifically, by introducing so-called loop labelings, we derive an alternative expression of the preimage of any set of compiled hypergraphs under this encoding procedure when all equivalence classes of graphs are being considered. We then deduce equivalent conditions for the injectivity of the parity transformation on any subset of all equivalences classes of graphs. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate that the parity transformation is not an injective mapping, and also introduce an important class of physical layouts and their corresponding set of constraints whose preimage is uniquely determined. In addition, we provide an algorithm which is based on classical algorithms from theoretical computer science and computes a compiled physical layout in this class in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the partition function for $\beta$-ensembles at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the real $\beta$-ensemble (or 1D log-gas) of dimension $N$ in the high-temperature regime, \textit{i.e.} where the inverse temperature $\beta$ scales as $N\beta=2P$ with $P$ a fixed positive parameter. We establish the large-$N$ asymptotic expansion at all orders of the partition function:
  \begin{equation*}
  Z_N[V]=\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}\prod_{i&lt;j}^{N}\left |x_i-x_j\right|^{\frac{2P}{N}}\cdot\prod_{i=1}^{N}e^{-V(x_i)} \mathrm{d}x_i
  \end{equation*}
  for $V(x)=x^2+\phi(x)$ with $\phi$ a bounded smooth function, and identify the first two terms of this expansion.
  In this regime, the energy no longer dominates the entropy, as in the fixed-$\beta$ case, but rather scales at the same order in $N$. Consequently, at large $N$, the system is macroscopically described by the so-called\textit{ thermal equilibrium measure} which is supported on the entire real line.
  Our proof relies on the loop equations method, previously applied in the fixed-$\beta$ setting in \cite{BoG1,BoG2}, and provides the first example in which this approach can be successfully implemented using the thermal equilibrium measure. This requires a detailed understanding of both the thermal equilibrium measure and the associated master operator, an unbounded differential operator, leading to several new analytical challenges.
  In this setting, we carry out a technically involved analysis to obtain precise estimates for the inverse of the master operator in suitable functional norms. In addition we establish, through subtle operator arguments, a crucial continuity property of the equilibrium density with respect to the potential dependence. These two results constitute the main novelties of the paper and allow us to exhibit a new class of multiple integrals for which such an expansion can be obtained, while providing a deeper understanding of the thermal equilibrium measure and its properties.</description>

      <title>Approximate Unitary $k$-Designs from Shallow, Low-Communication Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random unitaries are useful in quantum information and related fields, but hard to generate with limited resources. An approximate unitary $k$-design is an ensemble of unitaries with an underlying measure over which the average is close to a Haar random ensemble up to the first $k$ moments. A particularly strong notion of approximation bounds the distance from Haar randomness in relative error. Such relative-error approximate designs are secure against queries by an adaptive adversary trying to distinguish it from a Haar ensemble. We construct relative-error approximate unitary $k$-design ensembles for which communication between subsystems is $O(1)$ in the system size. These constructions use the alternating projection method to analyze overlapping Haar averages, giving a bound on the convergence speed to the full averaging with respect to the $2$-norm. Using von Neumann subalgebra indices to replace system dimension, the 2-norm distance converts to relative error without introducing any additional dimension dependence. We use these constructions as the building blocks of a two-step protocol that achieves a relative-error design in $O \big ( (\log m + \log(1/\epsilon) + k \log k ) k\, \text{polylog}(k) \big )$ depth, where $m$ is the number of qudits in the complete system and $\epsilon$ the approximation error. This sublinear depth construction answers a variant of [Harrow and Mehraban 2023, Section 1.5, Open Questions 1 and 7]. Moreover, entanglement generated by the sublinear depth scheme follows area laws on spatial lattices up to corrections logarithmic in the full system size.</description>

      <title>The Critical 2d Stochastic Heat Flow and Related Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we review recent progress in the study of the stochastic heat equation and its discrete analogue, the directed polymer model, in spatial dimension 2. It was discovered that a phase transition emerges on an intermediate disorder scale, with Edwards-Wilkinson (Gaussian) fluctuations in the sub-critical regime. In the critical window, a unique scaling limit has been identified and named the critical 2d stochastic heat flow. This gives a meaning to the solution of the stochastic heat equation in the critical dimension 2, which lies beyond existing solution theories for singular SPDEs. We outline the proof ideas, introduce the key ingredients, and discuss related literature on disordered systems and singular SPDEs. A list of open questions is also provided.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential-in-volume tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lieb-Robinson bounds demonstrate the emergence of locality in many-body quantum systems. Intuitively, Lieb-Robinson bounds state that with local or exponentially decaying interactions, the correlation that can be built up between two sites separated by distance $r$ after a time $t$ decays as $\exp(vt-r)$, where $v$ is the emergent Lieb-Robinson velocity. In many problems, it is important to also capture how much of an operator grows to act on $r^d$ sites in $d$ spatial dimensions. Perturbation theory and cluster expansion methods suggest that at short times, these volume-filling operators are suppressed as $\exp(-r^d)$ at short times. We confirm this intuition, showing that for $r &gt; vt$, the volume-filling operator is suppressed by $\exp(-(r-vt)^d/(vt)^{d-1})$. This closes a conceptual and practical gap between the cluster expansion and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We then present two very different applications of this new bound. Firstly, we obtain improved bounds on the classical computational resources necessary to simulate many-body dynamics with error tolerance $\epsilon$ for any finite time $t$: as $\epsilon$ becomes sufficiently small, only $\epsilon^{-O(t^{d-1})}$ resources are needed. A protocol that likely saturates this bound is given. Secondly, we prove that disorder operators have volume-law suppression near the "solvable (Ising) point" in quantum phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking, which implies a new diagnostic for distinguishing many-body phases of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Schr\"odinger operators on domains with scaled resonant potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Schr\"odinger operators on a bounded, smooth domain of dimension $d \ge 2$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions and a properly scaled potential, which depends only on the distance to the boundary of the domain. Our aim is to analyse the convergence of these operators as the scaling parameter tends to zero. If the scaled potential is resonant, the limit in strong resolvent sense is a Robin Laplacian with boundary coefficient expressed in terms of the mean curvature of the boundary. A counterexample shows that norm resolvent convergence cannot hold in general in this setting. If the scaled potential is non-resonant and satisfies an explicit assumption on the smallness of the negative part, the limit in strong resolvent sense is the Dirichlet Laplacian. We conjecture that we can drop this additional assumption in the non-resonant case.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Probabilistic Dirichlet-to-Neumann Maps on Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps enable the coupling of multiphysics simulations across computational subdomains by ensuring continuity of state variables and fluxes at artificial interfaces. We present a novel method for learning Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on graphs using Gaussian processes, specifically for problems where the data obey a conservation constraint from an underlying partial differential equation. Our approach combines discrete exterior calculus and nonlinear optimal recovery to infer relationships between vertex and edge values. This framework yields data-driven predictions with uncertainty quantification across the entire graph, even when observations are limited to a subset of vertices and edges. By optimizing over the reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm while applying a maximum likelihood estimation penalty on kernel complexity, our method ensures that the resulting surrogate strictly enforces conservation laws without overfitting. We demonstrate our method on two representative applications: subsurface fracture networks and arterial blood flow. Our results show that the method maintains high accuracy and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates even under severe data scarcity, highlighting its potential for scientific applications where limited data and reliable uncertainty quantification are critical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lambert's problem is a classical boundary value problem in analytical mechanics. It arises when trying to determine the energy required to place a particle, subject to a central gravitational potential, in a "free fall" trajectory connecting two given points on a desired travel time. Due to its mathematical beauty and its relevance in aerospace engineering, it has been and remains the object of attention of countless engineers, mathematicians (pure and applied), and physicists seeking to produce efficient solution algorithms. In this expository article, didactic in nature, we present a unified and comprehensive derivation that assumes only a minimal background in physics and mathematics. We focus on the simplest unperturbed case and carefully develop the argument for elliptical trajectories. The goal is to provide a single reference that can serve as an accelerated introduction for students and researchers interested in a quick introduction to the subject.</description>

      <title>The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad problem and the geometry of CP maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation embodies a fundamental paradigm of the quantum theory of
  open systems, and the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generation theorem says precisely which superoperators can appear on its right-hand side. These are the generators of completely positive trace-preserving (or nonincreasing) semigroups. We prove a generalization, with time-dependent generator, as an application of an investigation of the geometry of the class of completely positive (CP) maps. The treatment of the finite-dimensional setting is based on a basis-free Choi-Jamio\l{}kowski type isomorphism. The infinite-dimensional case is bootstrapped from the finite-dimensional theory via a sequence of finite-dimensional approximations. Kraus decomposition is established along the way, in the guise of an extremal decomposition of the closed convex cone of CP maps. No appeal is made to results from the representation theory of operator algebras.</description>

      <title>Operator lift of Reshetikhin-Turaev formalism to Khovanov-Rozansky TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) is a powerful tool to describe homologies, which normally involve complexes and a variety of maps/morphisms, what makes a functional integration approach with a sum over a single kind of maps seemingly problematic. In TQFT this problem is overcame by exploiting the rich set of zero modes of BRST operators, which appear sufficient to describe complexes. We explain what this approach looks like for the important class of Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) cohomologies, which categorify the observables (Wilson lines or knot polynomials) in 3d Chern-Simons theory. We develop a construction of odd differential operators, associated with all link diagrams, including tangles with open ends. These operators become nilpotent only for diagram with no external legs, but even for open tangles one can develop a factorization formalism, which preserve Reidemeister/topological invariance -- the symmetry of the problem. This technique seems much more ``physical'' than conventional language of homological algebra and should have many applications to various problems beyond Chern-Simons theory. We also hope that this language will provide efficient algorithms, and finally allow to computerize the calculation of KR cohomologies -- for closed diagrams and for open tangles.</description>

      <title>The 2D Chern-Simons-Schr{\"o}dinger system reduced to 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a mean-field model for a system of 2D abelian anyons, given by the dynamics of a Schr{\"o}dinger matter field coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. We derive an effective 1D equation by adding a strongly anisotropic trapping potential (wave-guide) acting on the Schr{\"o}dinger field, and tracing out the tight confinement direction. The effective dynamics in the loose direction of the wave-guide turns out to be governed by the classical 1D quintic NLS equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the classical theory of spin structures, we develop a theory for lifting free C$^*$-dynamical systems, a.k.a. noncommutative principal bundles, along central extensions. This theory extends the bundle-theoretic notion of spin structures and yields a complete existence and classification result for such lifts. Using factor system techniques and Picard formalism, our approach introduces new invariants and obstruction classes, thereby unifying geometric, cohomological, and operator-algebraic perspectives. A range of examples demonstrates the scope of the theory.</description>

      <title>On Charge Conjugation, Correlations, Elitzur's Theorem and the Mass Gap Problem in Lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills Models in $d=4$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a four-dimensional Euclidean Wilson lattice Yang-Mills model with gauge group $SU(N)$, and the associated lattice Euclidean quantum field theory constructed by Osterwalder-Schrader-Seiler via a Feynman-Kac formula. In this model, to each lattice bond $b$ there is assigned a bond variable $U_b\in SU(N)$. Gluon fields are parameters in the Lie algebra of $SU(N)$. We define a charge conjugation operator $\mathcal C$ in the physical Hilbert space $H$ and prove that, for $N\not=2$, $H$ admits an orthogonal decomposition into two sectors with charge conjugation $\pm1$. There is only one sector for $N=2$. In the space of correlations, a charge conjugation operator $C_E$ is defined and a similar decomposition holds. Besides, a version of Elitzur's theorem is shown; applications are given. It is proven that the expectation averages of two distinct lattice vector potential correlators is zero. Surprisingly, the expectation of two distinct field strength tensors is also zero. In the gluon field parametrization it is known that Wilson action is bounded quadratically in the gluon fields. Towards solving the mass gap problem, in the gluon field expansion of the action, we show there are no local terms, such as a mass term. However, the action associated with the exponent of the exponentiated Haar measure density has a positive local mass term which is proportional to the square of the gauge coupling $\beta=g^{-2}&gt;0$ and the $SU(N)$ quadratic Casimir operator eigenvalue. Our results also hold in dimension three. Of course, the orthogonal decomposition of the Hilbert space $H$ has consequences in the analysis of the truncated two-point plaquette field correlation and the Yang-Mills mass gap problem: for $N\not=2$ and at least for small $\beta$, a multiplicity-two one-particle glueball state (two mass gaps) is expected to be present in the energy-momentum spectrum of the Yang-Mills model.</description>

      <title>Correlation Lengths for Stochastic Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general model of stochastically generated matrix product states (MPS) in which the local tensors share a common distribution and form a strictly stationary sequence, without requiring spatial independence. Under natural conditions on the associated transfer operators, we prove the existence of thermodynamic limits of expectations of local observables and establish almost-sure exponential decay of two-point correlations. In the homogeneous (random translation-invariant) case, for any error tolerance in probability, the two-point function decays exponentially in the distance between the two sites, with a deterministic rate. In the i.i.d. case, the exponential decay still holds with a deterministic rate, with the probability approaching one exponentially fast in the distance. For strictly stationary ensembles with decaying spatial dependence, the correlation decay quantitatively reflects the mixing profile: ($\rho$)-mixing yields polynomial bounds with high probability, while stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay in ($\rho$) (resp. ($\beta$)) yields stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay of the two-point function, again with correspondingly strong high-probability guarantees. Altogether, the framework unifies and extends recent progress on stationary ergodic and Gaussian translation-invariant ensembles, providing a transfer-operator route to typical correlation decay in random MPS.</description>

      <title>Burau representation, Squier's form, and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a frequency-tunable, two-dimensional non-Abelian control of operation order constructed from the reduced Burau representation of the braid group $B_3$, specialised at $t=e^{i\omega}$ and unitarized by Squier's Hermitian form. Coupled to two non-commuting qubit unitaries $A$, $B$, the resulting switch admits a closed expression for the single-shot Helstrom success probability and a fixed-order ceiling $p_{\mathrm{fixed}}$, defining the fixed-order ceiling $p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$ and the witness gaps $\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)=p_{\mathrm{switch}}(\omega)-p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$ and $\Delta_{\rm test}(\omega)=p_{\mathrm{test}}(\omega)-p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$.
  The non-Abelian mixers can either enhance or suppress the bare switch advantage, which we quantify by the interference contrast $\Delta_{\rm int}(\omega):=\Delta_{\rm test}(\omega)-\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)=p_{\rm test}(\omega)-p_{\rm switch}(\omega)$. Across the Squier positivity region, $\Delta_{\rm int}(\omega)$ takes both positive (constructive) and negative (destructive) values, a hallmark of matrix-valued (non-Abelian) order control, while $\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)&gt;0$ certifies algebraic causal non-separability.
  Numerical simulations confirm both enhancement and suppression regimes, establishing a minimal $B_3$ braid control that reproduces the characteristic interference pattern expected from a \emph{Gedankenexperiment} in anyonic statistics.</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of Turbulence as Diffusion in Loop Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly nonlinear dynamics, from fluid turbulence to quantum chromodynamics, have long constituted some of the most challenging problems in theoretical physics. This review describes a unified theoretical framework, the loop space calculus, which offers an analytical approach to these problems. The central idea is a shift in perspective from pointwise fields to integrated loop observables, a transformation that recasts the governing nonlinear equations into a universal linear diffusion equation in the space of loops. This framework, supported by recent mathematical analysis, is analytically solvable and yields an exact, parameter-free solution for decaying hydrodynamic turbulence -- the Euler ensemble -- which is shown to be dual to a solvable string theory. The theory's predictions include: (i) the unification of spatial and temporal scaling laws, governed by two related, infinite spectra of intermittency and decay exponents derived from the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function; (ii) a first-order phase transition in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence; and (iii) the formation of quantized, concentric shells in passive scalar mixing. The theory also predicts log-periodic oscillations in correlation functions -- effects not captured by standard phenomenology -- for which there is now emerging evidence from high-precision turbulence experiments. The appearance of identical mathematical structures as solutions to the turbulent regime of Yang-Mills gradient flow points to the broad applicability of this approach. The framework also yields a new type of analytic Hodge-dual matrix surface that solves the Yang-Mills fixed-point loop equation by harmonic map, opening the way for a geometric formulation of QCD string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review our joint work on the scaling limits of disordered systems, linking the notion of disorder relevance/irrelevance to that of sub/super-criticality of singular SPDEs. This line of research culminated in the construction of the Critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF), a universal process which provides a non-trivial solution to the Stochastic Heat Equation in dimension 2, a critical singular SPDE that lies beyond the reach of existing solution theories. The SHF also offers a rare example of a non-Gaussian scaling limit for a disordered system at its phase transition point in the critical dimension.</description>

      <title>On the Virasoro Crossing Kernels at Rational Central Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report novel analytic results for the Virasoro modular and fusion kernels relevant to 2d conformal field theories (CFTs), 3d topological field theories (TQFTs), and the representation theory of certain quantum groups. For all rational values of the parameter $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ -- corresponding in 2d CFT to all rational central charge values in the domain $(-\infty,1]\cup[25,\infty)$ -- we establish two main results. First, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{[25,\infty)}$ we show that the modular and fusion kernels derived by Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov respectively can be expressed as a linear combination of two functions, which (i) are themselves admissible crossing kernels, (ii) have square-root branch point singularities in the Liouville momenta, (iii) are not reflection-symmetric in the Liouville momenta. These features illustrate that the space of solutions to the basic shift relations determining these kernels is broader than previously assumed. Second, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ we derive for the first time the physical modular and fusion kernels for generic values of the Liouville momenta. These can again be written as a linear combination of two other admissible kernels but overall, and unlike the Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov solutions for $c\geq 25$, they possess square-root branch point singularities. As a corollary, we demonstrate that timelike Liouville theory at $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ is crossing symmetric and modular covariant. Surprisingly, the crossing kernels at any $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ behave as if they were semiclassical and one-loop exact, and we discuss the interpretation of this fact in the context of the 2d conformal bootstrap and the 3d TQFT that captures pure 3d gravity with negative cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation for 1-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations with nonzero random drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the wave propagation for a reaction-diffusion equation on the real line, with a random drift and Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscounov (FKPP) type nonlinear reaction. We show that when the average drift is positive, the asymptotic wave fronts propagating to the positive and negative directions are both pushed in the negative direction, leading to the possibility that both wave fronts propagate toward negative infinity. Our proof is based on the Large Deviations Principle for diffusion processes in random environments, as well as an analysis of the Feynman-Kac formula. Such probabilistic arguments also reveal the underlying physical mechanism of the wave fronts formation: the drift acts as an external field that shifts the (quenched) free-energy reference level without altering the intrinsic fluctuation structure of the system.</description>

      <title>Geometry is Wavy: Curvature Wave Equations for Generic Affine Connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometry is wavy: even at the purely geometric level (no particular theory chosen), curvature satisfies a covariant quasilinear wave equation. In Riemannian geometry equipped with the Levi-Civita connection, the Riemann curvature tensor obeys a wave equation of the schematic form \[ \Box Riem=\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem), \] where $\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem)$ denotes the terms quadratic in the curvature arising from the Bianchi identities. In this work, we generalize this curvature wave equation to spacetimes endowed with a generic affine connection possessing torsion and nonmetricity. Working within the metric-affine framework, we derive the corresponding wave equation for the Riemann tensor and analyze its structure in several geometrically and physically distinguished settings, including Einstein spaces, teleparallel gravity, and Einstein-Cartan theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently established spectral Favard theorem for bounded banded matrices admitting a positive bidiagonal factorization is applied to a broader class of Markov chains with bounded banded transition matrices, extending beyond the classical birth-and-death setting, to those that allow a positive stochastic bidiagonal factorization. In the finite case, the Karlin-McGregor spectral representation is derived. The recurrence of the Markov chain is established, and explicit formulas for the stationary distributions are provided in terms of orthogonal polynomials. Analogous results are obtained for the countably infinite case. In this setting, the chain is not necessarily recurrent, and its behavior is characterized in terms of the associated spectral measure. Finally, ergodicity is examined through the presence of a mass at $1$ in the spectral measure, corresponding to the eigenvalue $1$ with both right and left eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>Unbounded banded matrices with positive bidiagonal factorization and mixed-type multiple orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spectral Favard theorem is proved for semi-infinite banded matrices admitting a positive bidiagonal factorization, without assuming boundedness of the associated operator, thus covering both the bounded and unbounded settings. The result yields a matrix-valued spectral measure and an explicit spectral representation of the matrix powers in terms of the associated mixed-type multiple orthogonal polynomials. The argument follows the constructive truncation scheme: principal truncations are oscillatory, hence have simple positive spectra, and a suitable choice of initial conditions ensures positivity of the Christoffel coefficients and of the resulting discrete matrix-valued measures supported at the truncation eigenvalues. The main difficulty is the passage to the limit of these discrete measures beyond the bounded case. This is resolved by combining the available Gaussian quadrature structure with a Helly-type compactness argument, leading to a limiting matrix-valued measure and completing the spectral theorem. The role of normality (maximal degree pattern) for the mixed-type families is also addressed.</description>

Abstract: The General Lagrangian Mean (GLM) theory uses a version of the averaged equations of fluid dynamics, designed to examine interactions between small-amplitude waves and mean flows. These equations are formulated in coordinates following the fluid's average velocity and are often referred to as `pseudo-Lagrangian'. This paper focuses on the principles for deriving the GLM equations, using an inviscid, incompressible, homogeneous fluid as a demonstration case. Our exposition methodically differs from others and is aimed at the learners of this theory.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a defining signature and resource of quantum theory, but its standard definition presupposes a globally fixed decomposition into subsystems. We develop a geometric framework that detects when such a decomposition cannot be globalized for twisted families of pure-state spaces. Using Severi--Brauer schemes associated to Azumaya algebras over a base scheme, we study pure-state entanglement in families of projective state spaces that are locally trivial but globally twisted. For a given factorization type, we show that the existence of a global locus of product states is equivalent to a reduction of the underlying projective linear torsor to the stabilizer of the corresponding Segre variety, so entanglement in families becomes a geometric obstruction to globalizing subsystem structure.
  We construct the moduli space of subsystem structures, identify it with a natural torsor quotient, and realize it as a locally closed locus in the relative Hilbert scheme, yielding a canonical compactification by degenerations of product-state loci. In the bipartite case, once a subsystem structure is chosen, the Schmidt-rank stratification globalizes to a flat filtration with base-change compatible incidence resolutions and fiberwise constant numerical invariants. We complement this with Brauer-theoretic constraints and explicit examples showing that reducibility can depend on the underlying torsor rather than only on the Brauer class, with an interpretation via entangling monodromy.</description>

      <title>The properad of quadratic Poisson structures is Koszul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we suggest a sufficient condition on the properadic envelope of a quadratic dioperad to be Koszul in terms of twisted associative algebras.
  As a particular new example, we show that the properad of quadratic Poisson structures is Koszul.</description>

      <title>On the escape rate for intermittent maps with holes shrinking around the indifferent fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-uniformly expanding maps of the unit interval with a parabolic fixed point at the origin that admit an ergodic absolutely continuous invariant measure, which may be finite or infinite. By introducing a hole defined by an interval containing the parabolic fixed point, we analyze the escape rate of the resulting open system and its asymptotic behavior as the hole shrinks. Our approach relies on the transfer operator associated with the dynamical system and on the relationship between the transfer operators of the original system and its induced version. The results extend to this general framework previous investigations which considered special cases.</description>
