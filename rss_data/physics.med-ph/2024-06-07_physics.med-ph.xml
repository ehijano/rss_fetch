      <title>Anatomy-based quality metric of diffusion-weighted MRI data for accurate derivation of muscle fiber orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is used to quantitatively characterize the microscopic structure of soft tissue due to the anisotropic diffusion of water in muscle. Applications such as fiber tractography or modeling of tumor spread in soft tissue require precise detection of muscle fiber orientation, which is derived from the principal eigenvector of the diffusion tensor. For clinical applications, high image quality and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of DW-MRI for fiber orientation must be balanced with an appropriate scan duration. Muscles with known structural heterogeneity, e.g. bipennate muscles such as the thigh rectus femoris, provide a natural quality benchmark to determine fiber orientation at different scan parameters. Here, we analyze DW-MR images of the thigh of a healthy volunteer at different SNRs and use PCA to identify subsets of voxels with different directions of diffusion tensor eigenvectors. We propose to use the mixing index of spatial co-localization of the clustered eigenvectors as a quality metric for fiber orientation detection. Comparing acquisitions at different SNRs, we find that high SNR results in a low mixing index, reflecting a clear separation of the two compartments of the bipennate muscle on either side of the central tendon. Because the mixing index allows joint estimation of spatial and directional noise in DW-MRI as a single parameter, it will allow future quantitative optimization of DW-MRI protocols for soft tissue.</description>

      <title>Optical biomarker of metabolism for breast tumor diagnosis: Insights from subcellular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label-free metabolic dynamics contrast is highly appealing but difficult to achieve in biomedical imaging. Interference offers a highly sensitive mechanism for capturing the metabolic dynamics of the subcellular scatterers. However, traditional interference detection methods fail to isolate pure metabolic dynamics, as the dynamic signals are coupled with scatterer reflectivity and other uncontrollable imaging factors. Here, we demonstrate active phase modulation-assisted dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography (APMD-FFOCT) that decouples and quantifies the metabolic dynamics by adding a reference movement for all interferential scatterers. This novel technique enables imaging and dynamic analysis of subcellular structures along with their changes during the apoptotic process in tumor tissues. Furthermore, the nucleus-to-cytoplasm dynamic intensity ratio could serve as an optical biomarker for breast tumor grading, enhancing intraoperative diagnosis.</description>

      <title>3D Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography for Musculoskeletal Tissue Assessment Under Compressive Load: A Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given its real-time capability to quantify mechanical tissue properties, ultrasound shear wave elastography holds significant promise in clinical musculoskeletal imaging. However, existing shear wave elastography methods fall short in enabling full-limb analysis of 3D anatomical structures under diverse loading conditions, and may introduce measurement bias due to sonographer-applied force on the transducer. These limitations pose numerous challenges, particularly for 3D computational biomechanical tissue modeling in areas like prosthetic socket design. In this feasibility study, a clinical linear ultrasound transducer system with integrated shear wave elastography capabilities was utilized to scan both a calibrated phantom and human limbs in a water tank imaging setup. By conducting 2D and 3D scans under varying compressive loads, this study demonstrates the feasibility of volumetric ultrasound shear wave elastography of human limbs. Our preliminary results showcase a potential method for evaluating 3D spatially varying tissue properties, offering future extensions to computational biomechanical modeling of tissue for various clinical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Collateral Supply with Local-AIF Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI Predicts Infarct Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ischemic stroke, leptomeningeal collaterals can provide compensatory blood flow to tissue at risk despite an occlusion, and impact treatment response and infarct growth. The purpose of this work is to test the hypothesis that local perfusion with an appropriate Local Arterial Input Function (AIF) is needed to quantify the degree of collateral blood supply in tissue distal to an occlusion. Seven experiments were conducted in a pre-clinical middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Magnetic resonance dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) was imaged and post-processed as cerebral blood flow maps with both a traditionally chosen single arterial input function (AIF) applied globally to the whole brain (i.e. "Global-AIF") and a novel automatic delay and dispersion corrected AIF (i.e. "Local AIF") that is sensitive to retrograde flow. Pial collateral recruitment was assessed from x-ray angiograms and infarct growth via serially acquired diffusion weighted MRI scans both blinded to DSC. The degree of collateralization at x-ray correlated strongly with quantitative perfusion determined using the Local AIF in the ischemic penumbra (R2=0.81) compared to a traditionally chosen Global-AIF (R2=0.05). Quantitative perfusion calculated using a Local-AIF was negatively correlated (less infarct progression as local perfusion increased) with infarct growth (R2 = 0.79) compared to Global-AIF (R2=0.02). Local DSC perfusion with a Local-AIF is more accurate for assessing tissue status and degree of leptomeningeal collateralization than traditionally chosen AIFs. These findings support use of a Local-AIF in determining quantitative tissue perfusion with collateral supply in occlusive disease.</description>

      <title>An automated pipeline for computation and analysis of functional ventilation and perfusion lung MRI with matrix pencil decomposition: TrueLung</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18275v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To introduce and evaluate TrueLung, an automated pipeline for computation and analysis of free-breathing and contrast-agent free pulmonary functional MRI.
  Material and Methods: time-resolved ultra-fast bSSFP acquisitions are transferred to TrueLung, which includes image quality checks, image registration, and computation of perfusion and ventilation maps with matrix pencil decomposition. Neural network whole-lung and lobar segmentations allow quantification of impaired relative perfusion (RQ) and fractional ventilation (RFV). TrueLung delivers functional maps and quantitative outcomes, reported for clinicians in concise documents. We evaluated the pipeline in 75 cystic fibrosis children. Whole-lung and lobar segmentations were manually refined when necessary, and the impact on RQ and RFV was quantified.
  Results: Functional imaging was performed at 7.9 $\pm$ 1.8 (mean $\pm$ SD) coronal slice positions per patient, totaling on average 6min 20s scan time per patient. The whole pipeline required 20min calculation time per subject. TrueLung delivered the functional maps of all the subjects for radiological assessment. Quality controlling maps and segmentations lasted 1min 12s per patient. The automated segmentations and quantification of whole-lung defects were satisfying in 88% of patients (97% of slices) and the lobar quantification in 73% (93% of slices). The segmentations refinements required 16s per patient for the whole-lung, and 2min 10s for the lobe masks. The relative differences in RFV and RQ between fully-automated and manually refined data were marginal.
  Conclusions: TrueLung quickly delivers functional maps and quantitative outcomes in an objective and standardized way, suitable for radiological and pneumological assessment with minimal manual input. TrueLung can be used for clinical research in cystic fibrosis and might be applied across various lung diseases.</description>

      <title>Designing the system to measure the depth-dose profile of a proton beam using CsI(Tl) scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the standard CsI(Tl) scintillator was used to determine the characteristics of a proton beam. By irradiating the scintillator with a proton beam, it was able to subsequently measure the emitted light using a spectrometer. This work presents the dose response of a scintillator and its use to measure the depth-dose profile of a proton beam. The measurement of the dose response showed that the emission light of the scintillator depended on the total dose of the proton beam. For the design of the depth-dose measurement, the setup of the water phantom included a scintillator and a water tank. The depth-dose profile was determined through varying the water depth at various positions along the path of the proton beam until the end of the Bragg peak region. To compare the measured depth-dose profile, the deposited energy was simulated and fitted Birks constant for collecting quenching. Furthermore, the recommended measurement design suggested using a thin scintillator, as it resulted in a narrower shape of the depth-dose profile. Based on experiment and simulation data, a standard CsI(Tl) scintillator was promising for determining the characteristic proton beam.</description>
