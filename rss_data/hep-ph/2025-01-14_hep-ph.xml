      <title>Dynamics of Heavy Quarks in Strongly Coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the probability distribution $P({\bf k})$ for a heavy quark with velocity $v$ propagating through strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma in the 't Hooft limit at a temperature $T$ to acquire a momentum ${\bf k}$ due to interactions with the plasma. This distribution encodes the well-known drag coefficient $\eta_D$ and the transverse and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients $\kappa_T$ and $\kappa_L$. Furthermore, our calculation determines all of the higher order and mixed moments to leading order in $1/\sqrt{\lambda}$ for the first time. These non-Gaussian features of $P({\bf k})$ include qualitatively novel correlations between longitudinal energy loss and transverse momentum broadening at nonzero $v$. We demonstrate that these non-Gaussian characteristics can be sizable in magnitude and even dominant in physically relevant situations. We use these results to derive a Kolmogorov equation for the evolution of the probability distribution for the total momentum of a heavy quark that propagates through strongly coupled plasma. This evolution equation accounts for all higher order correlations between transverse momentum broadening and longitudinal energy loss, which we have calculated from first principles. It reduces to a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation when truncated to only include the effects of $\eta_D$, $\kappa_T$ and $\kappa_L$. Remarkably, while heavy quarks do not reach kinetic equilibrium with the plasma if evolved with this FP equation, we demonstrate that heavy quarks do reach kinetic equilibrium if evolved with the all-order Kolmogorov equation we have derived. Our results thus provide a dynamically complete framework for understanding the thermalization of a heavy quark that may be initially far from equilibrium in the strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma -- as well as new insight into heavy quark transport and equilibration in quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Probing axion and muon-philic new physics with muon beam dump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy muon beam dump experiments are powerful probes of new physics models beyond the Standard Model, particularly those involving muon-philic interactions. In this study, we place constraints on three new physics models utilizing data from the recent NA64$\mu$ experiment: (1) axions coupling to photons, (2) axions coupling to muons, and (3) a muon-philic dark sector mediated by a massless $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge boson. A key signature of these models is the significant missing energy from the production of new particles that either escape the downstream detectors or decay between them. We find that the current NA64$\mu$ data do not yet probe new parameter region on axion-photon coupling. For muon-philic axions, the current NA64$\mu$ data can exclude new parameter space for the axion-muon coupling $g_{a\mu\mu}\gtrsim4\times10^{-3}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and the axion mass $m_a\lesssim 0.2$ GeV. For a muon-philic dark sector, the current data provide stringent constraints that surpass existing ones by nearly one order of magnitude. The data from 2023 NA64$\mu$ run, once available, will be capable of excluding new axion-photon coupling parameter space and examine the axion explanation of muon $g-2$ deviation, with more sensitivity advancement expected in near future runs.</description>

      <title>The impact of memory-burdened primordial black holes on high-scale leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of the back-reaction of evaporation on the quantum state of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), known as ``memory burden", on the baryon asymmetry production in the Universe through high-scale leptogenesis. Focusing on PBH masses ranging from 1 to 1000 grams, we investigate the interplay between the non-thermal production of heavy sterile neutrinos and the entropy injection within this non-standard cosmological framework. By assuming appropriate values for the memory-burden parameters, $q=1/2$ and $k=1$, we derive mutual exclusion limits between PBHs and thermal leptogenesis in the mixed parameter space. Our analysis reveals that the primary contribution of PBHs to baryon asymmetry stems from entropy injection. Indeed, we find that, differently from earlier studies based on the semi-classical Hawking evaporation, the memory-burden effect suppresses the non-thermal source term in the PBH mass range explored. This has significant implications for understanding baryogenesis in such alternative cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{\mu}$-Hybrid Inflation and Metastable Cosmic Strings in $\mathbf{SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a scenario based on $\mu$-hybrid inflation within the framework of a left-right symmetric model defined by the gauge symmetry group $G_{3221} = SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$. This model features a two-stage symmetry breaking to the Standard Model, with inflation occurring between the two stages, resulting in the dilution of primordial monopoles produced during the symmetry breaking of $SU(2)_R$ to $U(1)_R$. The second symmetry breaking gives rise to a network of metastable cosmic strings, which produces gravitational waves that can be observed by current and future experiments. A crucial aspect of this model is the inclusion of $R$-symmetry breaking terms in the superpotential, which helps explain the origin of the first symmetry breaking scale and ensures experimentally viable inflation with a minimal (canonical) K\"ahler potential. We show that the model successfully implements consistent inflation, leptogenesis, metastable cosmic strings, and gravitino dark matter, all in agreement with the observational data and constraints on reheating temperature from leptogenesis and gravitino overproduction bounds. We explore the potential embedding of $G_{3221}$ within the gauge symmetry $G_{422} = SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$, and provide a brief discussion on the proton decay predictions, which can be tested by the upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Coherent dynamics of flavor mode entangled neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the lynchpin of all quantum correlations, quantum coherence is fundamental for distinguishing quantum systems from classical ones and is essential for realizing quantum advantages in areas such as computation, communication, and metrology. In this study, we investigate the relationship between quantum coherence and neutrino oscillations by mapping the neutrino state as a multi-mode quantum system into qubit and qutrit frameworks. Our analysis extends beyond the commonly used $l_1$-norm and relative entropy of coherence to include all relevant measures of coherence such as robustness of coherence, coherence concurrence, trace-norm distance measure of coherence, coherence of formation, Schatten-$p$-norm-based functionals, geometric coherence and logarithmic coherence rank, each offering unique insights into the quantum correlations in these systems. Notably, while the $l_1$-norm and relative entropy-based measures apply to general quantum states, the other measures are particularly relevant for entangled systems, highlighting the critical role of entanglement in neutrino oscillations. We present a detailed methodology for calculating coherence measures in both two-flavor and three-flavor mixing scenarios, contributing to a deeper understanding of how quantum coherence manifests and evolves in mode-entangled neutrino systems. Our findings emphasize the potential of these systems as robust candidates for quantum information tasks, facilitated by the weak interaction nature of neutrinos.</description>

      <title>The Instantaneous Breit Equation with an Application to Charmonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution of the Breit equation with an instantaneous potential for the case of two spin-1/2 particles in a pseudoscalar bound state is considered. This is then applied to charmonium using a potential of the Cornell type. The masses of the two JP = 0^- states below charm threshold are calculated in this model. We allow different mixtures of the Lorentz nature (vector or scalar) of the linear confining term and investigate the effect of these on the bound-state energies. Some general comments are made on the issue of how the bound nature of these states depends on the vector-scalar mix.</description>

      <title>Quark flavor equilibration of the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early stage of a heavy-ion collision is marked by rapid entropy production and the transition from a gluon saturated initial condition to a plasma of quarks and gluons that evolves hydrodynamically. However, during the early times of the hydrodynamic evolution, the chemical composition of the QCD medium is still largely unknown. We present a study of quark chemical equilibration in the (Q)GP using a novel model of viscous hydrodynamic evolution in partial chemical equilibrium. Motivated by the success of gluon saturated initial condition models, we initialize the QCD medium as a completely gluon dominated state. Local quark production during the hydrodynamic phase is then simulated through the evolution of time-dependent fugacities for each independent quark flavor, with the timescales set as free parameters to compare different rates of equilibration. We present the results of complete heavy-ion collision simulations using this partial chemical equilibrium model, and show the effects on hadronic and electromagnetic observables. In particular, we show that the development of flow is sensitive to the equilibration timescale, providing an empirical way to probe the chemical equilibration of the QCD medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we studied line operators in the Left-Right Symmetric Model. The gauge group of Left-Right Symmetric Electroweak Model is ${G} = SU(3) \times SU(2)_{L} \times SU(2)_{R} \times U(1)_{B - L}$. We derived the spectrum of line operators in all possible scenarios within left-right symmetric models. We then studied the $\theta$ angles in left-right symmetric model. We also discuss the effect of symmetry breaking on the spectrum of line operators and $\theta$ angles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an extended and more complete version of the primary QCD nucleation model presented in Ref. [1], the new model introduces explicitly the transition balance and formulates it in both macroscopic and microscopic descriptions. The microscopic description of the transition balance in QCD nucleation is implemented in a kinetic parton cascade model and tested for a first-order phase transition from gluons to pions in a one-dimensional expansion with Bjorken boost invariance.</description>

      <title>Very Special Relativity in Accelerated Frames: Non-relativistic Effects in Gravitational Spectroscopy of Ultracold Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenology of fermionic systems in uniform gravitational fields within the framework of Very Special Relativity (VSR). We especially focus on the case of gravitational spectroscopy with ultracold neutrons, explored in experiments like \emph{q}\textsc{Bounce}. Calculating the leading ($c^0$) and next-to-leading ($c^{-1}$) order corrections to the non-relativistic Hamiltonian in an accelerated frame, we derive the fermionic perturbed energy spectrum. At leading order, we do not find new non-trivial modifications, apart from a mass shift, confirming both the equivalence between inertial and gravitational mass and particle-antiparticle sectors. The next-to-leading order, instead, introduces time-dependent anisotropic contributions depending on the preferred spatial direction from VSR, which can then be used to probe novel Lorentz-violating signatures. Using \emph{q}\textsc{Bounce} sensitivity as a benchmark, we suggest a first rough constraint for these effects. Finally, we propose alternative spin-flipping setups to better probe VSR signatures and foresee potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>The strength of the interaction between quarks and gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern particle physics experiments, e.g. at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, crucially depend on the precise description of the scattering processes in terms of the known fundamental forces. This is limited by our current understanding of the strong nuclear force, as quantified by the strong coupling, $\alpha_s$, between quarks and gluons. Relating $\alpha_s$ to experiments poses a major challenge as the strong interactions lead to the confinement of quarks and gluons inside hadronic bound states. At high energies, however, the strong interactions become weaker ("asymptotic freedom") and thus amenable to an expansion in powers of the coupling. Attempts to relate both regimes usually rely on modeling of the bound state problem in one way or another. Using large scale numerical simulations of a first principles formulation of Quantum Chromodynamics on a space-time lattice, we have carried out a model-independent determination of $\alpha_s$ with unprecedented precision. The uncertainty, about half that of all other results combined, originates predominantly from the statistical Monte Carlo evaluation and has a clear probabilistic interpretation. The result for $\alpha_s$ describes a variety of physical phenomena over a wide range of energy scales. If used as input information, it will enable significantly improved analyses of many high energy experiments, by removing an important source of theoretical uncertainty. This will increase the likelihood to uncover small effects of yet unknown physics, and enable stringent precision tests of the Standard Model. In summary, this result boosts the discovery potential of the LHC and future colliders, and the methods developed in this work pave the way for even higher precision in the future.</description>

      <title>Precise measurement of CP violating $\tau$ EDM through $e^+ e^- \to \gamma^*, \psi(2s) \to \tau^+ \tau^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonzero electric dipole moment of a tauon, $d_\tau$, signals CP violation and provides an important probe for new physics. We study methods to measure $d_\tau$ at low energy $e^+ e^-$ colliders through the processes $e^+e^- \to \gamma^*, \psi(2S) \to \tau^+\tau^-$ with $\tau^\pm$ decays into a charged hadron and a tau neutrino. We point out that, with measuring energies of the charged hadron, Im$(d_\tau)$ can be measured. On the other hand, selecting events of $\tau$ decays after traveling more than the detector resolution distance, Re$(d_\tau)$ can also be determined. We find that the precision at Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) running at the center energy of $m_{\psi (2S)}$ for 10 year data accumulation, the precision of Im$(d_\tau)$ and Re$(d_\tau)$ are found to be 3.5 and 11 in unit of $10^{-18}~e\,\text{cm}$, respectively. The sensitivity for $d_\tau$ measurement precision at the STCF can be reached its optimum at a central energy of $6.3~\text{GeV}$, achieving a precision of $1.3$ for Im$(d_\tau)$ and $2.9$ for Re$(d_\tau)$ in unit of $ 10^{-18}~e\,\text{cm}$.</description>

      <title>Tagging ultra-boosted jets at FCC-hh using machine learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Future Circular Hadron Collider (FCC-hh) will probe unprecedented energy regimes, enabling direct searches for new elementary particles at a scale of tens of TeV. FCC-hh is currently in the planning stage, and one of its primary physics goals is to search for physics beyond the Standard Model by exploring a previously inaccessible kinematic domain. While venturing into uncharted high-energy territories promises excitement, reconstructing objects with enormous transverse momenta will require overcoming major experimental challenges. This work investigates the identification of boosted $W$ bosons and boosted top quarks in the context of three beyond the Standard Model scenarios: heavy vector-like quark ($B'$), heavy neutral gauge boson ($Z'$), and heavy neutral Higgs boson ($H$). We employ machine learning techniques, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), to identify these ultra-boosted objects in the collider from their SM background counterpart. We evaluate the performance of these techniques in distinguishing $W$ jets and top jets from QCD jets at extremely high transverse momenta ($p_{T}$) values, demonstrating their potential for future FCC-hh analyses.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal leading-twist distribution amplitude of $^1P_1$-state $b_1(1235)$-meson and its implications on $B\to b_1(1235)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we derive the $\xi$-moments $\langle\xi_{2;b_1}^{n;\|}\rangle$ of the longitudinal leading-twist distribution amplitude $\phi_{2;b_1}^{\|}$ for $^1P_1$-state $b_1(1235)$-meson by using the QCD sum rules under the background field theory. Considering the contributions from the vacuum condensates up to dimension-six, its first two non-zero $\xi$-moments at the scale 1 GeV are $\langle\xi_{2;b_1}^{1;\|}\rangle= -0.647^{+0.118}_{-0.113}$ and $\langle\xi_{2;b_1}^{3;\|}\rangle = -0.328^{+0.055}_{-0.052}$, respectively. Using those moments, we then fix the Gegenbauer expansion series of $\phi_{2;b_1}^{\|}$ and apply it to calculate $B\to b_1(1235)$ transition form factors (TFFs) that are derived by using the QCD light-cone sum rules. Those TFFs are then extrapolated to the physically allowable $q^2$-range via the simplified series expansion. As for the branching fractions, we obtain ${\cal B}(\bar B^0 \to b_1^+(1235)e^- \bar\nu_e) = 2.179^{+0.553}_{-0.422}\times 10^{-4}$, ${\cal B}(B^0 \to b_1^-(1235)\mu^+\nu_\mu) = 2.166^{+0.544}_{-0.415}\times 10^{-4}$, ${\cal B}(B^+ \to b_1^0(1235)e^+\nu_e) = 2.353^{+0.597}_{-0.456}\times 10^{-4}$, and ${\cal B}(B^+ \to b_1^0(1235)\mu^+\nu_\mu) = 2.339^{+0.587}_{-0.448}\times 10^{-4}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Direct CP violation in $\bar B_{s} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-} K^{+}K^{-}$ decay process induced by interferences of the intermediate vector particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate CP violation in the decay process $\bar B_{s} \rightarrow V V \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}K^{+}K^{-}$ within the framework of perturbative QCD, where V represents vector mesons $\phi$, $\rho$, and $\omega$. We analyze the mixing mechanism among $\phi-\rho^{0}-\omega$ and provide amplitudes for these decay processes. Moreover, we explore CP violation in the four-body decay process of $\bar{B}_{s}^{0} \rightarrow K^{+} K^{-} K^{+} K^{-}$ involving intermediate vector mesons and their mixing. Notably, significant CP violation is observed for specific two-vector meson intermediate states. Additionally, a substantial amount of CP violation arises from vector mixing when the invariant mass of $K^{+}K^{-}$ falls within a certain range. This study holds potential implications for future detection by the LHC experiment.</description>

      <title>Signals for a 2HDM with $Z'$ at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a neutrinophilic $U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model (SM) under which only a second Higgs doublet and SM singlet scalars and fermions are charged. The new gauge boson $Z'$ couples to SM minimally, generated by $Z-Z'$ mixing. As the $Z'$ is very weakly coupled, it can mostly be produced through the decay of the scalars from the second Higgs doublet at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We discuss the scalar sector of the model in detail and consider decay modes such as $(H^{\pm} \to W^\pm Z', h_2 \to VV, (V = W^\pm, Z, Z'), A_2 \to h_1 Z'(Z))$ that lead to multilepton signals at the LHC from the pair production of the scalars. We analyze the signal with a representative value of the $Z'$ mass to show the discovery potential of the 2HDM scalars at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Systematic uncertainties from higher-twist corrections in DIS at large $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the systematic uncertainties and potential biases arising from the inclusion of large-$x$ corrections to proton and deuteron DIS data in global QCD analyses. Using the CTEQ-JLab framework, we examine various approaches to implementing higher-twist corrections in nucleon structure functions and off-shell PDF modifications in deuteron targets. We analyze how these components interact and influence the determination of the $d$-quark PDF and the neutron structure function at large $x$. We find that it is very important to consider isospin-dependent higher-twist corrections in order to minimize implementation biases in the extracted quantities.</description>

Abstract: Quarks and leptons, the fundamental building blocks of the subatomic world, manifest in three families - replicas with identical quantum numbers that differ only in their masses. After revisiting the key milestones that led to the discovery of this peculiar structure, a non-technical overview is presented of the main attempts to explain its origin and trace it back to an as-yet-unknown fundamental principle.</description>

      <title>Constraint on the magnetic field for the stable strange quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasiparticle model is employed to investigate the quark matter at finite chemical potential. The effective bag constant is derived to be dependent on both the chemical potential and the magnetic field. The self-consistent thermodynamics is fulfilled that the free energy minimum corresponds to the zero pressure. It is shown that the strong magnetic field is helpful for the stabilization of the strange quark matter. However, the increase in the coupling constant and the vacuum bag constant could reduce the stability. For the absolutely stable strange quark matter, there is a lower limit of the allowed magnetic field, which rises with the increase in the coupling constant and the vacuum bag constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nuclear modification and the universality of short-range correlation (SRC) in pion-induced Drell-Yan process. Employing nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and pion PDFs, the ratio of differential cross sections of different nuclei relative to the free nucleon is presented. A kind of universal modification function was proposed which would provide nontrivial tests of SRC universality on the platform of pion-induced Drell-Yan. This work improves our understanding of nuclear structure and strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Inferring Interpretable Models of Fragmentation Functions using Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is rapidly making its path into natural sciences, including high-energy physics. We present the first study that infers, directly from experimental data, a functional form of fragmentation functions. The latter represent a key ingredient to describe physical observables measured in high-energy physics processes that involve hadron production, and predict their values at different energy. Fragmentation functions can not be calculated in theory and have to be determined instead from data. Traditional approaches rely on global fits of experimental data using a pre-assumed functional form inspired from phenomenological models to learn its parameters. This novel approach uses a ML technique, namely symbolic regression, to learn an analytical model from measured charged hadron multiplicities. The function learned by symbolic regression resembles the Lund string function and describes the data well, thus representing a potential candidate for use in global FFs fits. This study represents an approach to follow in such QCD-related phenomenology studies and more generally in sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient-flow formalism is applied to a non-Abelian gauge theory with scalar and fermionic particles, dubbed "scalar QCD". It is shown that the flowed scalar quark requires a field renormalization, albeit only beyond the one-loop level. A pseudo-physical, t-dependent renormalization scheme is defined, and the corresponding renormalization constant is evaluated at the two-loop level. We also calculate the gluon action density as well as the condensate of the scalar and the fermionic quark at three-loop level in this theory. The results validate the consistency of the gradient-flow formalism in this theory and provide a further step towards applying the gradient-flow formalism to the full Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHC is not only the most powerful collider built to date but also the source of an intense beam of the most energetic neutrinos ever produced by humankind. After nearly 15 years of LHC operation, these neutrinos have been observed for the first time by the FASER and SND@LHC experiments. This breakthrough marks the dawn of a new field: collider neutrino physics. Further neutrino measurements at the LHC will offer novel opportunities to advance neutrino physics, constrain the strong interaction in uncharted kinematic regimes, provide critical input for addressing outstanding questions in astroparticle physics, and search for phenomena predicted by scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model. This proceeding reviews the existing and proposed neutrino detectors, presents their first results, and summarizes their physics potential.</description>

      <title>Constraints on extended axion structures from the lensing of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that have been regarded as promising dark matter (DM) candidates. On the other hand, extended compact objects such as axion stars, which are supported by gravity and axion self interactions, may have also been formed in the early Universe and comprise part of DM. In this work, we consider the lensing of electromagnetic signals from distant sources by axion stars, as a way to constrain the properties of axion stars and fundamental axion parameters. Accounting for the effect of the finite size of the axion star, we study the lensing effect induced by gravity and the axion-photon coupling. The latter effect is frequency dependent, and is relevant in the low frequency band, which motivates the use of fast radio burst (FRB) signals as a probe. We calculate the predicted number of lensed FRB events by specifying the fundamental axion parameters, axion star radial profile, fraction of DM residing in axion stars, and imposing lensing criteria based on the flux ratio and time delay between the brightest images from lensing. Assuming an optimistic case of $10^4$ observed FRB events, and a timing resolution of $1~\mu{\rm s}$, the lack of observed FRB lensing events in CHIME allows us to probe axion stars with mass $ \gtrsim 2 \times 10^{-2} M_\odot$, corresponding to axion masses $\lesssim 10^{-10}{\rm eV}$. We obtain constraints for even lighter axion stars up to $\sim 10^{-3} M_\odot$, when the axion-photon interactions are taken into account. Our results indicate that FRB lensing lead to constraints that are competitive with conventional microlensing searches operating in the optical band.</description>

      <title>Dominance of Electric Fields in the Charge Splitting of Elliptic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of electromagnetic fields, highlighting the dominant effect of electric fields on the splitting of elliptic flow, \( \Delta v_2 \) with transverse momentum ($p_T$). The velocity and temperature profiles of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is described through thermal model calculations. The electromagnetic field evolution is however determined from the solutions of Maxwell's equations, assuming constant electric and chiral conductivities. We find that the slower decay of the electric fields compared to the magnetic fields makes its impact on the splitting of the elliptic flow more dominant. We further estimated that the maximum value of \( |\langle eF \rangle| \), evaluated by averaging the field values over all spatial points on the hypersurface and across all field components, is approximately \( (0.010003 \pm 0.000195) \, m_{\pi}^2 \) for \( \sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 7.7 \, \text{GeV} \), which could describe the splitting of elliptic flow data within the current experimental uncertainty reasonably well.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological anatomy of top-quark FCNCs induced by a light scalar singlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar singlets under the Standard Model gauge group appear naturally in many well-motivated New Physics scenarios, such as the composite Higgs models. Unlike the Higgs boson in the Standard Model, they can induce large flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) in the top sector. We investigate systematically the effects of a light scalar singlet $S$ with top-quark FCNC couplings, by including the low-energy constraints from the $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay, the muon anomalous magnetic moment $(g-2)_\mu$ and the neutron Electric Dipole Moment (EDM). We also perform a detailed Monte-Carlo simulation of the channel $pp \to t S +j$ with $S \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $S \to b \bar b$, and investigate the LHC sensitivity to the $tcS$ couplings. It is found that the scalar singlet $S$ can induce scalar-type contributions to the $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay, which do not suffer from the helicity suppression and contain a large CKM factor $V_{cs}^*V_{tb}$. As a result, constraints on the $tcS$ couplings from the measured branching ratio $\mathcal{B}(B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-)$ are quite stringent, being even stronger than the expected LHC sensitivity in some parameter spaces. Besides the CP-conserving $tcS$ couplings, we have also considered the case of CP-violating $tcS$ couplings, with $y_{R,L}^{ct}=|y_{R,L}^{ct}|e^{i\theta_{R,L}}$. It is found that the CP observables $\mathcal{A}_{\Delta\Gamma_s}^{\mu\mu}$ and $\mathcal{S}_{\mu\mu}$ of the $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay are sensitive to the phase $\theta_R$, while the neutron EDM can provide bounds on the phase difference $\theta_L-\theta_R$. Therefore, they are complementary to each other in probing the CP phases of the $tcS$ couplings.</description>

      <title>Rationalisation of multiple square roots in Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feynman integrals are very often computed from their differential equations. It is not uncommon that the $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equation contains only dlog-forms with algebraic arguments, where the algebraic part is given by (multiple) square roots. It is well-known that if all square roots are simultaneously rationalisable, the Feynman integrals can be expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms. This is a sufficient, but not a necessary criterium. In this paper we investigate weaker requirements. We discuss under which conditions we may use different rationalisations in different parts of the calculation. In particular we show that we may use different rationalisations if they correspond to different parameterisations of the same integration path. We present a non-trivial example -- the one-loop pentagon function with three adjacent massive external legs involving seven square roots -- where this technique can be used to express the result in terms of multiple polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>Advancing Higgsino Searches by Integrating ML for Boosted Object Tagging and Event Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higgsinos near the TeV mass range are highly motivated as they offer an elegant solution to the naturalness problem in the Standard Model. Extensive searches for such higgsinos within the framework of General Gauge Mediation (GGM) have been conducted by both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. However, the sensitivity of these searches in the hadronic channel remains limited, primarily due to the reliance on traditional substructure-based techniques for fat jet identification. In this work, we present a novel search strategy that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to improve the characterization of fat jets originating from W/Z/h bosons, top quarks, and QCD-initiated light quarks and gluons. The GNN scores, combined with a boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier, enhance signal-background discrimination, offering a significant improvement in sensitivity for higgsino searches at the LHC.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Search for Leptoquarks Decaying into Top-$\tau$ Final States at the Future LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the collider phenomenology of third-generation scalar leptoquarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with a 14 TeV center-of-mass energy. The analysis focuses on leptoquarks decaying exclusively into top quarks and tau leptons, employing machine learning-based tagging techniques for identifying hadronically decaying boosted top quarks, W/Z, and Higgs bosons, as well as a multivariate classifier to distinguish signal events from Standard Model (SM) backgrounds. The expected 95% confidence level (CL) upper limits on the leptoquark production cross-section are computed assuming integrated luminosities of 200 and 500 inverse femtobarns at the 14 TeV LHC. The results demonstrate significant sensitivity improvements for detecting leptoquarks at masses beyond the current experimental limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new physics-based model for analytical calculation of Soft Error Rate (SER) in digital memory circuits under the influence of heavy ions in space orbits is proposed. This method is based on parameters that are uniquely determined from the results of ground tests under nor-mal ion incidence. It is shown that preliminary averaging over the total solid angle within the standard inverse cosine model allows one to take into account the effect of isotropic flow, which increases the effective SER. The model includes the ability to estimate the contribution to SER of the low LET spectrum region, which is very important for modern ICs with low Single Event Upset tolerance.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, I discuss the macroscopic properties of the ultracompact object XTE J1814-338, whose inferred mass and radius read $M$ = 1.21 $\pm$ 0.05 $M_\odot$ and R = 7.0 $\pm$ 0.4 km. By using the neutralino as WIMP dark matter with a fixed Fermi momentum, I calculated the maximum possible mass of this object, the moment of inertia, the gravitational redshift, the dimensionless tidal parameter, and the total amount of dark matter for a 1.2$M_\odot$ star.</description>

      <title>Probing Signals of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Core Collapse in \textsc{Hi}-Rich Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze rotation curves of five \textsc{Hi}-rich galaxies recently discovered with MeerKAT. These galaxies exhibit sharply rising rotation curves, while their baryonic components are not dynamically dominant, suggesting that their dark matter halos have high inner densities. When fitting the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo model, four galaxies require extremely high halo concentrations, exceeding the cosmological median by $5\sigma$. In contrast, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos in the core-collapse phase naturally account for the high densities in these galaxies. For halos with masses around $10^{11}~{\rm M_\odot}$, those in cosmic filaments exhibit concentrations consistent with the cosmological average, while halos in cosmic nodes show relatively higher concentrations that align with the SIDM fits but remain insufficient for the NFW fits. Our analysis indicates that these \textsc{Hi}-rich galaxies may have formed in cosmic nodes of dark matter with significant self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Three-loop verification of the equations relating running of the gauge couplings in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD+SQED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We verify a recently derived equations relating the renormalization group running of two gauge couplings in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD+SQED by the explicit three-loop calculation. It is demonstrated that these equations are really valid in the HD+MSL scheme. In other words, if a theory is regularized by higher covariant derivatives and the renormalization is made by minimal subtractions of logarithms, the analogs of the strong and electromagnetic gauge couplings do not run independently. However, in the $\overline{\mbox{DR}}$ scheme the considered equations do not hold starting from the three-loop order, where the scheme dependence becomes essential. Therefore, they are valid only for a certain set of the renormalization prescriptions. We prove that all of them can be obtained from the HD+MSL scheme by finite renormalizations which satisfy a special constraint and illustrate how this works in the three-loop approximation.</description>

      <title>Probing the sign-changeable interaction between dark energy and dark matter with DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and this interaction may also undergo a sign change during the evolution of the universe. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain models of a sign-changeable interaction. The data we employ, in addition to the cosmic microwave background data, also encompass the first-year baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI and the type Ia supernova data of the full 5-year observation from DES. To achieve high generality, we investigate four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$: (i) IDE1 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm de}$; (ii) IDE2 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm c}$; (iii) IDE3 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm de}$; (iv) IDE4 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm c}$. From the analysis, we observe that $\beta(z) &gt; 0$ at early times and $\beta(z) &lt; 0$ at late times, with the coupling $\beta(z)$ crossing the non-interacting line $\beta(z) = 0$ during cosmic evolution at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level for the IDE1, IDE3, and IDE4 models. However, for the IDE2 model, $\beta(z)$ remains consistently negative and does not cross $\beta(z) = 0$ at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level. Our findings indicate that the energy transfer is from dark matter to dark energy when dark matter dominates the universe, and from dark energy to dark matter when dark energy dominates, for the IDE1 and IDE3 models. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the IDE1 and IDE3 models are moderately preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. The overall outcomes of this study clearly indicate that, based on current observational data, the sign-changeable IDE models are quite compelling and merit further attention.</description>

      <title>Advection Algorithms for Quantum Neutrino Moment Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino transport in compact objects is an inherently challenging multi-dimensional problem. This difficulty is compounded if one includes flavor transformation -- an intrinsically quantum phenomenon requiring one to follow the coherence between flavors and thus necessitating the introduction of complex numbers. To reduce the computational burden, simulations of compact objects that include neutrino transport often make use of momentum-angle-integrated moments (the lowest order ones being commonly referred to as the energy density and flux) and these quantities can be generalized to include neutrino flavor, i.e., they become quantum moments. Numerous finite-volume approaches to solving the moment evolution equations for classical neutrino transport have been developed based on solving a Riemann problem at cell interfaces. In this paper we describe our generalization of a Riemann solver for quantum moments, specifically decomposing complex numbers in terms of a (signed) magnitude and phase instead of real and imaginary parts. We then test our new algorithm in numerous cases showing a neutrino fast flavor instability, varying from toy models with analytic solutions to snapshots from neutron star merger simulations. Compared to previous algorithms for neutrino transport with flavor mixing, we find uniformly smaller growth rates of the flavor transformation along with concomitantly larger length-scales, and that the results are a better match with the growth rates seen from multi-angle codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While first order phase transitions (FOPTs) have been extensively studied as promising cosmological sources of gravitational waves, the phenomenon of particle production from the dynamics of the background field during FOPTs has received relatively little attention in the literature, where it has only been studied with semi-analytic estimates in some simplified settings. This paper provides improved numerical studies of this effect in more realistic frameworks, revealing important qualitative details that have been missed in the literature. We also provide easy to use analytic formulae that can be used to calculate particle production in generic FOPT setups.</description>

      <title>The problem of flavour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the problem of flavour tracing back to the days when the standard model was just coming together. We focus on the recently discussed new solutions of this problem, namely the Froggatt and Nielsen mechanism based on a novel discrete $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm N} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm M}$ flavour symmetry, and the standard hierarchical VEVs model. The standard HVM, and the Froggatt and Nielsen mechanism based on the $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm N} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm M}$ flavour symmetry, can be recovered from a new dark-technicolour paradigm, where the hierarchical VEVs or the flavon VEV may appear as the chiral multifermion condensates. In particular, there appears a novel feature that the solution of the flavour problem based on the discrete flavour symmetry can provide the so-called flavonic dark matter. This predicts a specific relation between the mass and the symmetry-breaking scale, which can be contrasted with the standard QCD axion. Moreover, a possible direction towards the Grand Unified framework is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Particle Production from Bubble Dynamics at a First Order Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First order phase transitions (FOPTs) constitute an active area of contemporary research as a promising cosmological source of observable gravitational waves. The spacetime dynamics of the background scalar field undergoing the phase transition can also directly produce quanta of particles that couple to the scalar, which has not been studied as extensively in the literature. This paper provides the first careful examination of various aspects of this phenomenon, which is important for understanding the dynamics of the phase transition, the generation of gravitational waves, and various high energy and beyond the Standard Model phenomena. In particular, the contributions from various stages of FOPTs (bubble nucleation, expansion, collision, post-collision) are disentangled, and conceptual aspects of the associated underlying physics relevant for particle production are clarified. Subtleties related to non-universality of particle interactions and masses in different vacua are discussed, and the suppression of nonperturbative effects such as tachyonic instability and parametric resonance due to the inhomogeneous nature of the process is examined.</description>

Abstract: We present DarkCLR, a novel framework for detecting semi-visible jets at the LHC. DarkCLR uses a self-supervised contrastive-learning approach to create observables that are approximately invariant under relevant transformations. We use background-enhanced data to create a sensitive representation and evaluate the representations using a CLR-inspired anomaly score and a normalized autoencoder as density estimators. Our results show a remarkable sensitivity for a wide range of semi-visible jets and are more robust than a supervised classifier trained on a specific signal.</description>

Abstract: Whenever invertible generative networks are needed for LHC physics, normalizing flows show excellent performance. In this work, we investigate their performance for fast calorimeter shower simulations with increasing phase space dimension. We use fast and expressive coupling spline transformations applied to the CaloChallenge datasets. In addition to the base flow architecture we also employ a VAE to compress the dimensionality and train a generative network in the latent space. We evaluate our networks on several metrics, including high-level features, classifiers, and generation timing. Our findings demonstrate that invertible neural networks have competitive performance when compared to autoregressive flows, while being substantially faster during generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark photons, as a minimal extension of the Standard Model through an additional Abelian gauge group, may propagate relativistically across the galaxy, originating from dark matter decay or annihilation, thereby contributing to a galactic dark photon background. The generation of dark photons typically favors certain polarization modes, which are dependent on the interactions between dark matter and dark photons. We introduce a framework in which a resonant cavity is utilized to detect and differentiate these polarizations, leveraging the daily variation in expected signals due to the anisotropic distribution of dark photons and the rotation of the Earth. We conduct an experimental search using superconducting radio-frequency cavities, noted for their exceptionally high quality factors, proving them to be effective telescopes for observing galactic dark photons. This approach establishes the most stringent limits yet on the kinetic mixing coefficient between dark photons and electromagnetic photons, thereby unveiling a novel avenue for the indirect search for dark matter via multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the nonlinear dynamics of coupled scalar fields often necessitates simulations on a 3D mesh. These simulations can be computationally expensive if a large scale separation is involved. A common solution is adaptive mesh refinement which, however, greatly increases a simulation's complexity. In this work, we present sledgehamr, an AMReX-based code package to make the simulation of coupled scalar fields on an adaptive mesh more accessible. Compatible with both GPU and CPU clusters, sledgehamr offers a flexible and customizable framework. While the code had been primarily developed to evolve axion string networks, this framework enables various other applications, such as the study of gravitational waves sourced by the dynamics of scalar fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of $CP$-violation on the signal strength $\mu^{Z\gamma}$, which was reported as $2.2\pm 0.7$ by the LHC. We obtain constraints on the real and absorptive parts of the $CP$-violating form factor $h_3^{Z\gamma}$ and find that they are less than 1.15 GeV. Additionally, we revisit the leading order Standard Model contributions to the $H\rightarrow Z\gamma$ decay and calculate contributions to $h_3^{Z\gamma}$ from FCNC complex couplings mediated by the $Z$ and $H$ bosons. By using the current bounds on such couplings, we find that the FCNC contribution to $h_3^{Z\gamma}$ with top and charm quarks in the loop is of order $10^{-5}$ GeV. While in a model with new quarks that preserves the SM predictions on Higgs decays, the $CP$-violating form factor $h_3^{Z\gamma}$ can be of order $10^{-1}$ GeV and could explain the excess on the signal strength $\mu^{Z\gamma}$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the high $Q^2$ (photon virtuality) limit of single-inclusive hadron production in DIS (SIDIS) at small $x$, using the color glass condensate formalism at next-to-leading order. We focus on the $\Lambda_{QCD}^2 \ll \mathbf{p}_h^2 \ll Q^2$ kinematic regime where $\mathbf{p}_h$ is the produced hadron transverse momentum, and extract the Sudakov double logarithms. We further argue that compatibility between the CGC calculation and TMD factorization at one-loop order can only be achieved if the small-x evolution is kinematically constrained.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the CP-odd Higgs in a Generalized 2HDM at a Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the generalized two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) with a minimally perturbed lepton specific (Type-X) Yukawa sector in context of the muon collider. The model offers a large region of parameter space where it can provide a solution to the observed muon ($g-2$) excess. Specifically the low mass CP odd scalar of this model plays an important role to fit this anomaly. Interestingly, the coupling of the pseudo scalar with the muons is proportional to $\tan \beta$ (the ratio of VEVs of the Higgs doublets) which dominantly controls the one loop and two loop contributions of the muon magnetic moment, therefore it can be probed directly at a muon collider with greater sensitivity in comparison to Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Primarily focusing on a parameter space where muon $g-2$ anomaly is satisfied, we explore the available theoretical and experimental constraints arising from vacuum stability, unitarity, lepton falvour violation (LFV), electroweak precision constraint, B-meson decay and collider experiments on the model. In the parameter space where all these constraints are satisfied, we propose to study the production of the light pseudo-scalar $A$ in association with a photon at a $3$ TeV muon collider. Subsequent decay of $A$ into a $\tau$ pair will produce a striking $l^+ l^- \gamma$ plus missing energy signature.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Charmed Baryon Decays with Strong Phases under SU(3) Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00426v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SU(3) analysis is considered a powerful tool in charmed baryon decays. Motivated by recent measurements of anti-triplet charmed baryon two-body decays from the Belle, Belle II, and BESIII Collaborations, we have finally determined the last two IRA form factors, $f^{a\prime}$ and $g^{a\prime}$, which were absent in previous work. By considering both real and complex form factor cases in our work, we find that the phases of the form factors are necessary and that complex form factors can explain the experimental data well. Using the fitted form factors, we further numerically study the equivalence of the SU(3) irreducible representation amplitude (IRA) and topological diagrammatic approach (TDA) methods. We find that the IRA and TDA methods can be numerically equivalent with the addition of the new form factors. Based on the conclusions above, and considering some interesting scenarios, the CP violation effects can be predicted in these processes at the order of $O(10^{-3})$. This suggests a promising opportunity to observe CP violation for the first time in charmed baryon decays. Although our predictions depend on some assumptions, considering that the experimental data is far from sufficient to determine CPV through SU(3) analysis, our study is meaningful and instructive for observing CPV at experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Internal structure of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ from its light-quark mass dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a chiral effective field theory-based approach to connect $DD^*$ scattering observables at the physical and variable pion masses accessible in lattice QCD simulations. We incorporate all relevant scales associated with three-body $DD\pi$ dynamics and the left-hand cut induced by the one-pion exchange for pion masses higher than the physical one, as required by analyticity and unitarity. By adjusting the contact interactions to match experimental data at the physical pion mass and lattice finite-volume energy levels at $m_{\pi} = 280$ MeV, we predict the trajectory of the $T_{cc}$ pole as a function of the pion mass, finding it consistent with the hadronic-molecule scenario. In particular, we find that the explicit treatment of the one-pion exchange has a pronounced effect on the pole trajectory for $m_\pi \gtrsim 230$ MeV by pushing it into the complex energy plane.</description>

      <title>Hunting for the prospective $T_{cc}$ family based on the diquark-antidiquark configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the first $T_{cc}$ observation at the LHCb Collaboration, the spectroscopic properties of the entire isoscalar and isovector $T_{cc}$ family are systematically investigated by means of multiple sorts of relativized and nonrelativistic diquark formalisms, which include the Godfrey-Isgur relativized diquark model, the modified Godfrey-Isgur relativized diquark model incorporating the color screening effects, the nonrelativistic diquark model with the Gaussian type hyperfine potential, and the nonrelativistic diquark model with the Yukawa type hyperfine potential. In terms of the $1S$-wave double-charm tetraquark state with $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$, the predicted masses of most diquark-antidiquark scenarios are somewhat higher than the observed value of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ structure. In light of the diquark-antidiquark configuration, this work unveils the mixing angles of the orbitally excited isovector $T_{cc}$ states and the magic mixing angles of the ideal heavy-light tetraquarks for the first time. As the advancement of the experimental detection capability, these phenomenological predictions will effectively boost the hunting for the prospective low-lying $T_{cc}$ states in the future.</description>

      <title>Leading-colour-based unweighted event generation for multi-parton tree-level processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit unweighted event generation for multi-parton tree-level processes in massless QCD. We introduce a two-step approach, in which initially unweighted events are generated at leading-colour (LC) accuracy, followed by a reweighting of these events to full-colour (FC) accuracy and applying an additional unweighting cycle. This method leverages the simple structure of LC integrands, enabling optimized phase-space parameterisations and resulting in high primary unweighting efficiencies, ranging from the percent level for $2 \to 4$ processes to the per-mille level for $2 \to 7$ processes. Given that the LC-accurate matrix elements closely approximate the FC-accurate ones, the secondary unweighting efficiencies exceed 50%. Our results suggest that this two-step approach offers an efficient alternative to direct event generation at FC accuracy.</description>

Abstract: The seven-gluon two-loop full-color Yang-Mills amplitude is presented in a compact analytic form where we use the methods of four-dimensional unitarity cuts to obtain the polylogarithmic pieces and augmented recursion to obtain the rational pieces. Furthermore, an $n$-point form for the full-color polylogarithmic piece is presented. We use these results to probe for potential relations amongst the two-loop partial amplitudes.</description>

      <title>SPECTER: Efficient Evaluation of the Spectral EMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Energy Mover's Distance (EMD) has seen use in collider physics as a metric between events and as a geometric method of defining infrared and collinear safe observables. Recently, the Spectral Energy Mover's Distance (SEMD) has been proposed as a more analytically tractable alternative to the EMD. In this work, we obtain a closed-form expression for the Riemannian-like p = 2 SEMD metric between events, eliminating the need to numerically solve an optimal transport problem. Additionally, we show how the SEMD can be used to define event and jet shape observables by minimizing the distance between events and parameterized energy flows (similar to the EMD), and we obtain closed-form expressions for several of these observables. We also present the SPECTER framework, an efficient and highly parallelized implementation of the SEMD metric and SEMD-derived shape observables as an analogue of the previously-introduced SHAPER for EMD-based computations. We demonstrate that computing the SEMD with SPECTER can be up to a thousand times faster than computing the EMD with standard optimal transport libraries.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Thermal Field Theory: From First Principles to Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review article provides the basics and discusses some important applications of thermal field theory, namely the combination of statistical mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory. In a first part the fundamentals are covered: the density matrix, the corresponding averages and the treatment of fields of various spin in a medium. A second part is dedicated to the computation of thermal Green's function for scalars, vectors and fermions with path-integral methods. These functions play a crucial role in thermal field theory, as explained here. A more applicative part of the review is dedicated to the production of particles in a medium and to phase transitions in field theory, including the process of vacuum decay in a general theory featuring a first-order phase transition. To understand this review, the reader should only have a good knowledge of non-statistical quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the upper limit on dark matter mass in the context of the inert double model. We derive analytic expression for the upper bound as a function of the mass squared differences between dark matter and other new particles.

      <title>Exploring semi-relativistic $p$-wave dark matter annihilation in minimal Higgs portal near supermassive black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential annihilation processes of light dark matter (DM) in minimal Higgs portal models near supermassive black hole (Sgr A$^{\star}$) in the Galactic Center, considering interactions between DM particles mediated by either a light scalar or pseudoscalar with couplings $ c_s $ and $ c_p $. Accelerated by the supermassive black hole, DM particles can reach velocities up to half the speed of light, significantly enhancing the $ p $-wave annihilation cross-section, allowing forbidden annihilation channels within specific mass ranges, and producing unique gamma-ray spectral signals. Utilizing gamma-ray observation from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) in the direction of Sgr $A^{\star}$, we constrain light DM parameter in the mass range of $ 0.3-10 \, \text{GeV} $ . Our results indicate that the couplings $ c_s $ and $ c_p $ are constrained to the order of $ 10^{-5} $, corresponding to a DM annihilation cross-section as low as $ 10^{-38} $$ {\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$. In the future, the Very Large Gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST), with a larger detection area and broader detection range from $1$ MeV to $1$ TeV, will enhance our ability to probe sub-GeV DM and offer the opportunity to further study the forbidden annihilation scenario.</description>

      <title>Constraining eV-scale axion-like particle dark matter: insights from the M87 Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can account for the observed dark matter (DM) of the Universe and if their masses are at the eV scale, they can decay into infrared, optical and ultraviolet photons with a decay lifetime larger than the age of the Universe. We analyze multi-wavelength data obtained from the central region of Messier 87 (M87) galaxy by several telescopes, such as, Swift, Astrosat, Kanata, Spitzer and International Ultraviolet Explorer in the infrared to ultraviolet frequencies ($\sim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm Hz} - 3\times10^{15}$ Hz), to constrain the narrow emission lines indicative of the eV scale ALP DM decay. We derive constraints on the ALP coupling to two photons ($g_{a\gamma\gamma}$) for ALP mass range $2 \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 20 \, {\rm eV}$, assuming ALPs form the DM in the M87 halo. We find that our bounds on ALP-two-photon coupling can become stronger than the existing ones by an order of magnitude in the ALP mass range $8 \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 20 \, {\rm eV}$.</description>

Abstract: We determine the uncorrelated modes that characterize the fluctuations in a semi-realistic model for the initial state of high-energy nuclear collisions, consisting of hot spots whose positions are distributed independently. Varying the number of hot spots, their size, and the weights with which they contribute to the initial state, we find that the parameter that has the largest influence on the relative importance of the fluctuation modes is the source size, with more extended hot spots leading to a more marked predominance of the principal modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel methodology for analysing the relation between the energy density in gravitational waves and primordial power spectra is developed. Focusing on scalar-induced gravitational radiation, this methodology is applied to a number of scenarios for the primordial black hole formation. Being differed from conventional Bayesian approaches, its advantages include directness and computational efficiency, which are crucial for handling the complex data characteristic of gravitational wave research. As an important application, it is demonstrated that this methodology allows for the systematic reconstruction of power spectra across all scenarios using current pulsar timing array data, providing a clear example of its potential in gravitational wave analysis.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Origin of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts with or without Extended Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The merger of compact binary stars produces short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), involving channels such as neutron star - neutron star (BNS) and neutron star - black hole (NS-BH). The association between sGRB 170817A and gravitational wave GW 170817 provides reliable evidence for the BNS channel. Some speculations suggest that sGRBs with extended emission (EE) may represent another distinct population. The offset is the distance between the GRB sky localization and the host galaxy center. We compared the offset distributions of these two types of samples (46 sGRBs with EE and 9 without EE samples) and found that they follow the same distribution. Utilizing non-parametric methods, we examined the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs without any assuming. The luminosity function can be described as $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.12 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} &lt; L_0^b$ ($\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.73 \pm 0.02}$ for $L_{0} &gt; L_0^b$) for sGRB without EE and $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.13 \pm 0.003}$ for $L_{0} &lt; L_0^b$ ($\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.61 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} &gt; L_0^b$) for sGRBs with EE. The formation rate is characterized as $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-3.04 \pm 0.10}$ for $z &lt; 1$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.29 \pm 0.38}$ for $1 &lt; z &lt; 3$ for sGRB without EE, while for sGRBs with EE, it is $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-3.85 \pm 0.15}$ for $z &lt; 1$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.40 \pm 1.11}$ for $1 &lt; z &lt; 3$. Our findings suggest no significant difference in the progenitors of sGRBs with and without EE when considered in terms of spatial offsets, formation rates, and luminosity function.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM cosmology: Alleviating major cosmological tensions by predicting standard neutrino properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-parameter extension of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model by allowing variations in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ and their total mass $\sum m_\nu$. Our motivation is twofold: (i) to examine whether $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM retains its success in fitting the data and addressing major cosmological tensions, without suggesting a need for a deviation from the standard model of particle physics, and (ii) to determine whether the data indicate new physics that could potentially address cosmological tensions, either in the post-recombination universe through the late-time mirror AdS-dS transition, or in the pre-recombination universe through modifications in the standard values of $N_{\rm eff}$ and $\sum m_\nu$, or both. Within the extended $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, referred to as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$+$\sum m_{\rm \nu}$, we find no significant tension when considering the Planck-alone analysis. We observe that incorporating BAO data limits the further success of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM extension. However, the weakly model-dependent BAOtr data, along with Planck and Planck+PP\&amp;SH0ES, favor $H_0\sim 73\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}\, Mpc^{-1}}$. In cases where BAOtr dataset is used, the mirror AdS-dS transition is very effective in providing enhanced $H_0$ values, and thus the model requires no significant deviation from the standard value of $N_{\rm eff} = 3.044$. Both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are effectively addressed, with some compromise in the case of the Planck+BAO dataset. Finally, the upper bounds obtained on $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.5$~eV are fully compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments. Our findings provide evidence that late-time physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, such as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, without altering the standard pre-recombination universe, can suffice to alleviate the major cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Coulomb liquid phase in few-electron droplets</title>

Abstract: Emergence of universal collective behaviour from interactions within a sufficiently large group of elementary constituents is a fundamental scientific paradigm. In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter such as deconfined quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions or expanding quantum degenerate gases. Mesoscopic colliders, through shot-noise measurements, have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges, levitons and anyon statistics. Yet, bridging the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity as the number of interacting particles increases remains a challenging task at the microscopic level. Here we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of electron droplets containing up to N = 5 electrons, driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor device. Analyzing the partitioning data using high-order multivariate cumulants and finite-size scaling towards the thermodynamic limit reveals distinctive fingerprints of a strongly-correlated Coulomb liquid. These fingerprints agree well with a universal limit where the partitioning of a droplet is predicted by a single collective variable. Our electron-droplet collider provides critical insight into the interplay of confinement and interaction effects in small electron systems and highlights a new way to study engineered states of matter.</description>

      <title>Impact of extreme magnetic fields on the QCD topological susceptibility in the vicinity of the crossover region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first determination of the topological susceptibility from lattice QCD in the presence of strong background magnetic fields. Our simulations employ 2+1 flavours of stout improved staggered quarks with physical masses and cover a broad range of temperatures and magnetic field values. The results are extrapolated to the continuum limit using four different lattice spacings and an eigenvalue reweighting technique to reduce discretisation errors. For low temperatures, our calculations show an enhancement of the topological susceptibility due to the magnetic field, compatible with predictions from chiral perturbation theory. At high temperatures, we observe the impact of inverse magnetic catalysis on the susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Searching for displaced vertices with a gaseous tracker for a future e$^+$e$^-$ Higgs factory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents results of the first full simulation study addressing prospects for observation of long-lived particles (LLPs) with the International Large Detector (ILD), operating at the International Linear Collider (ILC) at $\sqrt{s}=250$ GeV. Neutral LLP production, resulting in a displaced vertex signature inside the ILD's time projection chamber (TPC), is considered. We focus on scenarios interesting from the experimental perspective and perform a search based on displaced vertex finding inside the TPC volume. Two experimentally challenging scenarios are explored: the first involving very soft final states due to a small mass splitting between a heavy LLP and the dark matter particle to which it decays, and the second with production of a light and therefore highly boosted LLP resulting in almost colinear vertex tracks. The expected limits on the signal production cross section are presented for a wide range of the LLP proper lifetimes corresponding to $c\tau$ from 0.1 mm to 10 km.</description>

      <title>From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04392v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</description>

      <title>Partially Coherent Crystalline Undulator Radiation from a Positron Bunch Modulated via the SASE XFEL Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystalline undulator (CU), where the positrons of a bunch are channeled planarly, is considered. In contrast to channeling radiation, CU radiation (CUR) occurs due to the average sinusoidal motion of positrons. Taking into account the medium polarization, besides hard photons, soft photons are also generated. In the SASE XFEL process, microbunching occurs with a longitudinal size on the order of the wavelength of the stimulated radiation due to the interaction between positrons and generated photons at zero angle. These microbunches in CU will radiate coherently, and the radiation of the bunch will be partially coherent. Charged particles organized into a microbunch with a well-defined spatial phase distribution can emit coherent (synergistic or collective) radiation when the wavelength of the emitted radiation is comparable to or longer than the longitudinal size of the microbunch. The CU parameters, the spatial period and the amplitude, are selected to preserve both the channeling phenomenon of positrons and the coherence of CUR from positron microbunches. The gain of spontaneous radiation depends on the modulation depth of the microbunch, which is a critical parameter of the bunch and can also be determined through the proposed experiment. A numerical analysis has been conducted for a specific case involving CUR generated by a positron bunch modulated during the SASE XFEL, at a corresponding wavelength of the process.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>
