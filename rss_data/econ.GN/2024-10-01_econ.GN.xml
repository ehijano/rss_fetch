      <title>Save the Farms: Nonlinear Impact of Climate Change on Banks' Agricultural Lending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The agricultural sector is particularly susceptible to the impact of climate change. In this paper, I investigate how vulnerability to climate change affects U.S. farms' credit access, and demonstrates that such impact is unequally distributed across farms. I first construct a theoretical framework of bank lending to farms faced with climate risks, and the model helps discipline ensuing empirical analyses that use novel panel datasets at county and at bank levels. I find that higher exposure to climate change, measured by temperature anomaly, reduces bank lending to farms. Such impact is persistent, nonlinear, and heterogeneous. Small and medium farms almost always experience loss of loan access. In comparison, large farms see less severe credit contraction, and in some cases may even see improvement in funding. While small banks carry the burden of continuing to lend to small farms, their limited market share cannot compensate for the reduction of lending from medium and large banks. These results suggest that factors such as farm size and bank type can amplify the financial impact of climate change.</description>

      <title>The College Melting Pot: Peers, Culture and Women's Job Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gender norms are widely recognized as key determinants of persistent gender gaps in the labor market. However, our understanding of the drivers of gender norms, and their implications for preferences, remain lacking. This paper addresses this gap by examining how cultural assimilation from college peers influences women's early-career labor market decisions. For identification of causal effects, I exploit cross-cohort idiosyncratic variation in peers' geographical origins within Master's programs, combined with unique administrative and survey data covering the universe of college students in Italy. The main finding is that exposure to female classmates originating from areas with more egalitarian gender culture significantly increases women's labor supply, primarily through increased uptake of full-time jobs. A one standard deviation increase in peers' culture increases female earnings by 3.7%. The estimated peer effects are economically significant, representing more than a third of the gender earnings gap. Drawing on comprehensive data on students' job search preferences and newly collected data on their beliefs, I shed novel light on two distinct mechanisms driving peer influence: (1) shifts in preferences for non-pecuniary job attributes, and (2) social learning, particularly on the characteristics of the job offer distribution.</description>

      <title>Academic Knowledge: Does it Reflect the Combinatorial Growth of Technology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I explore the concept of growth being rooted in the recombination of existing technology as an explanation for the remarkable growth witnessed during the Industrial Revolution as it was recently proposed by Koppl et al.(2023). I adapt their combinatorial growth theory to assess its applicability in generating academic knowledge within universities and research institutions, particularly in the field of economics. The central question is whether significant combinatorial growth can also be anticipated in academia. The current career structures discourage the recombination of ideas, theories, or methods, making it more advantageous for early career researchers to stick to the status quo. I employ machine-learning-based natural language analysis of the top 5 journals in economics. The analysis reveals limited correlations between topics over the past three decades, suggesting the presence of isolated topic islands rather than productive recombination. This confirms the theoretical considerations beforehand. Overall, the institutional order of academia makes combinatorial growth at the research frontier unlikely.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework to Classify Business Activities into International Standard Industrial Classification through Large Language Models for Circular Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective information gathering and knowledge codification are pivotal for developing recommendation systems that promote circular economy practices. One promising approach involves the creation of a centralized knowledge repository cataloguing historical waste-to-resource transactions, which subsequently enables the generation of recommendations based on past successes. However, a significant barrier to constructing such a knowledge repository lies in the absence of a universally standardized framework for representing business activities across disparate geographical regions. To address this challenge, this paper leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify textual data describing economic activities into the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC), a globally recognized economic activity classification framework. This approach enables any economic activity descriptions provided by businesses worldwide to be categorized into the unified ISIC standard, facilitating the creation of a centralized knowledge repository. Our approach achieves a 95% accuracy rate on a 182-label test dataset with fine-tuned GPT-2 model. This research contributes to the global endeavour of fostering sustainable circular economy practices by providing a standardized foundation for knowledge codification and recommendation systems deployable across regions.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Model for Multidimensional Intransitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intransitivity is a critical issue in pairwise preference modeling. It refers to the intransitive pairwise preferences between a group of players or objects that potentially form a cyclic preference chain and has been long discussed in social choice theory in the context of the dominance relationship. However, such multifaceted intransitivity between players and the corresponding player representations in high dimensions is difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model that jointly learns each player's d-dimensional representation (d&gt;1) and a dataset-specific metric space that systematically captures the distance metric in Rd over the embedding space. Interestingly, by imposing additional constraints in the metric space, our proposed model degenerates to former models used in intransitive representation learning. Moreover, we present an extensive quantitative investigation of the vast existence of intransitive relationships between objects in various real-world benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this investigation is the first of this type. The predictive performance of our proposed method on different real-world datasets, including social choice, election, and online game datasets, shows that our proposed method outperforms several competing methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Construction of Instruction-tuned LLMs for Finance without Instruction Data Using Continual Pretraining and Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for constructing instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) for finance without instruction data. Traditionally, developing such domain-specific LLMs has been resource-intensive, requiring a large dataset and significant computational power for continual pretraining and instruction tuning. Our study proposes a simpler approach that combines domain-specific continual pretraining with model merging. Given that general-purpose pretrained LLMs and their instruction-tuned LLMs are often publicly available, they can be leveraged to obtain the necessary instruction task vector. By merging this with a domain-specific pretrained vector, we can effectively create instruction-tuned LLMs for finance without additional instruction data. Our process involves two steps: first, we perform continual pretraining on financial data; second, we merge the instruction-tuned vector with the domain-specific pretrained vector. Our experiments demonstrate the successful construction of instruction-tuned LLMs for finance. One major advantage of our method is that the instruction-tuned and domain-specific pretrained vectors are nearly independent. This independence makes our approach highly effective. The Japanese financial instruction-tuned LLMs we developed in this study are available at https://huggingface.co/pfnet/nekomata-14b-pfn-qfin-inst-merge.</description>

      <title>Fuel tax loss in a world of electric mobility: A window of opportunity for congestion pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continued transition towards electric mobility will decrease energy tax revenues worldwide, which has substantial implications for government funds. At the same time, demand for transportation is ever increasing, which in turn increases congestion problems. Combining both challenges, this paper assesses the effectiveness of congestion pricing as a sustainable revenue stream to offset fuel tax loss in 2030 while simultaneously enhancing efficiency in the transport sector. A congestion-based toll that is road-and-time-variant is simulated for the greater Berlin area in Germany using the multi-agent transport simulation (MATSim) software. Through the simulation results, this paper quantifies the impacts of the toll on the governmental revenue, traffic management, environment, social welfare, and the distribution effects. We find that the revenue from congestion tolls in a metropolitan area can compensate the reduction in passenger car fuel tax. Furthermore, a remarkable welfare surplus is observed. The toll also successfully incentivises transport users to adjust their travel behaviour, which reduces traffic delay time by 28%. CO2 emissions as a key metric for decarbonisation of the transport sector decrease by more than 5%. The analysis of the distribution effects suggests that a redistribution plan with a focus on the middle-low-income residents and the outer boroughs could help the policy gain more public acceptance.</description>

      <title>La R\'evolution D\'evore ses Enfants: Pricing Implications of Transformative Agreements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the widespread dissemination of the internet, academia envisioned free availability and rapid dissemination of new knowledge. However, most researchers continued publishing in established journals instead of switching to fully open-access alternatives. That preserved the market power of the large commercial publishing houses owning thousands of journals behind paywalls. To turn these portfolios into open access, research institutions around the globe have been negotiating `transformative agreements:' Papers are published fully open access, and universities pay only for the publication but not for subscriptions any longer. In this paper, I demonstrate that publishers controlling a large stock of paywalled publications can use them as leverage to ensure high revenues even with decreasing publication numbers. By that, this industrial policy may harm competitors that only publish under open access. This could harm competition and perpetuate the position of the incumbent players.</description>

      <title>Does the Use of Unusual Combinations of Datasets Contribute to Greater Scientific Impact?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05024v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific datasets play a crucial role in contemporary data-driven research, as they allow for the progress of science by facilitating the discovery of new patterns and phenomena. This mounting demand for empirical research raises important questions on how strategic data utilization in research projects can stimulate scientific advancement. In this study, we examine the hypothesis inspired by the recombination theory, which suggests that innovative combinations of existing knowledge, including the use of unusual combinations of datasets, can lead to high-impact discoveries. Focusing on social science, we investigate the scientific outcomes of such atypical data combinations in more than 30,000 publications that leverage over 5,000 datasets curated within one of the largest social science databases, ICPSR. This study offers four important insights. First, combining datasets, particularly those infrequently paired, significantly contributes to both scientific and broader impacts (e.g., dissemination to the general public). Second, infrequently paired datasets maintain a strong association with citation even after controlling for the atypicality of dataset topics. In contrast, the atypicality of dataset topics has a much smaller positive impact on citation counts. Third, smaller and less experienced research teams tend to use atypical combinations of datasets in research more frequently than their larger and more experienced counterparts. Lastly, despite the benefits of data combination, papers that amalgamate data remain infrequent. This finding suggests that the unconventional combination of datasets is an under-utilized but powerful strategy correlated with the scientific impact and broader dissemination of scientific discoveries</description>
