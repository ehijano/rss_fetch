      <title>Origin of granular axial segregation bands in a rotating tumbler: An interface-mixing driven Rayleigh-Taylor instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of large and small particle axial bands in long rotating tumblers is a long-standing question. Using DEM simulations, we show that this axial segregation is due to a Rayleigh-Taylor instability which is characterized by the fact that the density of a granular medium increases with mixing and decreases with segregation. For initially mixed particles, segregation and collisional diffusion in the flowing layer balance and lead to a three-layer system, with a layer of large particles over a layer of small particles, and, interposed between these layers, a layer of more densely packed mixed particles. The higher density mixed particle layer over the lower density small particle layer induces a Rayleigh-Taylor instability, evident as waviness in the interface between the layers. The waviness destabilizes into ascending plumes of small particles and descending plumes of mixed particles with large particles enriched near the surface, which become evident as small and large particle bands visible at the free surface. Rolls driven by segregation at the tilted interface between plumes maintain the pattern of frozen plumes. Published by the American Physical Society 2024</description>

      <title>An experimental demonstration of neuromorphic sensing of chemical species using electro-optical reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A chemical discrimination system based on photonic reservoir computing is demonstrated experimentally for the first time. The system is inspired by the way humans perceive and process visual sensory information. The electro-optical reservoir computing system is a photonic analogue of the human nervous system with the read-out layer acting as the 'brain', and the sensor that of the human eye. A task-specific optimisation of the system is implemented, and the performance of the system for the discrimination between three chemicals is presented. The results are compared to the previously published numerical simulation. This publication provides a feasibility assessment and a demonstration of a practical realisation of photonic reservoir computing for a new neuromorphic sensing system - the next generation sensor with a built-in 'intelligence' which can be trained to 'understand' and to make a real time sensing decision based on the training data.</description>
