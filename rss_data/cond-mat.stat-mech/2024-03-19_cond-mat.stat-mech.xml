      <title>Phase determination with and without deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of phase transitions is a critical task in statistical physics, traditionally pursued through analytic methods and direct numerical simulations. Recently, machine-learning techniques have emerged as promising tools in this context, with a particular focus on supervised and unsupervised learning methods, along with non-learning approaches. In this work, we study the performance of unsupervised learning in detecting phase transitions in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the square lattice. The model is chosen due to its simplicity and complexity, thus providing an understanding of the application of machine-learning techniques in both straightforward and challenging scenarios. We propose a simple method based on a direct comparison of configurations. The reconstruction error, defined as the mean-squared distance between two configurations, is used to determine the critical temperatures ($T_c$). The results from the comparison of configurations are contrasted with that of the configurations generated by variational autoencoders. Our findings highlight that for certain systems, a simpler method can yield results comparable to more complex neural networks. This work contributes to the broader understanding of machine-learning applications in statistical physics and introduces an efficient approach to the detection of phase transitions using machine determination techniques.</description>

      <title>Sample complexity of matrix product states at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For quantum many-body systems in one dimension, computational complexity theory reveals that the evaluation of ground-state energy remains elusive on quantum computers, contrasting the existence of a classical algorithm for temperatures higher than the inverse logarithm of the system size. This highlights a qualitative difference between low- and high-temperature states in terms of computational complexity. Here, we describe finite-temperature states using the matrix product state formalism. Within the framework of random samplings, we derive an analytical formula for the required number of samples, which provides both quantitative and qualitative measures of computational complexity. At high and low temperatures, its scaling behavior with system size is linear and quadratic, respectively, demonstrating a distinct crossover between these numerically difficult regimes of quantitative difference.</description>

      <title>Motility-Induced Pinning in Flocking System with Discrete Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a motility-induced pinning transition in the active Ising model for an active self-propelled particle system with discrete symmetry. This model was known to exhibit a liquid-gas type flocking phase transition, but a recent study reveals that the polar order is metastable due to droplet excitation. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that, for an intermediate alignment interaction strength, the steady state is characterized by traveling local domains, which renders the polar order short-ranged in both space and time. We further demonstrate that interfaces between colliding domains become pinned as the alignment interaction strength increases. A resonating back-and-forth motion of individual self-propelled particles across interfaces is identified as a mechanism for the pinning. We present an analytic argument for the motility-induced pinning transition by incorporating the resonance mechanism into the hydrodynamic theory. The resulting steady state consists of a network of pinned interfaces interconnected by particle currents. While the polar order is still short-ranged in space, the particle currents mediated by the pinned interfaces can exhibit long-range temporal correlations.</description>

      <title>Being heterogeneous is disadvantageous: Brownian non-Gaussian searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusing diffusivity models, polymers in the grand canonical ensemble and polydisperse, and continuous-time random walks all exhibit stages of non-Gaussian diffusion. Is non-Gaussian targeting more efficient than Gaussian? We address this question, central to, e.g., diffusion-limited reactions and some biological processes, through a general approach that makes use of Jensen's inequality and that encompasses all these systems. In terms of customary mean first-passage time, we show that Gaussian searches are more effective than non-Gaussian ones. A companion paper argues that non-Gaussianity becomes instead highly more efficient in applications where only a small fraction of tracers is required to reach the target.</description>

      <title>Being Heterogeneous Is Advantageous: Extreme Brownian Non-Gaussian Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redundancy in biology may be explained by the need to optimize extreme searching processes, where one or few among many particles are requested to reach the target like in human fertilization. We show that non-Gaussian rare fluctuations in Brownian diffusion dominates such searches, introducing drastic corrections to the known Gaussian behavior. Our demonstration entails different physical systems and pinpoints the relevance of diversity within redundancy to boost fast targeting. We sketch an experimental context to test our results: polydisperse systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying nonuniversal corner free-energy contributions in weakly-anisotropic two-dimensional critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an exact formula for the corner free-energy contribution of weakly-anisotropic two-dimensional critical systems in the Ising universality class on rectangular domains, expressed in terms of quantities that specify the anisotropic fluctuations. The resulting expression agrees with numerical exact calculations that we perform for the anisotropic triangular Ising model and quantifies the nonuniversality of the corner term for anisotropic critical two-dimensional systems. Our generic formula is expected to apply also to other weakly-anisotropic critical two-dimensional systems that allow for a conformal field theory description in the isotropic limit. We consider the 3-states and 4-states Potts models as further specific examples.</description>

      <title>Variance sum rule: proofs and solvable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive, in more general conditions, a recently introduced variance sum rule (VSR) [I. Di Terlizzi et al., 2024 Science 383 971] involving variances of displacement and force impulse for overdamped Langevin systems in a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). This formula allows visualising the effect of nonequilibrium as a deviation of the sum of variances from normal diffusion $2Dt$, with $D$ the diffusion constant and $t$ the time. From the VSR, we also derive formulas for the entropy production rate $\sigma$ that, differently from previous results, involve second-order time derivatives of position correlation functions. This novel feature gives a criterion for discriminating strong nonequilibrium regimes without measuring forces. We then apply and discuss our results to three analytically solved models: a stochastic switching trap, a Brownian vortex, and a Brownian gyrator. Finally, we compare the advantages and limitations of known and novel formulas for $\sigma$ in an overdamped NESS.</description>

      <title>Microscopic understanding of NMR signals by dynamic mean-field theory for spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently developed dynamic mean-field theory for disordered spins (spinDMFT) is shown to capture the spin dynamics of nuclear spins very well. The key quantities are the spin autocorrelations. In order to compute the free induction decay (FID), pair correlations are needed in addition. They can be computed on spin clusters of moderate size which are coupled to the dynamic mean fields determined in a first step by spinDMFT. We dub this versatile approach non-local spinDMFT (nl-spinDMFT). It is a particular asset of nl-spinDMFT that one knows from where the contributions to the FID stem. We illustrate the strengths of nl-spinDMFT in comparison to experimental data for CaF$_2$. Furthermore, spinDMFT provides the dynamic mean-fields explaining the FID of the nuclear spins in $^{13}$C in adamantane up to some static noise. The spin Hahn echo in adamantane is free from effects of static noise and agrees excellently with the spinDMFT results without further fitting.</description>

      <title>Critical Fluctuations at Finite-Time Dynamical Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the critical properties of the recently discovered finite-time dynamical phase transition in the non-equilibrium relaxation of Ising magnets. The transition is characterized by a sudden switch in the relaxation dynamics and it occurs at a sharp critical time. While previous works have focused either on mean-field interactions or on investigating the properties of the critical time, we analyze the critical fluctuations at the phase transition in the nearest-neighbor Ising model on a square lattice using Monte Carlo simulations. By means of a finite-size scaling analysis, we extract the critical exponents for the transition. In two spatial dimensions, the exponents are consistent with those of the two-dimensional Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>The Ba{\l}aban variational problem in the non-linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimization of the action of a QFT with a constraint dictated by the block averaging procedure is an important part of Ba{\l}aban's approach to renormalization. It is particularly interesting for QFTs with non-trivial target spaces, such as gauge theories or non-linear sigma models on a lattice. We analyze this step for the $O(4)$ non-linear sigma model in two dimensions and demonstrate, in this case, how various ingredients of Ba{\l}aban's approach play together. First, using variational calculus on Lie groups, the equation for the critical point is derived. Then, this non-linear equation is solved by the Banach contraction mapping theorem. This step requires detailed control of lattice Green functions and their integral kernels via random walk expansions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the quantum geometric tensor for parameter-dependent curved spaces to higher dimensions, and introduce an equivalent definition that generalizes the Zanardi, et al, formulation of the tensor. The parameter-dependent metric modifies the behavior of both the quantum metric tensor and Berry curvature in a purely geometric way. Our focus is on understanding the distinctions in higher dimensions that emerge when using the generalized tensor compared to the conventional one. Through a comparative analysis, illustrated with examples in two dimensions, we highlight unique quantum geometric properties for both the quantum metric tensor and the Berry curvature. Additionally, we explore differences between analytical and perturbative approaches in solving the problems.</description>

      <title>A field theory representation of sum of powers of principal minors and physical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel field theory representation for the Sum of Powers of Principal Minors (SPPM), a mathematical construct with profound implications in quantum mechanics and statistical physics. We begin by establishing a Berezin integral formulation of the SPPM problem, showcasing its versatility through various symmetries including $SU(n)$, its subgroups, and particle-hole symmetry. This representation not only facilitates new analytical approaches but also offers deeper insights into the symmetries of complex quantum systems. For instance, it enables the representation of the Hubbard model's partition function in terms of the SPPM problem. We further develop three mean field techniques to approximate SPPM, each providing unique perspectives and utilities: the first method focuses on the evolution of symmetries post-mean field approximation, the second, based on the bosonic representation, enhances our understanding of the stability of mean field results, and the third employs a variational approach to establish a lower bound for SPPM. These methods converge to identical consistency relations and values for SPPM, illustrating their robustness. The practical applications of our theoretical advancements are demonstrated through two compelling case studies. First, we exactly solve the SPPM problem for the Laplacian matrix of a chain, a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, allowing for precise benchmarking of mean-field theory results. Second, we present the first analytical calculation of the Shannon-R\'enyi entropy for the transverse field Ising chain, revealing critical insights into phase transitions and symmetry breaking in the ferromagnetic phase. This work not only bridges theoretical gaps in understanding principal minors within quantum systems but also sets the stage for future explorations in more complex quantum and statistical physics models.</description>

      <title>Stochastic nanoswimmer: a multistate model for enzyme self-propulsion and enhanced diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several enzymes show enhanced diffusion in the presence of substrate a feature that is explained by postulating that the enzyme in the bound state has a higher diffusion constant than in the unbound state. In a recent experiment [Jee et al. PNAS, 115, E10812 (2018)], it was observed that some of these enzymes perform a run-and-tumble motion, where the self-propulsion velocities can be of the order of mm/s. Theoretical models of nanoscale swimmers have not been able to explain the high self-propulsion speeds measured in experiments. Here we model the enzyme as a dimer with fluctuating mobility. We show that even a dimer can perform a run-and-tumble motion when the dimer switches between states of different mobility in the enzymatic cycle. Within a three-state enzymatic cycle, we investigate the conditions under which self-propulsion speeds consistent with experiments can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Universal correlations in chaotic many-body quantum states: Fock-space formulation of Berrys random wave model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The apparent randomness of chaotic eigenstates in interacting quantum systems hides subtle correlations dynamically imposed by their finite energy per particle. These correlations are revealed when Berrys approach for chaotic eigenfunctions in single-particle systems is lifted into many-body space. We achieve this by a many-body semiclassics analysis, appropriate for the mesoscopic regime of large but finite number of particles. We then identify the universality of both the cross-correlations and the Gaussian distribution of expansion coefficients as the signatures of chaotic eigenstates. Combined, these two aspects imprint a distinctive backbone to the morphology of eigenstates that we check against extensive quantum simulations. The universality of eigenstate correlations for fixed energy density is then a further signature of many-body quantum chaos that, while consistent with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, lies beyond random matrix theory.</description>

Abstract: We studied random resistor networks produced with regular structure and random distribution of edge conductances. These networks are intended to mimic crack-template-based transparent conductive films as well some random networks produced using nano-imprinting technology. Applying an effective medium theory, we found out that the electrical conductance of such networks is proportional to the square root of the number density of conductive edges. This dependence is in agreement with numerical calculations in Voronoi networks, although the effective conductances are about 15%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent charge and heat transport through periodically driven nanodevices provide a platform for studying thermoelectric effects on the nanoscale. Here we study a junction comprising a quantum dot connected to two fermionic terminals by two weak links. An AC electric field induces time-dependent spin-orbit interaction in the weak links. We show that this setup supports DC charge and heat currents and that thermoelectric performance can be improved, as reflected by the effect of the spin-orbit coupling on the Seebeck coefficient and the electronic thermal conductance. Our analysis is based on the nonequilibrium Keldysh Green's function formalism in the time domain and reveals an interesting distribution of the power supply from the AC source among the various components of the device, apparently not realized before.</description>

      <title>Delayed interactions in the noisy voter model through the periodic polling mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of delayed interactions on the stationary distribution of the noisy voter model. We assume that the delayed interactions occur through the periodic polling mechanism and replace the original instantaneous two-agent interactions. In our analysis, we require that the polling period aligns with the delay in announcing poll outcomes. As expected, when the polling period is relatively short, the model with delayed interactions is effectively identical to the original model. As the polling period increases, oscillatory behavior emerges, but the model with delayed interactions still converges to stationary distribution. The stationary distribution resembles a Beta-binomial distribution, with its shape parameters scaling with the polling period. The observed scaling behavior is non-trivial. As the polling period increases, fluctuation damping also intensifies, yet there is a critical intermediate polling period for which fluctuation damping reaches its maximum intensity.</description>

      <title>A universal crack tip correction algorithm discovered by physical deep symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital image correlation is a widely used technique in the field of experimental mechanics. In fracture mechanics, determining the precise location of the crack tip is crucial. In this paper, we introduce a universal crack tip detection algorithm based on displacement and strain fields obtained by digital image correlation. Iterative crack tip correction formulas are discovered by applying deep symbolic regression guided by physical unit constraints to a dataset of simulated cracks under mode I, II and mixed-mode conditions with variable T-stress. For the training dataset, we fit the Williams series expansion with super-singular terms to the simulated displacement fields at randomly chosen origins around the actual crack tip. We analyse the discovered formulas and apply the most promising one to digital image correlation data obtained from uniaxial and biaxial fatigue crack growth experiments of AA2024-T3 sheet material. Throughout the experiments, the crack tip positions are reliably detected leading to improved stability of the crack propagation curves.</description>

      <title>The inhomogeneous $t$-PushTASEP and Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a multispecies $t$-PushTASEP system on a finite ring of $n$ sites with site-dependent rates $x_1,\dots,x_n$. Let $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)$ be a partition whose parts represent the species of the $n$ particles on the ring. We show that for each composition $\eta$ obtained by permuting the parts of $\lambda$, the stationary probability of being in state $\eta$ is proportional to the ASEP polynomial $F_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n; q,t)$ at $q=1$; the normalizing constant (or partition function) is the Macdonald polynomial $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$ at $q=1$. Our approach involves new relations between the families of ASEP polynomials and of non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials at $q=1$. We also use multiline diagrams, showing that a single jump of the PushTASEP system is closely related to the operation of moving from one line to the next in a multiline diagram. We derive symmetry properties for the system under permutation of its jump rates, as well as a formula for the current of a single-species system.</description>

      <title>Critical behaviours of anisotropic XY ferromagnet in the presence of random field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anisotropic XY ferromagnet has been studied by Monte Carlo simulation in a three dimensional simple cubic lattice. The increase in critical temperature (ferro-para transition) has been noticed with increasing the strength of anisotropy. The effects of random fields (both with full circular symmetry and in angular window) on the critical temperature are investigated systematically in the anisotropic XY ferromagnet in three dimensions. Reduction in the critical temperature of anisotropic XY ferromagnet has been observed in the presence of random field. The compensating field (the required amount of field which preserves the critical temperature for isotropic XY ferromagnet) has been studied as a function of the strength of anisotropy. The compensating field was found to depend linearly on the strength of anisotropy. We have also studied the effects of random field confined in the angular window and observed the reduction of the critical temperature with increase of the angular extension. The critical behaviours are formalized by the usual finite size analysis and the estimation of critical exponents for the susceptibility and the specific heat. .</description>

      <title>Macroscopic fluctuation theory of local time in lattice gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local time in an ensemble of particles measures the amount of time the particles spend in the vicinity of a given point in space. Here we study fluctuations of the empirical time average $R= T^{-1}\int_{0}^{T}\rho\left(x=0,t\right)\,dt$ of the density $\rho\left(x=0,t\right)$ at the origin (so that $R$ is the local time spent at the origin, rescaled by $T$) for an initially uniform one-dimensional diffusive lattice gas. We consider both the quenched and annealed initial conditions and employ the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (MFT). For a gas of non-interacting random walkers (RWs) the MFT yields exact large-deviation functions of $R$, which are closely related to the ones recently obtained by Burenev \textit{et al.} (2023) using microscopic calculations for non-interacting Brownian particles. Our MFT calculations, however, additionally yield the most likely history of the gas density $\rho(x,t)$ conditioned on a given value of $R$. Furthermore, we calculate the variance of the local time fluctuations for arbitrary particle- or energy-conserving diffusive lattice gases. Better known examples of such systems include the simple symmetric exclusion process, the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti model and the symmetric zero-range process. Our results for the non-interacting RWs can be readily extended to a step-like initial condition for the density.</description>

      <title>Anomalous scaling of heterogeneous elastic lines: a new picture from sample to sample fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a discrete model of an heterogeneous elastic line with internal disorder, submitted to thermal fluctuations. The monomers are connected through random springs with independent and identically distributed elastic constants drawn from $p(k)\sim k^{\mu-1}$ for $k\to0$. When $\mu&gt;1$, the scaling of the standard Edwards-Wilkinson model is recovered. When $\mu&lt;1$, the elastic line exhibits an anomalous scaling of the type observed in many growth models and experiments. Here we derive and use the exact expression for the exact probability distribution of the line shape at equilibrium, as well as the spectral properties of the matrix containing the random couplings, to fully characterize the sample to sample fluctuations. Our results lead to novel scaling predictions that partially disagree with previous works, but which are corroborated by numerical simulations. We also provide a novel interpretation of the anomalous scaling in terms of the abrupt jumps in the line's shape that dominate the average value of the observable.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-Induced Spin Parity Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>

      <title>Universal fragility of spin-glass ground-states under single bond changes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the effect of perturbing a single bond on ground-states of nearest-neighbor Ising spin-glasses, with a Gaussian distribution of the coupling constants, across various two and three-dimensional lattices and regular random graphs. Our results reveal that the ground-states are strikingly susceptible to such changes. Altering the strength of only a single bond beyond a critical threshold value leads to a new ground-state that differs from the original one by a droplet of flipped spins whose boundary and volume diverge with the system size -- an effect that is reminiscent of the more familiar phenomenon of disorder chaos. These elementary fractal-boundary zero-energy droplets and their composites feature robust characteristics and provide the lowest-energy macroscopic spin-glass excitations. Remarkably, within numerical accuracy, the size of such droplets conforms to a nearly universal power-law distribution with exponents dependent on the spatial dimension of the system. Furthermore, the critical coupling strengths adhere to a stretched Gaussian distribution that is predominantly determined by the local coordination number.</description>

      <title>Completing the Bootstrap Program for $\mathrm{T}\bar{\mathrm{T}}$-Deformed Massive Integrable Quantum Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years a considerable amount of attention has been devoted to the investigation of 2D quantum field theories perturbed by certain types of irrelevant operators. These are the composite field $\mathrm{T}\bar{\mathrm{T}}$ - constructed out of the components of the stress-energy tensor - and its generalisations - built from higher-spin conserved currents. The effect of such perturbations on the infrared and ultraviolet properties of the theory has been extensively investigated. In the context of integrable quantum field theories, a fruitful perspective is that of factorised scattering theory. In fact, the above perturbations were shown to preserve integrability. The resulting deformed scattering matrices - extensively analysed with the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz - provide the first step in the development of a complete bootstrap program. In this letter we present a systematic approach to computing matrix elements of operators in generalised $\mathrm{T}\bar{\mathrm{T}}$-perturbed models, based on employing the standard form factor program. Our approach is very general and can be applied to all theories with diagonal scattering. We show that the deformed form factors, just as happens for the $S$-matrix, factorise into the product of the undeformed ones and of a perturbation- and theory-dependent term. From these solutions, correlation functions can be obtained and their asymptotic properties studied. Our results set the foundations of a new research program for massive integrable quantum field theory perturbed by irrelevant operators.</description>

      <title>$W$ state is not the unique ground state of any local Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The characterization of ground states among all quantum states is an important problem in quantum many-body physics. For example, the celebrated entanglement area law for gapped Hamiltonians has allowed for efficient simulation of 1d and some 2d quantum systems using matrix product states. Among ground states, some types, such as cat states (like the GHZ state) or topologically ordered states, can only appear alongside their degenerate partners, as is understood from the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In this work, we introduce a new class of simple states, including the $W$ state, that can only occur as a ground state alongside an exactly degenerate partner, even in gapless or disordered models. We show that these states are never an element of a stable gapped ground state manifold, which may provide a new method to discard a wide range of 'unstable' entanglement area law states in the numerical search of gapped phases. On the other hand when these degenerate states are the ground states of gapless systems they possess an excitation spectrum with $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size splitting. One familiar situation where this special kind of gaplessness occurs is at a Lifshitz transition due to a zero mode; a potential quantum state signature of such a critical point. We explore pathological parent Hamiltonians, and discuss generalizations to higher dimensions, other related states, and implications for understanding thermodynamic limits of many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Weight fluctuations in (deep) linear neural networks and a derivation of the inverse-variance flatness relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stationary (late-time) training regime of single- and two-layer linear underparameterized neural networks within the continuum limit of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for synthetic Gaussian data. In the case of a single-layer network in the weakly underparameterized regime, the spectrum of the noise covariance matrix deviates notably from the Hessian, which can be attributed to the broken detailed balance of SGD dynamics. The weight fluctuations are in this case generally anisotropic, but are subject to an isotropic loss. For a two-layer network, we obtain the stochastic dynamics of the weights in each layer and analyze the associated stationary covariances. We identify the inter-layer coupling as a new source of anisotropy for the weight fluctuations. In contrast to the single-layer case, the weight fluctuations experience an anisotropic loss, the flatness of which is inversely related to the fluctuation variance. We thereby provide an analytical derivation of the recently observed inverse variance-flatness relation in a model of a deep linear neural network.</description>

      <title>Dual Symmetry Classification of Non-Hermitian Systems and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Point-Gap Topology of a Non-Unitary Quantum Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit richer topological properties compared to their Hermitian counterparts. It is well known that non-Hermitian systems have been classified based on either the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or the symmetry relations for non-unitary time-evolution operators in the context of Floquet topological phases. In this work, we propose that non-Hermitian systems can always be classified in two ways; a non-Hermitian system can be classified using the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or time-evolution operator regardless of the Floquet topological phases or not. We refer to this as dual symmetry classification. To demonstrate this, we successfully introduce a new non-unitary quantum walk that exhibits point gaps with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topological phase applying the dual symmetry classification and treating the time-evolution operator of this quantum walk as the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider second-order phase transitions in which the order parameter is a replicated overlap matrix. We focus on a tricritical point that occurs in a variety of mean-field models and that, more generically, describes higher order liquid-liquid or liquid-glass transitions. We show that the static replicated theory implies slowing down with a logarithmic decay in time. The dynamical equations turn out to be those predicted by schematic Mode Coupling Theory for supercooled viscous liquids at a $A_3$ singularity, where the parameter exponent is $\lambda=1$. We obtain a quantitative expression for the parameter $\mu$ of the logarithmic decay in terms of cumulants of the overlap, which are physically observable in experiments or numerical simulations.</description>
