      <title>Two-Timescale Design for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided URLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, to tackle the blockage issue in massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) systems, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is seamlessly deployed to support devices with ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). The transmission power of the base station and the phase shifts of the RIS are jointly devised to maximize the weighted sum rate while considering the spatially correlation and channel estimation errors. Firstly, \textcolor{black}{the relationship between the channel estimation error and spatially correlated RIS's elements is revealed by using the linear minimum mean square error}. Secondly, based on the maximum-ratio transmission precoding, a tight lower bound of the rate under short packet transmission is derived. Finally, the NP-hard problem is decomposed into two optimization problems, where the transmission power is obtained by geometric programming and phase shifts are designed by using gradient ascent method. Besides, we have rigorously proved that the proposed algorithm can rapidly converge to a sub-optimal solution with low complexity. Simulation results confirm the tightness between the analytic results and Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the two-timescale scheme provides a practical solution for the short packet transmission.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Evaluation of Coherence Time for Non-Terrestrial Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are recognized as essential components of the next-generation communication systems. This letter evaluates the coherence time for non-terrestrial channels, revealing that the rapid mobility of non-terrestrial base stations (BSs) substantially diminishes channel coherence time. Our results demonstrate that the existence and enhancement of the line-of-sight channel play a crucial role in extending coherence time. Furthermore, unlike terrestrial networks, adjustments to receiver beamwidth seldom affect coherence time with a highspeed motion of the BS in NTNs.</description>

      <title>Energy Reduction in Cell-Free Massive MIMO through Fine-Grained Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical layer foundations of cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) have been well-established. As a next step, researchers are investigating practical and energy-efficient network implementations. This paper focuses on multiple sets of access points (APs) where user equipments (UEs) are served in each set, termed a federation, without inter-federation interference. The combination of federations and CF-mMIMO shows promise for highly-loaded scenarios. Our aim is to minimize the total energy consumption while adhering to UE downlink data rate constraints. The energy expenditure of the full system is modelled using a detailed hardware model of the APs. We jointly design the AP-UE association variables, determine active APs, and assign APs and UEs to federations. To solve this highly combinatorial problem, we develop a novel alternating optimization algorithm. Simulation results for an indoor factory demonstrate the advantages of considering multiple federations, particularly when facing large data rate requirements. Furthermore, we show that adopting a more distributed CF-mMIMO architecture is necessary to meet the data rate requirements. Conversely, if feasible, using a less distributed system with more antennas at each AP is more advantageous from an energy savings perspective.</description>

      <title>On the Reliability and Security of Ambient Backscatter Uplink NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental objective of the forthcoming sixth-generation wireless networks is to concurrently serve a vast array of devices many of which, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors, are projected to have low power requirements or even operate in a battery-free manner. To achieve this goal, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and ambient backscatter communications (AmBC) are regarded as two pivotal and promising technologies. In this work, we present a novel analytical framework for studying the reliability and security of uplink NOMA-based AmBC systems. Specifically, closed-form analytical expressions for both NOMA-users' and IoT backscatter device's (BD's) outage probabilities (OPs) are derived for both cases of perfect and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). In addition, assuming that one NOMA-user transmits an artificial noise in order to enhance system's security, the physical layer security (PLS) of the system is investigated by extracting analytical expressions for NOMA-users' and BD's intercept probabilities (IPs). To gain insightful understandings, an asymptotic analysis is carried out by focusing on the high signal-to-noise (SNR) regime, which reveals that NOMA-users and BDs face outage floors in the high SNR regime as well as that IPs reach constant values at high SNR. Additionally, practical insights regarding how different system parameters affect these OP floors and IP constant values are extracted. Numerical results verify the accuracy of othe developed theoretical framework, offer performance comparisons between the presented NOMA-based AmBC system and a conventional orthogonal multiple access-based AmBC system, and reveal the impact of different system parameters on the reliability and security of NOMA-based AmBC networks.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided Compressive Sensing: Enabling Site-Specific MIMO Hybrid Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressive sensing is a promising solution for the channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with large antenna arrays and constrained hardware. Utilizing site-specific channel data from real-world systems, deep learning can be employed to learn the compressive sensing measurement vectors with minimum redundancy, thereby focusing sensing power on promising spatial directions of the channel. Collecting real-world channel data, however, is challenging due to the high overhead resulting from the large number of antennas and hardware constraints. In this paper, we propose leveraging a site-specific digital twin to generate synthetic channel data, which shares a similar distribution with real-world data. The synthetic data is then used to train the deep learning models for learning measurement vectors and hybrid precoder/combiner design in an end-to-end manner. We further propose a model refinement approach to fine-tune the model pre-trained on the digital twin data with a small amount of real-world data. The evaluation results show that, by training the model on the digital twin data, the learned measurement vectors can be efficiently adapted to the environment geometry, leading to high performance of hybrid precoding for real-world deployments. Moreover, the model refinement approach can enable the digital twin aided model to achieve comparable performance to the model trained on the real-world dataset with a significantly reduced amount of real-world data.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-aided Parametric Sparse Channel Estimation for Terahertz Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communications is considered as one of key solutions to support extremely high data demand in 6G. One main difficulty of the THz communication is the severe signal attenuation caused by the foliage loss, oxygen/atmospheric absorption, body and hand losses. To compensate for the severe path loss, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna array-based beamforming has been widely used. Since the beams should be aligned with the signal propagation path to achieve the maximum beamforming gain, acquisition of accurate channel knowledge, i.e., channel estimation, is of great importance. An aim of this paper is to propose a new type of deep learning (DL)-based parametric channel estimation technique. In our work, DL figures out the mapping function between the received pilot signal and the sparse channel parameters characterizing the spherical domain channel. By exploiting the long short-term memory (LSTM), we can efficiently extract the temporally correlated features of sparse channel parameters and thus make an accurate estimation with relatively small pilot overhead. From the numerical experiments, we show that the proposed scheme is effective in estimating the near-field THz MIMO channel in THz downlink environments.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas Aided Multicast MISO Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel multicast communication system with movable antennas (MAs) is proposed, where the antenna position optimization is exploited to enhance the transmission rate. Specifically, an MA-assisted two-user multicast multiple-input single-input system is considered. The joint optimization of the transmit beamforming vector and transmit MA positions is studied by modeling the motion of the MA elements as discrete movements. A low-complexity greedy search-based algorithm is proposed to tackle this non-convex inter-programming problem. A branch-and-bound (BAB)-based method is proposed to achieve the optimal multicast rate with a reduced time complexity than the brute-force search by assuming the two users suffer similar line-of-sight path losses. Numerical results reveal that the proposed MA systems significantly improve the multicast rate compared to conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs)-based systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Wideband OFDM Communications: Circuit-Based Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the modeling and optimization of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which generalizes conventional RIS with diagonal phase shift matrices and provides additional flexibility for manipulating wireless channels, in wideband communication systems. Specifically, we start from the signal modeling of the BD-RIS-aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, which bridges the time-domain and frequency-domain channels, and explicitly shows the frequency dependence of the BD-RIS response. We next characterize the frequency dependence of the BD-RIS response based on circuit models. Benefiting from the admittance parameter analysis, we model individually each tunable admittance component of BD-RIS and derive an approximated linear expression with respect to the frequency of the transmit signals. With the proposed signal model for the BD-RIS-aided OFDM system and the frequency-dependent BD-RIS model, we propose algorithms to optimize the BD-RIS and the power allocation at the transmitter to maximize the average rate for a BD-RIS-aided OFDM system. Finally, simulation results show that BD-RIS outperforms conventional RIS in the OFDM system. More importantly, the impact of wideband modeling of BD-RIS on the system performance becomes more significant as the circuit complexity of BD-RIS architectures increases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving era of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the emphasis has moved from mere data collection to strategically obtaining timely and relevant data within the Internet of Drones (IoDs) ecosystem. However, the unpredictable conditions in dynamic IoDs pose safety challenges for drones. Addressing this, our approach introduces a multi-UAV framework using spatial-temporal clustering and the Frechet distance for enhancing reliability. Seamlessly coupled with Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), it enhances the precision and agility of UAV networks. Our Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mechanism ensures UAVs adapt strategies through ongoing environmental interactions and enhancing intelligent sensing. This focus ensures operational safety and efficiency, considering data capture and transmission viability. By evaluating the relevance of the sensed information, we can communicate only the most crucial data variations beyond a set threshold and optimize bandwidth usage. Our methodology transforms the UAV domain, transitioning drones from data gatherers to adept information orchestrators, establishing a benchmark for efficiency and adaptability in modern aerial systems.</description>

      <title>AquaIntellect: A Semantic Self-learning Framework for Underwater Internet of Things Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging paradigm of Non-Conventional Internet of Things (NC IoT), which is focused on the usefulness of information as opposed to the notion of high volume data collection and transmission, will be an important and dominant part of human life in the near future. This paper proposes a novel semantic-based approach for addressing the unique challenges posed by underwater NC IoT. We present an intelligent sensing strategy for exploring the semantics of the underwater environment by judiciously selecting the data to transmit, thereby minimizing redundancy for utmost relevant data transmission. We introduce an evolutionary function for the selection of the semantic-empowered messages relevant to the specific task within a minimum Age of Information (AoI), a freshness metric of the collected information, and for monitoring the underwater environment for performance optimization. A DNN-empowered Bayesian integrated with an adaptive surrogate model optimization will determine the optimal placement strategy of the sensors and the uncertainty level of the underwater landscape. An Adaptive Expected Improvement (AEI) mechanism is introduced to predict the optimal arrival rate for enabling a synchronized data sensing and transmission ecosystem, ensuring efficiency and timeliness. Simulation results show that the proposed solution outperforms conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Networked ISAC for Low-Altitude Economy: Transmit Beamforming and UAV Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the exploitation of networked integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) to support low-altitude economy (LAE), in which a set of networked ground base stations (GBSs) transmit wireless signals to cooperatively communicate with multiple authorized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and concurrently use the echo signals to detect the invasion of unauthorized objects in interested airspace. Under this setup, we jointly design the cooperative transmit beamforming at multiple GBSs together with the trajectory control of authorized UAVs and their GBS associations, for enhancing the authorized UAVs' communication performance while ensuring the sensing requirements for airspace monitoring. In particular, our objective is to maximize the average sum rate of authorized UAVs over a particular flight period, subject to the minimum illumination power constraints for sensing over the interested airspace, the maximum transmit power constraints at individual GBSs, and the flight constraints at UAVs. This problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, due to the involvement of integer variables and the coupling of optimization variables. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an efficient algorithm by using the techniques of alternating optimization (AO), successive convex approximation (SCA), and semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Numerical results show that the obtained transmit beamforming and UAV trajectory designs in the proposed algorithm efficiently balance the tradeoff between the sensing and communication performances, thus significantly outperforming various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>PRANK: a singular value based noise filtering approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High quality measurements are paramount to a successful application of experimental techniques in structural dynamics. The presence of noise and disturbances can significantly distort the information stored in the data and, if not adequately treated, may result in erroneous findings and misleading predictions. A common technique to filter out noise relies on decomposing the dataset into singular components sorted by their degree of significance. Discarding low-value contributions helps to clean the data and remove spuriousness. This paper presents PRANK, a novel singular value-based reconstruction approach for multiple-response vibration datasets. PRANK integrates the effect of Principal Response Functions and Hankel filtering actions, resulting in an improved data reconstruction for both system poles and zeros. The mixed formulation, incorporating the e-15 algorithm for automatic truncation, is tested on both analytical and numerical examples, showcasing its robustness, efficiency and versatility. PRANK operates with both time- and frequency-based data. Applied to noisy full-field camera measurements, the filter delivered excellent performance, indicating its potential for various identification tasks and applications in vibration analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by orthogonal dictionary learning problems, we propose a novel method for matrix factorization, where the data matrix $\mathbf{Y}$ is a product of a Householder matrix $\mathbf{H}$ and a binary matrix $\mathbf{X}$. First, we show that the exact recovery of the factors $\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ from $\mathbf{Y}$ is guaranteed with $\Omega(1)$ columns in $\mathbf{Y}$ . Next, we show approximate recovery (in the $l\infty$ sense) can be done in polynomial time($O(np)$) with $\Omega(\log n)$ columns in $\mathbf{Y}$ . We hope the techniques in this work help in developing alternate algorithms for orthogonal dictionary learning.</description>

      <title>A Low-rank Projected Proximal Gradient Method for Spectral Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to the recovery of a spectrally sparse signal (SSS) from partially observed entries, focusing on challenges posed by large-scale data and heavy noise environments. The SSS reconstruction can be formulated as a non-convex low-rank Hankel recovery problem. Traditional formulations for SSS recovery often suffer from reconstruction inaccuracies due to unequally weighted norms and over-relaxation of the Hankel structure in noisy conditions. Moreover, a critical limitation of standard proximal gradient (PG) methods for solving the optimization problem is their slow convergence. We overcome this by introducing a more accurate formulation and a Low-rank Projected Proximal Gradient (LPPG) method, designed to efficiently converge to stationary points through a two-step process. The first step involves a modified PG approach, allowing for a constant step size independent of signal size, which significantly accelerates the gradient descent phase. The second step employs a subspace projection strategy, optimizing within a low-rank matrix space to further decrease the objective function. Both steps of the LPPG method are meticulously tailored to exploit the intrinsic low-rank and Hankel structures of the problem, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Our numerical simulations reveal a substantial improvement in both the efficiency and recovery accuracy of the LPPG method compared to existing benchmark algorithms. This performance gain is particularly pronounced in scenarios with significant noise, demonstrating the method's robustness and applicability to large-scale SSS recovery tasks.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented compression for $L_p$-norm-type goal functions: Application to power consumption scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional data compression schemes aim at implementing a trade-off between the rate required to represent the compressed data and the resulting distortion between the original and reconstructed data. However, in more and more applications, what is desired is not reconstruction accuracy but the quality of the realization of a certain task by the receiver. In this paper, the receiver task is modeled by an optimization problem whose parameters have to be compressed by the transmitter. Motivated by applications such as the smart grid, this paper focuses on a goal function which is of $L_p$-norm-type. The aim is to design the precoding, quantization, and decoding stages such that the maximum of the goal function obtained with the compressed version of the parameters is as close as possible to the maximum obtained without compression. The numerical analysis, based on real smart grid signals, clearly shows the benefits of the proposed approach compared to the conventional distortion-based compression paradigm.</description>

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) networks have been envisioned as a prospective technology for achieving higher system capacity, improved performance, and ultra-high reliability in 6G networks. However, due to severe attenuation and limited scattering in THz transmission, as well as high power consumption for increased number of access points (APs), further improvement of network capacity becomes challenging. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been introduced as a low-cost solution to reduce AP deployment and assist in data transmission. However, due to the ultra-wide bandwidth and frequency-dependent characteristics of RISs, beam split effect has become an unavoidable obstacle. To compensate the severe performance degradation caused by beam split effect, we introduce additional time delay (TD) layers at both access points (APs) and RISs. Accordingly, we propose a joint precoding framework at APs and RISs to fully unleash the potential of the considered network. Specifically, we first formulate the joint precoding as a non-convex optimization problem. Then, given the location of unchanged RISs, we adjust the time delays (TDs) of APs to align the generated beams towards RISs. After that, with knowledge of the optimal TDs of APs, we decouple the optimization problem into three subproblems of optimizing the baseband beamformers, RISs and TDs of RISs, respectively. Exploiting multidimensional complex quadratic transform, we transform the subproblems into convex forms and solve them under alternate optimizing framework. Numerical results verify that the proposed method can effectively mitigate beam split effect and significantly improve the achievable rate compared with conventional cell-free mMIMO networks.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Spatial and Temporal Correlations in Massive MIMO Systems Over Non-Stationary Aging Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a multi-user, multi-antenna uplink wireless system, where multiple users transmit signals to a base station. Previous research has explored the potential for linear growth in spectral efficiency by employing multiple transmit and receive antennas. This gain depends on the quality of channel state information and uncorrelated antennas. However, spatial correlations, arising from closely-spaced antennas, and channel aging effects, stemming from the difference between the channel at pilot and data time instances, can substantially counteract these benefits and degrade the transmission rate, especially in non-stationary environments. To address these challenges, this work introduces a real-time beamforming framework to compensate for the spatial correlation effect. A channel estimation scheme is then developed, leveraging temporal channel correlations and considering mobile device velocity and antenna spacing. Subsequently, an expression approximating the average spectral efficiency is obtained, dependent on pilot spacing, pilot and data powers, and beamforming vectors. By maximizing this expression, optimal parameters are identified. Numerical results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to prior works. Moreover, optimal pilot spacing remains unaffected by interference components such as path loss and the velocity of interference users. The impact of interference components also diminishes with an increasing number of transmit antennas.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Informed Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the matrix completion problem, where the objective is to reconstruct a low-rank matrix from a few observed entries. A commonly employed approach involves nuclear norm minimization. For this method to succeed, the number of observed entries needs to scale at least proportional to both the rank of the ground-truth matrix and the coherence parameter. While the only prior information is oftentimes the low-rank nature of the ground-truth matrix, in various real-world scenarios, additional knowledge about the ground-truth low-rank matrix is available. For instance, in collaborative filtering, Netflix problem, and dynamic channel estimation in wireless communications, we have partial or full knowledge about the signal subspace in advance. Specifically, we are aware of some subspaces that form multiple angles with the column and row spaces of the ground-truth matrix. Leveraging this valuable information has the potential to significantly reduce the required number of observations. To this end, we introduce a multi-weight nuclear norm optimization problem that concurrently promotes the low-rank property as well the information about the available subspaces. The proposed weights are tailored to penalize each angle corresponding to each basis of the prior subspace independently. We further propose an optimal weight selection strategy by minimizing the coherence parameter of the ground-truth matrix, which is equivalent to minimizing the required number of observations. Simulation results validate the advantages of incorporating multiple weights in the completion procedure. Specifically, our proposed multi-weight optimization problem demonstrates a substantial reduction in the required number of observations compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transmitter Design and Pilot Spacing in MIMO Non-Stationary Aging Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers an uplink wireless communication system where multiple users with multiple antennas transmit data frames over dynamic channels. Previous studies have shown that multiple transmit and receive antennas can substantially enhance the sum-capacity of all users when the channel is known at the transmitter and in the case of uncorrelated transmit and receive antennas. However, spatial correlations stemming from close proximity of transmit antennas and channel variation between pilot and data time slots, known as channel aging, can substantially degrade the transmission rate if they are not properly into account. In this work, we provide an analytical framework to concurrently exploit both of these features. Specifically, we first propose a beamforming framework to capture spatial correlations. Then, based on random matrix theory tools, we introduce a deterministic expression that approximates the average sum-capacity of all users. Subsequently, we obtain the optimal values of pilot spacing and beamforming vectors upon maximizing this expression. Simulation results show the impacts of path loss, velocity of mobile users and Rician factor on the resulting sum-capacity and underscore the efficacy of our methodology compared to prior works.</description>

      <title>Improved Downlink Channel Estimation in Time-Varying FDD Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of accurately obtaining channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) for frequency division duplexing (FDD) multiple input multiple output systems. Although CSIT is vital for maximizing spatial multiplexing gains, traditional CSIT estimation methods often suffer from impracticality due to the substantial training and feedback overhead they require. To address this challenge, we leverage two sources of prior information simultaneously: the presence of limited local scatterers at the base station (BS) and the time-varying characteristics of the channel. The former results in a redundant angular sparsity of users' channels exceeding the spatial dimension (i.e., the number of BS antennas), while the latter provides a prior non-uniform distribution in the angular domain. We propose a weighted optimization framework that simultaneously reflects both of these features. The optimal weights are then obtained by minimizing the expected recovery error of the optimization problem. This establishes an analytical closed-form relationship between the optimal weights and the angular domain characteristics. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach in reducing the recovery error and consequently resulting in decreased training and feedback overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G mmWave roadside networks promise high-speed wireless connectivity, but face significant challenges in maintaining reliable connections for users moving at high speed. Frequent handovers, complex beam alignment, and signal attenuation due to obstacles like car bodies lead to service interruptions and degraded performance. We present Wall-Street, a smart surface installed on vehicles to enhance 5G mmWave connectivity for users inside. Wall-Street improves mobility management by (1) steering outdoor mmWave signals into the vehicle, ensuring coverage for all users; (2) enabling simultaneous serving cell data transfer and candidate handover cell measurement, allowing seamless handovers without service interruption; and (3) combining beams from source and target cells during a handover to increase reliability. Through its flexible and diverse signal manipulation capabilities, Wall-Street provides uninterrupted high-speed connectivity for latency-sensitive applications in challenging mobile environments. We have implemented and integrated Wall-Street in the COSMOS testbed and evaluated its real-time performance with four gNBs and a mobile client inside a surface-enabled vehicle, driving on a nearby road. Wall-Street achieves a 2.5-3.4x TCP throughput improvement and a 0.4-0.8x reduction in delay over a baseline 5G Standalone handover protocol.</description>

      <title>Time-of-arrival Estimation and Phase Unwrapping of Head-related Transfer Functions With Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In binaural audio synthesis, aligning head-related impulse responses (HRIRs) in time has been an important pre-processing step, enabling accurate spatial interpolation and efficient data compression. The maximum correlation time delay between spatially nearby HRIRs has previously been used to get accurate and smooth alignment by solving a matrix equation in which the solution has the minimum Euclidean distance to the time delay. However, the Euclidean criterion could lead to an over-smoothing solution in practice. In this paper, we solve the smoothing issue by formulating the task as solving an integer linear programming problem equivalent to minimising an $L^1$-norm. Moreover, we incorporate 1) the cross-correlation of inter-aural HRIRs, and 2) HRIRs with their minimum-phase responses to have more reference measurements for optimisation. We show the proposed method can get more accurate alignments than the Euclidean-based method by comparing the spectral reconstruction loss of time-aligned HRIRs using spherical harmonics representation on seven HRIRs consisting of human and dummy heads. The extra correlation features and the $L^1$-norm are also beneficial in extremely noisy conditions. In addition, this method can be applied to phase unwrapping of head-related transfer functions, where the unwrapped phase could be a compact feature for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>High-Order Synchrosqueezed Chirplet Transforms for Multicomponent Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the analysis of signals containing multiple components with crossover instantaneous frequencies (IF). This problem was initially solved with the chirplet transform (CT). Also, it can be sharpened by adding the synchrosqueezing step, which is called the synchrosqueezed chirplet transform (SCT). However, we found that the SCT goes wrong with the high chirp modulation signal due to the wrong estimation of the IF. In this paper, we present the improvement of the post-transformation of the CT. The main goal of this paper is to amend the estimation introduced in the SCT and carry out the high-order synchrosqueezed chirplet transform. The proposed method reduces the wrong estimation when facing a stronger variety of chirp-modulated multi-component signals. The theoretical analysis of the new reassignment ingredient is provided. Numerical experiments on some synthetic signals are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed high-order SCT.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided Radar Spoofing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic countermeasure (ECM) technology plays a critical role in modern electronic warfare, which can interfere with enemy radar detection systems by noise or deceptive signals. However, the conventional active jamming strategy incurs additional hardware and power costs and has the potential threat of exposing the target itself. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a new intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided radar spoofing strategy in this letter, where IRS is deployed on the surface of a target to help eliminate the signals reflected towards the hostile radar to shield the target, while simultaneously redirecting its reflected signal towards a surrounding clutter to generate deceptive angle-of-arrival (AoA) sensing information for the radar. We optimize the IRS's reflection to maximize the received signal power at the radar from the direction of the selected clutter subject to the constraint that its received power from the direction of the target is lower than a given detection threshold. We first solve this non-convex optimization problem using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method and further propose a lower-complexity solution for real-time implementation. Simulation results validate the efficacy of our proposed IRS-aided spoofing system as compared to various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existing methods for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) beamforming in wireless communication are typically limited to uniform phase quantization. However, in real world applications, the phase and bit resolution of RIS units are often non-uniform due to practical requirements and engineering challenges. To fill this research gap, we formulate an optimization problem for discrete non-uniform phase configuration in RIS assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) communications. Subsequently, a partition-and-traversal (PAT) algorithm is proposed to solve that, achieving the global optimal solution. The efficacy and superiority of the PAT algorithm are validated through numerical simulations, and the impact of non-uniform phase quantization on system performance is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the Hypercomplex: Inductive Biases in Hypercomplex Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypercomplex algebras have recently been gaining prominence in the field of deep learning owing to the advantages of their division algebras over real vector spaces and their superior results when dealing with multidimensional signals in real-world 3D and 4D paradigms. This paper provides a foundational framework that serves as a roadmap for understanding why hypercomplex deep learning methods are so successful and how their potential can be exploited. Such a theoretical framework is described in terms of inductive bias, i.e., a collection of assumptions, properties, and constraints that are built into training algorithms to guide their learning process toward more efficient and accurate solutions. We show that it is possible to derive specific inductive biases in the hypercomplex domains, which extend complex numbers to encompass diverse numbers and data structures. These biases prove effective in managing the distinctive properties of these domains, as well as the complex structures of multidimensional and multimodal signals. This novel perspective for hypercomplex deep learning promises to both demystify this class of methods and clarify their potential, under a unifying framework, and in this way promotes hypercomplex models as viable alternatives to traditional real-valued deep learning for multidimensional signal processing.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Decentralized Stochastic Successive Convex Approximation for composite non-convex problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Successive Convex approximation (SCA) methods have shown to improve the empirical convergence of non-convex optimization problems over proximal gradient-based methods. In decentralized optimization, which aims to optimize a global function using only local information, the SCA framework has been successfully applied to achieve improved convergence. Still, the stochastic first order (SFO) complexity of decentralized SCA algorithms has remained understudied. While non-asymptotic convergence analysis has been studied for decentralized deterministic settings, its stochastic counterpart has only been shown to converge asymptotically.
  We have analyzed a novel accelerated variant of the decentralized stochastic SCA that minimizes the sum of non-convex (possibly smooth) and convex (possibly non-smooth) cost functions. The algorithm viz. Decentralized Momentum-based Stochastic SCA (D-MSSCA), iteratively solves a series of strongly convex subproblems at each node using one sample at each iteration. The key step in non-asymptotic analysis involves proving that the average output state vector moves in the descent direction of the global function. This descent allows us to obtain a bound on average \textit{iterate progress} and \emph{mean-squared stationary gap}. The recursive momentum-based updates at each node contribute to achieving stochastic first order (SFO) complexity of O(\epsilon^{-3/2}) provided that the step sizes are smaller than the given upper bounds. Even with one sample used at each iteration and a non-adaptive step size, the rate is at par with the SFO complexity of decentralized state-of-the-art gradient-based algorithms. The rate also matches the lower bound for the centralized, unconstrained optimization problems. Through a synthetic example, the applicability of D-MSSCA is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Capacity Maximization for Base Station with Hybrid Fixed and Movable Antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an effective solution for enhancing wireless network capacity through the adjustment of both 3D positions and 3D rotations of distributed antennas/antenna surfaces. Although freely positioning/rotating 6DMA surfaces offers the greatest flexibility and thus highest capacity improvement, its implementation may be challenging in practice due to the drastic architecture change required for existing base stations (BSs), which predominantly adopt fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays (e.g., sector antenna arrays). Thus, we introduce in this letter a new BS architecture called hybrid fixed and movable antennas (HFMA), which consists of both conventional FPA arrays and position/rotation-adjustable 6DMA surfaces. For ease of implementation, we consider that all 6DMA surfaces can rotate along a circular track above the FPA arrays. We aim to maximize the network capacity via optimizing the rotation angles of all 6DMA surfaces based on the users' spatial distribution. Since this problem is combinatorial and its optimal solution requires prohibitively high computational complexity via exhaustive search, we propose an alternative adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo based method to solve it more efficiently. Finally, we present simulation results that show significant performance gains achieved by our proposed design over various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel Supervised Info-enhanced Contrastive Learning framework for EEG based Emotion Recognition (SICLEER). SI-CLEER employs multi-granularity contrastive learning to create robust EEG contextual representations, potentiallyn improving emotion recognition effectiveness. Unlike existing methods solely guided by classification loss, we propose a joint learning model combining self-supervised contrastive learning loss and supervised classification loss. This model optimizes both loss functions, capturing subtle EEG signal differences specific to emotion detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate SI-CLEER's robustness and superior accuracy on the SEED dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we analyze electrode performance, highlighting the significance of central frontal and temporal brain region EEGs in emotion detection. This study offers an universally applicable approach with potential benefits for diverse EEG classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming with Gradient-based Liquid Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication with the advanced beamforming technologies is a key enabler to meet the growing demands of future mobile communication. However, the dynamic nature of cellular channels in large-scale urban mmWave MIMO communication scenarios brings substantial challenges, particularly in terms of complexity and robustness. To address these issues, we propose a robust gradient-based liquid neural network (GLNN) framework that utilizes ordinary differential equation-based liquid neurons to solve the beamforming problem. Specifically, our proposed GLNN framework takes gradients of the optimization objective function as inputs to extract the high-order channel feature information, and then introduces a residual connection to mitigate the training burden. Furthermore, we use the manifold learning technique to compress the search space of the beamforming problem. These designs enable the GLNN to effectively maintain low complexity while ensuring strong robustness to noisy and highly dynamic channels. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the GLNN can achieve 4.15% higher spectral efficiency than that of typical iterative algorithms, and reduce the time consumption to only 1.61% that of conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Identifying Hate Speech Peddlers in Online Platforms. A Bayesian Social Learning Approach for Large Language Model Driven Decision-Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of autonomous agents performing Bayesian social learning for sequential detection when the observations of the state belong to a high-dimensional space and are expensive to analyze. Specifically, when the observations are textual, the Bayesian agent can use a large language model (LLM) as a map to get a low-dimensional private observation. The agent performs Bayesian learning and takes an action that minimizes the expected cost and is visible to subsequent agents. We prove that a sequence of such Bayesian agents herd in finite time to the public belief and take the same action disregarding the private observations. We propose a stopping time formulation for quickest time herding in social learning and optimally balance privacy and herding. Structural results are shown on the threshold nature of the optimal policy to the stopping time problem. We illustrate the application of our framework when autonomous Bayesian detectors aim to sequentially identify if a user is a hate speech peddler on an online platform by parsing text observations using an LLM. We numerically validate our results on real-world hate speech datasets. We show that autonomous Bayesian agents designed to flag hate speech peddlers in online platforms herd and misclassify the users when the public prior is strong. We also numerically show the effect of a threshold policy in delaying herding.</description>

      <title>Channel Coding Toward 6G: Technical Overview and Outlook</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel coding plays a pivotal role in ensuring reliable communication over wireless channels. With the growing need for ultra-reliable communication in emerging wireless use cases, the significance of channel coding has amplified. Furthermore, minimizing decoding latency is crucial for critical-mission applications, while optimizing energy efficiency is paramount for mobile and the Internet of Things (IoT) communications. As the fifth generation (5G) of mobile communications is currently in operation and 5G-advanced is on the horizon, the objective of this paper is to assess prominent channel coding schemes in the context of recent advancements and the anticipated requirements for the sixth generation (6G). In this paper, after considering the potential impact of channel coding on key performance indicators (KPIs) of wireless networks, we review the evolution of mobile communication standards and the organizations involved in the standardization, from the first generation (1G) to the current 5G, highlighting the technologies integral to achieving targeted KPIs such as reliability, data rate, latency, energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, connection density, and traffic capacity. Following this, we delve into the anticipated requirements for potential use cases in 6G. The subsequent sections of the paper focus on a comprehensive review of three primary coding schemes utilized in past generations and their recent advancements: low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, turbo codes (including convolutional codes), polar codes (alongside Reed-Muller codes). Additionally, we examine alternative coding schemes like Fountain codes and sparse regression codes. Our evaluation includes a comparative analysis of error correction performance and the performance of hardware implementation for these coding schemes, providing insights into their potential and suitability for the upcoming 6G era.</description>

      <title>On the Coexistence of eMBB and URLLC in the Cell-Free Massive MIMO Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-orthogonal coexistence between the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and the enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) in the downlink of a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. We provide a unified information-theoretic framework that combines a finite-blocklength analysis of the URLLC error probability based on the use of mismatched decoding with an infinite-blocklength analysis of the eMBB spectral efficiency. Superposition coding and three levels of puncturing are considered as alternative downlink coexistence strategies to cope with the inter-service interference and the URLLC random activation pattern, under the assumption of imperfect pilot-based channel state information acquisition at the access points and statistical channel knowledge at the users. Numerical results shed light into the trade-off between eMBB and URLLC performances considering different precoding and power control strategies.</description>

Abstract: Smart signal processing approaches using Artificial Intelligence are gaining momentum in NMR applications. In this study, we demonstrate that AI offers new opportunities beyond tasks addressed by traditional techniques. We developed and trained several artificial neural networks in our new toolbox Magnetic Resonance with Artificial intelligence (MR-Ai) to solve three "impossible" problems: quadrature detection using only Echo (or Anti-Echo) modulation from the traditional Echo/Anti-Echo scheme; accessing uncertainty of signal intensity at each point in a spectrum processed by any given method; and defining a reference-free score for quantitative access of NMR spectrum quality. Our findings highlight the potential of AI techniques to revolutionize NMR processing and analysis.</description>

      <title>Waste Factor and Waste Figure: A Unified Theory for Modeling and Analyzing Wasted Power in Radio Access Networks for Improved Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Waste Factor (W), also denoted as Waste Figure (WF) in dB, a promising new metric for quantifying energy efficiency in a wide range of circuits and systems applications, including data centers and RANs. Also, the networks used to connect data centers and AI computing engines with users for ML applications must become more power efficient. This paper illustrates the limitations of existing energy efficiency metrics that inadequately capture the intricate energy dynamics of RAN components. We delineate the methodology for applying W across various network configurations, including MISO, SIMO, and MIMO systems, and demonstrate the effectiveness of W in identifying energy optimization opportunities. Our findings reveal that W not only offers nuanced insights into the energy performance of RANs but also facilitates informed decision-making for network design and operational efficiency. Furthermore, we show how W can be integrated with other KPIs to guide the development of optimal strategies for enhancing network energy efficiency under different operational conditions. Additionally, we present simulation results for a distributed multi-user MIMO system at 3.5, 17, and 28 GHz, demonstrating overall network power efficiency on a per square kilometer basis, and show how overall W decreases with an increasing number of base stations and increasing carrier frequency. This paper shows that adopting W as a figure of merit can significantly contribute to the sustainability and energy optimization of next-generation wireless communication networks, paving the way for greener and more sustainable, energy-efficient 5G and 6G technologies.</description>

      <title>SAR Image Synthesis with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models (DMs) have become a popular method for generating synthetic data. By achieving samples of higher quality, they quickly became superior to generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the current state-of-the-art method in generative modeling. However, their potential has not yet been exploited in radar, where the lack of available training data is a long-standing problem. In this work, a specific type of DMs, namely denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is adapted to the SAR domain. We investigate the network choice and specific diffusion parameters for conditional and unconditional SAR image generation. In our experiments, we show that DDPM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based methods for SAR image generation. Finally, we show that DDPM profits from pretraining on largescale clutter data, generating SAR images of even higher quality.</description>

      <title>Design of an ultra-compact, energy-efficient non-volatile photonic switch based on phase change materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The on-chip photonic switch is a critical building block for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and the integration of phase change materials (PCMs) enables non-volatile switch designs that are compact, low-loss, and energy-efficient. Existing switch designs based on these materials typically rely on weak evanescent field interactions, resulting in devices with a large footprint and high energy consumption. Here we present a compact non-volatile 2 by 2 switch design leveraging optical concentration in slot waveguide modes to significantly enhance interactions of light with PCMs, thereby realizing a compact, efficient photonic switch. To further improve the device's energy efficiency, we introduce an integrated single-layer graphene heater for ultrafast electrothermal switching of the PCM. Computational simulations demonstrate a 2 by 2 switch with crosstalk (CT) down to -24 dB at 1550 nm wavelength and more than 55 nm 0.3 dB insertion loss (IL) bandwidth. The proposed photonic switch architecture can constitute the cornerstone for next-generation high-performance reconfigurable photonic circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a sensor placement problem where sensors can move within a network over time. Sensor placement problem aims to select K sensor positions from N candidates where K &lt; N. Most existing methods assume that sensor positions are static, i.e., they do not move, however, many mobile sensors like drones, robots, and vehicles can change their positions over time. Moreover, underlying measurement conditions could also be changed, which are difficult to cover with statically placed sensors. We tackle the problem by allowing the sensors to change their positions in their neighbors on the network. We sequentially learn the dictionary from a pool of observed signals on the network based on graph sampling theory. Using the learned dictionary, we dynamically determine the sensor positions such that the non-observed signals on the network can be best recovered from the observations. In experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method via the mean squared error (MSE) of the reconstructed signals. The proposed dynamic sensor placement outperforms the existing static ones for both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Aberration Correction via Optimal Bulk Speed of Sound Compensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diagnostic ultrasound is a versatile and practical tool in the abdomen, and is particularly vital toward the detection and mitigation of early-stage non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, its performance in those with obesity -- who are at increased risk for NAFLD -- is degraded due to distortions of the ultrasound as it traverses thicker, acoustically heterogeneous body walls (aberration). Many aberration correction methods for ultrasound require measures of channel data relationships. Simpler, bulk speed of sound optimizations based on the image itself have demonstrated empirical efficacy, but their analytical limitations have not been evaluated. Herein, we assess analytically the bounds of a single, optimal speed of sound correction in receive beamforming to correct aberration, and improve the resulting images. Additionally, we propose an objective metric on the post-sum B-mode image to identify this speed of sound, and validate this technique through in virto phantom experiments and in vivo abdominal ultrasound data collection with physical aberrating layers. We find that a bulk correction may approximate the aberration profile for layers of relevant thicknesses (1 to 3 cm) and speeds of sound (1400 to 1500 m/s). Additionally, through in vitro experiments, we show significant improvement in resolution (average point target width reduced by 60 %) and improved boundary delineation in vivo with bulk speed of sound correction determined automatically from the beamformed images. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of simple, efficient bulk speed of sound correction to improve the quality of diagnostic liver images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for future wireless communications due to its capability of optimizing the propagation environments. Nevertheless, in literature, there are few prototypes serving multiple users. In this paper, we propose a whole flow of channel estimation and beamforming design for RIS, and set up an RIS-aided multi-user system for experimental validations. Specifically, we combine a channel sparsification step with generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm, and propose to generate the measurement matrix as Rademacher distribution to obtain the channel state information (CSI). To generate the reflection coefficients with the aim of maximizing the spectral efficiency, we propose a quadratic transform-based low-rank multi-user beamforming (QTLM) algorithm. Our proposed algorithms exploit the sparsity and low-rank properties of the channel, which has the advantages of light calculation and fast convergence. Based on the universal software radio peripheral devices, we built a complete testbed working at 5.8GHz and implemented all the proposed algorithms to verify the possibility of RIS assisting multi-user systems. Experimental results show that the system has obtained an average spectral efficiency increase of 13.48bps/Hz, with respective received power gains of 26.6dB and 17.5dB for two users, compared with the case when RIS is powered-off.</description>

Abstract: Current deep learning algorithms designed for automatic ECG analysis have exhibited notable accuracy. However, akin to traditional electrocardiography, they tend to be narrowly focused and typically address a singular diagnostic condition. In this exploratory study, we specifically investigate the capability of a single model to predict a diverse range of both cardiac and non-cardiac discharge diagnoses based on a sole ECG collected in the emergency department. We find that 253, 81 cardiac, and 172 non-cardiac, ICD codes can be reliably predicted in the sense of exceeding an AUROC score of 0.8 in a statistically significant manner. This underscores the model's proficiency in handling a wide array of cardiac and non-cardiac diagnostic scenarios which demonstrates potential as a screening tool for diverse medical encounters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses a near-field imaging problem utilizing extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) antennas and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) already in place for wireless communications. To this end, we consider a system with a fixed transmitting antenna array illuminating a region of interest (ROI) and a fixed receiving antenna array inferring the ROI's scattering coefficients. Leveraging XL-MIMO and high frequencies, the ROI is situated in the radiative near-field region of both antenna arrays, thus enhancing the degrees of freedom (DoF) (i.e., the channel matrix rank) of the illuminating and sensing channels available for imaging, here referred to as holographic imaging. To further boost the imaging performance, we optimize the illuminating waveform by solving a min-max optimization problem having the upper bound of the mean squared error (MSE) of the image estimate as the objective function. Additionally, we address the challenge of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios by considering the presence of a RIS and deriving its optimal reflection coefficients. Numerical results investigate the interplay between illumination optimization, geometric configuration (monostatic and bistatic), the DoF of the illuminating and sensing channels, image estimation accuracy, and image complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first measurement of the atmospheric optical turbulence profile using the transmitted beam from a satellite laser communication terminal. A Ring Image Next Generation Scintillation Sensor (RINGSS) instrument for turbulence profiling, as described in Tokovinin (MNRAS, 502.1, 2021, 747-808), was deployed at the NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Table Mountain Facility (TMF) in California. The optical turbulence profile was measured with the downlink optical beam from the Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD) Geostationary satellite. LCRD conducts links with the Optical Communication Telescope Laboratory ground station and the RINGSS instrument was co-located at TMF to conduct measurements. Turbulence profiles were measured at day and night and atmospheric coherence lengths were compared with other turbulence monitors such as a solar scintillometer and Polaris motion monitor. RINGSS sensitivity to boundary layer turbulence, a feature not provided by many profilers, is also shown to agree with a boundary layer scintillometer at TMF (R=0.85). Diurnal evolution of optical turbulence and measured profiles are presented. The correlation of RINGSS with other turbulence monitors (R=0.75-0.86) demonstrates the concept of free-space optical communications turbulence profiling, which could be adopted as a way to support optical ground stations in a future Geostationary feeder link network. These results also provide further evidence that RINGSS, a relatively new instrument concept, correlates well with other instruments in daytime and nighttime turbulence.</description>

      <title>The Sandwich meta-framework for architecture agnostic deep privacy-preserving transfer learning for non-invasive brainwave decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has enhanced the performance of decoding signals indicating human behaviour. EEG decoding, as an exemplar indicating neural activity and human thoughts non-invasively, has been helpful in neural activity analysis and aiding patients via brain-computer interfaces. However, training machine learning algorithms on EEG encounters two primary challenges: variability across data sets and privacy concerns using data from individuals and data centres. Our objective is to address these challenges by integrating transfer learning for data variability and federated learning for data privacy into a unified approach. We introduce the Sandwich as a novel deep privacy-preserving meta-framework combining transfer learning and federated learning. The Sandwich framework comprises three components: federated networks (first layers) that handle data set differences at the input level, a shared network (middle layer) learning common rules and applying transfer learning, and individual classifiers (final layers) for specific tasks of each data set. It enables the central network (central server) to benefit from multiple data sets, while local branches (local servers) maintain data and label privacy. We evaluated the `Sandwich' meta-architecture in various configurations using the BEETL motor imagery challenge, a benchmark for heterogeneous EEG data sets. Compared with baseline models, our `Sandwich' implementations showed superior performance. The best-performing model, the Inception Sandwich with deep set alignment (Inception-SD-Deepset), exceeded baseline methods by 9%. The `Sandwich' framework demonstrates significant advancements in federated deep transfer learning for diverse tasks and data sets. It outperforms conventional deep learning methods, showcasing the potential for effective use of larger, heterogeneous data sets with enhanced privacy as a model-agnostic meta-framework.</description>

Abstract: The surge in AI usage demands innovative power reduction strategies. Novel Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architectures, leveraging advanced memory technologies, hold the potential for significantly lowering energy consumption by integrating storage with parallel Matrix-Vector-Multiplications (MVMs). This study addresses the 1T1R RRAM crossbar, a core component in numerous CIM architectures. We introduce an abstract model and a calibration methodology for estimating operational energy. Our tool condenses circuit-level behaviour into a few parameters, facilitating energy assessments for DNN workloads. Validation against low-level SPICE simulations demonstrates speedups of up to 1000x and energy estimations with errors below 1%.</description>

      <title>Cooperative ISAC Networks: Opportunities and Challenges</title>

Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a cornerstone technology for the forth upcoming sixth generation era, seamlessly incorporating sensing functionality into wireless networks as a native capability. The main challenges in efficient ISAC are constituted by its limited sensing and communication coverage, as well as severe inter-cell interference. Network-level ISAC relying on multi-cell cooperation is capable of effectively expanding both the sensing and communication (S&amp;C) coverage and of providing extra degrees of freedom (DoF) for realizing increased integration gains between S&amp;C. In this work, we provide new considerations for ISAC networks, including new metrics, the optimization of the DoF, cooperation regimes, and highlight new S&amp;C tradeoffs. Then, we discuss a suite of cooperative S&amp;C architectures both at the task, as well as data, and signal levels. Furthermore, the interplay between S&amp;C at the network level is investigated and promising research directions are outlined.</description>

      <title>Compensation of Phase Noise in Massive-MIMO Uplink Communications Based on Expectation-Maximization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase noise (PN) is a major disturbance in MIMO systems, where the contribution of different oscillators at the transmitter and the receiver side may degrade the overall performance and offset the gains offered by MIMO techniques. This is even more crucial in the case of massive MIMO, since the number of PN sources may increase considerably. In this work, we propose an iterative receiver based on the application of the expectation-maximization algorithm. We consider a massive MIMO framework with a general association of oscillators to antennas, and include other channel disturbances like imperfect channel state information and Rician block fading. At each receiver iteration, given the information on the transmitted symbols, steepest descent is used to estimate the PN samples, with an optimized adaptive step size and a threshold-based stopping rule. The results obtained for several test cases show how the bit error rate and mean square error can benefit from the proposed phase-detection algorithm, even to the point of reaching the same performance as in the case where no PN is present, offering better results than a state-of-the-art alternative. Further analysis of the results allow to draw some useful trade-offs respecting final performance and consumption of resources.</description>

      <title>Auto-Linear Phenomenon in Subsurface Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subsurface imaging involves solving full waveform inversion (FWI) to predict geophysical properties from measurements. This problem can be reframed as an image-to-image translation, with the usual approach being to train an encoder-decoder network using paired data from two domains: geophysical property and measurement. A recent seminal work (InvLINT) demonstrates there is only a linear mapping between the latent spaces of the two domains, and the decoder requires paired data for training.
  This paper extends this direction by demonstrating that only linear mapping necessitates paired data, while both the encoder and decoder can be learned from their respective domains through self-supervised learning. This unveils an intriguing phenomenon (named Auto-Linear) where the self-learned features of two separate domains are automatically linearly correlated. Compared with existing methods, our Auto-Linear has four advantages: (a) solving both forward and inverse modeling simultaneously, (b) applicable to different subsurface imaging tasks and achieving markedly better results than previous methods, (c)enhanced performance, especially in scenarios with limited paired data and in the presence of noisy data, and (d) strong generalization ability of the trained encoder and decoder.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization with Formal Safety Guarantees via Online Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-box zero-th order optimization is a central primitive for applications in fields as diverse as finance, physics, and engineering. In a common formulation of this problem, a designer sequentially attempts candidate solutions, receiving noisy feedback on the value of each attempt from the system. In this paper, we study scenarios in which feedback is also provided on the safety of the attempted solution, and the optimizer is constrained to limit the number of unsafe solutions that are tried throughout the optimization process. Focusing on methods based on Bayesian optimization (BO), prior art has introduced an optimization scheme -- referred to as SAFEOPT -- that is guaranteed not to select any unsafe solution with a controllable probability over feedback noise as long as strict assumptions on the safety constraint function are met. In this paper, a novel BO-based approach is introduced that satisfies safety requirements irrespective of properties of the constraint function. This strong theoretical guarantee is obtained at the cost of allowing for an arbitrary, controllable but non-zero, rate of violation of the safety constraint. The proposed method, referred to as SAFE-BOCP, builds on online conformal prediction (CP) and is specialized to the cases in which feedback on the safety constraint is either noiseless or noisy. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data validate the advantages and flexibility of the proposed SAFE-BOCP.</description>

      <title>AudioLDM 2: Learning Holistic Audio Generation with Self-supervised Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although audio generation shares commonalities across different types of audio, such as speech, music, and sound effects, designing models for each type requires careful consideration of specific objectives and biases that can significantly differ from those of other types. To bring us closer to a unified perspective of audio generation, this paper proposes a framework that utilizes the same learning method for speech, music, and sound effect generation. Our framework introduces a general representation of audio, called "language of audio" (LOA). Any audio can be translated into LOA based on AudioMAE, a self-supervised pre-trained representation learning model. In the generation process, we translate any modalities into LOA by using a GPT-2 model, and we perform self-supervised audio generation learning with a latent diffusion model conditioned on LOA. The proposed framework naturally brings advantages such as in-context learning abilities and reusable self-supervised pretrained AudioMAE and latent diffusion models. Experiments on the major benchmarks of text-to-audio, text-to-music, and text-to-speech demonstrate state-of-the-art or competitive performance against previous approaches. Our code, pretrained model, and demo are available at https://audioldm.github.io/audioldm2.</description>

Abstract: Near-space information networks (NSINs) composed of high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and high- and low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a new regime for providing quick, robust, and cost-efficient sensing and communication services. Precipitated by innovations and breakthroughs in manufacturing, materials, communications, electronics, and control techniques, NSINs have been envisioned as an essential component of the emerging sixth-generation of mobile communication systems. This article reveals some critical issues needing to be tackled in NSINs through conducting experiments and discusses the latest advances in NSINs in the research areas of channel modeling, networking, and transmission from a forward-looking, comparative, and technical evolutionary perspective. In this article, we highlight the characteristics of NSINs and present the promising use cases of NSINs. The impact of airborne platforms' unstable movements on the phase delays of onboard antenna arrays with diverse structures is mathematically analyzed. The recent advances in HAP channel modeling are elaborated on, along with the significant differences between HAP and UAV channel modeling. A comprehensive review of the networking techniques of NSINs in network deployment, handoff management, and network management aspects is provided. Besides, the promising techniques and communication protocols of the physical (PHY) layer, medium access control (MAC) layer, network layer, and transport layer of NSINs for achieving efficient transmission over NSINs are reviewed, and we have conducted experiments with practical NSINs to verify the performance of some techniques. Finally, we outline some open issues and promising directions for NSINs deserved for future study and discuss the corresponding challenges.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Positioning and Attitude Sensing Based on Electromagnetic Propagation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positioning and sensing over wireless networks are imperative for many emerging applications. However, since traditional wireless channel models over-simplify the user equipment (UE) as a point target, they cannot be used for sensing the attitude of the UE, which is typically described by the spatial orientation. In this paper, a comprehensive electromagnetic propagation modeling (EPM) based on electromagnetic theory is developed to precisely model the near-field channel. For the noise-free case, the EPM model establishes the non-linear functional dependence of observed signals on both the position and attitude of the UE. To address the difficulty in the non-linear coupling, we first propose to divide the distance domain into three regions, separated by the defined Phase ambiguity distance and Spacing constraint distance. Then, for each region, we obtain the closed-form solutions for joint position and attitude estimation with low complexity. Next, to investigate the impact of random noise on the joint estimation performance, the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) is derived to yield useful insights. The expected Cram\'er-Rao bound (ECRB) is further provided to obtain the simplified closed-form expressions for the performance lower bounds. Our numerical results demonstrate that the derived ZZB can provide accurate predictions of the performance of estimators in all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. More importantly, we achieve the millimeter-level accuracy in position estimation and attain the 0.1-level accuracy in attitude estimation.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for Near-Field Communications: Fundamentals, Tools, and Outlooks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple output (XL-MIMO) is a promising technology to achieve high spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) in future wireless systems. The larger array aperture of XL-MIMO makes communication scenarios closer to the near-field region. Therefore, near-field resource allocation is essential in realizing the above key performance indicators (KPIs). Moreover, the overall performance of XL-MIMO systems heavily depends on the channel characteristics of the selected users, eliminating interference between users through beamforming, power control, etc. The above resource allocation issue constitutes a complex joint multi-objective optimization problem since many variables and parameters must be optimized, including the spatial degree of freedom, rate, power allocation, and transmission technique. In this article, we review the basic properties of near-field communications and focus on the corresponding "resource allocation" problems. First, we identify available resources in near-field communication systems and highlight their distinctions from far-field communications. Then, we summarize optimization tools, such as numerical techniques and machine learning methods, for addressing near-field resource allocation, emphasizing their strengths and limitations. Finally, several important research directions of near-field communications are pointed out for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Protecting the Future of Information: LOCO Coding With Error Detection for DNA Data Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DNA strands serve as a storage medium for $4$-ary data over the alphabet $\{A,T,G,C\}$. DNA data storage promises formidable information density, long-term durability, and ease of replicability. However, information in this intriguing storage technology might be corrupted. Experiments have revealed that DNA sequences with long homopolymers and/or with low $GC$-content are notably more subject to errors upon storage.
  This paper investigates the utilization of the recently-introduced method for designing lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) codes in DNA data storage. This paper introduces DNA LOCO (D-LOCO) codes, over the alphabet $\{A,T,G,C\}$ with limited runs of identical symbols. These codes come with an encoding-decoding rule we derive, which provides affordable encoding-decoding algorithms. In terms of storage overhead, the proposed encoding-decoding algorithms outperform those in the existing literature. Our algorithms are readily reconfigurable. D-LOCO codes are intrinsically balanced, which allows us to achieve balancing over the entire DNA strand with minimal rate penalty. Moreover, we propose four schemes to bridge consecutive codewords, three of which guarantee single substitution error detection per codeword. We examine the probability of undetecting errors. We also show that D-LOCO codes are capacity-achieving and that they offer remarkably high rates at moderate lengths.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Frequency Partial Correlation Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the large research effort devoted to learning dependencies between time series, the state of the art still faces a major limitation: existing methods learn partial correlations but fail to discriminate across distinct frequency bands. Motivated by many applications in which this differentiation is pivotal, we overcome this limitation by learning a block-sparse, frequency-dependent, partial correlation graph, in which layers correspond to different frequency bands, and partial correlations can occur over just a few layers. To this aim, we formulate and solve two nonconvex learning problems: the first has a closed-form solution and is suitable when there is prior knowledge about the number of partial correlations; the second hinges on an iterative solution based on successive convex approximation, and is effective for the general case where no prior knowledge is available. Numerical results on synthetic data show that the proposed methods outperform the current state of the art. Finally, the analysis of financial time series confirms that partial correlations exist only within a few frequency bands, underscoring how our methods enable the gaining of valuable insights that would be undetected without discriminating along the frequency domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional social learning frameworks consider environments with a homogeneous state, where each agent receives observations conditioned on that true state of nature. In this work, we relax this assumption and study the distributed hypothesis testing problem in a heterogeneous environment, where each agent can receive observations conditioned on their own personalized state of nature (or truth). We particularly focus on community structured networks, where each community admits their own true hypothesis. This scenario is common in various contexts, such as when sensors are spatially distributed, or when individuals in a social network have differing views or opinions. We show that the adaptive social learning strategy is a preferred choice for nonstationary environments, and allows each cluster to discover its own truth.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate Maximization for Split Learning-based Control of EMG Prosthetic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a promising Distributed Learning approach in electromyography (EMG) based prosthetic control, due to its applicability within resource-constrained environments. Other learning approaches, such as Deep Learning and Federated Learning (FL), provide suboptimal solutions, since prosthetic devices are extremely limited in terms of processing power and battery life. The viability of implementing SL in such scenarios is caused by its inherent model partitioning, with clients executing the smaller model segment. However, selecting an inadequate cut layer hinders the training process in SL systems. This paper presents an algorithm for optimal cut layer selection in terms of maximizing the convergence rate of the model. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm substantially accelerates the convergence in an EMG pattern recognition task for improving prosthetic device control.</description>

Abstract: Neural wearables can enable life-saving drowsiness and health monitoring for pilots and drivers. While existing in-cabin sensors may provide alerts, wearables can enable monitoring across more environments. Current neural wearables are promising but most require wet-electrodes and bulky electronics. This work showcases in-ear, dry-electrode earpieces used to monitor drowsiness with compact hardware. The employed system integrates additive-manufacturing for dry, user-generic earpieces, existing wireless electronics, and offline classification algorithms. Thirty-five hours of electrophysiological data were recorded across nine subjects performing drowsiness-inducing tasks. Three classifier models were trained with user-specific, leave-one-trial-out, and leave-one-user-out splits. The support-vector-machine classifier achieved an accuracy of 93.2% while evaluating users it has seen before and 93.3% when evaluating a never-before-seen user. These results demonstrate wireless, dry, user-generic earpieces used to classify drowsiness with comparable accuracies to existing state-of-the-art, wet electrode in-ear and scalp systems. Further, this work illustrates the feasibility of population-trained classification in future electrophysiological applications.</description>

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) has emerged as a technology enabling wave domain beamforming through multiple stacked reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). SIM has been implemented so far with diagonal RIS (D-RIS), while SIM implemented with beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) remains unexplored. Furthermore, a model of SIM accounting for mutual coupling is not yet available. To fill these gaps, we derive a physically consistent channel model for SIM-aided systems and clarify the assumptions needed to obtain the simplified model used in related works. Using this model, we show that 1-layer SIM implemented with BD-RIS achieves the performance upper bound with limited complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heart diseases rank among the leading causes of global mortality, demonstrating a crucial need for early diagnosis and intervention. Most traditional electrocardiogram (ECG) based automated diagnosis methods are trained at population level, neglecting the customization of personalized ECGs to enhance individual healthcare management. A potential solution to address this limitation is to employ digital twins to simulate symptoms of diseases in real patients. In this paper, we present an innovative prospective learning approach for personalized heart disease detection, which generates digital twins of healthy individuals' anomalous ECGs and enhances the model sensitivity to the personalized symptoms. In our approach, a vector quantized feature separator is proposed to locate and isolate the disease symptom and normal segments in ECG signals with ECG report guidance. Thus, the ECG digital twins can simulate specific heart diseases used to train a personalized heart disease detection model. Experiments demonstrate that our approach not only excels in generating high-fidelity ECG signals but also improves personalized heart disease detection. Moreover, our approach ensures robust privacy protection, safeguarding patient data in model development.</description>

Abstract: The classification of sleep stages is a pivotal aspect of diagnosing sleep disorders and evaluating sleep quality. However, the conventional manual scoring process, conducted by clinicians, is time-consuming and prone to human bias. Recent advancements in deep learning have substantially propelled the automation of sleep stage classification. Nevertheless, challenges persist, including the need for large datasets with labels and the inherent biases in human-generated annotations. This paper introduces NeuroNet, a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework designed to effectively harness unlabeled single-channel sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by integrating contrastive learning tasks and masked prediction tasks. NeuroNet demonstrates superior performance over existing SSL methodologies through extensive experimentation conducted across three polysomnography (PSG) datasets. Additionally, this study proposes a Mamba-based temporal context module to capture the relationships among diverse EEG epochs. Combining NeuroNet with the Mamba-based temporal context module has demonstrated the capability to achieve, or even surpass, the performance of the latest supervised learning methodologies, even with a limited amount of labeled data. This study is expected to establish a new benchmark in sleep stage classification, promising to guide future research and applications in the field of sleep analysis.</description>

      <title>Timely Status Updates in Slotted ALOHA Networks With Energy Harvesting</title>

Abstract: We investigate the age of information (AoI) in a scenario where energy-harvesting devices send status updates to a gateway following the slotted ALOHA protocol and receive no feedback. We let the devices adjust the transmission probabilities based on their current battery level. Using a Markovian analysis, we derive analytically the average AoI. We further provide an approximate analysis for accurate and easy-to-compute approximations of both the average AoI and the age-violation probability (AVP), i.e., the probability that the AoI exceeds a given threshold. We also analyze the average throughput. Via numerical results, we investigate two baseline strategies: transmit a new update whenever possible to exploit every opportunity to reduce the AoI, and transmit only when sufficient energy is available to increase the chance of successful decoding. The two strategies are beneficial for low and high update-generation rates, respectively. We show that an optimized policy that balances the two strategies outperforms them significantly in terms of both AoI metrics and throughput. Finally, we show the benefit of decoding multiple packets in a slot using successive interference cancellation and adapting the transmission probability based on both the current battery level and the time elapsed since the last transmission.</description>
