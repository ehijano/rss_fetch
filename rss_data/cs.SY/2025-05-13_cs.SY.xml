      <title>Safety and optimality in learning-based control at low computational cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying machine learning methods to physical systems that are supposed to act in the real world requires providing safety guarantees. However, methods that include such guarantees often come at a high computational cost, making them inapplicable to large datasets and embedded devices with low computational power. In this paper, we propose CoLSafe, a computationally lightweight safe learning algorithm whose computational complexity grows sublinearly with the number of data points. We derive both safety and optimality guarantees and showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm on a seven-degrees-of-freedom robot arm.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Reinforcement Learning and Koopman Theory for Enhanced Model Predictive Control Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an innovative approach to Model Predictive Control (MPC) by leveraging the powerful combination of Koopman theory and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). By transforming nonlinear dynamical systems into a higher-dimensional linear regime, the Koopman operator facilitates the linear treatment of nonlinear behaviors, paving the way for more efficient control strategies. Our methodology harnesses the predictive prowess of Koopman-based models alongside the optimization capabilities of DRL, particularly using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to enhance the controller's performance. The resulting end-to-end learning framework refines the predictive control policies to cater to specific operational tasks, optimizing both performance and economic efficiency. We validate our approach through rigorous NMPC and eNMPC case studies, demonstrating that the Koopman-RL controller outperforms traditional controllers by achieving higher stability, superior constraint satisfaction, and significant cost savings. The findings indicate that our model can be a robust tool for complex control tasks, offering valuable insights into future applications of RL in MPC.</description>

      <title>Integrating Koopman theory and Lyapunov stability for enhanced model predictive control in nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the challenges posed by the increasing complexity of modern control systems, specifically focusing on bilinear systems, a prevalent subclass of non-linear systems characterized by state dynamics influenced by the interaction of state and control variables. Traditional control strategies, such as PID controllers, often fall short in adequately addressing the intricacies of such systems due to their predictive limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Model Predictive Control (MPC), a sophisticated technique that utilizes system models to forecast future behaviors, allowing for the computation of an optimal control sequence by minimizing deviations and control efforts. The Koopman operator emerges as a pivotal tool in this framework by providing a means to linearize the nonlinear dynamics of bilinear systems. By integrating the principles of Lyapunov theory with the linearizing capabilities of the Koopman operator into the MPC framework, we give rise to Koopman Lyapunov-based Model Predictive Control (Koopman LMPC). This approach not only retains MPC's predictive capabilities but also harnesses the Koopman operator's ability to transform complex nonlinear behaviors into a linear framework, thereby enhancing the robustness and applicability of LMPC. With the stability assurances from Lyapunov theory, Koopman LMPC presents a robust solution to effectively control and stabilize bilinear systems. The paper underscores the efficacy of Koopman LMPC, emphasizing its significance in achieving optimal performance and system stability, marking it as a promising approach for the future of advanced control systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Blocking Robustness Analysis in Discrete Event Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for characterizing state blocking in discrete event systems (DES) under transition deletions. We introduce a path-based analysis approach that determines whether systems maintain non-blocking properties when transitions are removed. Through formal analysis and case studies, we establish three key contributions: a mathematical characterization of transition-induced blocking with necessary and sufficient conditions, a definition of robust deviations that preserve non-blocking properties, and an algorithm for identifying critical transitions and analyzing system behavior under deletions. Our algorithm reduces computational complexity by leveraging minimal blocking sets, achieving significant reduction in computational requirements. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through manufacturing system and autonomous vehicle case studies, showing substantial improvements in identifying critical transitions and predicting potential blocking scenarios across different application domains.</description>

      <title>A spherical amplitude-phase formulation for 3-D adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) guidance with USGES stability guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently proposed 3-D adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) path-following algorithm addressed coupled motion dynamics of marine craft, aircraft, and uncrewed vehicles under environmental disturbances such as wind, waves, and ocean currents. Stability analysis established uniform semiglobal exponential stability (USGES) of the cross- and vertical-track errors using a body-velocity-based amplitude-phase representation of the North-East-Down (NED) kinematic differential equations. In this brief paper, we revisit the ALOS framework and introduce a novel spherical amplitude-phase representation. This formulation yields a more geometrically intuitive and physically observable description of the guidance errors and enables a significantly simplified stability proof. Unlike the previous model, which relied on a vertical crab angle derived from body-frame velocities, the new representation uses an alternative vertical crab angle and retains the USGES property. It also removes restrictive assumptions such as constant altitude/depth or zero horizontal crab angle, and remains valid for general 3-D maneuvers with nonzero roll, pitch, and flight-path angles.</description>

      <title>On the Use of CVRP to Diagnose Faulty Elements in Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Constrained-View Radiated Power (CVRP) for diagnosing phased array element failures, specifically focusing on on-off element failure. CVRP, similar to Partial Radiated Power (PRP), considers a specific Field-of-View (FoV) but normalizes it by the FoV area. The study explores CVRP's effectiveness in detecting failures in a 2x8 cosine element array under beam-steering conditions, accounting for random and depointing errors, angular resolution, and pattern rotation. Results indicate that CVRP can detect on-off failures based on angular resolution and error severity, under the assumption of reduced Total Radiated Power (TRP) with element failures. Additionally, CVRP is effective with partial far-field patterns, making it suitable for near-field, indirect far-field, and far-field measurement systems without requiring phase acquisition in the latter two.</description>

      <title>A Practical Approach to Generating First-Order Rician Channel Statistics in a RC plus CATR Chamber at mmWave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel hybrid configuration integrating a Reverberation Chamber (RC) with a Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR) to achieve a controllable Rician K-factor. The focus is testing directive antennas in the lower FR2 frequency bands (24.25-29.5 GHz) for 5G and beyond wireless applications. The study meticulously evaluates 39 unique configurations, using a stationary horn antenna for consistent reference K-factor characterization, and considers variables like absorbers and CATR polarization. Results demonstrate that the K-factor can be effectively adjusted within the hybrid setup, maintaining substantial margins above the noise level across all configurations. Sample independence is confirmed for at least 600 samples in all cases. The Bootstrap Anderson-Darling goodness-of-fit test verifies that the data align with Rician or Rayleigh distributions. Analysis of total received power, stirred and unstirred power and frequency-dependent modeling reveals that power variables are inversely related to frequency, while the K-factor remains frequency-independent. The hybrid RC-CATR system achieves a wide range of frequency-averaged K-factors from -9.2 dB to 40.8 dB, with an average granularity of 1.3 dB. Notably, configurations using co-polarized CATR signals yield large K-factors, reduced system losses, and improved frequency stability, underscoring the system's efficacy for millimeter-wave over-the-air testing. This research offers a cost-efficient and repeatable method for generating complex Rician fading channels at mmWave frequencies, crucial for the effective OTA testing of advanced wireless devices.</description>

      <title>The Quadrature Gaussian Sum Filter and Smoother for Wiener Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block-Oriented Nonlinear (BONL) models, particularly Wiener models, are widely used for their computational efficiency and practicality in modeling nonlinear behaviors in physical systems. Filtering and smoothing methods for Wiener systems, such as particle filters and Kalman-based techniques, often struggle with computational feasibility or accuracy. This work addresses these challenges by introducing a novel Gaussian Sum Filter for Wiener system state estimation that is built on a Gauss-Legendre quadrature approximation of the likelihood function associated with the output signal. In addition to filtering, a two-filter smoothing strategy is proposed, enabling accurate computation of smoothed state distributions at single and consecutive time instants. Numerical examples demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in balancing accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting its benefits in control, state estimation and system identification, for Wiener systems.</description>

      <title>Max-Min Fairness in Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Aided Rate Splitting Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a downlink multiuser multiple-input single-output system that integrates rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) with a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) to enable wave-domain beamforming. Unlike conventional digital beamforming, the proposed system leverages the programmable phase shifts of the SIM to perform beamforming entirely in the wave domain. In contrast to existing literature, this work introduces a fairness-centric SIM-RSMA design that shifts the emphasis from maximizing sum-rate to ensuring fair allocation of resources. In particular, we formulate a max-min rate optimization problem that jointly optimizes transmit power coefficients at the base station and SIM phase shifts. Given the non-convex nature of this problem, we develop an alternating optimization framework, where the power allocation is optimized through successive convex approximation and SIM beamforming is optimized using the Riemannian conjugate gradient method. Simulation results indicate that combining SIM with RSMA yields superior max-min performance compared to its integration with space division multiple access or non-orthogonal multiple access.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-assisted Model Predictive Control Optimization for Power System Real-Time Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a modified model predictive control (MPC) framework for real-time power system operation. The framework incorporates a diffusion model tailored for time series generation to enhance the accuracy of the load forecasting module used in the system operation. In the absence of explicit state transition law, a model-identification procedure is leveraged to derive the system dynamics, thereby eliminating a barrier when applying MPC to a renewables-dominated power system. Case study results on an industry park system and the IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that using the diffusion model to augment the training dataset significantly improves load-forecasting accuracy, and the inferred system dynamics are applicable to the real-time grid operation with solar and wind.</description>

      <title>A High-Efficiency Reconfigurable Bidirectional Array Antenna Based on Transmit-Reflect Switchable Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a reconfigurable bidirectional array antenna with high-efficiency radiations and flexible beam-switching capability by employing a novel transmit-reflect switchable metasurface (TRSM). To realize the electromagnetic (EM) wave transmitted or reflected manipulation, a dedicated transmit-reflect switch layer (TRSL) with periodically soldered PIN diodes is introduced between two transmitted metasurfaces. By switching ON/OFF the embedded diodes, the TRSL performs as a mesh-type ground layer or polarization-grid layer, exhibiting a reflect or transmit property to the incident wave respectively. Further, utilizing the above TRSM configuration in conjunction with a microstrip feed antenna, bidirectional radiations are obtained at the same frequency and polarization. To further reduce the number of PIN diodes and control complexity, an enhanced TRSM using a single diode to control two unit cells is also investigated, resulting in half PIN diodes reduction. Since the bidirectional beam-switching is achieved by only controlling PIN diodes integrated in the ground plane instead of directly acting on the radiation element, which reduces insertion loss and avoids phase quantization errors, the proposed antenna can maintain a high aperture efficiency. To verify this concept, a prototype was designed, fabricated, and measured, demonstrating a successful realization of backward and forward patterns with peak gains of 22.3 and 22.1 dBi, and aperture efficiencies of 47.2% and 43.8%. The 3-dB gain bandwidths of reflected and transmitted modes are 13.7% and 12.3%. This antenna has the advantages of high gain, high aperture efficiency, simple configuration, cost-effectiveness, and flexible and digital beam control.</description>

      <title>Robust Indoor Localization via Conformal Methods and Variational Bayesian Adaptive Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor localization is critical for IoT applications, yet challenges such as non-Gaussian noise, environmental interference, and measurement outliers hinder the robustness of traditional methods. Existing approaches, including Kalman filtering and its variants, often rely on Gaussian assumptions or static thresholds, limiting adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a hierarchical robust framework integrating Variational Bayesian (VB) parameter learning, Huber M-estimation, and Conformal Outlier Detection (COD) to address these limitations. First, VB inference jointly estimates state and noise parameters, adapting to time-varying uncertainties. Second, Huber-based robust filtering suppresses mild outliers while preserving Gaussian efficiency. Third, COD provides statistical guarantees for outlier detection via dynamically calibrated thresholds, ensuring a user-controlled false alarm rate. Theoretically, we prove the Semi-positive Definiteness of Huber-based Kalman filtering covariance and the coverage of sliding window conformal prediction. Experiments on geomagnetic fingerprint datasets demonstrate significant improvements: fingerprint matching accuracy increases from 81.25% to 93.75%, and positioning errors decrease from 0.62-6.87 m to 0.03-0.35 m. Comparative studies further validate the framework's robustness, showing consistent performance gains under non-Gaussian noise and outlier conditions.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Distributed Edge Learning: Seamless Integration in Next-Generation Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed edge learning (DL) is considered a cornerstone of intelligence enablers, since it allows for collaborative training without the necessity for local clients to share raw data with other parties, thereby preserving privacy and security. Integrating DL into the 6G networks requires a coexistence design with existing services such as high-bandwidth (HB) traffic like eMBB. Current designs in the literature mainly focus on communication round-wise designs that assume a rigid resource allocation throughout each communication round (CR). However, rigid resource allocation within a CR is a highly inefficient and inaccurate representation of the system's realistic behavior. This is due to the heterogeneous nature of the system, as clients inherently may need to access the network at different times. This work zooms into one arbitrary CR, and demonstrates the importance of considering a time-dependent resource sharing design with HB traffic. We first formulate a time-step-wise optimization problem to minimize the consumed time by DL within the CR while constrained by a DL energy budget. Due to its intractability, a session-based optimization problem is formulated assuming a CR lasts less than a large-scale coherence time. Some scheduling properties of such multi-server joint communication scheduling and resource allocation framework have been established. An iterative algorithm has been designed to solve such non-convex and non-block-separable-constrained problems. Simulation results confirm the importance of the efficient and accurate integration design proposed in this work.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trajectory Planning with Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Vehicle Maneuvering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To perform autonomous driving maneuvers, such as parallel or perpendicular parking, a vehicle requires continual speed and steering adjustments to follow a generated path. In consequence, the path's quality is a limiting factor of the vehicle maneuver's performance. While most path planning approaches include finding a collision-free route, optimal trajectory planning involves solving the best transition from initial to final states, minimizing the action over all paths permitted by a kinematic model. Here we propose a novel method based on sequential convex optimization, which permits flexible and efficient optimal trajectory generation. The objective is to achieve the fastest time, shortest distance, and fewest number of path segments to satisfy motion requirements, while avoiding sensor blind-spots. In our approach, vehicle kinematics are represented by a discretized Dubins model. To avoid collisions, each waypoint is constrained by linear inequalities representing closest distance of obstacles to a polygon specifying the vehicle's extent. To promote smooth and valid trajectories, the solved kinematic state and control variables are constrained and regularized by penalty terms in the model's cost function, which enforces physical restrictions including limits for steering angle, acceleration and speed. In this paper, we analyze trajectories obtained for several parking scenarios. Results demonstrate efficient and collision-free motion generated by the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Load-independent Metrics for Benchmarking Force Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Torque-controlled actuators are critical components in mechatronic systems that closely interact with their environment, such as legged robots, collaborative manipulators, and exoskeletons. The performance and stability of these actuators depend not only on controller design and system dynamics but also significantly on load characteristics, which may include interactions with humans or unstructured environments. This load dependence highlights the need for frameworks that properly assess and compare torque controllers independent of specific loading conditions. In this short paper, we concisely present a modeling approach that captures the impact of load on the closed-loop dynamics of torque-controlled systems. Based on this model, we propose new methods and quantitative metrics, including the Passivity Index Interval, which blends passivity and small-gain theory to offer a less conservative measure of coupled stability than passivity alone. These metrics can be used alongside traditional control performance indicators, such as settling time and bandwidth, to provide a more comprehensive characterization of torque-controlled systems. We demonstrate the application of the proposed metrics through experimental comparisons of linear actuator force controllers.</description>

      <title>A General Approach of Automated Environment Design for Learning the Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are increasingly used to solve the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. Yet, the question of how to design RL environments to maximize training performance remains unanswered, both for the OPF and the general case. We propose a general approach for automated RL environment design by utilizing multi-objective optimization. For that, we use the hyperparameter optimization (HPO) framework, which allows the reuse of existing HPO algorithms and methods. On five OPF benchmark problems, we demonstrate that our automated design approach consistently outperforms a manually created baseline environment design. Further, we use statistical analyses to determine which environment design decisions are especially important for performance, resulting in multiple novel insights on how RL-OPF environments should be designed. Finally, we discuss the risk of overfitting the environment to the utilized RL algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general approach for automated RL environment design.</description>

      <title>VoI-Driven Joint Optimization of Control and Communication in Vehicular Digital Twin Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vision of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks paves the way for the seamless integration of digital twins into vehicular networks, giving rise to a Vehicular Digital Twin Network (VDTN). The large amount of computing resources as well as the massive amount of spatial-temporal data in Digital Twin (DT) domain can be utilized to enhance the communication and control performance of Internet of Vehicle (IoV) systems. In this article, we first propose the architecture of VDTN, emphasizing key modules that center on functions related to the joint optimization of control and communication. We then delve into the intricacies of the multitimescale decision process inherent in joint optimization in VDTN, specifically investigating the dynamic interplay between control and communication. To facilitate the joint optimization, we define two Value of Information (VoI) concepts rooted in control performance. Subsequently, utilizing VoI as a bridge between control and communication, we introduce a novel joint optimization framework, which involves iterative processing of two Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) modules corresponding to control and communication to derive the optimal policy. Finally, we conduct simulations of the proposed framework applied to a platoon scenario to demonstrate its effectiveness in ensu</description>

      <title>Fault Detection Method for Power Conversion Circuits Using Thermal Image and Convolutional Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fault detection method for power conversion circuits using thermal images and a convolutional autoencoder is presented. The autoencoder is trained on thermal images captured from a commercial power module at randomly varied load currents and augmented image2 generated through image processing techniques such as resizing, rotation, perspective transformation, and bright and contrast adjustment. Since the autoencoder is trained to output images identical to input only for normal samples, it reconstructs images similar to normal ones even when the input images containing faults. A small heater is attached to the circuit board to simulate a fault on a power module, and then thermal images were captured from different angles and positions, as well as various load currents to test the trained autoencoder model. The areas under the curve (AUC) were obtained to evaluate the proposed method. The results show the autoencoder model can detect anomalies with 100% accuracy under given conditions. The influence of hyperparameters such as the number of convolutional layers and image augmentation conditions on anomaly detection accuracy was also investigated.</description>

      <title>A Tightly Coupled IMU-Based Motion Capture Approach for Estimating Multibody Kinematics and Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) enable portable, multibody motion capture (MoCap) in diverse environments beyond the laboratory, making them a practical choice for diagnosing mobility disorders and supporting rehabilitation in clinical or home settings. However, challenges associated with IMU measurements, including magnetic distortions and drift errors, complicate their broader use for MoCap. In this work, we propose a tightly coupled motion capture approach that directly integrates IMU measurements with multibody dynamic models via an Iterated Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) to simultaneously estimate the system's kinematics and kinetics. By enforcing kinematic and kinetic properties and utilizing only accelerometer and gyroscope data, our method improves IMU-based state estimation accuracy. Our approach is designed to allow for incorporating additional sensor data, such as optical MoCap measurements and joint torque readings, to further enhance estimation accuracy. We validated our approach using highly accurate ground truth data from a 3 Degree of Freedom (DoF) pendulum and a 6 DoF Kuka robot. We demonstrate a maximum Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) in the pendulum's computed joint angles of 3.75 degrees compared to optical MoCap Inverse Kinematics (IK), which serves as the gold standard in the absence of internal encoders. For the Kuka robot, we observe a maximum joint angle RMSD of 3.24 degrees compared to the Kuka's internal encoders, while the maximum joint angle RMSD of the optical MoCap IK compared to the encoders was 1.16 degrees. Additionally, we report a maximum joint torque RMSD of 2 Nm in the pendulum compared to optical MoCap Inverse Dynamics (ID), and 3.73 Nm in the Kuka robot relative to its internal torque sensors.</description>

      <title>Rethink Repeatable Measures of Robot Performance with Statistical Query</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a general standardized testing algorithm designed to evaluate a specific aspect of a robot's performance, several key expectations are commonly imposed. Beyond accuracy (i.e., closeness to a typically unknown ground-truth reference) and efficiency (i.e., feasibility within acceptable testing costs and equipment constraints), one particularly important attribute is repeatability. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently obtain the same testing outcome when similar testing algorithms are executed on the same subject robot by different stakeholders, across different times or locations. However, achieving repeatable testing has become increasingly challenging as the components involved grow more complex, intelligent, diverse, and, most importantly, stochastic. While related efforts have addressed repeatability at ethical, hardware, and procedural levels, this study focuses specifically on repeatable testing at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we target the well-adopted class of testing algorithms in standardized evaluation: statistical query (SQ) algorithms (i.e., algorithms that estimate the expected value of a bounded function over a distribution using sampled data). We propose a lightweight, parameterized, and adaptive modification applicable to any SQ routine, whether based on Monte Carlo sampling, importance sampling, or adaptive importance sampling, that makes it provably repeatable, with guaranteed bounds on both accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three representative scenarios: (i) established and widely adopted standardized testing of manipulators, (ii) emerging intelligent testing algorithms for operational risk assessment in automated vehicles, and (iii) developing use cases involving command tracking performance evaluation of humanoid robots in locomotion tasks.</description>

      <title>Constrained Factor Graph Optimization for Robust Networked Pedestrian Inertial Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel constrained Factor Graph Optimization (FGO)-based approach for networked inertial navigation in pedestrian localization. To effectively mitigate the drift inherent in inertial navigation solutions, we incorporate kinematic constraints directly into the nonlinear optimization framework. Specifically, we utilize equality constraints, such as Zero-Velocity Updates (ZUPTs), and inequality constraints representing the maximum allowable distance between body-mounted Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) based on human anatomical limitations. While equality constraints are straightforwardly integrated as error factors, inequality constraints cannot be explicitly represented in standard FGO formulations. To address this, we introduce a differentiable softmax-based penalty term in the FGO cost function to enforce inequality constraints smoothly and robustly. The proposed constrained FGO approach leverages temporal correlations across multiple epochs, resulting in optimal state trajectory estimates while consistently maintaining constraint satisfaction. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms conventional Kalman filter approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness for pedestrian navigation.</description>

      <title>Fast Contact Detection via Fusion of Joint and Inertial Sensors for Parallel Robots in Human-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast contact detection is crucial for safe human-robot collaboration. Observers based on proprioceptive information can be used for contact detection but have first-order error dynamics, which results in delays. Sensor fusion based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of accelerometers and gyroscopes is advantageous for reducing delays. The acceleration estimation enables the direct calculation of external forces. For serial robots, the installation of multiple accelerometers and gyroscopes is required for dynamics modeling since the joint coordinates are the minimal coordinates. Alternatively, parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential to use only one IMU on the end-effector platform, which already presents the minimal coordinates of the PR. This work introduces a sensor-fusion method for contact detection using encoders and only one low-cost, consumer-grade IMU for a PR. The end-effector accelerations are estimated by an extended Kalman filter and incorporated into the dynamics to calculate external forces. In real-world experiments with a planar PR, we demonstrate that this approach reduces the detection duration by up to 50% compared to a momentum observer and enables the collision and clamping detection within 3-39ms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is known to be inherently fragile to model misspecifications often occurring in real-world situations. We consider discretetime partially observable stochastic linear systems and provide a robustification of the standard LQG against distributional uncertainties on the process and measurement noise. Our distributionally robust formulation specifies the admissible perturbations by defining a relative entropy based ambiguity set individually for each time step along a finite-horizon trajectory, and minimizes the worst-case cost across all admissible distributions. Notably, we prove that the optimal control policy is still linear, as in standard LQG, and we derive a computational scheme grounded on iterative best response that provably converges to the set of saddle points. Finally, we consider the case of endogenous uncertainty captured via decision-dependent ambiguity sets and we propose an approximation scheme based on dynamic programming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is critical for applications such as precision agriculture and search and rescue. While traditional methods rely on discrete grid-based representations, real-world UAV operations require power-efficient continuous motion planning. We formulate the UAV CPP problem in a continuous environment, minimizing power consumption while ensuring complete coverage. Our approach models the environment with variable-size axis-aligned rectangles and UAV motion with curvature-constrained B\'ezier curves. We train a reinforcement learning agent using an action-mapping-based Soft Actor-Critic (AM-SAC) algorithm employing a self-adaptive curriculum. Experiments on both procedurally generated and hand-crafted scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in learning energy-efficient coverage strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of co-designing control barrier functions and linear state feedback controllers for discrete-time linear systems affected by additive disturbances. For disturbances of bounded magnitude, we provide a semi-definite program whose feasibility implies the existence of a control law and a certificate ensuring safety in the infinite horizon with respect to the worst-case disturbance realization in the uncertainty set. For disturbances with unbounded support, we rely on martingale theory to derive a second semi-definite program whose feasibility provides probabilistic safety guarantees holding joint-in-time over a finite time horizon. We examine several extensions, including (i) encoding of different types of input constraints, (ii) robustification against distributional ambiguity around the true distribution, (iii) design of safety filters, and (iv) extension to general safety specifications such as obstacle avoidance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers distributed online nonconvex optimization with time-varying inequality constraints over a network of agents, where the nonconvex local loss and convex local constraint functions can vary arbitrarily across iterations, and the information of them is privately revealed to each agent at each iteration. For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, we propose two distributed bandit online primal--dual algorithm with compressed communication to efficiently utilize communication resources in the one-point and two-point bandit feedback settings, respectively. In nonconvex optimization, finding a globally optimal decision is often NP-hard. As a result, the standard regret metric used in online convex optimization becomes inapplicable. To measure the performance of the proposed algorithms, we use a network regret metric grounded in the first-order optimality condition associated with the variational inequality. We show that the compressed algorithms establish sublinear network regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>MC-Swarm: Minimal-Communication Multi-Agent Trajectory Planning and Deadlock Resolution for Quadrotor Swarm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For effective multi-agent trajectory planning, it is important to consider lightweight communication and its potential asynchrony. This paper presents a distributed trajectory planning algorithm for a quadrotor swarm that operates asynchronously and requires no communication except during the initial planning phase. Moreover, our algorithm guarantees no deadlock under asynchronous updates and absence of communication during flight. To effectively ensure these points, we build two main modules: coordination state updater and trajectory optimizer. The coordination state updater computes waypoints for each agent toward its goal and performs subgoal optimization while considering deadlocks, as well as safety constraints with respect to neighbor agents and obstacles. Then, the trajectory optimizer generates a trajectory that ensures collision avoidance even with the asynchronous planning updates of neighboring agents. We provide a theoretical guarantee of collision avoidance with deadlock resolution and evaluate the effectiveness of our method in complex simulation environments, including random forests and narrow-gap mazes. Additionally, to reduce the total mission time, we design a faster coordination state update using lightweight communication. Lastly, our approach is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments with cluttered environment scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distinguishing abnormal nodes from those with normal packet loss in clusters helps reduce the loss of clustered network resources. The detection performance of existing detection schemes is limited by the techniques to quantify node behaviors, and most schemes cannot avoid being misled by the falsified information. This paper presents a novel probabilistic abnormal node detection scheme CSD -- Cooperative Statistical Detection -- for accurate and efficient detection in the existence of falsified detection data in clustered networks. Specifically, employing the likelihood ratio test (LRT) based detection method to measure node forwarding behaviors, we propose a modified Z-score based falsification-resistant mechanism to filter out falsifications. We show that both the false alarm and missed detection probabilities can decrease exponentially if and only if the transmissions from the nodes falsifying the data are less than half of the total. Furthermore, the optimal threshold of the modified Z-score method is derived, which guarantees perfect detection of our CSD under any falsification strategy in the proposed detection model. Evaluation results validate the effectiveness, robustness, and superiority of our scheme compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Signal Temporal Logic Control Synthesis among Uncontrollable Dynamic Agents with Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of dynamical systems under temporal logic specifications among uncontrollable dynamic agents is challenging due to the agents' a-priori unknown behavior. Existing works have considered the problem where either all agents are controllable, the agent models are deterministic and known, or no safety guarantees are provided. We propose a predictive control synthesis framework that guarantees, with high probability, the satisfaction of signal temporal logic (STL) tasks that are defined over a controllable system in the presence of uncontrollable stochastic agents. We use trajectory predictors and conformal prediction to construct probabilistic prediction regions for each uncontrollable agent that are valid over multiple future time steps. Specifically, we construct a normalized prediction region over all agents and time steps to reduce conservatism and increase data efficiency. We then formulate a worst-case bilevel mixed integer program (MIP) that accounts for all agent realizations within the prediction region to obtain an open-loop controller that provably guarantee task satisfaction with high probability. To efficiently solve this bilevel MIP, we propose an equivalent MIP program based on KKT conditions of the original bilevel formulation. Building upon this, we design a closed-loop controller, where both recursive feasibility and task satisfaction can be guaranteed with high probability. We illustrate our control synthesis framework on two case studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mathematical properties of the Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) when iterating on the measurement update step, following the principles of the well-known Iterated Extended Kalman Filter. This iterative variant of the IEKF (IterIEKF) systematically improves its accuracy through Gauss-Newton-based relinearization, and exhibits additional theoretical properties, particularly in the low-noise regime, that resemble those of the linear Kalman filter. We apply the proposed approach to the problem of estimating the extended pose of a crane payload using an inertial measurement unit. Our results suggest that the IterIEKF significantly outperforms the IEKF when measurements are highly accurate.</description>

      <title>A Prudent Framework for Understanding Risk-Awareness in Demand Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that risk-aware behaviors in demand response originate from superquadratic state-dependent cost functions and price uncertainty with skewed distributions. We obtain such results through developing a novel theoretical demand response framework that combines non-anticipatory multi-stage decision-making with superquadratic cost functions. We introduce the concept of prudent demand, defined by a positive third-order derivative of the cost function, which is the first principle for risk-averse behavior despite a risk-neutral objective. Our analysis establishes that future price uncertainty affects immediate consumption decisions, and the extent of this response scales proportionally with the skewness of the price distribution. We visualize our theoretical findings through numerical simulations and illustrate their practical implications using a real-world case study.</description>

      <title>Predictive control for nonlinear stochastic systems: Closed-loop guarantees with unbounded noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13257v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a stochastic model predictive control framework for nonlinear systems subject to unbounded process noise with closed-loop guarantees. First, we provide a conceptual shrinking-horizon framework that utilizes general probabilistic reachable sets and minimizes the expected cost. Then, we provide a tractable receding-horizon formulation that uses a nominal state to minimize a deterministic quadratic cost and satisfy tightened constraints. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates recursive feasibility, satisfaction of chance constraints, and bounds on the expected cost for the resulting closed-loop system. We provide a constructive design for probabilistic reachable sets of nonlinear continuously differentiable systems using stochastic contraction metrics and an assumed bound on the covariance matrices. Numerical simulations highlight the computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees of the proposed method. Overall, this paper provides a framework for computationally tractable stochastic predictive control with closed-loop guarantees for nonlinear systems with unbounded noise.</description>

      <title>NExT-LF: A Novel Operational Modal Analysis Method via Tangential Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) is vital for identifying modal parameters under real-world conditions, yet existing methods often face challenges with noise sensitivity and stability. This work introduces NExT-LF, a novel method that combines the well-known Natural Excitation Technique (NExT) with the Loewner Framework (LF). NExT enables the extraction of Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) from output-only vibration data, which are then converted into the frequency domain and used by LF to estimate modal parameters. The proposed method is validated through numerical and experimental case studies. In the numerical study of a 2D Euler-Bernoulli cantilever beam, NExT-LF provides results consistent with analytical solutions and those from standard methods, NExT with Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (NExT-ERA) and Stochastic Subspace Identification with Canonical Variate Analysis (SSI). Additionally, NExT-LF demonstrates superior noise robustness, reliably identifying stable modes across various noise levels where NExT-ERA fails. Experimental validation on the Sheraton Universal Hotel is the first OMA application to this structure, confirming NExT-LF as a robust and efficient method for output-only modal parameter identification.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Input-Output Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a framework for ensuring set invariance and designing constrained control laws. However, crafting a valid CBF relies on system-specific assumptions and the availability of an accurate system model, underscoring the need for systematic data-driven synthesis methods. This paper introduces a data-driven approach to synthesizing a CBF for discrete-time LTI systems using only input-output measurements. The method begins by computing the maximal control invariant set using an input-output data-driven representation, eliminating the need for precise knowledge of the system's order and explicit state estimation. The proposed CBF is then systematically derived from this set, which can accommodate multiple input-output constraints. Furthermore, the proposed CBF is leveraged to develop a minimally invasive safety filter that ensures recursive feasibility with an adaptive decay rate. To improve clarity, we assume a noise-free dataset, though the method can be extended using data-driven reachability to capture noise effects and handle uncertainty. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on an unknown time-delay system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing demands for high accuracy in mechatronic systems necessitate the incorporation of parameter variations in feedforward control. The aim of this paper is to develop a data-driven approach for direct learning of parameter-varying feedforward control to increase tracking performance. The developed approach is based on kernel-regularized function estimation in conjunction with iterative learning to directly learn parameter-varying feedforward control from data. This approach enables high tracking performance for feedforward control of linear parameter-varying dynamics, providing flexibility to varying reference tasks. The developed framework is validated on a benchmark industrial experimental setup featuring a belt-driven carriage.</description>

      <title>An Overview of the Prospects and Challenges of Using Artificial Intelligence for Energy Management Systems in Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microgrids have emerged as a pivotal solution in the quest for a sustainable and energy-efficient future. While microgrids offer numerous advantages, they are also prone to issues related to reliably forecasting renewable energy demand and production, protecting against cyberattacks, controlling operational costs, optimizing power flow, and regulating the performance of energy management systems (EMS). Tackling these energy management challenges is essential to facilitate microgrid applications and seamlessly incorporate renewable energy resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently demonstrated immense potential for optimizing energy management in microgrids, providing efficient and reliable solutions. This paper highlights the combined benefits of enabling AI-based methodologies in the energy management systems of microgrids by examining the applicability and efficiency of AI-based EMS in achieving specific technical and economic objectives. The paper also points out several future research directions that promise to spearhead AI-driven EMS, namely the development of self-healing microgrids, integration with blockchain technology, use of Internet of things (IoT), and addressing interpretability, data privacy, scalability, and the prospects to generative AI in the context of future AI-based EMS.</description>

      <title>Consensus Building in Human-robot Co-learning via Bias Controlled Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics and Non-verbal Communication through Robotic Eyes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consensus between humans and robots is crucial as robotic agents become more prevalent and deeply integrated into our daily lives. This integration presents both unprecedented opportunities and notable challenges for effective collaboration. However, the active guidance of human actions and their integration in co-learning processes, where humans and robots mutually learn from each other, remains under-explored. This article demonstrates how consensus between human and robot opinions can be established by modeling decision-making processes as non-linear opinion dynamics. We utilize dynamic bias as a control parameter to steer the robot's opinion toward consensus and employ visual cues via a robotic eye gaze to guide human decisions. These non-verbal cues communicate the robot's future intentions, gradually guiding human decisions to align with them. To design robot behavior for consensus, we integrate a human opinion observation algorithm with the robot's opinion formation, controlling its actions based on that formed opinion. Experiments with $51$ participants ($N=51$) in a two-choice decision-making task show that effective consensus and trust can be established in a human--robot co-learning setting by guiding human decisions through nonverbal robotic cues and using bias-controlled opinion dynamics to shape robot behavior. Finally, we provide detailed information on the perceived cognitive load and the behavior of robotic eyes based on user feedback and post-experiment interviews.</description>

      <title>Optimization-free Smooth Control Barrier Function for Polygonal Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polygonal collision avoidance (PCA) is short for the problem of collision avoidance between two polygons (i.e., polytopes in planar) that own their dynamic equations. This problem suffers the inherent difficulty in dealing with non-smooth boundaries and recently optimization-defined metrics, such as signed distance field (SDF) and its variants, have been proposed as control barrier functions (CBFs) to tackle PCA problems. In contrast, we propose an optimization-free smooth CBF method in this paper, which is computationally efficient and proved to be nonconservative. It is achieved by three main steps: a lower bound of SDF is expressed as a nested Boolean logic composition first, then its smooth approximation is established by applying the latest log-sum-exp method, after which a specified CBF-based safety filter is proposed to address this class of problems. To illustrate its wide applications, the optimization-free smooth CBF method is extended to solve distributed collision avoidance of two underactuated nonholonomic vehicles and drive an underactuated container crane to avoid a moving obstacle respectively, for which numerical simulations are also performed.</description>

      <title>UAV-VLRR: Vision-Language Informed NMPC for Rapid Response in UAV Search and Rescue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergency search and rescue (SAR) operations often require rapid and precise target identification in complex environments where traditional manual drone control is inefficient. In order to address these scenarios, a rapid SAR system, UAV-VLRR (Vision-Language-Rapid-Response), is developed in this research. This system consists of two aspects: 1) A multimodal system which harnesses the power of Visual Language Model (VLM) and the natural language processing capabilities of ChatGPT-4o (LLM) for scene interpretation. 2) A non-linearmodel predictive control (NMPC) with built-in obstacle avoidance for rapid response by a drone to fly according to the output of the multimodal system. This work aims at improving response times in emergency SAR operations by providing a more intuitive and natural approach to the operator to plan the SAR mission while allowing the drone to carry out that mission in a rapid and safe manner. When tested, our approach was faster on an average by 33.75% when compared with an off-the-shelf autopilot and 54.6% when compared with a human pilot.

      <description>arXiv:2504.10497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The swift progress of Generative Artificial intelligence (GenAI), notably Large Language Models (LLMs), is reshaping the digital landscape. Recognizing this transformative potential, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) launched a pilot initiative to explore the integration of GenAI techniques into its daily operation for performance excellence, where 22 projects were launched in May 2024. Within these projects, this paper presents the development of the intelligent agent Pubbie as a case study, targeting the automation of performance measurement, data management and insight reporting at the NRC. Cutting-edge techniques are explored, including LLM orchestration and semantic embedding via RoBERTa, while strategic fine-tuning and few-shot learning approaches are incorporated to infuse domain knowledge at an affordable cost. The user-friendly interface of Pubbie allows general government users to input queries in natural language and easily upload or download files with a simple button click, greatly reducing manual efforts and accessibility barriers.</description>
