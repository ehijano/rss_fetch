      <title>The diameter of random spanning trees interpolating between the UST and the MST of the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ as the weighted spanning tree of the complete graph $K_n$ w.r.t. the random electric network of conductances $\{\exp(-\beta_nU_{e})\}_{e\in E(K_n)}$ with $\mathrm{Unif}[0,1]$ i.i.d. $U_e$'s.
  Moving from $\beta_n\equiv 0$ to faster and faster growing $\beta_n$'s, the model interpolates between the \emph{uniform} and the \emph{minimum} spanning trees: $\mathsf{WST}^0(K_n)=\mathsf{UST}(K_n)$, and there are phase transitions for $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ behaving more and more like $\mathsf{MST}(K_n)$:
  - around $\beta_n=n^{3+o(1)}$ regarding the agreement of the two standard algorithms generating these models : Aldous-Broder and Prim's invasion algorithms,
  - around $\beta_n=n^{2+o(1)}$ regarding the models consisting of exactly the same edges, and
  - around $\beta_n=n^{1+o(1)}$ regarding the expected total length $\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{e\in \mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)}U_e\right]$.
  But most importantly, we study the global geometry of the model: we prove that the typical diameter of $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ grows like $\Theta(n^{1/3})$ for $\beta_n\ge n^{4/3+o(1)}$ likewise the $\mathsf{MST}(K_n)$ case, and it grows like $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ for $\beta_n\le n^{1+o(1)}$ similarly to the $\mathsf{UST}(K_n)$ case. For $\beta_n=n^{\alpha}$ with $1&lt;\alpha&lt;4/3$, the behavior of the typical diameter is a more delicate open question, but we conjecture that its exponent strictly between 1/2 and 1/3.</description>

      <title>RNN-BSDE method for high-dimensional fractional backward stochastic differential equations with Wick-It\^o integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motions(fBMs) are not semimartingales so the classical theory of It\^o integral can't apply to fBMs. Wick integration as one of the applications of Malliavin calculus to stochastic analysis is a fine definition for fBMs. We consider the fractional forward backward stochastic differential equations(fFBSDEs) driven by a fBM that have the Hurst parameter in (1/2,1) where $\int_{0}^{t} f_s \, dB_s^H$ is in the sense of a Wick integral, and relate our fFBSDEs to the system of partial differential equations by using an analogue of the It\^o formula for Wick integrals. And we develop a deep learning algorithm referred to as the RNN-BSDE method based on recurrent neural networks which is exactly designed for solving high-dimensional fractional BSDEs and their corresponding partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a centered Gaussian field on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ defined by the following: the conditional law of the field at any site $i \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ is Gaussian of mean $\epsilon$ times the mean of the neighbours, and of variance 1. We show that when $\epsilon$ is small enough, this model can be written as a factor of an i.i.d. process, and that it is exponentially close to a finitely dependent model. Furthermore, if the field is conditioned to take values in a compact, we show that the factor can be realised with exponential tails.</description>

      <title>Tail behaviour of stationary densities for one-dimensional random diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of stationary densities of one-dimensional random diffeomorphisms, at the boundaries of their support, which correspond to deterministic fixed points of extremal diffeomorphisms. In particular, we show how this stationary density at a boundary depends on the underlying noise distribution, as well as the linearisation of the extremal diffeomorphism at the boundary point (in case the corresponding fixed point is hyperbolic), or the leading nonlinear term of the extremal diffeomorphism (in case the corresponding fixed point is not hyperbolic).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Normality and Concentration Inequalities of Statistics of Core Partitions with Bounded Perimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core partitions have attracted much attention since Anderson's work (2002) on the number of $(s,t)$-core partitions for coprime $s,t$. Recently there has been interest in studying the limit distribution of the sizes of random simultaneous core partitions. In this paper, we prove the asymptotic normality of certain statistics of random core partitions with bounded perimeters under the uniform measure, in the Kolmogorov and Wasserstein-$1$ distances, including the length and size of a random (strict) $n$-core partition, the size of the Durfee square and the size of a random self-conjugate $n$-core partition. Accordingly, we prove that these statistics are subgaussian. This behavior contrasts with that of the size of a random $(s, t)$-core partition for coprime $s,t$ studied in Even-Zohar (2022), which converges in law to Watson's $U^2$-distribution. Our results show that the distribution of the size of a random strict $(n, dn+1)$-core partition is asymptotically normal when $d \ge 3$ is fixed and $n$ tends to infinity, which is an analog of Zaleski's conjecture (2017) and covers Koml\'{o}s-Sergel-Tusn\'{a}dy's result (2020) as a special case. Our proof applies several tools including Stein's method based on Hoeffding decomposition, Hoeffding's combinatorial central limit theorem, Efron-Stein inequalities on product spaces and slices, and asymptotics of P\'{o}lya frequency sequences. We believe our approach can be generalized to establish the asymptotic normality of functionals of random variables with certain global dependence structure that can be decomposed into appropriate mixture forms.</description>

      <title>Supercritical McKean-Vlasov SDE driven by cylindrical $\alpha$-stable process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following supercritical McKean-Vlasov SDE, driven by a symmetric non-degenerate cylindrical $\alpha$-stable process in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\alpha \in (0,1)$: $$ \mathord{{\rm d}} X_t = (K * \mu_{t})(X_t)\mathord{{\rm d}}t + \mathord{{\rm d}} L_t^{(\alpha)}, \quad X_0 = x \in \mathbb{R}^d, $$ where $K: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $\beta$-order H\"older continuous function, and $\mu_t$ represents the time marginal distribution of the solution $X$. We establish both strong and weak well-posedness under the conditions $\beta \in (1 - \alpha/2, 1)$ and $\beta \in (1 - \alpha, 1)$, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate strong propagation of chaos for the associated interacting particle system, as well as the convergence of the corresponding Euler approximations. In particular, we prove a commutation property between the particle approximation and the Euler approximation.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for nonlocal kinetic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ probabilistic techniques to derive sharp, explicit two-sided estimates for the heat kernel of the nonlocal kinetic operator $$ \Delta^{\alpha/2}_v + v \cdot \nabla_x, \quad \alpha \in (0, 2),\ (x,v)\in {\mathbb R}^{d}\times{\mathbb R}^d,$$ where $ \Delta^{\alpha/2}_v $ represents the fractional Laplacian acting on the velocity variable $v$. Additionally, we establish logarithmic gradient estimates with respect to both the spatial variable $x$ and the velocity variable $v$. In fact, the estimates are developed for more general non-symmetric stable-like operators, demonstrating explicit dependence on the lower and upper bounds of the kernel functions. These results, in particular, provide a solution to a fundamental problem in the study of \emph{nonlocal} kinetic operators.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit of diffusive games through the master equation: extreme value analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-player game where the players control the drifts of their diffusive states which have no interaction in the noise terms. The aim of each player is to minimize the expected value of her cost, which is a function of the player's state and the empirical measure of the states of all the players. Our aim is to determine the $N \to \infty$ asymptotic behavior of the upper order statistics of the player's states under Nash equilibrium (the Nash states). For this purpose, we consider also a system of interacting diffusions which is constructed by using the Master PDE of the game and approximates the system of the Nash states, and we improve an $L^2$ estimate for the distance between the drifts of the two systems which has been used for establishing Central Limit Theorems and Large Deviations Principles for the Nash states in the past. By differentiating the Master PDE, we obtain that estimate also in $L^{\infty}$, which allows us to control the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a Girsanov transformation that connects the two systems. The latter allows us to reduce the problem to the case of $N$ uncontrolled diffusions with standard mean-field interaction in the drifts, which has been treated in a previous work.</description>

      <title>The critical density of the Stochastic Sandpile Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stochastic sandpile model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and demonstrate that the critical density is strictly less than one in all dimensions. This generalizes a previous result by Hoffman, Hu, Richey, and Rizzolo (2022), which was limited to the one-dimensional case. In addition, we show that the critical density is strictly positive on any vertex-transitive graph, extending the earlier result of Sidoravicius and Teixeira (2018) and providing a simpler proof.</description>

      <title>Super-resolved anomalous diffusion: deciphering the joint distribution of anomalous exponent and diffusion coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gradient descent in high dimensions for multi-spiked tensor PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics in high dimensions of online stochastic gradient descent for the multi-spiked tensor model. This multi-index model arises from the tensor principal component analysis (PCA) problem with multiple spikes, where the goal is to estimate $r$ unknown signal vectors within the $N$-dimensional unit sphere through maximum likelihood estimation from noisy observations of a $p$-tensor. We determine the number of samples and the conditions on the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) required to efficiently recover the unknown spikes from natural random initializations. We show that full recovery of all spikes is possible provided a number of sample scaling as $N^{p-2}$, matching the algorithmic threshold identified in the rank-one case [Ben Arous, Gheissari, Jagannath 2020, 2021]. Our results are obtained through a detailed analysis of a low-dimensional system that describes the evolution of the correlations between the estimators and the spikes, while controlling the noise in the dynamics. We find that the spikes are recovered sequentially in a process we term "sequential elimination": once a correlation exceeds a critical threshold, all correlations sharing a row or column index become sufficiently small, allowing the next correlation to grow and become macroscopic. The order in which correlations become macroscopic depends on their initial values and the corresponding SNRs, leading to either exact recovery or recovery of a permutation of the spikes. In the matrix case, when $p=2$, if the SNRs are sufficiently separated, we achieve exact recovery of the spikes, whereas equal SNRs lead to recovery of the subspace spanned by the spikes.</description>

      <title>Persistence exponents of self-interacting random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The persistence exponent, which characterises the long-time decay of the survival probability of stochastic processes in the presence of an absorbing target, plays a key role in quantifying the dynamics of fluctuating systems. Determining this exponent for non-Markovian processes is known to be a difficult task, and exact results remain scarce despite sustained efforts. In this Letter, we consider the fundamental class of self-interacting random walks (SIRWs), which display long-range memory effects that result from the interaction of the random walker at time $t$ with the territory already visited at earlier times $t'&lt;t$. We compute exactly the persistence exponent for all physically relevant SIRWs. As a byproduct, we also determine the splitting probability of these processes. Besides their intrinsic theoretical interest, these results provide a quantitative characterization of the exploration process of SIRWs, which are involved in fields as diverse as foraging theory, cell biology, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for the Symbolic Correlation Integral and the Renyi-2 Entropy under Short-range Dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symbolic correlation integral provides a way to measure the complexity of time series and dynamical systems. In the present article we prove limit results for an estimator of this quantity which is based on U-statistics under the assumption of short-range dependence. To this end, we slightly generalize classical limit results in the framework of 1-approximating functionals. Furthermore, we carefully analyze the limit variance. A simulation study with ARMA and ARCH time series as well as a real world data example are also provided. In the latter we show how our method could be used to analyze EEG data in the context of epileptic seizures.</description>

Abstract: We conjecture an explicit expression for the lower tail large deviation rate function of the partition function of the log-Gamma polymer. We rigorously prove our result, except for one step for which we only provide heuristic evidence. We show that the large deviation rate function matches with that of last passage percolation with exponential weights in the zero-temperature limit, and with the lower tail of the Tracy-Widom distribution for moderate deviations.</description>

      <title>Stationary measures and random walks on $\tilde{A}_2$-buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a non-elementary group action of a locally compact second countable group $G$ on a possibly non-discrete building $X$ of type $\tilde{A}_2$. We study $G$-equivariant measurable maps between a given $G$-boundary $(B, \nu_B)$ and the set of chambers of the spherical building at infinity. Using techniques from boundary theory, we prove that such a boundary map exists and is unique. As a consequence, we prove that if $\mu$ is an admissible probability measure on $G$, there is a unique $\mu$-stationary measure $\nu$ supported on the chambers at infinity of the spherical building at infinity. We use this result to study random walks induced by the $G$-action, and we prove that for any base-point $o \in X$, $(Z_n o )$ converges almost surely to a regular point of the boundary under a second moment assumption.</description>

      <title>Can we spot a fake?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of detecting fake data inspires the following seemingly simple mathematical question. Sample a data point $X$ from the standard normal distribution in $\mathbb{R}^n$. An adversary observes $X$ and corrupts it by adding a vector $rt$, where they can choose any vector $t$ from a fixed set $T$ of the adversary's "tricks", and where $r&gt;0$ is a fixed radius. The adversary's choice of $t=t(X)$ may depend on the true data $X$. The adversary wants to hide the corruption by making the fake data $X+rt$ statistically indistinguishable from the real data $X$. What is the largest radius $r=r(T)$ for which the adversary can create an undetectable fake? We show that for highly symmetric sets $T$, the detectability radius $r(T)$ is approximately twice the scaled Gaussian width of $T$. The upper bound actually holds for arbitrary sets $T$ and generalizes to arbitrary, non-Gaussian distributions of real data $X$. The lower bound may fail for not highly symmetric $T$, but we conjecture that this problem can be solved by considering the focused version of the Gaussian width of $T$, which focuses on the most important directions of $T$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06597v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study random walks on metric spaces with contracting isometries. In this first article of the series, we establish sharp deviation inequalities by adapting Gou\"ezel's pivotal time construction. As an application, we establish the exponential bounds for deviation from below, central limit theorem, law of the iterated logarithms and the geodesic tracking of random walks on mapping class groups and CAT(0) spaces.</description>

      <title>Gradual convergence for Langevin dynamics on a degenerate potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11026v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an ordinary differential equation with a degenerate global attractor at the origin, to which we add a white noise with a small parameter that regulates its intensity. Under general conditions, for any fixed intensity, as time tends to infinity, the solution of this stochastic dynamics converges exponentially fast in total variation distance to a unique equilibrium distribution. We suitably accelerate the random dynamics and show that the preceding convergence is gradual, that is, the function that associates to each fixed $t\geq 0$ the total variation distance between the accelerated random dynamics at time $t$ and its equilibrium distribution converges, as the noise intensity tends to zero, to a decreasing function with values in $(0,1)$. Moreover, we prove that this limit function for each fixed $t \geq 0$ corresponds to the total variation distance between the marginal, at time $t$, of a stochastic differential equation that comes down from infinity and its corresponding equilibrium distribution. This completes the classification of all possible behaviors of the total variation distance between the time marginal of the aforementioned stochastic dynamics and its invariant measure for one dimensional well-behaved convex potentials. In addition, there is no cut-off phenomenon for this one-parameter family of random processes and asymptotics of the mixing times are derived.</description>

      <title>Supercritical sharpness for Voronoi percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the supercritical phase of Voronoi percolation on $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 3$, is well behaved in the sense that for every $p&gt;p_c(d)$ local uniqueness of macroscopic clusters happens with high probability. As a consequence, truncated connection probabilities decay exponentially fast and percolation happens on sufficiently thick 2D slabs. This is the analogue of the celebrated result of Grimmett &amp; Marstrand for Bernoulli percolation and serves as the starting point for renormalization techniques used to study several fine properties of the supercritical phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local perturbations in conservative particle systems can have a non-local influence on the stationary measure. To capture this phenomenon, we analyze in this paper two toy models. We study the symmetric exclusion process on a countable set of sites V with a source at a given point (called the origin), starting from a Bernoulli product measure with density $\rho$. We prove that when the underlying random walk on V is recurrent, then the system evolves towards full occupation, whereas in the transient case we obtain a limiting distribution which is not product and has long-range correlations. For independent random walkers on V , we analyze the same problem, starting from a Poissonian measure. Via intertwining with a system of ODE's, we prove that the distribution is Poissonian at all later times t \&amp;gt; 0, and that the system ''explodes'' in the limit t $\rightarrow$ $\infty$ if and only if the underlying random walk is recurrent. In the transient case, the limiting density is a simple function of the Green's function of the random walk.</description>

      <title>On the amenable subalgebras of group von Neumann algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We approach the study of sub-von Neumann algebras of the group von Neumann algebra $L\Gamma$ for countable groups $\Gamma$ from a dynamical perspective. It is shown that $L(\Gamma)$ admits a maximal invariant amenable subalgebra. The notion of invariant probability measures (IRAs) on the space of sub-algebras is introduced, analogous to the concept of Invariant Random Subgroups. And it is shown that amenable IRAs are supported on the maximal amenable invariant sub-algebra.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Reduced Multilevel Splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the classical problem of sampling with Monte Carlo methods a target rare event distribution defined by a score function that is very expensive to compute. We assume we can build using evaluations of the true score, an approximate surrogate score certified with error bounds. This work proposes a fully adaptive algorithm to sequentially sample surrogate rare event distributions with increasing target levels. An essential contribution consists in sampling at each iteration the surrogate rare event at a critical level corresponding to a specific cost. This cost is related to importance sampling for a target for a given budget. The critical level is calculated solely from the reduced score and its error bound From a practical point of view, sampling the proposal sequence is performed by extending the framework of the popular adaptive multilevel splitting algorithm to the use of score approximations. Numerical experiments evaluate the proposed importance sampling algorithm in terms of computational complexity versus squared error. In particular, we investigate the performance of the algorithm when simulating rare events related to the solution of a parametric PDE, which is approximated by a reduced basis.</description>

      <title>Drawing with Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing (a multiset of) coloured balls from an urn is one of the most basic models in discrete probability theory. Three modes of drawing are commonly distinguished: multinomial (draw-replace), hypergeometric (draw-delete), and Polya (draw-add). These drawing operations are represented as maps from urns to distributions over multisets of draws. The set of urns is a metric space via the Kantorovich distance. The set of distributions over draws is also a metric space, using Kantorovich-over-Kantorovich. It is shown that these three draw operations are all isometries, that is, they exactly preserve the Kantorovich distances. Further, drawing is studied in the limit, both for large urns and for large draws. First it is shown that, as the urn size increases, the Kantorovich distances go to zero between hypergeometric and multinomial draws, and also between P\'olya and multinomial draws. Second, it is shown that, as the drawsize increases, the Kantorovich distance goes to zero (in probability) between an urn and (normalised) multinomial draws from the urn. These results are known, but here, they are formulated in a novel metric manner as limits of Kantorovich distances. We call these two limit results the law of large urns and the law of large draws.</description>

      <title>L\'evy measures on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an explicit characterisation of L\'evy measures on both $L^p$-spaces and UMD Banach spaces. In the case of $L^p$-spaces, L\'evy measures are characterised by an integrability condition, which directly generalises the known description of L\'evy measures on sequence spaces. The latter has been the only known description of L\'evy measures on infinite dimensional Banach spaces that are not Hilbert. L\'evy measures on UMD Banach spaces are characterised by the finiteness of the expectation of a random {\gamma}-radonifying norm. Although this description is more abstract, it reduces to simple integrability conditions in the case of $L^p$-spaces.</description>
