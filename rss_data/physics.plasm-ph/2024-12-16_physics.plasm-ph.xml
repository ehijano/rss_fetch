      <title>Advancements in Maize Cultivation: Synergistic Effects of Dry Atmospheric Plasma Combined with Plasma-Activated Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effects of pre-germinative and post-germinative plasma treatments, applied separately or in combination, to improve maize germination and early seedling development. Pre-germinative treatment consists of priming the seeds with a dry atmospheric plasma (DAP) generated by a dielectric barrier device (DBD), characterized by minimal radiative emission, low electrical power (4 W) and high emissions of O, OH and NO radicals. Post-germinative treatment, known as plasma-activated water (PAW), uses a single-pin electrode device (SPED) to generate a DC discharge that features a power of 126 W and produces large amounts of OH radicals. The resulting PAW, after 5 minutes of SPED treatment, induces a slight acidification and increased concentrations of nitrate ions (from 24 to 250 mg/L), nitrite ions (from less than 0.1 to 56.1 mg/L) and hydrogen peroxide (from 0.3 to 18.5 mg/L). Results indicate that DAP applied on maize seeds for 20 min boosts their germination rate up to 90% (versus only 65% for untreated seeds) while reducing the median germination time by 37.5%. Then, seedling growth monitoring is achieved on control, DAP, PAW and DAP+PAW groups to assess stem length, hypocotyl length, leaf count, collar diameter and fresh/dry mass. The DAP+PAW group shows the most robust growth, demonstrating a synergistic effect of the combined treatments, particularly with significantly longer stem lengths. Additionally, physiological analyses of seedling leaves indicate a decrease in chlorophyll content despite enhanced growth, while fluorescence microscopy reveals a reduction in stomatal density in leaves treated with DAP and PAW, especially in the combined treatment group, potentially impacting photosynthetic efficiency and water regulation.</description>

      <title>Targeting Cholangiocarcinoma Cells By Cold Piezoelectric Plasmas: In Vitro Efficacy And Cellular Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold piezoelectric plasma (CPP) is a novel approach in cancer therapy, enabling the development of portable treatment devices capable of triggering cancer cell death. While its effectiveness remains underexplored, this research focuses on its application against cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), an aggressive cancer of the biliary tract. A CPP device is utilized to generate either a corona discharge (Pz-CD) or a dielectric barrier discharge (Pz-DBD) for in vitro experiments. Notably, Pz-CD can deliver more power than Pz-DBD, although both sources produce significant levels of reactive species in plasma and liquid phases. This work shows that CPP causes a gradient increase in medium temperature from the center towards the edges of the culture well, especially for longer treatment times. Although Pz-CD heats more significantly, it cools quickly after plasma extinction. When applied to human CCA cells, CPP shows immediate and long-term effects, more localized for Pz-CD, while more uniform for Pz-DBD. Immediate effects result also in actin cytoskeleton remodeling without alteration of the cell membrane permeability. Long-term effects of CPP, although the antioxidant system is engaged, include activation of the DNA damage response pathway leading to cell death. In conclusion, CPP should be recognized as a promising antitumor therapy.</description>

      <title>Global electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations of internal transport barriers in reversed-shear tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims at improving our understanding of the conditions enabling the development of an Internal transport barriers (ITB), using a more comprehensive physical model, including low-$\beta$ electromagnetic flux-driven simulations. Our key findings are that electron dynamics is crucial for ITB formation even in an ITG scenario and that having $q_{\text{min}}$ close to a lowest order rational value (2 in our simulations) to allow for eddies self-interaction is a necessary ingredient. Electron dynamics has two critical effects. First, it leads to a structure formation characterized by strong zonal flows shearing rate, reduction of turbulence and profile corrugation. Second, it leads to zonal current sheets that result in a broadening of the minimum-q region, qualitatively consistent with the flux-tube simulations of Vol\v{c}okas et al. [1]. Flux-driven simulations performed with $q_{\text{min}}=2$ reveal the development of the transport barrier in the ion channel, forming at inner and outer radial positions with respect to the $q_{\text{min}}$ position. The ITB formation in flux-driven setup is not recovered if $q_{\text{min}} = 2.03$. Additionally, a simulation at higher $\rho^*$ indicates that the extent of the flattened region of the q-profile due to turbulent self-interaction does not change proportionally to $\rho^*$ or to $\rho_i$, but somewhere in between. On the other hand, the input power required to achieve similar on-axis temperatures appears to exhibit almost GyroBohm scaling (for the two considered $\rho^*$ values). Furthermore, considering an initial q-profile with $q_{\text{min}} = 2.01$, flux-driven simulations show that partial self-interaction can evolve to complete self-interaction. This occurs due to turbulent-driven zonal currents that lower and flatten the q-profile down to $q_{\text{min}} = 2.0$, in line with what is reported in Vol\v{c}okas et al.[1].</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional tearing instability of flux-tube-like magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection, a fundamental plasma process, is pivotal in understanding energy conversion and particle acceleration in astrophysical systems. While extensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) configurations, the dynamics of reconnection in three-dimensional (3D) systems remain under-explored. In this work, we extend the classical tearing mode instability to 3D by introducing a modulation along the otherwise uniform direction in a 2D equilibrium, given by $g(y)$, mimicking a flux tube-like configuration. We perform linear stability analysis (both analytically and numerically) and direct numerical simulations to investigate the effects of three-dimensionality. Our findings reveal that the 3D tearing instability exhibits reduced growth rates compared to 2D by a factor of $\int g(y)^{1/2} dy~/\int dy$, with the dispersion relation maintaining similar scaling characteristics. We show that the modulation introduces spatially varying resistive layer properties, which influence the reconnection dynamics. Remarkably, we find that Sweet-Parker scaling for the reconnection rate persists even in the absence of a guide field.</description>

      <title>Lower-Hybrid Drift Instabilities in a magnetic nozzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic nozzles are a key component of electrodeless plasma thrusters, acting as their main acceleration stage. Non-stationary phenomena common to the entire range of $E \times B$ devices, such as oscillations and instabilities, are likely to exist in the magnetic nozzle, according to the mounting experimental evidence. These mechanisms could lead to anomalous cross-field transport, either enhancing the plasma plume divergence or favoring electron detachment. In this work we present a local linear analysis of fluid instabilities relevant for said devices, expanding on previous works with the addition of plasma inhomogeneities in the direction parallel to the magnetic field, with a rigorous inclusion of the effects of magnetic curvature, finite Larmor radius and $3$D wave propagation, allowing for a general formulation of drift-driven instabilities in partially magnetized plasmas. Instability conditions are first studied analytically, and then applied to simulation data of a helicon plasma thruster. Finally, the effect of instabilities on wave-driven cross-field electron transport is assessed by means of quasi-linear analysis. This study predicts the onset of essentially-azimuthal instabilities in the $1$ kHz--$1$ MHz range, in qualitative agreement with some of the available experimental data, and highlights the importance of including parallel inhomogeneities in the formulation of the dispersion relation of an $E \times B$ plasma, as these gradients may drive instabilities even in the absence of axial propagation. Lastly, quasi-linear analysis suggests that the induced cross-field transport acts to smooth out the zeroth-order drifts which cause the plasma to destabilize in the first place.</description>

      <title>Limitations of emittance and source size measurement of laser-accelerated electron beams using the pepper-pot mask method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pepper-pot method is a widely used technique originally proposed for measuring the emittance of space-charge-dominated electron beams from radio-frequency photoinjectors. With recent advances in producing high-brightness electron beams via laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA), the method has also been applied to evaluate emittance in this new regime [1-3]. In this work, we explore the limitations of the method in inferring the emittance and beam waist of LWFA electron beams, showing that the technique becomes inaccurate for small emittance values.</description>

      <title>Electron Heating by Parallel Electric Fields in Magnetotail Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate electron heating by magnetic-field-aligned electric fields ($E_\parallel$) during anti-parallel magnetic reconnection in the Earth's magnetotail. Using a statistical sample of 140 reconnection outflows, we infer the acceleration potential associated with $E_\parallel$ from the shape of the electron velocity distribution functions. We show that heating by $E_\parallel$ in the reconnection outflow can reach up to ten times the inflow electron temperature. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the acceleration potential scales with the inflow Alfv\'en and electron thermal speeds to maintain quasi-neutrality in the reconnection region. Our results suggest that $E_\parallel$ plays a major role in the ion-to-electron energy partition associated with magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Spin Rotation of Relativistic Lepton Beams via Terahertz Wave in a Dielectric-Lined Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin rotation is central for the spin-manipulation of lepton beams which, in turn, plays an important role in investigation of the properties of spin-polarized lepton beams and the examination of spin-dependent interactions. However, realization of compact and ultrafast spin rotation of lepton beams, between longitudinal and transverse polarizations, still faces significant challenges. Here, we put forward a novel method for ultrafast (picosecond-timescale) spin rotation of a relativistic lepton beam via employing a moderate-intensity terahertz (THz) wave in a dielectric-lined waveguide (DLW). The lepton beam undergoes spin precession induced by the THz magnetic field. We find that optimizing the lepton velocity and THz phase velocity in the DLW can mitigate the impact of transverse Lorentz forces on the lepton beam and increase the precession frequency, thereby maintaining the beam quality and enhancing the efficiency of transverse-to-longitudinal spin rotation. The final polarization degree of the lepton beam exceeds $98\%$, and the energy spread can be improved significantly. Flexibility in adjusting the electromagnetic modes within the DLW adds further potential for spin-manipulation, and holds promise for advancing the development of spin-polarized particle beams, which have broad applications in materials science and atomic, nuclear, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the $m=1$ rigid ballooning mode in a mirror trap with high-beta sloshing ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stability of the ``rigid'' $m = 1$ ballooning mode in a mirror axisymmetric trap is studied for the case of oblique neutral beam injection (NBI), which creates an anisotropic population of fast sloshing ions. Since small-scale modes with azimuthal numbers $m&gt;1$ in long thin (paraxial) mirror traps are easily stabilized by finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects, suppression of the rigid ballooning and flute modes would mean stabilization of all MHD modes, with the exception of mirror and fire-hose disturbances, which are intensively studied in geophysics, but have not yet been identified in mirror traps.
  Large-scale ballooning mode can, in principle, be suppressed either by the lateral perfectly conducting wall, or by the end MHD anchors such as cusp, or by biased limiters, or by combination of these two methods. The effect of the wall shape, vacuum gap width between the plasma column and the lateral wall, angle of oblique NBI, radial profile of the plasma pressure, and axial profile of the vacuum magnetic field are studied.</description>

      <title>Enhanced pedestal transport driven by edge collisionality on Alcator C-Mod and its role in regulating H-mode pedestal gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental measurements of plasma and neutral profiles across the pedestal are used in conjunction with 2D edge modeling to examine pedestal stiffness in Alcator C-Mod H-mode plasmas. Experiments on Alcator C-Mod observed pedestal degradation and loss in confinement below a critical value of net power crossing the separatrix, $P_\mathrm{net} = P_\mathrm{net}^\mathrm{crit} \approx 2.3$ MW. New analysis of ionization and particle flux profiles reveal saturation of the pedestal electron density, $n_{e}^\mathrm{ped}$ despite continuous increases in ionization throughout the pedestal, inversely related to $P_\mathrm{net}$. A limit to the pedestal $\nabla n_{e}$ emerges as the particle flux, $\Gamma_{D}$ continues to grow, implying increases in the effective particle diffusivity, $D_\mathrm{eff}$. This is well-correlated with the separatrix collisionality, $\nu^{*}_\mathrm{sep}$ and a turbulence control parameter, $\alpha_{t}$, implying a possible transition in type of turbulence. The transition is well correlated with the experimentally observed value of $P_\mathrm{net}^\mathrm{crit}$. SOLPS-ITER modeling is performed for select discharges from the power scan, constrained with experimental electron and neutral densities, measured at the outer midplane. The modeling confirms general growth in $D_\mathrm{eff}$, consistent with experimental findings, and additionally suggests even larger growth in $\chi_{e}$ at the same $P_\mathrm{net}^\mathrm{crit}$.</description>

      <title>Identification of highly-forbidden optical transitions in highly charged ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical clocks represent the most precise experimental devices, finding application in fields spanning from frequency metrology to fundamental physics. Recently, the first highly charged ions (HCI) based optical clock was demonstrated using Ar$^{13+}$, opening up a plethora of novel systems with advantageous atomic properties for high accuracy clocks. While numerous candidate systems have been explored theoretically, the considerable uncertainty of the clock transition frequency for most species poses experimental challenges. Here, we close this gap by exploring quantum logic-inspired experimental search techniques for sub-Hertz clock transitions in HCI confined to a linear Paul trap. These techniques encompass Rabi excitation, an optical dipole force (ODF) approach, and linear continuous sweeping (LCS) and their applicability for different types of HCI. Through our investigation, we provide tools to pave the way for the development of exceptionally precise HCI-based optical clocks.</description>
