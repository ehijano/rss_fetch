      <title>From microscopic social force models to macroscopic continuum models for pedestrian flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pedestrian flow is one of the most complex systems, involving large populations of interacting agents. Models at microscopic and macroscopic scales offer different advantages for studying related problems. In general, microscopic models can describe interaction forces at the individual level. Macroscopic models, on the other hand, provide analytical insights into global interactions and long-term overall dynamics, along with efficient numerical simulations and predictions. However, the relationship between models at different scales has rarely been explored. In this study, based on the original microscopic social force model with a reactive optimal route choice strategy, we first derive kinetic equations at the mesoscopic level. By varying the interaction force in different scenarios, we then derive several continuum models at the macroscopic level. Finally, numerical examples are given to evaluate the behaviors of the social force model and our continuum models.</description>

      <title>Neural-Inspired Multi-Agent Molecular Communication Networks for Collective Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Communication (MC) is a pivotal enabler for the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). However, current research often relies on super-capable individual agents with complex transceiver architectures that defy the energy and processing constraints of realistic nanomachines. This paper proposes a paradigm shift towards collective intelligence, inspired by the cortical networks of the biological brain. We introduce a decentralized network architecture where simple nanomachines interact via a diffusive medium using a threshold-based firing mechanism modeled by Greenberg-Hastings (GH) cellular automata. We derive fixed-point equations for steady-state populations via mean-field analysis and validate them against stochastic simulations. We demonstrate that the network undergoes a second-order phase transition at a specific activation threshold. Crucially, we show that both pairwise and collective mutual information peak exactly at this critical transition point, confirming that the system maximizes information propagation and processing capacity at the edge of chaos.</description>

      <title>Order Out of Noise and Disorder: Fate of the Frustrated Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Langevin dynamics of $N$ Brownian particles on compact two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, interacting through pairwise potentials linear in geodesic distance with quenched random couplings. These \emph{frustrated Brownian particles} experience the competing demands of random attractive and repulsive interactions while confined to curved surfaces. We consider three geometries: the sphere $S^2$, torus $T^2$ (closed manifolds), and bounded cylinder $S^1 \times [0,H]$ (manifold with boundary). Our central finding is disorder-induced dimension reduction accompanied by spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry: order emerges from the combination of two sources of randomness (thermal noise and quenched disorder), with the manifold topology determining the character of the emerging structures. Glassy relaxation drives particles from 2D distributions to quasi-1D structures, specifically bands on $S^2$, rings on $T^2$, and localized clusters on the cylinder. The symmetry breaking pattern depends on topology: SO(3)$\to$SO(2) on the sphere, SO(2)$\times$SO(2)$\to$SO(2)$\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ on the torus, and SO(2)$\to\mathbb{Z}_2$ on the cylinder. Unlike conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking, the symmetry-breaking direction is not frozen but evolves slowly via thermal noise through type-A diffusive Nambu-Goldstone dynamics, while the reduced-dimensional structure persists. Unlike conventional self-organizing systems that require external driving or fine-tuned nonlinearities, our model demonstrates that geometry and topology alone can channel randomness into order. We discuss connections to spin glass theory, quantum field theory, astrophysical structure formation, and self-organizing systems, providing a geometric framework for understanding how disorder generates emergent spatial order on curved spaces.</description>

      <title>Adaptive dynamics of eco-evolutionary repeated games: Effect of reward and punishment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-term evolutionary processes can strongly influence common-pool resource conservation by generating new traits or behaviours that modify the feedback between population strategies and the resource state. Here we develop an eco-evolutionary framework in which individuals repeatedly interact with the same opponent and follow direct reciprocity through reactive strategies. The strategic dynamics is coupled to a renewable common resource and analyzed using adaptive dynamics. After our exhaustive non-linear dynamical analysis of $2\times2$ strategic games, we focus on comparative and combined usefulness of institutional incentives in the form of rewards and punishments in preventing the Tragedy of the Commons even when defection dominates in the replete resource state. We also report possibility of robust stable oscillations -- emerging via Hopf bifurcation -- in resource state and population strategies.</description>

      <title>How Information Evolves: Stability-Driven Assembly and the Emergence of a Natural Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information can evolve as a physical consequence of non-equilibrium dynamics, even in the absence of genes, replication, or predefined fitness functions. We present Stability-Driven Assembly (SDA), a framework in which stochastic assembly combined with differential persistence biases populations toward longer-lived motifs. Assemblies that persist longer become more frequent and are therefore more likely to participate in subsequent interactions, generating feedback that reshapes the population distribution and implements fitness-proportional sampling, realizing evolution as a natural, emergent genetic algorithm (SDA/GA) driven solely by stability. We apply SDA/GA to chemical symbol space using SMILES fragments with recombination, mutation, and a heuristic stability function. Simulations show hallmark features of evolutionary search, including scaffold-level dominance, sustained novelty, and entropy reduction, yielding open-ended dynamics absent from equilibrium models with fixed transition rates. These results motivate an evolutionary ladder hypothesis where persistence-driven selection precedes genetic replication.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in Traffic Dynamics: Mechanisms of Hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from a second-order linear differential equation, we analyze the dynamical mechanisms of no behavior pattern (pure response), reaction and anticipation behaviors in traffic. As an emergence of the underlying dynamical evolution, the periodic evolution trajectories (3D hysteresis) in phase space ($v_i, v_j, d_{ji}$) exhibit fascinating characters. We investigate the emerging Time-Delay ($TD$) phenomena and the resulting analytical hysteresis, an equal frequency sets of Lissajous figures. By quantifying energy dissipation through individual and system perspectives, we demonstrate that $TD$ and Time-To-Collision ($TTC$) are direct metrics of zero-dissipation under equilibrium and synchronization states. Finally, a phase diagram based on $TD$ and $TTC$ is developed to bridge the dynamical behaviors in traffic across $\mathbb{R}^1$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$ spaces. Our results provide a theoretical foundation upon which many obscure mechanisms become self-evident, such as the $TD$-induced flip of the hysteresis (clockwise to counterclockwise in FD) and the crossed hysteresis, etc.</description>

      <title>Competitive Social Mobilization in Threshold Models of Collective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social mobilization often fails not for a lack of collective interest, but because of fierce competition between rival movements for the same limited pool of participants. We generalize the classic threshold model of collective behavior to analyze this competitive aggregation, exploring how populations with diverse participation thresholds navigate multiple, mutually exclusive causes. Focusing on the conditions necessary for a single consensus movement to encompass an entire population, our analysis reveals that the outcome of social competition depends critically on the stability of individual dispositions. In quenched environments where participation thresholds are fixed, increasing resistance initially allows a dominant movement to suppress its competitors; however, further resistance triggers a sudden collapse into total fragmentation as low-threshold instigators become too rare to sustain growth. Conversely, in annealed environments where opinions are fluid, higher resistance paradoxically drives a winner-takes-all consensus. In this fluid scenario, massive movements can only be avoided through a deliberate divide-and-conquer strategy. In both cases, the transitions between pulverized and massive movements are discontinuous. These findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of social control depends entirely on environmental stability: raising the cost of participation can either forge unity or shatter collective action into insignificance.</description>

      <title>Crossing the Functional Desert: Cascade-Driven Assembly and Feasibility Transitions in Early Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of life poses a problem of combinatorial feasibility: How can temporally supported functional organization arise in exponentially branching assembly spaces when unguided exploration behaves as a memoryless random walk? We show that nonlinear threshold-cascade dynamics in connected interaction networks provide a minimal, substrate-agnostic mechanism that can soften this obstruction. Below a critical connectivity threshold, cascades die out locally and structured input-output response mappings remain sparse and transient-a "functional desert" in which accumulation is dynamically unsupported. Near the critical percolation threshold, system-spanning cascades emerge, enabling discriminative functional responses. We illustrate this transition using a minimal toy model and generalize the argument to arbitrary networked systems. Also near criticality, cascades introduce finite-timescale structural and functional coherence, directional bias, and weak dynamical path-dependence into otherwise memoryless exploration, allowing biased accumulation. This connectivity-driven transition-functional percolation-requires only generic ingredients: interacting units, nonlinear thresholds, influence transmission, and non-zero coherence times. The mechanism does not explain specific biochemical pathways, but it identifies a necessary dynamical regime in which structured functional organization can emerge and be temporarily supported, providing a physical foundation for how combinatorial feasibility barriers can be crossed through network dynamics alone.</description>

      <title>Largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered, which yields a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of the absolute value of Euler characteristic in finite-size graphs near to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS): A Unified Spectral Topology Framework for Stability in Turbulence, AI, and Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems frequently encounter a recurrent structural instability: the collapse of the spectral gap, driving the system toward a low-dimensional "Zero-Mode Attractor" (e.g., spectral pile-up or over-smoothing). Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator - Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) - functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations: (1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity. Crucially, we verify that the operator remains dormant ($\gamma \approx 0$) during the linear growth phase of physical instabilities, functioning strictly as a conditional topological clamp. (2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($\sigma^2 \equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonlinear Heterogeneity in Physical Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical neural networks typically train linear synaptic weights while treating device nonlinearities as fixed. We show the opposite - by training the synaptic nonlinearity itself, as in Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architectures, we yield markedly higher task performance per physical resource and improved performance-parameter scaling than conventional linear weight-based networks, demonstrating ability of KAN topologies to exploit reconfigurable nonlinear physical dynamics.
  We experimentally realise physical KANs in silicon-on-insulator devices we term 'Synaptic Nonlinear Elements' (SYNEs), operating at room temperature, microampere currents, 2 MHz speeds and ~250 fJ per nonlinear operation, with no observed degradation over 10^13 measurements and months-long timescales.
  We demonstrate nonlinear function regression, classification, and prediction of Li-Ion battery dynamics from noisy real-world multi-sensor data. Physical KANs outperform equivalently-parameterised software multilayer perceptron networks across all tasks, with up to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters, and two orders of magnitude fewer devices than linear weight based physical networks. These results establish learned physical nonlinearity as a hardware-native computational primitive for compact and efficient learning systems, and SYNE devices as effective substrates for heterogenous nonlinear computing.</description>
