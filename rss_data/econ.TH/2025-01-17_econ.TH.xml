      <title>A robust measure of complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a robust belief-based measure of complexity. The idea is that task A is deemed more complex than task B if the probability of solving A correctly is smaller than the probability of solving B correctly regardless of the reward. We fully characterize the corresponding order over the set of tasks. The main characteristic of this relation is that it depends, not only on difficulty (like most complexity definitions in the literature) but also on ex ante uncertainty. Finally, we show that for every task for which information is optimally acquired, there exists a more complex task which always induces less effort regardless of the reward.</description>

      <title>Regulation of Algorithmic Collusion, Refined: Testing Pessimistic Calibrated Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the regulation of algorithmic (non-)collusion amongst sellers in dynamic imperfect price competition by auditing their data as introduced by Hartline et al. [2024].
  We develop an auditing method that tests whether a seller's pessimistic calibrated regret is low. The pessimistic calibrated regret is the highest calibrated regret of outcomes compatible with the observed data. This method relaxes the previous requirement that a pricing algorithm must use fully-supported price distributions to be auditable. This method is at least as permissive as any auditing method that has a high probability of failing algorithmic outcomes with non-vanishing calibrated regret. Additionally, we strengthen the justification for using vanishing calibrated regret, versus vanishing best-in-hindsight regret, as the non-collusion definition, by showing that even without any side information, the pricing algorithms that only satisfy weaker vanishing best-in-hindsight regret allow an opponent to manipulate them into posting supra-competitive prices. This manipulation cannot be excluded with a non-collusion definition of vanishing best-in-hindsight regret.
  We motivate and interpret the approach of auditing algorithms from their data as suggesting a per se rule. However, we demonstrate that it is possible for algorithms to pass the audit by pretending to have higher costs than they actually do. For such scenarios, the rule of reason can be applied to bound the range of costs to those that are reasonable for the domain.</description>

      <title>Consistent Linear Orders for Supermajority Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider linear orders of finite alternatives that are constructed by aggregating the preferences of individuals. We focus on a linear order that is consistent with the collective preference relation, which is constructed by one of the supermajority rules and modified using two procedures if there exist some cycles. One modification procedure uses the transitive closure, and the other uses the Suzumura consistent closure. We derive two sets of linear orders that are consistent with the (modified) collective preference relations formed by any of the supermajority rules and show that these sets are generally not empty. These sets of linear orders are closely related to those obtained through the ranked pairs method and the Schulze method. Finally, we show that any linear order included in either of the sets satisfies two properties: the extended Condorcet criterion and the Pareto principle.</description>

      <title>Identifying Assumptions and Research Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A representative researcher has repeated opportunities for empirical research. To process findings, she must impose an "identifying assumption." She conducts research when the assumption is sufficiently plausible (taking into account both current beliefs and the quality of the opportunity), and updates beliefs as if the assumption were perfectly valid. We study the dynamics of this learning process. While the rate of research cannot always increase over time, research slowdown is possible. We characterize environments in which the rate is constant. Long-run beliefs can exhibit history-dependence and "false certitude." We apply the model to stylized examples of empirical methodologies: experiments, various causal-inference techniques, and "calibration."</description>

      <title>Hoping for the best while preparing for the worst in the face of uncertainty: a new type of incomplete preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and axiomatize a new model of incomplete preferences under uncertainty, which we call hope-and-prepare preferences. Act f is considered more desirable than act g when, and only when, both an optimistic evaluation, computed as the welfare level attained in a best-case scenario, and a pessimistic one, computed as the welfare level attained in a worst-case scenario, rank f above g. Our comparison criterion involves multiple priors, as best and worst cases are determined among sets of probability distributions, and is, generically, less conservative than Bewley preferences and twofold multi-prior preferences, the two ambiguity models that are closest to ours.</description>

      <title>Local hedging approximately solves Pandora's box problems with nonobligatory inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider search problems with nonobligatory inspection and single-item or combinatorial selection. A decision maker is presented with a number of items, each of which contains an unknown price, and can pay an inspection cost to observe the item's price before selecting it. Under single-item selection, the decision maker must select one item; under combinatorial selection, the decision maker must select a set of items that satisfies certain constraints. In our nonobligatory inspection setting, the decision maker can select items without first inspecting them. It is well-known that search with nonobligatory inspection is harder than the well-studied obligatory inspection case, for which the optimal policy for single-item selection (Weitzman, 1979) and approximation algorithms for combinatorial selection (Singla, 2018) are known.
  We introduce a technique, local hedging, for constructing policies with good approximation ratios in the nonobligatory inspection setting. Local hedging transforms policies for the obligatory inspection setting into policies for the nonobligatory inspection setting, at the cost of an extra factor in the approximation ratio. The factor is instance-dependent but is at most 4/3. We thus obtain the first approximation algorithms for a variety of combinatorial selection problems, including matroid basis, matching, and facility location.</description>
