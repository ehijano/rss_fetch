      <title>Multi-droplet combustion in the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous atomizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of heterogeneous and homogeneous atomizations on combustion dynamics and flame spread rates of multi-droplets are experimentally investigated. The utilized fuel is biodiesel, which is doped with graphene oxide and blended with ethanol. Stable fuel suspensions are prepared. Either one droplet is positioned at the intersection of two thin fibers or an array of three droplets are positioned along a horizontal line and at the intersections of fibers. Simultaneous and time-resolved flame chemiluminescence and shadowgraphy techniques are utilized for imaging the flame and droplets, respectively. It is observed that, for a single droplet combustion of biodiesel, relatively low frequency (about 10 Hz) dynamics appear in the second half of the droplet life-time, which is due to heterogeneous atomizations. Blending with ethanol leads to homogeneous atomizations with dynamics featuring frequencies smaller than 50 Hz and at the beginning of the droplet lifetime. It is reported that the homogeneous atomizations lead to at least three times larger root-mean-square oscillations of the flame chemiluminescence compared to that for heterogeneous atomizations. For all tested multi-droplet configurations, independent of the graphene oxide doping concentration and blending with ethanol, the most dominant frequency of flame chemiluminescence oscillations is about 10-15 Hz. It is observed that the heterogeneous atomizations lead to a flame spread rate of about 6-8 mm2/s, with largest values reported for doping with moderate concentration of graphene oxide. Compared to that for heterogeneous atomizations, the flame spread rate for homogeneous atomizations are significantly larger 10-40 mm2/s, are not sensitive to graphene oxide doping concentration, and feature a positive relation with the root-mean-square of the flame chemiluminescence oscillations.</description>

      <title>Stacked Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities grow drops into soft stalactite-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between thin film hydrodynamics and solidification produces formidably intricate geophysical structures, such as stalactites and icicles, whose shape is a testimony of their long growth. In simpler settings, liquid films can also produce regular patterns. When coated on the underside of a flat plate, these films are unstable and yield lattices of drops following the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. While this interfacial instability is well-studied in Newtonian fluids, much less is known about what happens when the thin film solidifies. Here, we coat the underside of a surface with liquid elastomer, allowing the film to destabilize and flow while it cures into an elastic solid. Once the first coating yields an array of solid droplets, this iterative coat-flow-cure process is repeated and gives rise to corrugated slender structures, which we name flexicles for their resemblance to icicles. We study the subtle combination of chaos and order that confers our flexicles, their structure, shape, arrangement, and, ultimately, deformability.</description>

      <title>Pressure fluctuations of liquids under short-time acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study experimentally investigates the pressure fluctuations of liquids in a column under short-time acceleration and demonstrates that the Strouhal number $St$ [$=L/(c\Delta t)$, where $L$, $c$, and $\Delta t$ are the liquid column length, speed of sound, and acceleration duration, respectively] provides a measure of the pressure fluctuations both for limiting cases (i.e. $St\ll1$ or $St = \infty$) and for intermediate $St$ values. Incompressible fluid theory and water hammer theory respectively imply that the magnitude of the averaged pressure fluctuation $\overline{P}$ becomes negligible for $St\ll1$ (i.e., in the condition where the duration of acceleration $\Delta t$ is large enough compared to the acoustic timescale) and tends to $\rho cu_0$ (where $u_0$ is the change in the liquid velocity) for $St\geq O(1)$ (i.e., in the condition where $\Delta t$ is small enough). For intermediate $St$ values, there is no consensus on the value of $\overline{P}$. In our experiments, $L$, $c$, and $\Delta t$ are varied so that $0.02 \leq St \leq 2.2$. The results suggest that the incompressible fluid theory holds only up to $St\sim0.2$ and that $St$ governs the pressure fluctuations under different experimental conditions for higher $St$ values. The data relating to a hydrogel also tend to collapse to a unified trend. The inception of cavitation in the liquid starts at $St\sim 0.2$ for various $\Delta t$, indicating that the liquid pressure becomes negative. To understand this mechanism, we employ a one-dimensional wave propagation model with a pressure wavefront of finite thickness that scales with $\Delta t$. The model provides a reasonable description of the experimental results as a function of $St$. The slight discrepancy between the model and experimental results reveals additional contributing factors such as the container motion and the profile of the pressure wavefront.</description>

      <title>Clustering and chaotic motion of heavy inertial particles in an isolated non-axisymmetric vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of heavy inertial particles in a flow field due to an isolated, non-axisymmetric vortex. For our study, we consider a canonical elliptical vortex - the Kirchhoff vortex and its strained variant, the Kida vortex. Contrary to the anticipated centrifugal dispersion of inertial particles, which is typical in open vortical flows, we observe the clustering of particles around co-rotating attractors near the Kirchhoff vortex due to its non-axisymmetric nature. We analyze the inertia-modified stability characteristics of the fixed points, highlighting how some of the fixed points migrate in physical space, collide and then annihilate with increasing particle inertia. The introduction of external straining, the Kida vortex being an example, introduces chaotic tracer transport. Using a Melnikov analysis, we show that particle inertia and external straining can compete, where chaotic transport can be suppressed beyond a critical value of particle inertia.</description>

      <title>Quasi-geostrophic projection of rotating shallow-water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a new unifying model for layered rotating shallow-water (RSW) and quasi-geostrophic (QG) equations, this paper sheds light on the relation between these two sets of equations. We propose here a new formulation of the quasi-geostrophic equations as a projection of the rotating shallow-water equations. This QG formulation uses the same prognostic variables as RSW, namely velocity and layer thickness, restoring the proximity of these two sets of equations. It allows direct access to the ageostrophic velocities hidden in geostrophic velocities resolved by the QG equations. It opens the path of studying the difference between QG and RSW using the same underlying numerical discretization. We illustrate this new possibility on a vortex shear instability and a double-gyre configuration.</description>

      <title>Gradient dynamics approach to reactive thin-film hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wetting and dewetting dynamics of simple and complex liquids is described by kinetic equations in gradient dynamics form that incorporates the various coupled dissipative processes in a fully thermodynamically consistent manner. After briefly reviewing this, we also review how chemical reactions can be captured by a related gradient dynamics description, assuming detailed balanced mass action type kinetics. Then, we bring both aspects together and discuss mesoscopic reactive thin-film hydrodynamics illustrated by two examples, namely, models for reactive wetting and reactive surfactants. These models can describe the approach to equilibrium but may also be employed to study out-of-equilibrium dynamics. In the latter case, one breaks the gradient dynamics form by chemostatting to obtain active systems. In this way, for reactive wetting we recover running drops that are driven by chemically sustained wettability gradients and for drops covered by autocatalytic reactive surfactants we find complex forms of self-propulsion and self-excited oscillations.</description>

      <title>An inflated dynamic Laplacian to track the emergence and disappearance of semi-material coherent sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian methods continue to stand at the forefront of the analysis of time-dependent dynamical systems. Most Lagrangian methods have criteria that must be fulfilled by trajectories as they are followed throughout a given finite flow duration. This key strength of Lagrangian methods can also be a limitation in more complex evolving environments. It places a high importance on selecting a time window that produces useful results, and these results may vary significantly with changes in the flow duration. We show how to overcome this drawback in the tracking of coherent flow features. Finite-time coherent sets (FTCS) are material objects that strongly resist mixing in complicated nonlinear flows. Like other materially coherent objects, by definition they must retain their coherence properties throughout the specified flow duration. Recent work [Froyland and Koltai, CPAM, 2023] introduced the notion of semi-material FTCS, whereby a balance is struck between the material nature and the coherence properties of FTCS. This balance provides the flexibility for FTCS to come and go, merge and separate, or undergo other changes as the governing unsteady flow experiences dramatic shifts. The purpose of this work is to illustrate the utility of the inflated dynamic Laplacian introduced in [Froyland and Koltai, CPAM, 2023] in a range of dynamical systems that are challenging to analyse by standard Lagrangian means, and to provide an efficient meshfree numerical approach for the discretisation of the inflated dynamic Laplacian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Karman-Howarth-Monin-Hill (KHMH) equation has been widely applied to scale-by-scale turbulent energy cascade studies in recent years, however, the forms and interpretations are not consistent. The present work generalizes to considering two different spatio-temporal points to reformulate the KHMH equation based on Reynolds decomposition and phase averaging. The unaveraged form and phase averaged form are detailed and interpreted. Then the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy are included in the KHMH equation to obtain the special form for homogeneous flows and isotropic flows.</description>

      <title>One-winged butterflies: mode selection for azimuthal magnetorotational instability by thermal convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of thermal convection on turbulence in accretion discs, and particularly its interaction with the magnetorotational instability (MRI), are of significant astrophysical interest. Despite extensive theoretical and numerical studies, such interactions have not been explored experimentally. We conduct linear analysis of the azimuthal version of MRI (AMRI) in the presence of convection and compare our findings with the experimental data. We show that AMRI sets in at lower critical Hartmann numbers ($Ha$) in the presence of convection. Importantly, convection breaks symmetry between the $m = \pm 1$ modes ($m$ is the azimuthal wavenumber). This preference for one mode over the other makes the AMRI-wave look like a "one-winged butterfly" observed in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Internally Driven $\beta$-plane Plasma Turbulence Using the Hasegawa-Wakatani System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General problem of plasma turbulence can be formulated as advection of potential vorticity (PV), which handles flow self-organization, coupled to a number of other fields, whose gradients provide free energy sources. Therefore, focusing on PV evolution separates the underlying linear instability from the flow self-organization, and clarifies key spatial scales in terms of balances between various time scales. Considering the Hasegawa-Wakatani model as a minimal, nontrivial model of plasma turbulence where the energy is injected internally by a linear instability, we find that the critical wavenumber $k_{c}=C/\kappa$ where $C$ is the adiabaticity parameter and $\kappa$ is the normalized density gradient separates the adiabatic (or highly zonostrophic) behavior for large scales from the hydrodynamic behavior at small scales. In the adiabatic range the non-zonal part of the wave-number spectrum goes from $E(k)\propto\gamma_{k}U^{-1}k^{-2}$ around the peak to $E(k) \propto \omega_{k}^{2} k^{-3}$ in the "inertial" range, where $\gamma_{k}$ and $\omega_{k}$ are the linear growth and frequency and $U$ is the rms zonal velocity. This proposed spectrum fits very well for the large $k_{c}$ case, where the bulk of the spectrum is in the adiabatic range. In contrast for small $k_{c}$, we get the usual forward enstrophy cascade with $E(k)\propto\epsilon_{W}^{2/3}k^{-3}$, where $\epsilon_{W}$ is the enstrophy dissipation. In contrast for $k_{c}\approx 1$, the system transitions to hydrodynamic forward enstrophy cascade right after the injection range, with zonal flows at large scales and forward enstrophy cascade at small scales. It is argued that the ratio $R_{\beta}\equiv k_{\beta}/k_{\text{peak}}\approx k_{c}/k_{\text{peak}}$ where $k_{\text{peak}}$ is the peak wave-number can be defined as the zonostrophy parameter.</description>

      <title>Active nematic-isotropic interfaces on flat surfaces: effects of anchoring, ordering field and activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A surface in contact with the isotropic phase of a passive liquid crystal can induce nematic order over distances that range from microscopic to macroscopic when the nematic-isotropic interface undergoes an orientational-wetting transition. If the nematic is active, what happens to the interface? Does it propagate and, if it does, is its structure different from the passive one? In this paper, we address these questions. We investigate how the active nematic-isotropic interface is affected by the anchoring strength of the surface, the bulk ordering field and the activity. We find that while passive interfaces are one-dimensional the active ones exhibit two dynamical regimes: a passive-like regime and a propagating regime where the interfaces propagate until the entire domain is active nematic. Active interfaces break the translational symmetry within the interfacial plane above a threshold activity, where the active nematic fluctuations, which are ultimately responsible for the emergence of an active turbulent nematic phase, drive non-steady dynamical interfacial regimes.</description>

      <title>Pattern selection and the route to turbulence in incompressible polar active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active fluids, such as suspensions of microswimmers, are known to self-organize into complex spatio-temporal flow patterns. An intriguing example is mesoscale turbulence, a state of dynamic vortex structures exhibiting a characteristic length scale. Here, we employ a minimal model for the effective microswimmer velocity field to explore how the turbulent state develops from regular vortex patterns when the strength of activity resp. related parameters such as nonlinear advection or polar alignment strength - is increased. First, we demonstrate analytically that the system, without any spatial constraints, develops a stationary square vortex lattice in the absence of nonlinear advection. Subsequently, we perform an extended stability analysis of this nonuniform "ground state" and uncover a linear instability, which follows from the mutual excitement and simultaneous growth of multiple perturbative modes. This extended analysis is based on linearization around an approximation of the analytical vortex lattice solution and allows us to calculate critical activity parameters. Above these critical values, the vortex lattice develops into mesoscale turbulence in numerical simulations. Utilizing the numerical approach, we uncover an extended region of hysteresis where both patterns are possible depending on the initial condition. Here, we find that turbulence persists below the instability of the vortex lattice. We further determine the stability of square vortex patterns as a function of their wavenumber and represent the results analogous to the well-known Busse balloons known from classical pattern-forming systems. Here, the region of stable periodic patterns shrinks and eventually disappears with increasing activity parameters. Our results show that the strength of activity plays a similar role for active turbulence as the Reynolds number does in driven flow exhibiting inertial turbulence.</description>

      <title>Active transport of a passive colloid in a bath of run-and-tumble particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion of a passive colloid immersed in a bath of non-interacting and non-Brownian run-and-tumble microswimmers in two dimensions is analyzed using stochastic simulations and an asymptotic theory, both based on a minimal model of swimmer-colloid collisions characterized solely by frictionless steric interactions. We estimate the effective long-time diffusivity $\mathcal{D}$ of the suspended colloid resulting from its interaction with the active bath, and elucidate its dependence on the level of activity (persistence length of swimmer trajectories), the mobility ratio of the colloid to a swimmer, and the number density of swimmers in the bath. We also propose a semi-analytical model for the colloid diffusivity in terms of the variance and correlation time of the net fluctuating active force on the colloid resulting from swimmer collisions. Quantitative agreement is found between numerical simulations and analytical results in the experimentally-relevant regime of low swimmer density, low mobility ratios, and high activity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1710.03986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The onset of viscous fingering in the presence of a non monotonic viscosity profile is investigated theoretically for two immiscible fluids. Classical fluid dynamics predicts that no unstable behavior may be observed when a viscous fluid pushes a less viscous one in a Hele-Shaw cell. Here, we show that the presence of a viscosity gradient at the interface between both fluids destabilize the interface facilitating the spread of the perturbation. The influence of the viscosity gradient on the dispersion relation is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Jet Mode in Electrospraying of Newtonian and Viscoelastic Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:1911.04730v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to explore the role of viscoelastic properties of polymeric solutions on the jet mode in the electrospray process. In this research, several numerical simulations were performed to model the behavior of electrified Newtonian and viscoelastic jets. First, used for validating viscoelastic constitutive equations and their implementation, the benchmark problem of the sedimenting sphere is stabilized beyond the previously suggested threshold. Then, an electrified DI water jet was simulated, and the obtained jet profile was compared with the experimental data from previous publications. Finally, the proposed algorithm was used to simulate viscoelastic electrified jets, where the effect of the Weissenberg number (Wi) on the jet profile was examined. In agreement with the previously obtained experimental results, by increasing the solution concentration, the asymptotic profile of the jet is reached at a smaller length from the nozzle, while the final thickness of the jet is slightly reduced.</description>

      <title>An unstructured finite-volume level set / front tracking method for two-phase flows with large density-ratios</title>

Abstract: We extend the unstructured LEvel set / froNT tracking (LENT) method for handling two-phase flows with strongly different densities (high-density ratios) by providing the theoretical basis for the numerical consistency between the mass and momentum conservation in the collocated Finite Volume discretization of the single-field two-phase Navier-Stokes equations. Our analysis provides the theoretical basis for the mass conservation equation introduced by Ghods and Herrmann [3] and used in [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. We use a mass flux that is consistent with mass conservation in the implicit Finite Volume discretization of the two-phase momentum convection term, and solve the single-field Navier-Stokes equations with our SAAMPLE segregated solution algorithm [2]. The proposed $\rho$LENT method recovers exact numerical stability for the two-phase momentum advection of a spherical droplet with density ratios ranging in $[1, 10^4]$. Numerical stability is demonstrated for in terms of the relative $L_\infty$ velocity error norm, for density-ratios in the range of $[1, 10^4]$, dynamic viscosity-ratios in the range of $[1, 10^4]$ and very strong surface tension forces, for challenging mercury/air and water/air fluid pairings. In addition, the solver performs well in cases characterized by strong interaction between two phases, i.e., oscillating droplets and rising bubbles. The proposed $\rho$LENT method is applicable to any other two-phase flow simulation method that discretizes the single-field two-phase Navier-Stokes Equations using the collocated unstructured Finite Volume Method but does not solve an advection equation for the phase indicator using a flux-based approach, by adding the proposed geometrical approximation of the mass flux and the auxiliary mass conservation equation to the solution algorithm.</description>

      <title>From Zero to Turbulence: Generative Modeling for 3D Flow Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulations of turbulent flows in 3D are one of the most expensive simulations in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Many works have been written on surrogate models to replace numerical solvers for fluid flows with faster, learned, autoregressive models. However, the intricacies of turbulence in three dimensions necessitate training these models with very small time steps, while generating realistic flow states requires either long roll-outs with many steps and significant error accumulation or starting from a known, realistic flow state - something we aimed to avoid in the first place. Instead, we propose to approach turbulent flow simulation as a generative task directly learning the manifold of all possible turbulent flow states without relying on any initial flow state. For our experiments, we introduce a challenging 3D turbulence dataset of high-resolution flows and detailed vortex structures caused by various objects and derive two novel sample evaluation metrics for turbulent flows. On this dataset, we show that our generative model captures the distribution of turbulent flows caused by unseen objects and generates high-quality, realistic samples amenable for downstream applications without access to any initial state.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation covariance-based study of roll-streak dynamics in Poiseuille flow turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the roll-streak (R-S) is fundamentally involved in the dynamics of wall-turbulence, the physical mechanism responsible for its formation and maintenance remains controversial. In this work we investigate the dynamics maintaining the R-S in turbulent Poiseuille flow at $R=1650$. Spanwise collocation is used to remove spanwise displacement of the streaks and associated flow components, which isolates the streamwise-mean flow R-S component and the second-order statistics of the streamwise-varying fluctuations that are collocated with the R-S. This streamwise-mean/fluctuation partition of the dynamics facilitates exploiting insights gained from the analytic characterization of turbulence in the second-order statistical state dynamics (SSD), referred to as S3T, and its closely associated restricted nonlinear dynamics (RNL) approximation. Symmetry of the statistics about the streak centerline permits separation of the fluctuations into sinuous and varicose components. The Reynolds stress forcing induced by the sinuous and varicose fluctuations acting on the R-S is shown to reinforce low- and high-speed streaks respectively. This targeted reinforcement of streaks by the Reynolds stresses occurs continuously as the fluctuation field is strained by the streamwise-mean streak and not intermittently as would be associated with streak-breakdown events. The Reynolds stresses maintaining the streamwise-mean roll arise primarily from the dominant POD modes of the fluctuations, which can be identified with the time average structure of optimal perturbations growing on the streak. These results are consistent with a universal process of R-S growth and maintenance in turbulent shear flow arising from torques generated by straining turbulent fluctuations, which was identified using the S3T SSD.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing tracer transport in convective penetration of a stably stratified layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use large-eddy simulations to study the penetration of a buoyant plume carrying a passive tracer into a stably stratified layer with constant buoyancy frequency. Using a buoyancy-tracer volume distribution, we develop a method for objectively partitioning buoyancy-tracer space into three regions, each of which corresponds to a coherent region in physical space. Specifically, we identify a source region where undiluted plume fluid enters the stratified layer, a transport region where much of the transition from undiluted to mixed fluid occurs in the plume cap, and an accumulation region corresponding to the radially spreading intrusion. This method enables quantification of different measures of turbulence and mixing within each of the three regions, including potential energy and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates, an activity parameter, and the instantaneous mixing efficiency. We find that the most intense buoyancy gradients lie in a thin layer at the cap of the penetrating plume. This forms the primary stage of mixing between plume and environment and exhibits a mixing efficiency around 50%. Newly generated mixtures of environmental and plume fluid joining the intrusion are subjected to relatively weak turbulence and weaker buoyancy gradients as mixtures are homogenised. As the intrusion spreads radially, environmental fluid surrounding the intrusion is mixed into the intrusion with moderate mixing efficiency. This dominates the total entrainment of environmental fluid into the plume as a whole. However, the 'strongest' entrainment, as measured by the specific entrainment rate, is largest in the plume cap where the most buoyant environmental fluid is entrained.</description>

      <title>CoNFiLD: Conditional Neural Field Latent Diffusion Model Generating Spatiotemporal Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces the Conditional Neural Field Latent Diffusion (CoNFiLD) model, a novel generative learning framework designed for rapid simulation of intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in chaotic and turbulent systems within three-dimensional irregular domains. Traditional eddy-resolved numerical simulations, despite offering detailed flow predictions, encounter significant limitations due to their extensive computational demands, restricting their applications in broader engineering contexts. In contrast, deep learning-based surrogate models promise efficient, data-driven solutions. However, their effectiveness is often compromised by a reliance on deterministic frameworks, which fall short in accurately capturing the chaotic and stochastic nature of turbulence. The CoNFiLD model addresses these challenges by synergistically integrating conditional neural field encoding with latent diffusion processes, enabling the memory-efficient and robust probabilistic generation of spatiotemporal turbulence under varied conditions. Leveraging Bayesian conditional sampling, the model can seamlessly adapt to a diverse range of turbulence generation scenarios without the necessity for retraining, covering applications from zero-shot full-field flow reconstruction using sparse sensor measurements to super-resolution generation and spatiotemporal flow data restoration. Comprehensive numerical experiments across a variety of inhomogeneous, anisotropic turbulent flows with irregular geometries have been conducted to evaluate the model's versatility and efficacy, showcasing its transformative potential in the domain of turbulence generation and the broader modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Energy-Conserving Neural Network for Turbulence Closure Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13770v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In turbulence modeling, we are concerned with finding closure models that represent the effect of the subgrid scales on the resolved scales. Recent approaches gravitate towards machine learning techniques to construct such models. However, the stability of machine-learned closure models and their abidance by physical structure (e.g. symmetries, conservation laws) are still open problems. To tackle both issues, we take the `discretize first, filter next' approach. In this approach we apply a spatial averaging filter to existing fine-grid discretizations. The main novelty is that we introduce an additional set of equations which dynamically model the energy of the subgrid scales. Having an estimate of the energy of the subgrid scales, we can use the concept of energy conservation to derive stability. The subgrid energy containing variables are determined via a data-driven technique. The closure model is used to model the interaction between the filtered quantities and the subgrid energy. Therefore the total energy should be conserved. Abiding by this conservation law yields guaranteed stability of the system. In this work, we propose a novel skew-symmetric convolutional neural network architecture that satisfies this law. The result is that stability is guaranteed, independent of the weights and biases of the network. Importantly, as our framework allows for energy exchange between resolved and subgrid scales it can model backscatter. To model dissipative systems (e.g. viscous flows), the framework is extended with a diffusive component. The introduced neural network architecture is constructed such that it also satisfies momentum conservation. We apply the new methodology to both the viscous Burgers' equation and the Korteweg-De Vries equation in 1D. The novel architecture displays superior stability properties when compared to a vanilla convolutional neural network.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann simulation of deformable fluid-filled bodies: progress and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of studies involving droplet microfluidics, drug delivery, cell detection, and microparticle synthesis, among others, many scientists have invested significant efforts to model the flow of these fluid-filled bodies. Motivated by the intricate coupling between hydrodynamics and the interactions of fluid-filled bodies, several methods have been developed. The objective of this review is to present a compact foundation of the methods used in the literature in the context of lattice Boltzmann methods. For hydrodynamics, we focus on the lattice-Boltzmann method due to its specific ability to treat time and spatial-dependent boundary conditions and to incorporate new physical models in a computationally efficient way. We split the existing methods into two groups with regard to the interfacial boundary: fluid-structure and fluid-fluid methods. The fluid-structure methods are characterised by the coupling between fluid dynamics and mechanics of the flowing body, often used in applications involving membranes and similar flexible solid boundaries. We further divide fluid-structure-based methods into two subcategories, those which treat the fluid-structure boundary as a continuum medium and those that treat it as a discrete collection of individual springs and particles. Next, we discuss the fluid-fluid methods, particularly useful for the simulations of fluid-fluid interfaces. We focus on models for immiscible droplets and their interaction in a suspending fluid and describe benchmark tests to validate the models for fluid-filled bodies.</description>
