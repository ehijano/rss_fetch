      <title>Generative design of stabilizing controllers with diffusion models: the Youla approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing controllers that simultaneously achieve strong performance and provable closed-loop stability remains a central challenge in control engineering. This work introduces a diffusion-based generative framework for linear controller synthesis grounded in the Youla-Kucera parameterization, enabling the construction of stabilizing controllers by design. The diffusion model learns a conditional mapping from plant dynamics and desired performance metrics to feasible Youla parameters, guaranteeing internal stability while flexibly accommodating user-specified targets. Trained on synthetically generated stable SISO plants with fixed-order Youla parameters, the proposed approach reliably synthesizes controllers that meet prescribed sensitivity and settling-time specifications on previously unseen systems. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first demonstration that diffusion models can generate stabilizing controllers, combining rigorous control-theoretic guarantees with the versatility of modern generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Run-to-Run Indirect Trajectory Tracking Control of Electromechanical Systems Based on Identifiable and Flat Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially flat models are frequently used to design feedforward controllers for electromechanical systems. However, control performance depends on model accuracy, which makes feedback imperative. This paper presents a control scheme for electromechanical systems in which measuring or estimating the output to be controlled -- typically the position -- is not feasible. It employs an identifiable-model-based controller and predictor, coupled with an iterative loop that updates model parameters using the error between a measurable output and its prediction. Simulations on electromechanical switching devices show effective tracking of the desired position trajectory using only coil current measurements.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Benchmark Platform for Process Control Research of Outdoor Microalgae Raceway Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a benchmarking framework to evaluate process control strategies in outdoor microalgae raceway reactors, integrating four key control regulation tasks: pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), culture volume through coordinated harvest-dilution actions, and temperature via a sump-mounted spiral heat exchanger. The benchmark is built upon a high-fidelity, experimentally calibrated dynamic model that captures the strongly coupled thermal, physicochemical, and biological processes governing industrial-scale open raceway ponds. A closed-loop simulation environment is provided, featuring realistic actuator constraints, gas transport delays, stiff integration, and a fully specified scenario based on multi-day outdoor disturbances (irradiance, temperature, wind, and humidity). Four user-replaceable controllers define the manipulation of CO2 injection, air bubbling, harvest/dilution sequencing, and heat-exchanger operation. The platform computes a unified global performance index, in addition to individual metrics for each control problem, combining tracking error, gas and energy usage, and biomass productivity, enabling consistent and quantitative comparison of alternative control strategies. Baseline regulatory architectures (On/Off, PI/PID, and Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC)) are included to illustrate the benchmark use for classical and advanced control methods. By providing an openly specified, reproducible, and computationally tractable benchmark with well-defined function interfaces, this work aims to bridge control methodology and outdoor algal bioprocess engineering, and to support the development of multivariable control strategies for disturbance-rich environmental systems.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-based Adaptive Transformer (LyAT) for Control of Stochastic Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Lyapunov-based Adaptive Transformer (LyAT) controller for stochastic nonlinear systems. While transformers have shown promise in various control applications due to sequential modeling through self-attention mechanisms, they have not been used within adaptive control architectures that provide stability guarantees. Existing transformer-based approaches for control rely on offline training with fixed weights, resulting in open-loop implementations that lack real-time adaptation capabilities and stability assurances. To address these limitations, a continuous LyAT controller is developed that adaptively estimates drift and diffusion uncertainties in stochastic dynamical systems without requiring offline pre-training. A key innovation is the analytically derived adaptation law constructed from a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, which enables real-time weight updates while guaranteeing probabilistic uniform ultimate boundedness of tracking and parameter estimation errors. Experimental validation on a quadrotor demonstrates the performance of the developed controller.</description>

      <title>Synchronization, Identification, and Signal Detection for Underwater Photon-Counting Communications With Input-Dependent Shot Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon counting (PhC) is an effective detection technology for underwater optical wireless communication (OWC) systems. The presence of signal-dependent Poisson shot noise and asynchronous multi-user interference (MUI) complicates the processing of received data signals, hindering the effective signal detection of PhC OWC systems. This paper proposes a novel iterative signal detection method in grant-free, multi-user, underwater PhC OWC systems with signal-dependent Poisson shot noise. We first introduce a new synchronization algorithm with a unique frame structure design.The algorithm performs active user identification and transmission delay estimation. Specifically, the estimation is performed first on a user group basis and then at the individual user level with reduced complexity and latency.We also develop a nonlinear iterative multi-user detection (MUD) algorithm that utilizes a detection window for each user to identify interfering symbols and estimate MUI on a slot-by-slot basis, followed by maximum \textit{a-posteriori} probability detection of user signals.Simulations demonstrate that our scheme achieves bit error rates comparable to scenarios with transmission delays known and signal detection perfectly synchronized.</description>

      <title>Consensus tracking of perturbed open multi-agent systems with repelling antagonistic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open multi-agent system (OMAS) comprises migrating agents which produce a flexible network structure that is naturally switching and size-varying. Meanwhile, agent migrations also make an OMAS more prone to environmental adversities. In this work, we deal with the consensus tracking problem of OMASs suffering these migration-induced adversities, including non-vanishing perturbations in the agent dynamics/state and the repelling antagonistic interactions among agents, over an intermittently disconnected signed digraph. The OMAS is interpreted into a perturbed $M^3D$ system in which unstable subsystems are created when repelling interactions dominate the normal cooperative ones in the OMAS network regardless of its connectivity. To handle the destabilizing effects brought by the repelling interaction as well as the non-vanishing perturbations, we extend the stability theory for $M^3D$ systems and apply it to the OMAS to show that practical consensus tracking can be achieved if the migration-induced switching satisfies the piecewise average dwell time and activation time ratio constraints. Particularly, we indicate that for vanishing perturbations and repelling interactions, asymptotic tracking can be expected under weaker switching constraints.</description>

      <title>Black-Start Power Capacity Sizing and Control Strategy for an Islanded DFIG Wind-to-Hydrogen System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a black-start method for an off-grid wind-to-hydrogen (W2H) system comprising a wind farm based on Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs), proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) serving as the black-start power source, and a hydrogen production industry. The PEMFC is installed within the hydrogen industry to facilitate direct access to hydrogen fuel. Based on the microgrid topology and black-start scheme, this study innovatively sizes the rated capacity of the PEMFC through power flow analysis. The capacity must be sufficient to charge passive components such as transmission lines and transformers, provide rotor excitation, and supply wind turbine (WT) and electrolyzer (ELZ) auxiliaries during startup. The proposed system integrates wind-hydrogen coordinated control (WHCC) and hydrogen-storage coordinated control (HSCC). Under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the WTs, the ELZ follows power fluctuations to absorb wind output, ensuring stable voltage and frequency. Fixed-frequency control applied to either the DFIG or PEMFC converters enables DFIGs to retain conventional grid-following (GFL) operation, reducing converter development costs. For both control modes, this paper establishes the black-start sequence and formulates a comprehensive coordinated control strategy for the entire system. The entire control system is validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. Results confirm that the calculated PEMFC capacity supports reliable black-start, while the black-start control strategy ensures smooth system self-startup. Furthermore, the coordinated control strategy maintains stable frequency and voltage under fluctuating wind power, demonstrating the practicality and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Closed Loop Reference Optimization for Extrusion Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various defects occur during material extrusion additive manufacturing processes that degrade the quality of the 3D printed parts and lead to significant material waste. This motivates feedback control of the extrusion process to mitigate defects and prevent print failure. We propose a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for closed-loop control with force feedback to provide accurate width tracking of the extruded filament. Furthermore, we propose preemptive optimization of the reference force given to the LQR that accounts for the performance of the LQR and generates the optimal reference for the closed loop extrusion dynamics and machine constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the improved tracking performance and response time. Experiments on a Fused Filament Fabrication 3D printer showcase a root mean square error improvement of 39.57% compared to tracking the unmodified reference as well as an 83.7% shorter settling time.</description>

      <title>Using Seminorms To Analyze Contraction of Switched Systems With Only Non-Contracting Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates contraction properties of switched dynamical systems for the case that all modes are non-contracting, thereby extending existing results that require at least one mode to be contracting. Leveraging the property that unstable systems may still exhibit stable behavior within certain subspaces, conditions are provided which ensure contracting evolution within a given subspace of the state space of the switched system. These conditions are derived using the concepts of seminorms and semi-contracting systems. Then, by selecting a set of subspaces whose corresponding seminorms form a separating family of the state space, and by verifying whether a given mode is contracting in each subspace, conditions on the activation time of each mode are provided by which contraction on the complete state space is guaranteed. Numerical examples are presented for illustration.</description>

      <title>Contraction Analysis of Filippov Solutions in Multi-Modal Piecewise Smooth Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides conditions to ensure contractive behavior of Filippov solutions generated by multi-modal piecewise smooth (PWS) systems. These conditions are instrumental in analyzing the asymptotic behavior of PWS systems, such as convergence towards an equilibrium point or a limit cycle. The work is motivated by a known principle for contraction analysis of bimodal PWS systems which ensures that the flow dynamics of each mode and the sliding dynamics on the switching manifold are contracting. This approach is extended first to PWS systems with multiple non-intersecting switching manifolds in Rn, and then to two intersecting switching manifolds in R2. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings, along with a discussion on extensions to more general intersecting switching manifolds in Rn.</description>

      <title>Optimal chiller loading including transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scheduling and loading of chillers in a multi-chiller plant is considered. A new framework is introduced considering an extended set of independent variables for the optimization problem of energy consumption. In this way the number of decision variables is increased, providing extra degrees of freedom to optimize cooling plant operation. The dynamic effects due to transients arising from switching on and off of units are usually not considered in the literature dealing with Optimal Chiller Loading/Sequencing which is restricted to the static case. In this paper, these effects are treated in a way that results in a manageable optimization problem. A Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation solution is deployed for the problem and the proposed method is compared with a similar but static approach showing the benefits in terms of reduced energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Economic versus energetic model predictive control of a cold production plant with thermal energy storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic model predictive control has been proposed as a means for solving the unit loading and unit allocation problem in multi-chiller cooling plants. The adjective economic stems from the use of financial cost due to electricity consumption in a time horizon, such is the loss function minimized at each sampling period. The energetic approach is rarely encountered. This article presents for the first time a comparison between the energetic optimization objective and the economic one. The comparison is made on a cooling plant using air-cooled water chillers and a cold storage system. Models developed have been integrated into Simscape, and non-convex mixed optimization methods used to achieve optimal control trajectories for both energetic and economic goals considered separately. The results over several scenarios, and in different seasons, support the consideration of the energetic approach despite the current prevalence of the economic one. The results are dependent on the electric season and the available tariffs. In particular, for the high electric season and considering a representative tariff, the results show that an increment of about 2.15% in energy consumption takes place when using the economic approach instead of the energetic one. On the other hand, a reduction in cost of 2.94% is achieved.</description>

      <title>From Liability to Asset: A Three-Mode Grid-Forming Control Framework for Centralized Data Center UPS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI workloads are turning large data centers into highly dynamic power-electronic loads; fault-time behavior and workload pulsing can stress weak-grid points of interconnection. This paper proposes a centralized medium-voltage (MV) uninterruptible power supply (UPS) control architecture implemented as three operating modes: Mode 1 regulates a DC stiff bus and shapes normal-operation grid draw, Mode 2 enforces current-limited fault-mode P--Q priority with UPS battery energy storage system (UPS-BESS) buffering and a rate-limited post-fault "soft return," and Mode 3 optionally provides droop-based fast frequency response via grid-draw modulation. Fundamental-frequency averaged dq simulations (50 MW block, short-circuit ratio (SCR) = 1.5, 0.5 p.u. three-phase dip for 150~ms) show zero unserved information-technology (IT) energy (0.00000 MWh vs.0.00208 MWh for a momentary-cessation benchmark), a 0.57 p.u. peak inverter current (vs. 1.02 p.u. for a synchronous-reference-frame phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL) low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) baseline), a nonzero mean fault-window grid draw of 0.20~p.u. (vs.approx 0 for momentary cessation), and an improved settled point-of-common-coupling (PCC) voltage minimum of 0.79 p.u. after one cycle (vs. 0.66 p.u.). A forced-oscillation case study applies a 1 Hz pulsed load (+/- 0.25 p.u.) and shows that the normal-operation shaping filters the oscillation seen by the grid while the UPS-BESS buffers the pulsing component.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Approximate Model Predictive Control for an Impact Wrench Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based model predictive control has emerged as a powerful approach for handling complex dynamics in mechatronic systems, enabling data-driven performance improvements while respecting safety constraints. However, when computational resources are severely limited, as in battery-powered tools with embedded processors, existing approaches struggle to meet real-time requirements. In this paper, we address the problem of real-time torque control for impact wrenches, where high-frequency control updates are necessary to accurately track the fast transients occurring during periodic impact events, while maintaining high-performance safety-critical control that mitigates harmful vibrations and component wear. The key novelty of the approach is that we combine data-driven model augmentation through Gaussian process regression with neural network approximation of the resulting control policy. This insight allows us to deploy predictive control on resource-constrained embedded platforms while maintaining both constraint satisfaction and microsecond-level inference times. The proposed framework is evaluated through numerical simulations and hardware experiments on a custom impact wrench testbed. The results show that our approach successfully achieves real-time control suitable for high-frequency operation while maintaining constraint satisfaction and improving tracking accuracy compared to baseline PID control.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the differentially private consensus problem for general linear multi-agent systems (MASs) based on output feedback protocols. To protect the output information, which is considered private data and may be at high risk of exposure, Laplace noise is added to the information exchange. The conditions for achieving mean square and almost sure consensus in observer-based MASs are established using the backstepping method and the convergence theory for nonnegative almost supermartingales. It is shown that the separation principle remains valid for the consensus problem of linear MASs with decaying Laplace noise. Furthermore, the convergence rate is provided. Then, a joint design framework is developed for state estimation gain, feedback control gain, and noise to ensure the preservation of \epsilon-differential privacy. The output information of each agent is shown to be protected at every time step. Finally, sufficient conditions are established for simultaneously achieving consensus and preserving differential privacy for linear MASs utilizing both full-order and reduced-order observers. Meanwhile, an \epsilon*-differentially private consensus is achieved to meet the desired privacy level. Two simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>DiscoverDCP: A Data-Driven Approach for Construction of Disciplined Convex Programs via Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose DiscoverDCP, a data-driven framework that integrates symbolic regression with the rule sets of Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) to perform system identification. By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>A Context-Free Smart Grid Model Using Complex System Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy and pollution are urging problems of the 21th century. By gradually changing the actual power grid system, smart grid may evolve into different systems by means of size, elements and strategies, but its fundamental requirements and objectives will not change such as optimizing production, transmission, and consumption. Studying the smart grid through modeling and simulation provides us with valuable results which cannot be obtained in real world due to time and cost related constraints. Moreover, due to the complexity of the smart grid, achieving global optimization is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a complex system based approach to the smart grid modeling, accentuating on the optimization by combining game theoretical and classical methods in different levels. Thanks to this combination, the optimization can be achieved with flexibility and scalability, while keeping its generality.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Optimal Control for Colloidal Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise control of colloidal self-assembly into specific patterns remains a longstanding challenge due to the complex process dynamics. Recently, machine learning-based state representation and reinforcement learning-based control strategies have started to accumulate popularity in the field, showing great potential in achieving an automatable and generalizable approach to producing patterned colloidal assembly. In this work, we adopted a machine learning-based optimal control framework, combining unsupervised learning and graph convolutional neural work for state observation with deep reinforcement learning-based optimal control policy calculation, to provide a data-driven control approach that can potentially be generalized to other many-body self-assembly systems. With Brownian dynamics simulations, we demonstrated its superior performance as compared to traditional order parameter-based state description, and its efficacy in obtaining ordered 2-dimensional spherical colloidal self-assembly in an electric field-mediated system with an actual success rate of 97%.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the problem of coordinating multiple robots to build 3-D structures. This problem consists of a set of mobile robots that interact with each other in order to autonomously build a predefined 3-D structure. Our approach is based on Supervisory Control Theory, and it allows us to synthesize from models that represent a single robot and the target structure a correct-by-construction reactive controller, called supervisor. When this supervisor is replicated for the other robots, then the target structure can be completed by all robots</description>

      <title>Resilience of coupled systems under deep uncertainty and dynamic complexity: An integrative literature review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resilience in coupled systems is increasingly critical in addressing global challenges such as climate change and pandemics. These systems show unpredictable behaviour due to dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty across spatiotemporal scales. Despite growing interest, few studies systematically integrate both concepts when assessing resilience. This paper conducts an integrative review of 102 English-language publications to identify gaps in current approaches. Findings reveal that most papers address lower levels of uncertainty and rarely consider dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty simultaneously, which limits the effectiveness of resilience strategies. To advance systems research, we propose a conceptual framework and practical tools to support researchers and decision-makers in evaluating and improving resilience. The paper also outlines future research directions for more robust, adaptive, and integrative resilience assessments.</description>

      <title>Verifiable Natural Language to Linear Temporal Logic Translation: A Benchmark Dataset and Evaluation Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art natural-language (NL) to temporal-logic (TL) translation systems reveals near-perfect performance on existing benchmarks. However, current studies measure only the accuracy of the translation of NL logic into formal TL, ignoring a system's capacity to ground atomic propositions into new scenarios or environments. This is a critical feature, necessary for the verification of resulting formulas in a concrete state space. Consequently, most NL-to-TL translation frameworks propose their own bespoke dataset in which the correct grounding is known a-priori, inflating performance metrics and neglecting the need for extensible, domain-general systems. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic Benchmark ( VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark that measures verification and verifiability of automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of four unique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications and corresponding formal specifications in temporal logic. Moreover, the benchmark contains sample traces to validate the temporal logic expressions. While the benchmark directly supports end-to-end evaluation, we observe that many frameworks decompose the process into i) lifting, ii) grounding, iii) translation, and iv) verification. The benchmark provides ground truths after each of these steps to enable researches to improve and evaluate different substeps of the overall problem. To encourage methodologically sound advances in verifiable NL-to-LTL translation approaches, we release VLTL-Bench here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubascudes/vltl bench.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to improve the action smoothness of a cascaded online learning flight control system. Although the cascaded structure is widely used in flight control design, its stability can be compromised by oscillatory control actions, which poses challenges for practical engineering applications. To address this issue, we introduce an online temporal smoothness technique and a low-pass filter to reduce the amplitude and frequency of the control actions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze policy performance in the frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate the improvements achieved by the two proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Network Topology of a Linear Reservoir Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has become a fundamental approach for modeling, prediction, and control, enabling systems to learn from data and perform complex tasks. Reservoir computing is a machine learning tool that leverages high-dimensional dynamical systems to efficiently process temporal data for prediction and observation tasks. Traditionally, the connectivity of the network that underlies a reservoir computer (RC) is generated randomly, lacking a principled design. Here, we focus on optimizing the connectivity of a linear RC to improve its performance and interpretability, which we achieve by decoupling the RC dynamics into a number of independent modes. We then proceed to optimize each one of these modes to perform a given task, which corresponds to selecting an optimal RC connectivity in terms of a given set of eigenvalues of the RC adjacency matrix. Simulations on networks of varying sizes show that the optimized RC significantly outperforms randomly constructed reservoirs in both training and testing phases and often surpasses nonlinear reservoirs of comparable size. This approach provides both practical performance advantages and theoretical guidelines for designing efficient, task-specific, and analytically transparent RC architectures.</description>

      <title>Hill-Type Stability Analysis of Periodic Solutions of Fractional-Order Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores stability properties of periodic solutions of (nonlinear) fractional-order differential equations (FODEs). As classical Caputo-type FODEs do not admit exactly periodic solutions, we propose a framework of Liouville-Weyl-type FODEs, which do admit exactly periodic solutions and are an extension of Caputo-type FODEs. Local linearization around a periodic solution results in perturbation dynamics governed by a linear time-periodic differential equation. In the classical integer-order case, the perturbation dynamics is therefore described by Floquet theory, i.e. the exponential growth or decay of perturbations is expressed by Floquet exponents which can be assessed using the Hill matrix approach. For fractional-order systems, however, a rigorous Floquet theory is lacking. Here, we explore the limitations when trying to extend Floquet theory and the Hill matrix method to linear time-periodic fractional-order differential equations (LTP-FODEs) as local linearization of nonlinear fractional-order systems. A key result of the paper is that such an extended Floquet theory can only assess exponentially growing solutions of LTP-FODEs. Moreover, we provide an analysis of linear time-invariant fractional-order systems (LTI-FODEs) with algebraically decaying solutions and show that the inaccessibility of decaying solutions through Floquet theory is already present in the time-invariant case.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the internal and boundary stabilization of the Cahn-Hilliard and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations under saturated feedback control. We conduct our study through the spectral analysis of the associated linear operator. We identify a finite number of eigenvalues related to the unstable part of the system and then design a stabilization strategy based on modal decomposition, linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and geometric conditions on the saturation function. Local exponential stabilization in $H^{2}$ is established.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we propose an iterative joint detection algorithm of Kalman filter (KF) and channel decoder for the sensor-to-controller link of wireless networked control systems, which utilizes the prior information of control system to improve control and communication performance. In this algorithm, we first use the KF to estimate the probability density of the control system outputs and calculate the prior probability of received signals to assist decoder. Then, the possible outputs of the control system are traversed to update the prior probability in order to implement iterative detection. The simulation results show that the prior information and the iterative structure can reduce the block error rate performance of communications while improving the root mean square error performance of controls.</description>

      <title>Hull Clustering with Blended Representative Periods for Energy System Optimization Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources into power systems requires planning models to account for not only demand variability but also fluctuations in renewable availability during operational periods. Capturing this temporal detail over long planning horizons can be computationally demanding or even intractable. A common approach to address this challenge is to approximate the problem using a reduced set of selected time periods, known as representative periods (RPs). However, using too few RPs can significantly degrade solution quality. In this paper, we propose the method of hull clustering with blended RPs to enhance traditional clustering-based RP approaches in two key ways. First, instead of selecting typical cluster centers (e.g., centroids or medoids) as RPs, our method is based on extreme points, which are more likely to be constraint-binding. Second, it represents base periods as weighted combinations of RPs (e.g., convex or conic blends), approximating the full time horizon more accurately and with fewer RPs. Through two case studies based on data from the European network operators, we demonstrate that hull clustering with blended RPs outperforms traditional RP techniques in both regret and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Historical Information Accelerates Decentralized Optimization: A Proximal Bundle Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Historical information, such as past function values or gradients, has significant potential to enhance decentralized optimization methods for two key reasons: first, it provides richer information about the objective function, which also explains its established success in centralized optimization; second, unlike the second-order derivative or its alternatives, historical information has already been computed or communicated and requires no additional cost to acquire. Despite this potential, it remains underexploited. In this work, we employ a proximal bundle framework to incorporate the function values and gradients at historical iterates and adapt the framework to the proximal decentralized gradient descent method, resulting in a Decentralized Proximal Bundle Method (DPBM). To broaden its applicability, we further extend DPBM to the asynchronous and stochastic setting. We theoretically analysed the convergence of the proposed methods. Notably, both the asynchronous DPBM and its stochastic variant can converge with fixed step-sizes that are independent of delays, which is superior to the delay-dependent step-sizes required by most existing asynchronous optimization methods, as it is easier to determine and often leads to faster convergence. Numerical experiments on classification problems demonstrate that by using historical information, our methods yield faster convergence and stronger robustness in the step-sizes.</description>
