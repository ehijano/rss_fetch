      <title>Playing with Fire? A Mean Field Game Analysis of Fire Sales and Systemic Risk under Regulatory Capital Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of regulatory capital constraints on fire sales and financial stability in a large banking system using a mean field game model. In our model banks adjust their holdings of a risky asset via trading strategies with finite trading rate in order to maximize expected profits. Moreover, a bank is liquidated if it violates a stylized regulatory capital constraint. We assume that the drift of the asset value is affected by the average change in the position of the banks in the system. This creates strategic interaction between the trading behavior of banks and thus leads to a game. The equilibria of this game are characterized by a system of coupled PDEs. We solve this system explicitly for a test case without regulatory constraints and numerically for the regulated case. We find that capital constraints can lead to a systemic crisis where a substantial proportion of the banking system defaults simultaneously. Moreover, we discuss proposals from the literature on macroprudential regulation. In particular, we show that in our setup a systemic crisis does not arise if the banking system is sufficiently well capitalized or if improved mechanisms for the resolution of banks violating the risk capital constraints are in place.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sparse Mean-Reverting Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-reverting behavior of individuals assets is widely known in financial markets. In fact, we can construct a portfolio that has mean-reverting behavior and use it in trading strategies to extract profits. In this paper, we show that we are able to find the optimal weights of stocks to construct portfolio that has the fastest mean-reverting behavior. We further add minimum variance and sparsity constraints to the optimization problem and transform into Semidefinite Programming (SDP) problem to find the optimal weights. Using the optimal weights, we empirically compare the performance of contrarian strategies between non-sparse mean-reverting portfolio and sparse mean-reverting portfolio to argue that the latter provides higher returns when we take into account of transaction costs.</description>

      <title>Time-Consistent Asset Allocation for Risk Measures in a L\'evy Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09471v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focusing on gains &amp; losses relative to a risk-free benchmark instead of terminal wealth, we consider an asset allocation problem to maximize time-consistently a mean-risk reward function with a general risk measure which is i) law-invariant, ii) cash- or shift-invariant, and iii) positively homogeneous, and possibly plugged into a general function. Examples include (relative) Value at Risk, coherent risk measures, variance, and generalized deviation risk measures. We model the market via a generalized version of the multi-dimensional Black-Scholes model using $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes and give supplementary results for the classical Black-Scholes model. The optimal solution to this problem is a Nash subgame equilibrium given by the solution of an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Moreover, we show that the optimal solution is deterministic under appropriate assumptions.</description>
