      <title>A Relativistic MOND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a minimal relativistic completion of MOND in which (i) General Relativity is recovered exactly in the high-acceleration regime, while (ii) the Bekenstein--Milgrom (AQUAL) equation emerges in the low-acceleration regime, without introducing additional propagating fields beyond those already present in a right-handed gauge sector. The construction is motivated by an $E_6\times E_6$ framework in which $SU(3)_R\rightarrow SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{Y'}\rightarrow U(1)_{\rm dem}$, leaving a healthy repulsive $U(1)_{\rm dem}$ interaction whose charge is the square-root mass label. Gravity itself arises from the $SU(2)_R$ connection via a Plebanski/MacDowell--Mansouri mechanism, yielding an emergent tetrad and the Einstein--Hilbert action. MOND is implemented by an infrared (IR) metric deformation $\Delta S_{\rm IR}[g]$ that is UV-vanishing (so GR is recovered) while its deep-MOND/static limit is fixed by a symmetry principle: in three spatial dimensions, the deep-MOND action is conformally invariant with a 10-parameter group isomorphic to $SO(4,1)$ (the de Sitter group). The single MOND acceleration scale is set by a de Sitter radius selected dynamically in the IR, $a_0=c^2/(\xi\,\ell_{\rm dS})$ with $\xi={ O}(1)$ fixed by matching to the static limit. MOND resides in perturbations and quasistatic systems; the homogeneous FRW background is controlled by the IR vacuum kinematics rather than an ad hoc cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Could black hole thermodynamics play a role in black hole mergers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers yield values for both the black hole remnant mass $M$ and it's spin $a$, with the $169$ $a$ values collected so far crowding significantly around their average $\bar{a}=0.6869\pm 0.087$. Could this crowding relate directly to the Davies phase transition point at $a=0.68125$ from black hole thermodynamics? I argue that a necessary challenge for such a connection requires a consistent application of the thermodynamic fluctuation theory that follows from black hole thermodynamics (BHT). Specifically, necessary are a correct choice of fluctuating variables, as well as thermal equilibrium between the event horizon at the Hawking temperature $\sim \mu K$ and the outside universe $\sim 3 K$. I show that the former requirement follows in straightforward fashion from the BHT of the Kerr model, while the later requires an accretion disk following the Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model. I construct a thermodynamic fluctuation theory meeting both these requirements. My results open the possibility that black hole mergers are based on some dynamical model (not known to me) with a limiting attractor state at the Davies point.</description>

      <title>Future Rip Scenarios in Fractional Holographic Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the occurrence of late-time cosmological singularities, namely, the rip scenarios within the framework of interacting Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE). We start our investigation with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff, i.e., $L=(\gamma H^{2}+\delta\dot{H})^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, and highlight the range of allowed $\alpha$ (L\'evy's index) values for which big, little and pseudo rip can occur. In particular, we highlight the occurrence of a big rip for fractional values of the L\'evy's index in the allowed range $1&lt;\alpha\leq2$. Moreover, we conclude that the occurrence of a pseudo-rip requires L\'evy's index to be $\alpha&gt;2$. Therefore, we reject the possibility of pseudo-rip within the GO cutoff. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the occurrence of the little rip in FHDE equipped with a GO cutoff is rather contrived and requires a specific functional form of the IR cutoff $L\sim(\gamma H^{2}+g(H))^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, which belongs to a larger class of Nojiri-Odintsov (NO) cutoffs. To extend our perspective beyond the GO cutoff, we investigate the interacting FHDE framework equipped with the Hubble cutoff, i.e., $L=H^{-1}$, in developing an ansatz-based approach to the little and pseudo-rip singularities as they fail to appear in the GO cutoff. Within this approach, we invoke the expression of the Hubble parameter, $H(t)$, which corresponds to the little and pseudo-rip, into the cosmological parameters such as the Equation of State (EoS) and Squared Sound Speed (SSS) as a function of cosmic time $t$. We produce numerical plots of these parameters in both linear and non-linear $Q$ regimes, which supplement our theoretical findings. In summary, our results highlight the occurrence of little and pseudo-rip singularities within a Hubble cutoff for a non-linear $Q$ term within the FHDE framework.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Homogeneous Thermodynamics and Microscopic Structure of the Quantum-Corrected FLRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of phase transitions in cosmological spacetimes shows that their existence requires a time-dependent apparent horizon radius, which in turn implies an equation of state different from that of a dark energy fluid. This condition is not compatible with the simultaneous fulfillment of Hayward's unified gravitational first law and the fundamental thermodynamic equation of the apparent horizon. To solve this problem, we introduce an alternative formulation in which the cosmological horizon is modeled as a quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic system. We apply this approach to the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe under quantum gravity corrections encoded by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), promote the deformation parameter to a thermodynamic variable, and obtain a consistent thermodynamic description without relying on the usual pressure-volume interpretation. Using Geometrothermodynamics (GTD), we show that fluctuations of the GUP parameter can induce phase transitions closely resembling those of black hole configurations. Finally, we perform a numerical analysis of the behavior of the GTD scalar curvature near the phase transition point, where we find a scaling behavior characterized by the critical exponent close to 1, independently of the dimension of the equilibrium space. This reveals that quantum gravity corrections not only modify the thermodynamic consistency of cosmological models but also strengthen the notion of thermodynamic universality across gravitational systems. Our findings confirm GTD as a powerful geometric tool to unveil the emergent thermodynamic microstructure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Dynamics and Perturbations in Fractal Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inflationary dynamics within the framework of fractal cosmology, where spacetime exhibits a non-integer effective dimension, sourced through a relaxation of the cosmological principle. Using Friedmann and continuity equations, modified by an effective fractal dimension $D$; we derive generalized slow-roll parameters and examine their evolution for cubic, Starobinsky and Natural inflationary potentials. We then formulate a fractal extension of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation by introducing an effective momentum term $k_{\text{eff}}$, arising from the fractal decomposition of the spatial Laplacian, that captures the geometric influence of fractal cosmology on scalar perturbations. This leads to corrections in the power spectrum and a scalar spectral index $n_s$ that depends explicitly on both the fractal dimension $D$ and a fractional scale $L$, which controls the strength of the fractal deformation. Comparison with the Planck 2018 data ($n_s=0.9649\pm 0.0042$) constrains the allowed range of $D$ ($2.7\lesssim D\lesssim3$) depending on the cosmological and inflationary model assumed.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system approach to the spectral (in)stability of black holes under localised potential perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to improve understanding of the resonant spectra of black holes under perturbations arising from e.g. compact objects or accretion disks in their vicinity. It is known that adding a weak perturbation to the radial potential can strongly disrupt the spectrum of quasinormal modes and Regge poles of a black hole spacetime. Here we examine the effect of (weak or strong) localised delta-function perturbations on the resonant spectra of spherically-symmetric systems, to address fundamental questions around linear and non-linear spectral stability. We examine two cases: the Nariai spacetime with a Poschl-Teller potential and the Schwarzschild spacetime. We show that, in either case, the spectrum deforms in a smooth and continuous manner as the position and strength of the perturbation is varied. As the strength of the perturbation is increased, resonances migrate along trajectories in the complex plane which ultimately tend towards attracting points determined by a hard-wall scenario. However, for weak perturbations the trajectory near the unperturbed resonance is typically strongly influenced by a set of repelling points which, for perturbations far from the system, lie very close to the unperturbed resonances; hence there arises a non-linear instability (i.e. the failure of a linearised approximation). Taking a dynamical systems perspective, the sets of attracting and repelling spectral points follow their own trajectories as the position of the perturbation is varied, and these are tracked and understood.</description>

      <title>Fermi Acceleration Mechanisms Beyond Lorentz Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct models for first- and second-order Fermi acceleration of particles, incorporating generic frame transformations, dispersion relations, and conservation laws. Within this framework, we study deformations of Lorentz symmetry via the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra in the bicrossproduct and classical bases, which respectively deform and preserve the relativistic dispersion relation. We also examine explicit Lorentz symmetry violation and compare the results with deformed relativity and special relativity.</description>

      <title>Shadow of F(R)-EH Black Hole and Constraints from EHT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the optical properties of a static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black hole in f(R) gravity coupled to Euler-Heisenberg(EH) nonlinear electrodynamics(NLED). By analyzing photon trajectories in this background spacetime, we show how the model parameters affect light propagation, leading to wider ranges of lensed trajectories and photon rings. We identify regions of parameter space that admit physically consistent black hole shadows, characterized by the existence of a photon sphere located outside the event horizon and a shadow formed beyond it. These viable regions expand with increasing electric charge and increasing fR0, illustrating the interplay between gravitational and electromagnetic effects. By constraining the model using Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*, we find that de Sitter black hole solutions remain compatible with the observational data, whereas anti-de Sitter solutions are disfavored for low electric charge and fR0 &gt; -1. Finally, an analysis of the energy emission rate shows that higher electric charge enhances black hole evaporation, while stronger nonlinear electrodynamics effects and larger values of fR0 suppress it.</description>

      <title>Quantum fields in boson star spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson stars have been extensively studied in classical gravity, but their quantum properties remain comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we compute the quantum scalar fields and stress tensor in boson star spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity. Divergences are regularized using Pauli-Villars fields, and accurate numerical results are obtained through spectral methods. Employing coherent states enables a direct comparison between the classical part of the stress tensor and the quantum fluctuation. Our results indicate that strong spacetime curvature is the primary source of large quantum effects. The renormalized quantum energy density is mostly positive but the radial pressure is negative, suggesting that classical boson star solutions require modification once quantum effects are included. Moreover, in regimes of large curvature, the quantum fluctuations can constitute a significant fraction of the total stress tensor. The methods developed here can be generalized to other compact objects and used to study their response to quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Superluminal modes in a quantum field simulator for cosmology from analog Transplanckian physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum-field-theoretic description for the U(1)-Goldstone boson of a scalar Bose-Einstein condensate with time-dependent contact interactions is developed beyond the acoustic approximation in accordance with Bogoliubov theory. The resulting effective action is mapped to a relativistic quantum field theory on a dispersive (or rainbow) cosmological spacetime which has a superluminal Corley-Jacobson dispersion relation. Time-dependent changes of the s-wave scattering length to quantum-simulate cosmological particle production are accompanied by a time-dependent healing length that can be interpreted as an analog Planck length in the comoving frame. Non-adiabatic transitions acquire a dispersive character, which is thoroughly discussed. The framework is applied to exponentially expanding or power-law contracting $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetimes which are known to produce scale-invariant cosmological power spectra. The sensitivity of these scenarios to the time-dependence of the Bogoliubov dispersion is investigated: We find a violation of scale-invariance via analytically trackable Transplanckian damping effects if the cut-off scale is not well separated from the horizon-crossing scale. In case of the exponential expansion, these damping effects remarkably settle and converge to another scale-invariant plateau in the far ultraviolet regime where non-adiabatic transitions are suppressed by the high dispersion. The developed framework enables quantitative access to more drastic analog cosmological scenarios with improved predictability in the ultraviolet regime that ultimately may lead to the observation of a scale-invariant cosmological power spectrum in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>A new code for computing differentially rotating neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new initial data codes for constructing stationary, axisymmetric equilibrium models of differentially rotating neutron stars in full general relativity within the Frankfurt University/KADATH (FUKA) suite of initial data codes. FUKA leverages the KADATH spectral library to solve the Einstein equations under the assumption of an isentropic fluid without magnetic fields while incorporating GRHayLEOS to support 3D tabulated equations of state in \textit{stellar collapse} format. The two solvers explored in this work include one using quasi-isotropic coordinates (QIC) in Spherical coordinates while the other solves the eXtended Conformal Thin Sandwich (XCTS) decomposition in Cartesian coordinates, enabling the construction of equilibrium configurations with high accuracy and efficiency. In this work we adopt the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu differential rotation law, however, the code is designed to be extensible to other rotation laws, allowing for exploration of physically relevant sequences and critical rotation thresholds. Furthermore, we perform convergence tests demonstrating the exponential accuracy of the spectral approach, we validate QIC and XCTS solutions against models well-studied in the literature, and we also compare FUKA solutions against the well-known RNS code. Finally, we explore the impact that initial data resolution has on dynamical simulations and recover the convergence order of the evolution scheme, the dominate source of error in this study. The new FUKA codes and results presented here lay the foundation for future extensions to more general configurations, including magnetic fields, removal of isentropic assumptions, and binary systems, and have been made publicly available to support community efforts in modeling differentially rotating relativistic stars.</description>

      <title>The End of the Road for Bulk Fields in Braneworlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we generalize Ref. [1] and derive a complete set of local consistency conditions for bulk fields in braneworld scenarios with an arbitrary number of dimensions. This provides the first fully local and dimension-independent generalization of all known criteria for bulk fields. Within this framework, we show that a free scalar field is consistent and localized, whereas minimally and non-minimally coupled Maxwell fields violate the conditions, leading to a no-go theorem valid in any dimension. For nonlinear electrodynamics, we find that only the model $L(F)=b\sqrt{F}$ admits a consistent and normalizable zero mode, and that among p-forms, consistency occurs solely for the free 0-form. We also demonstrate that Dirac fermions, with or without Yukawa terms, are inconsistent within this framework and therefore cannot propagate in the bulk. Our local approach makes explicit that these conclusions do not depend on any particular internal geometry or warp factor: previously known results arise merely as special cases of a broader and strictly local structure, highlighting the universality of the constraints derived here.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified quantum field theory of dark energy and inflation: unstable de Sitter vacuum and running vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflation is a necessary cosmic mechanism to cure basic inconsistencies of the standard model of cosmology. These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $\Lambda$). In the FLRW epoch, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $\Lambda\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(m_{\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help to cure the cosmological tensions.</description>

Abstract: Synergies between self-force theory and other approaches to the gravitational two-body problem have traditionally relied on calculations of gauge-invariant observables as functions of orbital frequencies. However, in self-force theory one can also define a complete set of constants of motion: energy, azimuthal angular momentum, and radial and polar actions. Here we outline how directly utilizing these constants allows for more straightforward comparisons and hybridizations across the parameter space, as well as more streamlined waveform generation through flux-balance laws. Restricting to the case of nonspinning binaries and first order in self-force, we compute the constants of motion and the corrections to fundamental frequencies numerically as well as analytically (to 9PN in a post-Newtonian expansion), establishing consistency with the highest-order (4PN) results available from post-Newtonian theory. We also apply the results to identify the perturbed locations of special curves in the parameter space: circular orbits and the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits.</description>

      <title>Gauging Open EFTs from the top down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17089v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present explicit top-down calculations of Open EFTs for gauged degrees of freedom with a focus on the effects of gauge fixing. Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and St\"uckelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase. The latter serves as an example of an open system for St\"uckelberg/Goldstone fields.</description>

      <title>Search for Precessing Binary Black Holes in Advanced LIGO's Third Observing Run using Harmonic Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) exhibiting spin-induced orbital precession offer unique insight into compact-binary formation channels, cosmology, and tests of general relativity. We conduct a dedicated search for precessing BBHs in Advanced LIGO's third observing run (O3) using the harmonic decomposition method of precessing waveforms. We introduce a novel scheme to reduce the number of filters in a harmonic search. With our new approach, our template bank requires $5\times$ fewer filters compared to another proposed precessing search in the same region. We do not find any new significant events. Our new search method achieves up to $\sim 28\%$ improvement in sensitivity and up to $5\times$ lower computational costs compared to existing precessing search pipelines. Our method enables scalable, sensitive searches for precessing BBHs in future gravitational-wave observing runs.</description>

      <title>Spectator Composes a Gravitational Canon: Spectator-field-triggered Phase Transition During Inflation and its Anisotropic Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework in which a phase transition is triggered during cosmic inflation by the slow-roll dynamics of a spectator field. The topological defects formed at the transition are inflated outside the horizon, reenter it after inflation, and can subsequently generate characteristic gravitational-wave (GW) signals. Quantum fluctuations of the spectator field modulate the timing of the transition, imprinting large-scale anisotropies in the resulting GW background. As an explicit realization, the spectator field may be identified with the Higgs field in a supersymmetric Standard Model. More generally, our framework applies to a wide class of spectator-modulated phenomena, providing a generic mechanism for producing anisotropic GW signals.</description>

      <title>Diluting the Dark Sector: A Common Origin for the PTA Signal and Inelastic SIDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) challenges conventional astrophysics by observed signal amplitude exceeds predictions from standard SMBHB populations without implausible accretion histories. To resolve this amplitude tension, we introduce the Radiative SIDM Dilution framework.We explain the observed spectrum emerges as a hybrid signal by an astrophysical floor, dynamically suppressed by the cored halos of Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM),and a dominant cosmological peak generated during a supercooled phase transition in the dark sector. By performing a free spectral reconstruction and Bayesian model comparison, we demonstrate that a transition defined by a nucleation temperature $T_* \approx 1.24$ MeV and inverse duration $\beta/H_* \approx 150$ not only fills the spectral gap left by stalled binaries but yields statistical evidence($\Delta \text{BIC} \approx 15$) over purely standard astrophysical interpretations. The thermodynamics required to reproduce this SGWB signature also resolves the thermal overproduction of resonant SIDM. The entropy injected by the transition naturally provides the specific dilution factor $D \approx 100$ needed to reset the dark matter relic density to observation. This mechanism also has broader cosmological consequences.The residual dark radiation alleviates the Hubble tension $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \sim 0.3$ while bubble collisions generate magnetohydrodynamic turbulence sufficient to seed primordial magnetic fields $B_0 \sim 10^{-13}$ G. These convergences suggest that the NANOGrav excess is not an anomaly, but the acoustic signature of the entropy injection event that rendered the dark sector cosmologically viable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct singly and doubly spinning non-supersymmetric F1--P black ring solutions in five-dimensional supergravity. These black rings have regular horizons and non-zero temperature. The singly spinning configuration lies in the duality orbit of the black ring constructed by Elvang, Emparan, and Figueras, while the doubly spinning configuration is a charged extension of the black ring constructed by Chen, Hong, and Teo. We analyze the physical properties of these solutions and the various limits they admit. In particular, the doubly spinning solution admits an extremal limit in which the entropy satisfies the relation S= 2 \pi J_\phi, thereby linking it directly to the angular momentum on the S^2.</description>

      <title>Index saddle for supersymmetric F1-P black ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the index saddle for the supersymmetric F1--P black ring. Our construction proceeds by taking a supersymmetric limit of a non-supersymmetric doubly spinning F1--P black ring. We express the resulting saddle as a three-center Bena--Warner solution. The black ring saddle possesses a finite-area event horizon, yet the two-derivative index vanishes. The solution is singular on certain subspaces of the horizon, where higher-derivative corrections are expected to become important. We argue that, once such corrections are taken into account, the solution can yield a finite result. In particular, we present a scaling analysis showing that the index agrees with the microscopic result, up to an overall numerical constant that cannot be fixed by the scaling argument alone. This analysis applies only within a restricted region of parameter space, whose full significance is not yet fully understood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the gravitational effects of a black hole manifest themselves as thermal behavior in the dual finite-temperature conformal field theory (CFT). In the holographic framework of AdS/CFT, we analyze a wave packet propagating into a black hole geometry in the bulk by computing three-point functions of a scalar primary operator in the boundary CFT. Our setup captures thermal signatures such as exponential damping of the expectation value, which are absent at zero-temperature. This provides a concrete and analytically tractable example of how black hole physics can be probed from the CFT side.</description>

      <title>Tidal encounters of close white dwarf binaries with spinning black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a stellar binary encounters a spinning black hole, interesting phenomena might result due to the mutual interaction between the binary spin, orbital angular momentum and the black hole spin. Here we consider such encounters between an intermediate mass spinning black hole and a close identical white dwarf binary system whose center of mass follows a parabolic trajectory. After studying a corresponding three-body problem in the point particle approximation, we perform a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics based numerical simulations of such scenarios. For this, we integrate the geodesic equations for the spinning black hole, while considering the hydrodynamics and the self and mutual gravitational interactions of the stars in a Newtonian approximation, an approach justified by the choice of parameters in the theory. We consider various initial configurations of the binary center of mass leading to equatorial and off-equatorial orbits, as also various initial inclinations between the binary's initial spin angular momentum and its initial orbital angular momentum. We find that the effects of black hole spin manifest clearly in the tidal dynamics of the binary components, while the observables of tidal encounters such as mass fallback rates are strongly dependent on the initial inclination angle. We show that the influence of the black hole spin emerges in distinct ways for different initial configurations of the binary's spin alignment. We establish that within the ambits of the Hills mechanism, in certain cases, the fallback rate may show a three-hump structure, due to interactions between tidal debris of the individual stars.</description>

      <title>The dual twistor theory of self-dual black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Taub-NUT and Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instantons, along with the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric, form a set of Euclidean metrics which can naturally be called `self-dual black holes', as they arise from self-dual slices of the most general vacuum, asymptotically flat black hole metric. These self-dual black holes are of interest for many reasons, and can famously be described through the non-linear graviton construction of twistor theory. However, the implicit nature of this twistor description obscures some features of the underlying geometry, particularly for the most general self-dual black holes. In this paper, we give a new construction of all asymptotically flat self-dual black holes based on holomorphic quadrics in flat dual twistor space, rather than the usual twistor space associated with self-duality. Remarkably, the geometry of the self-dual black holes -- including their hyperkahler structure, as well as Kerr-Schild and Gibbons-Hawking forms -- is directly encoded in the corresponding quadric. As a consequence, we obtain a previously unknown single Kerr-Schild form of the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric.</description>

      <title>The Initial Value Problem for the Generalised Einstein Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the initial value problem for the Einstein equations in Hitchin's generalised geometry for the case of closed divergence (which correspond to the equations of motion in the bosonic part of the NS-NS sector in type II ten-dimensional supergravity) and establish the existence of a maximal globally hyperbolic development (MGHD). The dynamical fields, defined on a manifold of dimension $n+1$, are the space-time metric, a scalar field known as the dilaton function, and a two-form known as the $B$-field. We develop a generalisation of the Lorenz gauge which, applied to the $B$-field (and combined with a suitable gauge condition breaking diffeomorphism invariance), renders the system a wave equation with principal symbol given by the (dynamical) metric. Given initial data, we construct a development satisfying the gauge conditions. We show that all other developments are (in the appropriate sense) related to this development by a diffeomorphism, establishing geometric uniqueness. The existence of the MGHD follows then by a famous result by Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch.
  In showing existence and geometric uniqueness of developments, we follow an approach developed in detail by Ringstr\"om for the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field. In a preliminary section, we present a formulation which is disentangled from the specific assumptions made on the matter, so that adaptation to other systems is straightforward.</description>

      <title>Jet launching from the Kerr black hole magnetosphere: An electrogeodesic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The launch of relativistic jets of plasma on astrophysical to cosmological scales are observed in a variety of astrophysical sources, from active galactic nuclei to X-rays binaries. While these jets can be reproduced by the general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) and particle-in-cells (GRPIC) simulations of the dynamical Kerr magnetosphere, the development of analytic models to describe the physics of the jets has remained limited. A key challenge is to analytically describe the individual trajectories of accelerated charged particles which ultimately build up the jet and emit radiation. In this work, we provide a first simple but fully analytical model of jet launching from the Kerr magnetosphere based on the motion of charged particles. To that end, we use the integrability of electrogeodesic motion in the Kerr monopole magnetosphere to study the ejection of charged particles near the poles. This enables us to derive (i) a criterion for the rotation axis to constitute a stable latitunal equilibrium position, thereby representing an idealized jet, (ii) the expression for the magnetic frame-dragging effect, and (iii) the condition for an asymptotic observer to measure blueshifted particles emanating from the black hole surroundings. Our study reveals that particles can be accelerated only in a specific region whose maximal radius depends on the spin and magnetization of the black hole. Alongside these results, we provide a detailed review of the construction of test magnetospheres from (explicit and hidden) symmetries of the Kerr geometry and the condition for the separability of the electrogeodesic motion in a test magnetosphere, which serves as a basis for the model we study in this work.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Primoridal Black Hole Abundance with Space-Based Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overdense regions can collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe, which are a compelling candidate for dark matter. Current constraints leave the asteroid-mass window the only possible one for PBH to account for all the dark matter, which can only be probed indirectly by the scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by the curvature perturbation which forms PBH. In this work, we explore the capabilities of future space-based gravitational wave detectors, including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, to constrain such induced GWs as well as the PBH abundance. We systematically account for the width of the primordial curvature power spectrum, and find that the asteroid-mass window can be fully probed by all three space-based interferometers. If PBHs constitute the majority of dark matter, the induced GW leaves a strong signal in the mHz band with a signal-to-noise ratio of $10^3\sim10^4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a general, void-based consistency test for Galileon scalar-tensor theories. We show that the previously reported unphysical breakdown of the predicted Newtonian force in certain Galileon models is controlled by a single condition linking non-linear void dynamics to the cosmic expansion history. This connection yields a redshift-dependent upper bound on the allowed depth of voids and promotes this requirement to a new viability condition, complementary to standard stability criteria. As an example, we apply this void-based criterion to a linear parameterization in the scale factor constrained by theoretical and observational bounds; we find that $\sim 60\%$ of the parameter space is excluded, with most problematic models failing by $z\lesssim 10$. These results position cosmic voids as sharp, broadly applicable, theory-informed filters for viable modified gravity, enabling more informed priors and parameter-space choices in future cosmological inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Extended Heun Hierarchy in Quantum Seiberg-Witten Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometry of the Seiberg-Witten curve for $\mathcal{N}=2$, $\mathrm{SU(2)}^n$ linear quiver gauge theories. By applying the Weyl quantization prescription to the algebraic curve, we derive the corresponding second-order differential equation and demonstrate that it is isomorphic to the Extended Heun Equation with $n+3$ regular singular points. The physical parameters of the gauge theory are linked to the canonical coefficients of the Heun equation via a polynomial representation of the Seiberg-Witten curve. This framework provides the necessary mathematical foundation to apply non-perturbative gauge-theoretic techniques, such as instanton counting, to spectral problems in gravitational physics, most notably for higher-dimensional black holes.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: a perspective from local geometrical invariants and matter distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, the deflection angle of photons in the strong deflection limit exhibits a logarithmic divergence. We introduce an analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence by employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the properties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations -- where the divergence rate $\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent metric functions -- our approach relates $\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By applying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \begin{align*} \bar{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-8\pi R_{\mathrm{m}}^2\left(\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}}, \end{align*} where $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy density and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius $R_{\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed by the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\bar{a}=1$ emerging when $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the long-standing puzzle of obtaining $\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically present a new dynamical systems approach to standard inflationary processes and their variants as constant-roll inflation. Using the techniques presented in our work one can in general investigate the attractor nature of the inflationary models in the phase space. We have compactified the phase space coordinates, wherever necessary, and regulated the nonlinear differential equations, constituting the autonomous system of equations defining the dynamical system, at the cost of a new redefined time variable which is a monotonic increasing function of the standard time coordinate. We have shown that in most of the relevant cases the program is executable although the two time coordinates may show different durations of cosmological events. If one wishes one can revert back to the cosmological time via an inverse transformation. The present work establishes a standard norm for studying dynamical as well as stability issues in any new inflationary system.</description>

      <title>Standardized Constraints on the Shadow Radius and the Instability of Scalar, Electromagnetic, $p$-Form, and Gravitational Perturbations of High-Dimensional Spherically Symmetric Black Holes in Einstein-power-Yang-Mills-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The space-time geometry under investigation is chosen to be a high-dimensional, static, spherically symmetric solution in an asymptotically flat background within the Einstein-power-Yang-Mills-Gauss-Bonnet (EPYMGB) gravity. To address the limitations of previous shadow constraints, we construct a standardized framework based on the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric to constrain the characteristic parameters of high-dimensional black holes by leveraging observational shadow data. Additionally, we provide a rigorous derivation of the shadow radius formula for a general high-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole. Subsequently, we systematically and comprehensively present the equations of motion and master variables governing spin-0, spin-1, $p$-form, and spin-2 perturbations in high-dimensional static spherically symmetric flat space-time. Our analysis reveals that the Yang-Mills magnetic charge $\mathcal{Q}$ and the power $q$ have a negligible impact on both the shadow radius and perturbations of the black hole when compared to the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant ${\alpha}_2$ in various dimensions. Hence, the physical signatures of the parameters $\mathcal{Q}$ and $q$ in the black hole environment remain undetectable through either perturbation analysis or shadow observations. Cross-validation of the allowable range of ${\alpha}_2$ derived from the high-dimensional constraint on shadow radius and the dynamical stability analysis of gravitational perturbations demonstrates excellent agreement between these independent approaches. The conclusion of this cross-analysis further substantiates the accuracy of the high-dimensional shadow constraint formula proposed in this work, and we argue that this formula may serve as a universal tool for constraining the characteristic parameters of other high-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole solutions.</description>

Abstract: Quasinormal modes for bosonic (scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational) and fermionic field perturbations, radiated from black holes that carry quantum gravitational corrections at third order in the curvature to the Schwarzschild solution, are scrutinized from the propagation of analog transonic sound waves across a de Laval nozzle. The thermodynamic variables, the nozzle geometry, the Mach number, and the thrust coefficient are computed as functions of the parameter driving the effective action for quantum gravity containing a dimension-six local operator beyond general relativity. The quasinormal modes for quantum gravitational corrected analog black holes are also determined for higher overtones, yielding a more precise description of the quantum-corrected ringdown process and the gravitational waveform way before the fundamental mode sets in.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established that black holes in four-dimensional, vacuum, general relativity exhibit vanishing static tidal Love numbers, indicating no multipolar response to the external tidal fields in the static limit. This intriguing feature does not extend to higher-dimensional spacetimes within general relativity, where static black holes can possess non-zero static tidal Love numbers (TLNs). In this work, we have examined the tidal deformation of black holes in Lovelock gravity. We find that, in certain cases within pure Lovelock gravity, the static TLN vanishes, extending the four-dimensional result to specific higher-dimensional settings. On the other hand, black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity consistently exhibit non-zero static TLNs, with their magnitude depending on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. Exceptions occur only in certain special cases associated with axial perturbations. These results highlight the sensitivity of the multipolar response of a black hole under tidal field, to the underlying theory of gravity and the spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole spectroscopy is an important pillar when studying gravitational waves from black holes and enables tests of general relativity. Most of the gravitational-wave signals observed over the last decade originate from binary black hole systems. Binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star systems are rarer but of particular interest for the next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. These events offer the exciting possibility of studying matter effects on the ringdown of "dirty black holes". In this work, we ask the question: Does matter matter? Using numerical-relativity, we simulate a wide range of collapsing neutron stars producing matter environments, both in isolated scenarios and in binary mergers. Qualitatively, the resulting ringdown signals can be classified into "clean", "modified", and "distorted" cases, depending on the amount of matter that is present. We apply standard strategies for extracting quasinormal modes of clean signals, using both theory-agnostic and theory-specific assumptions. Even in the presence of matter, possible modifications of quasinormal modes seem to be dominated by ringdown modeling systematics. We find that incorporating multiple quasinormal modes allows one to drastically reduce mismatches and errors in estimating the final black hole mass at early times. If not treated carefully, deviations in the fundamental quasinormal mode might artificially be overestimated and falsely attributed to the presence of matter or violations of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of parameter-estimation biases in overlapping gravitational-wave signals: detector network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the significantly improved sensitivity and a wider frequency band, the next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are anticipated to detect $\sim 10^5$ GW signals per year with durations from hours to days, leading to inevitable signal overlaps in the data stream. While a direct fitting for all signals may be challenging, extracting only one signal will be biased by its overlap with other signals. From this perspective, understanding how the biases arise from the overlapping and their dependence on the signal parameters is crucial for developing effective algorithms. In this work, we extend the anatomy of biases in single-detector cases (Wang et al. 2024) to a detector network. Specifically, we examine how the biases of the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, luminosity distance, and coalescence time depend on the source's sky position and orientation, as well as on the coalescence time and phase. We propose a new quantity, named the bias integral, as a useful tool, and establish relationship between the biases in a single detector and that in the entire network, with explicit dependence on extrinsic parameters. Using a 3-detector network as an example, we further explore the potential of a network to suppress biases due to the detectors' different locations and orientations. We find that location generally has a smaller effect than orientation, and becomes significant only when the time separation between signals is below sub-seconds. Through a population-level simulation over the extrinsic parameters, we find that nearly half of overlapping signals will lead to larger biases in the network compared to a single detector, highlighting the need to cope with overlapping biases in a detector network.</description>

Abstract: The spectrum of radial oscillations of neutron stars is systematically studied within two frameworks of viscous relativistic hydrodynamics: the relativistic Navier-Stokes and Israel-Stewart theories. A correspondence is established between the discrete stellar eigenmodes and the continuous dispersion relation of perturbations around a homogeneous fluid, providing a basis for interpreting our numerical results. We analyze the Newtonian limit and assess the impact of relativistic corrections, such as the gravitational redshifting of microscopic relaxation timescales. We show that bulk viscosity can significantly affect the behavior of both hydrodynamic and nonhydrodynamic fundamental modes, and that, depending on the magnitude of the viscous effects, it is the nonhydrodynamic mode that becomes unstable beyond the turning point in a sequence of equilibrium configurations. These results provide a useful step toward systematic studies of neutron star quasinormal modes in the presence of viscosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the physical properties of an analytical, nonsingular quantum-corrected black hole solution recently derived in a minisuperspace model for unimodular gravity under the assumption of unitarity in unimodular time. We show that the metric corrections compared to the classical Schwarzschild solutions only depend on a single new parameter, corresponding to a minimal radius where a black hole-white hole transition occurs. While these corrections substantially alter the structure of the spacetime near this minimal radius, they fall off rapidly towards infinity, and we show in various examples how physical properties of the exterior spacetime are very close to those of the Schwarzschild solution. We derive the maximal analytic extension of the initial solution, which corresponds to an infinite sequence of Kruskal spacetimes connected via black-to-white hole transitions, and compare with some other proposals for non-singular black hole metrics. The metric violates the achronal averaged null energy condition, which indicates that we are capturing physics beyond the semiclassical approximation. Finally, we include some thoughts on how to go beyond the simple eternal black hole-white hole model presented here.</description>

Abstract: Numerical relativity has brought about profound and wide-ranging influences on modern astrophysics and gravitational-wave astronomy. In this study, we present a user-friendly Python interface for the numerical relativity code AMSS-NCKU. This interface facilitates the automation of initializing and executing the AMSS-NCKU simulations, as well as the automatic visualization of the output data. The Python interface can significantly reduce the operational complexity of the AMSS-NCKU simulation workflow, lowering the technical barriers for new users. To show the utility of this Python interface, we present two representative examples of numerical relativity simulations (the binary black hole and triple black hole merger processes), obtaining stable numerical results and the expected physical behaviors for black hole systems.

      <description>arXiv:2510.15391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The static antiscalar solution of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations in the form of the Papapetrou exponential metric had been interpreted as a traversable wormhole with a throat at \textit{r=M}. We aim to search for the effects which could be associated with this scale and only find that the topological Gauss-Bonnet invariant swaps sign, and the value of the Keplerian frequency for circular geodesics becomes singular. At the same time, the geometric invariants of the curvature tensor have extremal values at the scale twice less than that of the throat, revealing new physical effects. In particular, the Ricci scalar at \textit{r=M/2} (rather than \textit{r=M}) is associated with the extremal values of thermodynamic characteristics of the scalar background. This approach in combination with the antiscalar static limit of the Einstein-Maxwell equations suggests the interpretation of the scalar background as a stable medium with a stiff equation of state, formed by the neutral superposition of ambient quasistatic electric fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation GW detectors will produce a high rate of temporally overlapping signals from unrelated compact binary coalescences. Such overlaps can bias parameter estimation (PE) and mimic signatures of other physical effects, such as gravitational lensing. In this work, we investigate how overlapping signals can be degenerate with gravitational lensing by focusing on two scenarios: Type-II strong lensing and microlensing by an isolated point-mass lens. We simulate quasicircular binary black-hole pairs with chirp-mass ratios $\mathscr{M}_{\rm B}/\mathscr{M}_{\rm A}\in\{0.5,\,1,\,2\}$, SNR ratios $\mathrm{SNR}_{\rm B}/\mathrm{SNR}_{\rm A}\in\{0.5,\,1\}$, and coalescence-time offsets $\Delta t_{\rm c}\in[-0.1,\,0.1]~\mathrm{s}$. Bayesian PE and fitting-factor studies show that the Type-II lensing hypothesis is favored over the unlensed quasicircular hypothesis ($\log_{10}\mathscr{B}^{\rm L}_{\rm U}&gt;1$) only in a small region of the overlapping parameter space with $\mathscr{M}_{\rm B}/\mathscr{M}_{\rm A}\gtrsim1$ and $|\Delta t_{\rm c}|\leq0.03~\rm{s}$.. Meanwhile, false evidence for microlensing signatures can arise because, to a reasonable approximation, the model produces two superimposed images whose time delay can closely match $|\Delta t_{\rm c}|$. Overall, the inferred Bayes factor depends on relative chirp-mass ratios, relative loudness, difference in coalescence times, and also the absolute SNRs of the overlapping signals. Cumulatively, our results indicate that overlapping black-hole binaries with nearly equal chirp masses and comparable loudness are likely to be falsely identified as lensed. Such misidentifications are expected to become more common as detector sensitivities improve. While our study focuses on ground-based detectors using appropriate detectability thresholds, the findings naturally extend to next-generation GW observatories.</description>

Abstract: The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory is associated with the GfE Lagrangian given by the Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) between the true metric and the metric induced by the matter fields and the curvature. The GfE action leads to the GfE modified gravity equations displaying an emergent dynamical cosmological constant. Interestingly, the GfE equations of motion reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view and we associate the energy density of the GfE to the emergent dynamical cosmological constant of the theory. Focusing on homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, we reveal that the GfE universes associated with the FRW metrics are thermal. Indeed they are associated with the $k$-temperatures and the $k$-pressures which are related to their local GQRE and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated in the low energy, small curvature limit with matter content modelled as perfect fluid, where the solutions of the GfE equations of motion are well approximated by the Friedmann universes. We show that while the total GQRE per unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of GfE universes is not decreasing in time. These results provide a natural thermodynamic interpretation of GfE cosmologies and a framework for reconciling local complexity with the global increase in entropy of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic and thermodynamic stability of neutron stars composed of superconducting-superfluid mixtures within the Iyer-Wald formalism. We derive the first law of thermodynamics and the necessary and sufficient condition under which dynamic equilibrium implies thermodynamic equilibrium. By constructing the phase space and canonical energy, we show that the dynamic stability for perturbations, restricted in symplectic complement of trivial perturbations with the ADM 3-momentum unchanged, is equivalent to the non-negativity of the canonical energy. Furthermore, dynamic stability against restricted axisymmetric perturbations guarantees the dynamic stability against all axisymmetric perturbations. We also prove that the positivity of canonical energy on all axisymmetric perturbations within the Lagrangian displacement framework with fixed angular momentum is necessary for thermodynamic stability. In particular, the equivalence of dynamic and thermodynamic stability for spherically symmetric perturbations of static, spherically symmetric isentropic configurations is established.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that in constructing asymptotically flat vacuum initial data sets in General Relativity via the conformal method, certain asymptotic structures may be prescribed a priori through the specified seed data, including the ADM momentum components, the leading- and next-to-leading-order decay rates, and the anisotropy in the metric's mass term, yielding a recipe to construct initial data sets with desired asymptotics. We numerically construct a simple explicit example of an initial data set, with stronger asymptotics than have been obtained in previous work, such that the evolution of this initial data set does not exhibit the conjectured antipodal symmetry between future and past null infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of gravitons and their masses, clear in the case of Minkowski spacetime, remains ambiguous for de Sitter spacetime. Here, we used a two-fluid approach to de Sitter thermodynamics and found a collective mode that is analogous to second sound in the two-fluid dynamics of the de Sitter state. This mode is massless and propagates at the speed of light. This suggests that this second-sound analog is a massless graviton propagating in de Sitter spacetime. The type of graviton this mode represents requires further consideration.</description>

      <title>Motions of spinning particles and chaos bound in Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Lyapunov exponents of classical chaos of spinning particles orbiting a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and examine whether the values of the exponents exceed the chaos bound. For the neutral particle, when its spin magnitude surpasses a specific threshold, the value of the exponent exceeds the surface gravity, resulting in a violation. Given a fixed total angular momentum of the particle, its spin direction opposite to the angular momentum direction leads to a greater exponent value than when the two directions are aligned. For the charged particle, taking into account the influence of the electromagnetic force, we find that, for relatively large angular momenta, although the electromagnetic force does not change the trend of the exponent's variation with respect to spin and angular momentum and only modifies the specific values of the exponent, it still leads to violations of the bound. Therefore, the chaos bound is violated in the spinor field.</description>

      <title>A framework for LISA population inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to have a source rich data stream containing signals from large numbers of many different types of source. This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.</description>

      <title>Impact of Simultaneous Stellar Modeling Uncertainties on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch for Axion-Election Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for incorporating the effects of stellar modeling uncertainties into constraints on the axion-electron coupling constant found using the observed calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) I band magnitude $M_I$.~We simulate grids of models with varying initial stellar mass, helium abundance, metallicity, and axion-electron coupling $\alpha_{26}= 10^{26} g^2_{ae}/4\pi$ but different (fixed) mixing lengths and mass loss efficiencies.~We then train separate machine learning emulators to predict $M_I$ as a function of the varying parameters for each grid.~Our emulators enable the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations where $\alpha_{26}$ is varied simultaneously with the stellar parameters.~One of our grids yields a bound $\alpha_{26}\leq 0.75$ at the 95\% confidence limit, a factor of $\sim3.7$ weaker than previous bounds;~while the other grid yields $\alpha_{26}\leq1.58$ at the 95\% confidence limit, a factor $\sim7.8$ weaker than previous bounds.~We demonstrate that the different values we find are due to covariances between stellar and axion physics that are not accounted for by single parameter variations.~Our results suggest that the bound on $\alpha_{26}$ derived using empirical calibrations of the TRGB I band magnitude need to be reevaluated using simultaneous parameter variation.~Alternative methods that use the bolometric luminosity instead of $M_I$ are more robust because they are not reliant upon theoretical predictions of the effective temperature.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger standard-siren cosmology for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors: forecasts considering observations of gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, GW multi-messenger observations for binary neutron star merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. Extending the previous work, we explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimation by considering their associated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, including $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) coincidence observations by the Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor and GW-triggered target-of-opportunity observations of kilonovae by different optical survey projects. During an assumed 10-year observation, we predict that the number of detectable GW-kilonova events is $\sim 4900$ with redshifts below $\sim 0.4$ under GW network and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in the $i$ band, which is three times more than that of GW-GRB detections. For the cosmological analysis, we find that with the inclusion of GW-kilonova detections, the constraints on cosmological parameters from GW-EM detections are significantly improved compared to those from GW-GRB detections. In particular, GW-EM detections can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with a precision ranging from $0.076\%$ to $0.034\%$. Moreover, GW multi-messenger observations could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). The combination of CBS and GW-EM can tightly constrain the equation of state parameters of dark energy $w$ in the $w$CDM model and $w_0$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model with precisions of $0.72\%$ and $0.99\%$, respectively, meeting the standard of precision cosmology. In conclusion, GW multi-messenger observations could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probing the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $U(1)$ CP-violating phase which arises below chiral symmetry breaking in a non-Abelian gauge theory is ``secretly" the magnetic dual of the flux of a $U(1)$ $4$-form gauge field. Thus the discharge of this $4$-form flux by Schwinger production of charged membranes reduces the total CP-violating phase toward zero. This can safely restore CP symmetry to within the observational limits, $\theta_{\cancel{\tt CP}} \la 10^{-10}$, while also satisfying all limits from cosmology, when the charge and the tension of the gauge field sources are in the $\la keV$ range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Much of our intuition about Effective Field Theories (EFTs) stems from their formulation in flat spacetime, yet EFTs have become indispensable tools in cosmology, where time-dependent backgrounds are the norm. In this work, we demonstrate that in spacetimes undergoing significant expansion-such as accelerated FLRW and de Sitter backgrounds-the contributions of operators with mass dimension $\Delta$ to physical observables grow factorially with $\Delta$ at fixed couplings. This behavior stands in stark contrast to static flat spacetime. As a result, the cosmological EFT expansion is generally asymptotic rather than convergent, even at tree level. To illustrate this phenomenon, we analyze simple toy models involving a massless or conformally coupled scalar field interacting with a heavy scalar with zero or infinite sound speed. We demonstrate that meaningful EFT predictions can still be extracted via appropriate resummation techniques, performed in both Fourier and Mellin-momentum space. In the infinite sound speed limit, where the heavy field is effectively non-dynamical, the resummed EFT reproduces the exact result of the full theory. In other cases, the EFT captures only the local part of the dynamics, omitting nonlocal terms, which are exponentially suppressed in the large-mass limit for the Bunch-Davies state. Our results provide detailed and quantitative expectations for more general cosmological EFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron star glitches -- sudden increases in rotational frequency -- are thought to result from angular momentum transfer via quantized vortices in the superfluid core. To investigate the underlying superfluid dynamics, we employ a two-dimensional rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate described by a damped Gross-Pitaevskii equation with an imposed pinning potential that serves as a simplified analogue of a crust. Within this minimal framework, we examine the emergence and evolution of turbulent vortex motion following impulsive perturbations reminiscent of glitch-like forcing. Our simulations reveal a transient Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade ($k^{-5/3}$) that transitions to a Vinen-like scaling ($k^{-1}$). We identify an anomalous secondary injection mechanism driven primarily by quantum pressure, which can sustain turbulent fluctuations in such a system. By tuning the damping coefficient $\gamma$, we determine an optimal regime for energy transfer. While idealized, these findings illustrate how quantum turbulence with multiple scaling regimes can arise in pinned, rotating superfluids, and they suggest possible qualitative connections to vortex-mediated dynamics in neutron stars and other astrophysical superfluid systems.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based population inference of LISA's Galactic binaries: Bypassing the global fit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect thousands of individually resolved gravitational wave sources, overlapping in time and frequency, on top of unresolved astrophysical and/or primordial backgrounds. Disentangling resolved sources from backgrounds and extracting their parameters in a computationally intensive "global fit" is normally regarded as a necessary step toward reconstructing the properties of the underlying astrophysical populations. Here, we show that it is in principle feasible to infer the population properties of the most numerous of LISA sources -- Galactic double white dwarfs -- directly from the frequency (or, equivalently, time) strain series by adopting a simulation-based approach, without extracting and estimating the parameters of each single source. By training a normalizing flow on a custom-designed compression of simulated LISA frequency series from the Galactic double white dwarf population, we demonstrate how to infer the posterior distribution of population parameters (e.g., mass function, frequency, and spatial distributions). This allows for extracting information on the population parameters from both resolved and unresolved sources simultaneously and in a computationally efficient manner. This approach can be extended to other source classes (e.g., massive and stellar-mass black holes, extreme mass ratio inspirals) and to scenarios involving non-Gaussian or non-stationary noise (e.g., data gaps), provided that fast and accurate simulations are available.</description>

      <title>Investigating non-Keplerian motion in flare events with astrometric data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GRAVITY interferometer has achieved microarcsecond precision in near-infrared interferometry, enabling the tracking of flare centroid motion in the strong gravitational field near the Sgr A*. It might be promising to serve as a unique laboratory for exploring the accretion matter near black holes or testing Einstein's gravity. Recent studies debated whether there is a non-Keplerian motion of the flares in the GRAVITY dataset. This motivates us to present a comprehensive analysis based on error estimation under the Bayesian framework. This study uses astrometric flare data to investigate the possibility that the flares exhibit deviations from the circular Keplerian motion. We analyze both averaged and individual flare data, modeling the hotspot with either circular orbits parameterized by a non-Keplerian correction or planar geodesic orbits. It is confirmed that the astrometric data favor the circular orbits over non-circular ones, with the orbital circularity parameter of $\gamma = 0.99_{-0.10}^{+0.07}$. Our results show that the joint posteriors for black hole mass and non-Keplerian parameter are negatively correlated. Fixing the mass to be its established value yields a non-Keplerian parameter of $\omega/\omega_k = 1.45^{+0.35}_{-0.38}$, at approximately the 1$\sigma$ level. The statistical significance is insufficiently high, and the conclusion is found to be sensitive to the presence of correlations in the astrometric data, which might originate from the non-uniform $u$-$v$ coverage in interferometer measurements. In this sense, the current data might be insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the presence of non-Keplerian motion. Future improvements in astrometry precision might enable stronger constraints on the kinematical behavior of the flares.</description>

We show that the theory admits a regular AdS$_3$ black hole solution with primary hairs. Introducing a deformation in the theory, a different regular AdS$_3$ black hole solution is obtained. Charged generalizations of these solutions are given by coupling to Born-Infeld electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt the diffusion method employed in fundamentally nonlocal field theories to determine the number of initial conditions for the classicized dynamics of unitary field theories with fakeons, characterized by inverse powers of the d'Alembertian operator $\Box$. We show that this number is two and we recover all the results obtained with a direct calculation elsewhere, including explicit solutions of linear toy models. Possible applications to nonlocal gravity are discussed.</description>

      <title>Scattering perspective on gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves propagating across gravitational potentials undergo lensing effects that, in the wave-optics regime, manifest as frequency-dependent amplitude and phase modulations. In this work, we revisit the diffraction integral formalism of gravitational lensing and demonstrate that it admits a natural and transparent interpretation within the framework of scattering theory. We establish a direct correspondence between the lensing amplification factor and the scattering amplitude of waves propagating in curved spacetime, clarifying how familiar lensing limits map onto distinct scattering regimes. In particular, we show that the diffraction integral matches exactly the eikonal limit of the scattering amplitude at lowest post-Minkowskian order, after a change in coordinates and the inclusion of finite-distance effects. We further extend the standard formalism by including subleading corrections to the post-Minkowskian and eikonal approximations. Our results provide a unified theoretical framework for the interpretation of lensed gravitational-wave signals and open the way to more accurate waveform modeling for future lensed observations.</description>

      <title>SL(2N,C) Yang-Mills Theories: Direct Internal Forces and Emerging Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a four-dimensional gauge-gravity unification based on the \(SL(2N,\mathbb C)\) gauge theory taken in a universal Yang--Mills type setting. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields whose contracted invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $\mathrm{SL}(2N, \mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$, lifting all noncompact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector, while an Einstein--Cartan linear curvature term is induced radiatively from fermion loops. Below the breaking scale, only a neutral tetrad associated with graviton and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ vector fields remain massless, whereas axial-vector and tensor fields of the entire gauge multiplet acquire heavy masses. The matter sector clearly points to a deeper elementarity of \(SL(2N,\mathbb C)\) spinors, which can be identified with preon constituents whose bound states form the observed quarks and leptons. Anomaly matching between preons and composites singles out $N=8$. The chain $\mathrm{SL}(16,\mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(8)$ then naturally yields three composite quark--lepton families, while filtering out extraneous heavy states.</description>

      <title>Inflation in light of ACT/SPT: a new perspective from Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) have placed the strictest constraints on the primordial scalar perturbation spectrum, reporting a spectral index of $n_s\sim0.967-0.98$ at 95% confidence level. This result indicates a stronger scale invariance of the scalar perturbation than earlier estimates, posing challenges for numerous inflation models. In this work, we propose a novel inflationary scenario based on Weyl scale-invariant gravity, where the quadratic curvature establishes the scale invariance of the scalar spectrum, while the higher-order extensions imprint the observed slight deviation. Specifically, the exponential curvature extensions are introduced to suppress the mass divergence of the inflaton. We find such scenario naturally yields leading-order predictions of $n_s\simeq1-3/(2N)\sim0.97-0.975$ or $n_s\simeq1-5/(3N)\sim0.967-0.972$ for various models, in excellent agreement with the ACT/SPT constraints. This result builds a concrete bridge between theoretical and observational scale invariance, implying an enduring cosmic echo of the primordial symmetry.</description>

      <title>A Compact Formula for Conserved Three-Point Tensor Structures in 4D CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a compact analytic formula for a complete basis of conformally invariant tensor structures for three-point functions of conserved operators in arbitrary 4D Lorentz representations. The construction follows directly from a novel constraint equivalent to applying conservation conditions at each point: the leading terms in all OPE limits appear as symmetric traceless tensors. We derive this by lifting to a unified $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$ analytic superspace framework, where the conservation conditions are automatically solved and then reducing back to 4D CFT. The same method is also used for cases involving one non-conserved operator. This formalism further reveals a map of the counting of CFT tensor structures to that of finite-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(2n)$ representations, solved by Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. All results can be directly re-interpreted as three-point $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal tensor structures via the unified analytic superspace.</description>
