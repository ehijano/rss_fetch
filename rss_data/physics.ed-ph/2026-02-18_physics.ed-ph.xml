      <title>Do we have a quantum computer? Expert perspectives on current status and future prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of quantum information science and technology (QIST) in the 21st century has created both excitement and uncertainty about the field's trajectory. This qualitative study presents perspectives from leading quantum researchers, who are educators, on fundamental questions frequently posed by students, the public, and the media regarding QIST. Through in-depth interviews, we explored several issues related to QIST including the following key areas: the current state of quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era and timelines for fault-tolerant quantum computers, the feasibility of personal quantum computers in our pockets, and promising qubit architectures for future development. Our findings reveal diverse yet convergent perspectives on these issues. While experts agree that the current machines with physical qubits that are being built currently should be called quantum computers, most estimated that it will take a decade to build a small fault-tolerant quantum computer, and several decades to achieve scalable systems capable of running Shor's factoring algorithm with quantum advantage. Regarding carrying a quantum computer in the pocket, experts viewed quantum computers as specialized tools that will remain in central locations such as data centers and can be accessed remotely for applications for which they are particularly effective compared to classical computers. Quantum researchers suggested that multiple platforms show promise, with no clear winner emerging. These insights provide valuable guidance for educators, policymakers, and the broader community in establishing realistic expectations for developments in this exciting field. Our findings can provide valuable information for educators to clarify student doubts about these important yet confusing issues related to quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Navigating Hype, Interdisciplinary Collaboration, and Industry Partnerships in Quantum Information Science and Technology: Perspectives from Leading Quantum Educators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum information science and technology (QIST) has generated significant attention from people in academia, industry, and the public. Recent advances in QIST have led to both opportunities and challenges for students and researchers who are curious about the potential of the field amid hype, considering whether their skills are aligned with what the field needs, and contemplating how collaborating with industries may impact their research. This qualitative study presents perspectives from leading quantum researchers who are educators on three critical aspects shaping QIST's development: (1) the impact of hype in the field and strategies for managing expectations, (2) approaches to creating conducive environments that attract students and established researchers from non-physics disciplines, and (3) effective models for fostering university-industry partnerships that can be valuable for students and researchers alike. These aspects, along with several interconnected challenges, were explored through in-depth interviews with quantum educators. Our findings reveal nuanced perspectives on managing the hype cycle and its risks in creating unrealistic expectations. Regarding greater interdisciplinary engagement and attracting more non-physicists to QIST, educators emphasized the need to recognize and leverage existing expertise from other fields while developing educational pathways that meet diverse student backgrounds to prepare them for the QIST workforce. On university-industry partnerships, respondents highlighted successful models, while noting persistent challenges around intellectual property, confidentiality, and differing organizational goals. These insights provide valuable guidance for educators, policymakers, and industry leaders working to build a sustainable quantum workforce while maintaining realistic expectations about the field's trajectory.</description>

      <title>Students' understanding of the 2D Heat Equation: An APOS approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the APOS theoretical framework to validate a hypothetical learning trajectory of the 2D heat equation, a preliminary genetic decomposition that stresses the conceptual understanding of its mathematical formulation. We design questions to probe specific mental constructions of the preliminary genetic decomposition. We interview 8 students in the second year of the B.Sc. enrolled in either engineering, physics or twin (mathematics and physics) majors. Our findings indicate that students engage with many predicted mental constructions. In particular, coordination and encapsulation of two process conceptions of the Laplacian of the temperature improve understanding although it is challenging. Other parts of the genetic decomposition require refinements. These include mental constructions related to the temperature distribution function, heat flow, and the temperature gradient.</description>
