      <title>PINNPStomo: Simultaneous P- and S-wave seismic traveltime tomography using physics-informed neural networks with a new factored eikonal equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic tomography has long been an effective tool for constructing reliable subsurface structures. However, simultaneous inversion of P- and S-wave velocities presents a significant challenge for conventional seismic tomography methods, which depend on numerical algorithms to calculate traveltimes. A physics informed neural network (PINN)-based seismic tomography method (PINNtomo) has been proposed to solve the eikonal equation and construct the velocity model. Leveraging the powerful approximation capabilities of neural networks, we propose extending PINNtomo to perform multiparameter inversion of P- and S-wave velocities jointly, which we refer to as PINNPStomo. In PINNPStomo, we employ two neural networks: one for the P- and S-wave traveltimes, and another for the P- and S-wave velocities. By optimizing the misfits of P- and S-wave first-arrival traveltimes calculated from the eikonal equations, we can obtain the predicted P- and S-wave velocities that determine these traveltimes. Recognizing that the original PINNtomo utilizes a multiplicative factored eikonal equation, which depends on background traveltimes corresponding to a homogeneous velocity at the source location. We propose a new factored eikonal equation for PINNPStomo to eliminate this dependency. The proposed PINNPStomo, incorporating the new factored eikonal equation, demonstrates superior convergence speed and multiparameter inversion accuracy. We validate these improvements using 2D Marmousi and 2D/3D Overthrust elastic velocity models across three different seismic data acquisition geometries.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Unsaturated Slope Stability under Seismic and Surcharge Loading by Upper Bound Rigid Block Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Failure of earthen slopes is a very recurrent phenomenon, credited mainly due to the excess rainfall and application of surfeit surcharge. However, most of the analyses regarding slope stability were performed without considering the unsaturated state of the soil. The prime purpose of the present manuscript is to address the stability of unsaturated homogeneous slopes subjected to surcharge load and pseudo-static seismic forces under different climatic conditions. The upper bound limit analysis technique was used based on the log-spiral failure mechanism. The suction stress-based effective stress approach was used to capture the effect of the unsaturated zone of the slope. The suction stress is modelled using Gardner's one-parameter hydraulic conductivity function and van-Genuchten's soil water characteristics curve. An extensive parametric study is carried out to assess the combined effect of slope geometry, soil-strength parameters, hydro-mechanical parameters, depth of water table, various flow conditions, surcharge load, and seismic loading. A few stability charts are proposed to show the impact of surcharge load and seismic load separately on unsaturated homogeneous slopes subjected to various climatic conditions. The present computed solutions match quite well with the available solutions prescribed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Assessing the climate benefits of afforestation: phenomenology, processes, methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Afforestation greatly influences several earth system processes, making it essential to understand these effects to accurately assess its potential for climate change mitigation. Although our understanding of forest-climate interactions has improved, significant knowledge gaps remain, preventing definitive assessments of afforestation's net climate benefits. In this review, focusing on the Canadian boreal, we identify these gaps and synthesize existing knowledge. The review highlights regional realities, Earth's climatic history, uncertainties in biogeochemical (BGC) and biogeophysical (BGP) changes following afforestation, and limitations in current assessment methodologies, emphasizing the need to reconcile these uncertainties before drawing firm conclusions about the climate benefits of afforestation. We hope that the identified gaps will drive the development of a more informed decision-making framework for Canadian afforestation policy, one that considers regional and future climatic contexts. Although we use the Canadian boreal as an example, most arguments in this review are applicable across the globe, particularly for the circumpolar nations.</description>
