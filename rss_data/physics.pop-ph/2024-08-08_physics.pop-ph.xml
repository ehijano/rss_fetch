      <title>Niel's Chess -- The Battle of the Quantum Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13669v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a quantum variant of chess is introduced, which can be played on a traditional board without the need of using computers or other electronic devices. The rules of the game arise naturally by combining the rules of conventional chess with key quantum-physical effects such as superposition and entanglement. Niel's Chess is recommended for ages 10 and above, to everyone who wishes to play a creative game with historical roots and at the same time gain intuition about the foundational quantum effects that power cutting-edge technologies like quantum computing and quantum communication, which are poised to revolutionise our society in the coming decades.</description>

Takeaways from a pilot educational session that was carried out with 10-to-12-year-old children are also presented.</description>
