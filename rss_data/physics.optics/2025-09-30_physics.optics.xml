      <title>Static magnetic control of light emission in plasmonic nanojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in metal nanoparticles have been studied extensively through scattering and absorption. Static magnetic field-induced changes in plasmonic far-field response stem from the classical Hall effect and are generally very small in noble metals within the visible frequency range at readily accessible magnetic fields. Planar plasmonic tunnel junctions allow the study of nanogap LSPRs through current-driven light emission. We find that the electroluminescence of such junctions is modulated by tens of percent with a magnetic field of a few Teslas, exceeding Hall-based expectations by orders of magnitude. Complementary quantum mechanical and electromagnetic modeling reveals that a modest static magnetic field can introduce significant chirality in the transition dipoles generated during the electron tunneling process. This strongly affects the excitation of LSPRs and leads to magnetic-field sensitive far-field electroluminescent emission. This is a new paradigm for tunable nanoscale light sources.</description>

      <title>Bridging Mid-IR and Terahertz Domains in a Single High-Resolution Dual-Comb Spectroscopy Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) utilizes a pair of broadband mutually coherent laser frequency combs to enable high-resolution, high-accuracy spectroscopic measurements with atomic-clock-level frequency referencing, and rapid, multiplexed acquisition without moving parts. It has traditionally been confined to specific domains: terahertz, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet, each requiring distinct comb sources and detection mechanisms tailored to the nature of the spectroscopic target. Yet, similar techniques may be implemented in the terahertz (THz) and mid-infrared (MIR) regions, such as optical rectification for comb generation and electro-optic sampling for detection, both using crystals with quadratic nonlinearity. However, in the Reststrahlen band near phonon resonances in these crystals, typically between 5 and 10 THz, both linear and nonlinear susceptibilities experience abnormally high dispersion, and light propagation is strongly suppressed. This confines DCS operation to spectral regions either below or above the Reststrahlen band and effectively separating the THz and MIR domains. Here we demonstrate high-resolution DCS performed simultaneously over two broad spectral bands, each spanning an octave or more. The measurements cover both the MIR (350-1150 cm$^{-1}$; 8.7-28.5 $\mu$m; 10.5-34.5 THz) and the THz region (80-160 cm$^{-1}$; 62.5-125 $\mu$m; 2.4-4.8 THz), effectively bridging these traditionally separate regions within a single acquisition. This enables direct cross-referencing of molecular absorption line strengths across widely separated spectral domains. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the simultaneous acquisition of ro-vibrational and pure rotational absorption spectra of ammonia (NH$_3$) with a spectral resolution of 7.3 MHz (0.00024 cm$^{-1}$), sufficient to fully resolve Doppler-broadened line shapes across the entire measured spectral range.</description>

      <title>High fidelity CNOT gates in photonic integrated circuits using composite segmented directional couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic circuits are a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, but their performance is often constrained by component sensitivity to fabrication imperfections. Directional couplers, which are crucial building blocks for integrated quantum logic gates, are particularly prone to such limitations, with strong dependence on geometric and spectral parameters which reduces gate fidelity. Here, we demonstrate that composite segmented directional couplers (CSDC) offer a fabrication-tolerant alternative that enhances gate fidelity without active tuning. We design and fabricate a fully integrated photonic controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate using both uniform and composite coupler variants and compare their performance via simulation, classical characterization, and quantum two-photon interference. The composite design reduces the average error probability by nearly a factor of two and decreases variability fivefold. The residual error is primarily limited by photon indistinguishability. Classical matrix reconstruction confirms improved agreement with the ideal CNOT operation. These results establish CSDCs as compact, passive, and foundry-compatible building blocks for robust scalable quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Charge Transfer States in Donor Acceptor Bulk Heterojunctions as Triplet Triplet Annihilation Sensitizer for Solid-State Photon Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon interconversion in semiconductors is of fundamental importance for digital imaging and quantum sensing. Nonlinear processes such as triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) offer photon upconversion (UC) at yields desired for solid-state optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a multilayer molecular system where a near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizer facilitates robust photon UC. A molecular stack of squaraine DIB-SQ: 6,6-Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is optimized for UC by fine tuning the PCBM loading to engineer charge transfer states that facilitate further triplet generation. This composite NIR photosensitizer layer, at a 1:3 blend ratio in heterojunction with rubrene, drives triplet population density to levels desired for effective TTA. When paired with a fully optimized annihilator layer of tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) doped rubrene, the NIR sensitizer produces a photon upconversion quantum yield of 1.36% at 690 nm, with a significantly low excitation intensity threshold for the onset of the linear regime.. Time-resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption spectroscopy, and magnetic field dependent photoluminescence measurements reveal a detailed balance of photoexcited states and formation of charge transfer states of triplet character (3CT), which work in tandem with molecular states to sensitize the triplet state (T1) of rubrene. This approach of harnessing near-infrared photons presents promising avenue for advancing solid-state photon interconversion.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Impacted Beam Statistics and Image Topology with Lorentz Dipole Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a rigorous statistical and geometric framework for analyzing turbulence-impacted beam propagation and image topology with results obtained using a PMMA slab. The approach models beam intensity distributions as n-dimensional data set represented through Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), embedding them into the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. By employing information geometric tools, geodesic distances, and affine-invariant Riemannian metrics, we establish a principled methodology for quantifying similarity and dissimilarity among beam images. Experimental results demonstrate topological distance trends, distance statistics, and correlation measures for different turbulence scenarios, including polarized and unpolarized cases. Histograms of distance statistics reveal stable statistical features, with correlation coefficients highlighting the turbulence-induced variability in PMMA-based beam propagation. The framework not only provides a systematic foundation for analyzing optical beam statistics under turbulence but also opens avenues for advanced applications such as deep learning-based feature reduction, image compression, and secure free-space optical (FSO) communication. Future directions include refining the GMM-EM based distance measures, comparative scatter analysis, and developing robust statistical tools for turbulence imaging. Overall, this study bridges theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and potential technological applications in adaptive and applied optics.</description>

      <title>Integrated Silicon Photonic Multichannel Optical Hybrid for Broadband Parallel Coherent Reception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design and demonstrate a monolithically integrated silicon photonic multichannel optical hybrid for versatile broadband coherent reception, addressing the critical limitations of current wavelength multiplexed systems in scalability and power efficiency. The device combines a phase-compensated 90-degree optical hybrid with four robust three-stage Mach-Zehnder interferometer lattice filters, enabling 34-port functionality (two inputs and 32 outputs) for simultaneous analog and digital signal processing. Leveraging multimode interferometer designs,the chip achieves a broadband response with sub-dB passband uniformity across eight 200 GHz-spaced wavelength channels, while maintaining phase errors below 4 degrees over a 13.5 nm (1539-1552.5 nm) bandwidth with only 2.5 mW thermal tuning power.Experimentally, we validate its parallel-processing capability through RF channelizer reception (showing an average spurious-free dynamic range of 80.8 dB*Hz2/3 and image rejection ratio of 33.26 dB) and coherent optical communication (achieving 1.024 Tb/s data rate for 32-QAM signals with bit error rates far below the 20% SD-FEC threshold). The scheme enhances system performance with fully passive wavelength multiplexing integration, supporting high-fidelity uniformity and projecting scalability to 1.468 Tb/s. This work promises advancements in high-performance optoelectronic devices for next-generation AI-driven data centers and 5G-XG networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Limited Optical Vector Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Vector Analysers (OVA) are critical for emerging technologies such as integrated photonics and optical positioning. Achieving a sensitivity near the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) while acquiring a wide spectrum allows an accurate measurement of targets that are fragile, non-linear, or that scatter most of the probe light away. Existing OVAs operate with a sensitivity orders of magnitude below the SQL. In this paper, we use a free-running interferometer with a frequency range of 20 THz as an OVA. We introduce novel methods to mitigate the phase noise and obtain a unit signal-to-noise ratio for powers at the fW level. We apply this technique towards quantifying the fabrication quality of microring resonators in thin-film Lithium Niobate. Our characterisation yields a signal-to-noise ratio above 1 with much less than 1 circulating photon and reveals a quality factor above 5 millions, unambiguously attributed to low internal losses.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Diamond-Air Interface as an Efficient Photon Antenna for Solid-State Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting photons from defect centers is challenging due to the high refractive index of typical substrates. For nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, reaching saturation count rates above $2.5\times10^5\,\mathrm{counts}/\mathrm{s}$ so far requires nanofabricated optics like diamond waveguides or solid immersion lenses. Here we present an experimental and theoretical study of defect center emission at unmodified planar dielectric surfaces by quantitative back focal plane imaging and analytical modeling. Our results indicate that photon count rates approaching those of nanofabricated optics can also be achieved by oil-immersion optics. This is due to a dielectric antenna effect which directs the majority of the emission into the substrate within a narrow angle window suitable for back-side collection. By quantifying the collection efficiency of back-side detection, our work also enables a novel measurement method for the quantum efficiency of shallow defect centers. Its result challenges established values. Possible reasons for the discrepancy are discussed.</description>

      <title>Optical Vortex Dynamics in non-uniform twisted Ring-Core Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a thorough analysis of the propagation of fiber modes carrying orbital angular momentum in twisted, tapered, ring-core optical fibers. In particular, by generalizing the usual coupled-mode approach to include the effect of twisting and tapering, we discuss how it is possible to achieve efficient power transfer between modes carrying different amounts of orbital angular momentum. Our simulation allows us to get a clear insight into the dynamics of vortex modes propagating through twisted ring core fibers.</description>

      <title>Confinement of Polariton Condensates in quasi-Flatband BICs in Plasmonic and Dielectric Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate exciton-polariton condensation in square arrays, composed of either dielectric silicon (Si) or plasmonic silver (Ag) nanodisks, covered with a dye-doped layer. Both arrays support symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs) at normal incidence, featuring electric quadrupolar ($( Q_{xy} $)) and magnetic dipolar ($( m_z $)) characters. Due to differences in mode coupling, these BICs are split by $(\sim 10$) meV in the Si array, whereas they remain nearly degenerate in the Ag array. Simulations reveal that interference in the Ag array results in hybrid modes, $((m_z + i\tilde{Q}_{xy})$) and $((m_z - i\tilde{Q}_{xy})$), which are polarized along orthogonal directions. Interestingly, this results in similar lasing thresholds in both Si and Ag arrays, regardless of the inherent non-radiative losses of Ag, and also a confinement of the polariton condensates in the Ag array. While condensation in the Si array occurs in the $( Q_{xy} $) BIC, producing a characteristic donut-shaped far-field emission in k-space, condensation in the Ag array populates the hybrid modes, leading to a double-cross emission pattern extending over a broad range of wave vectors due to the quasi-flatband nature of this mode. As a result, the Ag array also exhibits a strong confinement along the polarization axis in real space. However, for unpolarized emission, there is a similar spatial confinement in both Si and Ag arrays. This control over the confinement of condensates could also be exploited to control interactions. Our results highlight a novel mechanism for condensate confinement with potential applications in quantum computing and polaritonic circuitry.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Raman Probing of Molecular Transport in sub-2-nm Plasmonic Quasi-2D Nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing molecular dynamics in nanoconfined channels with high spatiotemporal resolution is a key challenge in nanoscience, crucial for advancing catalysis, energy conversion, and molecular sensing. Bottom-up ultrathin plasmonic nanogaps, such as nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) structures, are ideal for ultrasensitive probing due to their extreme light confinement, but their perceived sealed geometry has cast doubt on the existence of accessible transport pathways. Here, counterintuitively, we demonstrate that ubiquitous ligand-capped NPoM-type nanogaps can form a natural quasi-two-dimensional nanochannel, supporting molecular transport over unprecedented length scales ($\gtrsim5$ $\mu$m) with an extreme aspect ratio ($&gt;10^3$). Using wavelength-multiplexed Raman spectroscopy, we resolve the underlying centripetal infiltration pathway with a spatial resolving power of $\sim$20 nm. This redefines the NPoM architecture as a sensitive, \textit{in-situ}, all-in-one "transport-and-probe" platform, enabling real-time, reusable monitoring of analyte with $\sim$10$^{-11}$ M. This work establishes a versatile new platform for advancing super-resolved \textit{in-situ} molecular sensing, nanoscale physicochemical studies, and on-chip nanophotofluidics.</description>

      <title>Generating topological non-diffracting beams using high quality factor nonlocal metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-diffracting optical beams are essential tools in photonics, enabling robust light transport, super-resolution imaging, and spatiotemporal control. While nonlocal metasurfaces have been proposed for structured-light generation due to their broad angular dispersion and topological characteristics, experimental generation of a non-diffracting beam with nonlocal metasurfaces has not been demonstrated. Here we experimentally realize vortex Bessel beams using a nonlocal metasurface and establish a direct link between non-diffracting-beam generation and photonic band curvature. Depending on the sign of the curvature, the beams exhibit spatially asymmetric non-diffraction, emerging either in front of or behind the metasurface. This asymmetry arises from a radial phase gradient in momentum space, which induces effective space compression or expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate wavelength-dependent tunability of the beam diameter and propagation distance, and show an order-of-magnitude enhancement in propagation distance compared to conventional Laguerre--Gaussian modes. These results position nonlocal metasurfaces as a compact, tunable platform for spatiotemporally controlled non-diffracting light.</description>

      <title>Axial resolution post-processing engineering in Fresnel incoherent correlation holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fresnel incoherent correlation holography (FINCH) is a self-interference-based incoherent digital holography method. In FINCH, light from an object point is split into two beams, modulated differently using two lenses with different focal distances, and creates a self-interference hologram. At least three phase-shifted holograms are recorded and synthesized into a complex hologram, which reconstructs the object image without twin image and bias noises. Compared with conventional imaging, FINCH exhibits a longer depth of focus (DOF) and higher lateral resolution. In this study, we propose and demonstrate a new method termed post-engineering of axial resolution in FINCH (PEAR-FINCH), which enables post-recording DOF engineering for the first time. In PEAR-FINCH, a library of FINCH holograms catalogued with unique axial characteristics, DOF, and focus location is recorded by changing the focal distance of one of the diffractive lenses. Selected holograms from this library are combined to engineer new axial characteristics not achievable in FINCH. A two-step reconstruction, involving numerical back-propagation and deconvolution with a point spread hologram, is implemented. Experiments with multiplane objects having large axial separations confirm that PEAR-FINCH achieves a substantially extended DOF compared with direct imaging and FINCH. PEAR-FINCH will be promising for applications in biomedical imaging, holography, and fluorescence microscopy.</description>

Abstract: Ultrashort pulsed laser annealing is an efficient technique for crystallizing amorphous semiconductors with the possibility to obtain polycrystalline films at low temperatures, below the melting point, through non-thermal processes. Here, a multilayer structure consisting of alternating amorphous silicon and germanium films was annealed by mid-infrared (1500 nm) ultrashort (70 fs) laser pulses under single-shot and multi-shot irradiation conditions. We investigate selective crystallization of ultrathin (3.5 nm) a-Ge film, promising for the generation of highly photostable nanodots. Based on Raman spectroscopy analysis, we demonstrate that, in contrast to thicker (above 10 nm) Ge films, explosive stress-induced crystallization is suppressed in such ultrathin systems and proceeds via thermal melting. This is likely due to the islet structure of ultrathin films which results in the formation of nanopores at the Si-Ge interface and reduces stress confinement during ultrashort laser heating.</description>

      <title>Low-power integrated optical parametric amplification via second-harmonic resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical amplifiers are fundamental to modern photonics, enabling long-distance communications, precision sensing, and quantum information processing. Erbium-doped amplifiers dominate telecommunications but are restricted to specific wavelength bands, while semiconductor amplifiers offer broader coverage but suffer from high noise and nonlinear distortions. Optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) promise broadband, quantum-limited amplification across arbitrary wavelengths. However, their miniaturization and deployment has been hampered by watt-level power requirements. Here we demonstrate an integrated OPA on thin-film lithium niobate that achieves &gt;17 dB gain with &lt;200 mW input power -- an order of magnitude improvement over previous demonstrations. Our second-harmonic-resonant design enhances both pump generation efficiency (95% conversion) and pump power utilization through recirculation, without sacrificing bandwidth. The resonant architecture increases the effective pump power by nearly an order of magnitude compared to conventional single-pass designs, while also multiplexing the signal and pump. We demonstrate flat near-quantum-limited noise performance over 110 nm. Our low-power architecture enables practical on-chip OPAs for next generation quantum and classical photonics.</description>

      <title>Topology-Optimized Dielectric Cavities for Enhanced Excitonic Light Emission from $\rm WSe_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic inverse design and, especially, topology optimization, enable dielectric cavities with deeply sub-diffraction mode volumes and high quality factors, thus offering a powerful platform for enhanced light-matter coupling. Here, we design and fabricate arrays of CMOS-compatible silicon cavities on sapphire with extreme subwavelength transverse mode sizes of only 30-40 nm ($\rm V\sim\lambda^3/2500$). These cavities are engineered for deterministic coupling to a monolayer (or few-layer) excitonic material, producing strong near-field localization directly beneath the 2D material. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements show reproducible tenfold enhancements relative to bare silicon, consistent with numerical simulations that account for material absorption and fabrication tolerances. Furthermore, time-resolved PL measurements reveal pronounced lifetime shortening and non-exponential dynamics, indicating cavity-mediated exciton-exciton interactions. The optimized cavity geometry enhances the far-field collection efficiency and supports scalable integration with van der Waals semiconductors. Our results show that the arrays of topology-optimized dielectric cavities are a versatile, scalable platform for controlling excitonic emission and interactions, which creates new opportunities in nonlinear optics, optoelectronics, and quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Position-Blind Ptychography: Viability of image reconstruction via data-driven variational inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present and investigate the novel blind inverse problem of position-blind ptychography, i.e., ptychographic phase retrieval without any knowledge of scan positions, which then must be recovered jointly with the image. The motivation for this problem comes from single-particle diffractive X-ray imaging, where particles in random orientations are illuminated and a set of diffraction patterns is collected. If one uses a highly focused X-ray beam, the measurements would also become sensitive to the beam positions relative to each particle and therefore ptychographic, but these positions are also unknown. We investigate the viability of image reconstruction in a simulated, simplified 2-D variant of this difficult problem, using variational inference with modern data-driven image priors in the form of score-based diffusion models. We find that, with the right illumination structure and a strong prior, one can achieve reliable and successful image reconstructions even under measurement noise, in all except the most difficult evaluated imaging scenario.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg Scaling in a Continuous-Wave Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-wave (CW) interferometry has stood at the frontier of precision measurement science since its inception, where it was used to search for the luminiferous ether, to the present day, where it forms the basis of interferometric gravitational-wave detection. Quantum theory predicts that this frontier can be expanded more rapidly by employing certain quantum resources, compared with the case of using only classical resources. In the quantum case, we can achieve ``Heisenberg scaling'', which manifests as a quadratic improvement over the best possible classical precision scaling. Although Heisenberg scaling has been demonstrated in pulsed operation, it has not been demonstrated for continuous operation. The challenge in doing so is two-fold: continuous measurements capable of Heisenberg scaling were previously unknown, and the requisite CW quantum states are fragile. Here we overcome these challenges and demonstrate the first CW interferometer exhibiting resource efficiency approaching Heisenberg scaling. Our scheme comprises a Mach-Zehnder interferometer illuminated with a pair of squeezed light sources, followed by a nonlinear estimator of the output homodyne record to estimate a differential phase modulation signal that drives the interferometer. We observe that this signal can be extracted with a precision that scales faster than what is allowed classically, and approaches the Heisenberg scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of boson sampling as a hardware accelerator for monte carlo integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental demonstration of boson sampling as a hardware accelerator for Monte Carlo integration. Our approach leverages importance sampling to factorize an integrand into a distribution that can be sampled using quantum hardware and a function that can be evaluated classically, enabling hybrid quantum-classical computation. We argue that for certain classes of integrals, this method offers a quantum advantage by efficiently sampling from probability distributions that are hard to simulate classically. We also identify structural criteria that must be satisfied to preserve computational hardness, notably the sensitivity of the classical post-processing function to high-order quantum correlations. To validate our protocol, we implement a proof-of-principle experiment on a programmable photonic platform to compute the first-order energy correction of a three-boson system in a harmonic trap under an Efimov-inspired three-body perturbation. The experimental results are consistent with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations, with deviations explained by photon distinguishability, discretization, and unitary imperfections. Additionally, we provide an error budget quantifying the impact of these same sources of noise. Our work establishes a concrete use case for near-term photonic quantum devices and highlights a viable path toward practical quantum advantage in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Electric-field control of pure spin photocurrent in germanene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrical control of pure spin current remains a central challenge in spintronics, particularly in time-reversal symmetric systems composed of nonmagnetic elements, where spin and electric fields interact only indirectly. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for electrically tuning pure spin photocurrent in two-dimensional materials with time-reversal symmetry via a gate electric field. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that in systems with spin-orbit coupling and in-plane mirror symmetry, an out-of-plane electric field induces spin splitting and reversal in the band structure near the Fermi energy, enabling magnitude control and direction reversal of the pure spin photocurrent. To validate this mechanism, we perform first-principles calculations on germanene, an experimentally realized two-dimensional material. Beyond amplitude modulation, we reveal that reversing the direction of the applied electric field leads to a corresponding reversal of the pure spin photocurrent. Furthermore, we show that the pure spin photocurrent can be tuned by varying the photon energy and the incident angle of light, providing additional degrees of control over spin transport. These findings establish a robust strategy for electric-field-controlled pure spin transport in two-dimensional materials, offering new possibilities for the development of optospintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Field-tuning of ultrafast magnetization fluctuations in Sm$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$FeO$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of spin fluctuations in antiferromagnets are largely unexplored, in particular at ultrafast timescales. Here, we employ femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) to experimentally study magnetization fluctuations in the canted antiferromagnet Sm$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$FeO$_{3}$ across its spin reorientation transition and under external magnetic fields. By comparing our measurements to atomistic spin noise and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the amplitude of the spin noise is governed by the free energy, with stronger fluctuations in regions where the potential landscape softens. We furthermore demonstrate that external magnetic fields suppress spin fluctuations and enhance the quasi-ferromagnetic magnon frequency by effectively stiffening the potential. These results highlight an effective route for tuning ultrafast magnetization fluctuations via external parameters.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction of Photons for Quantum Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, is vital for the realization of, e.g., quantum networks, distributed quantum computing, and quantum repeaters. The microwave-to-optical quantum transduction is of particular interest in the field of superconducting quantum computing, since interconnecting dilution refrigerators is considered inevitable for realizing large-scale quantum computers with fault-tolerance. In this review, we overview recent theoretical and experimental studies on the quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons. We describe a generic theory for the quantum transduction employing the input-output formalism, from which the essential quantities characterizing the transduction, i.e., the expressions for the transduction efficiency, the added noise, and the transduction bandwidth are derived. We review the major transduction methods that have been experimentally demonstrated, focusing the transduction via the optomechanical effect, the electro-optic effect, the magneto-optic effect, and the atomic ensembles. We also briefly review the recent experimental progress on the quantum transduction from superconducting qubit to optical photon, which is an important step toward the quantum state transfer between distant superconducting qubits interconnected over optical fibers.</description>

      <title>Deterministic single-photon source over the terahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic single-photon source in the terahertz (THz) regime, triggered by a sequence of coherent optical pulses. The scheme leverages the permanent dipole moment of a single-polar quantum emitter to induce THz transitions between optically dressed states, enhanced by a resonant coupling to a hybrid THz cavity. We present a cavity design that delivers high efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability while also enabling easy tunability of the emission frequency across the THz range. A key challenge in this new class of dressed-state sources is that, unlike standard solid-state single-photon sources, the dressed nature of the transitions can lead to undesired optical repumping during emission due to spontaneous photon emission in the visible range, which reduces the purity of the THz single-photon state. We show that this issue can be mitigated through optimized pulse areas and a sufficiently high Purcell rate, criteria that are met by our proposed cavity design. Finally, we demonstrate the significant purity enhancement of postselected THz photons by means of optical heralding, illustrating the new opportunities unlocked by the unique integration of terahertz and visible technologies with dressed polar quantum emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In its beginnings, the physics of intense laser-matter interactions was the physics of multiphoton processes. The theory was reduced then to high-order perturbation theory, while treating matter and light in a quantum manner. With the advent of chirped pulse amplification developed by D. Strickland and G. Mourou, which enabled generation of ultra-intense, ultra-short, coherent laser pulses, the need for a quantum electrodynamics description of electromagnetic (EM) fields practically ceased to exist and lost relevance. Contemporary attoscience (AS), and more generally ultrafast laser physics, awarded the Nobel Prize in 2023 to P. Agostini, F. Krausz, and A. L'Huillier, commonly uses the classical description of EM fields while keeping a fully quantum description of matter. The progress and successes of AS in the last 40 years have been spectacular, with an enormous amount of fascinating investigations in basic research and technology. Yet a central question remains: can ultrafast laser physics continue to advance without reintroducing quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics into its description of light-matter interactions? This article discusses future perspectives at the intersection of strong-field physics and quantum optics.</description>

Abstract: Digital micromirror devices have gained popularity in wavefront shaping, offering a high frame rate alternative to liquid crystal spatial light modulators. They are relatively inexpensive, offer high resolution, are easy to operate, and a single device can be used in a broad optical bandwidth. However, some technical drawbacks must be considered to achieve optimal performance. These issues, often undocumented by manufacturers, mostly stem from the device's original design for video projection applications. Herein, we present a guide to characterize and mitigate these effects. Our focus is on providing simple and practical solutions that can be easily incorporated into a typical wavefront shaping setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new "subpixel-smoothed projection" (SSP) formulation for differentiable binarization in topology optimization (TopOpt) as a drop-in replacement for previous projection schemes, which suffer from near-non-differentiability and slow convergence as binarization improves. Our new algorithm overcomes these limitations by depending on both the underlying filtered design field and its spatial gradient, instead of the filtered design field alone. We can now smoothly transition between density-based TopOpt (in which topology can easily change during optimization) and a level-set method (in which shapes evolve in an almost-everywhere binarized structure). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several photonics inverse-design problems and for a variety of computational methods (finite difference, Fourier-modal, and finite-element methods). SSP exhibits both faster convergence and greater simplicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel measurement method for the phase noise measurement of optical amplifiers, topologically similar to the Heterodyne Mach-Zehnder Interferometer but governed by different principles, and we report on the measurement of a fibered amplifier at 1.55 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength. The amplifier under test (DUT) is inserted in one arm of a symmetrical Mach-Zehnder interferometer, with an AOM in the other arm. We measure the phase noise of the RF beat detected at the Mach-Zehnder output. The phase noise floor of the amplifier decreases proportionally to the reciprocal of the laser power at the amplifier input, down to $-125$ $\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=100$ $\mathrm{kHz}$. The DUT flicker noise cannot be measured because it is lower than the background of the setup. This sets an upper bound of the amplifier noise at $-32$ $\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=1$ $\mathrm{Hz}$, which corresponds to a frequency stability of $5.2{\times}10^{-17}/\tau$ (Allan deviation), where $\tau$ is the integration time. Such noise level is lower than that of most Fabry-Perot cavity-stabilized lasers. These results are of interest in a wide range of applications including metrology, instrumentation, optical communications, or fiber links.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narrow linewidth stabilized lasers are central to precision applications that operate across the visible to short-wave infrared wavelengths, including optical clocks, quantum sensing and computing, ultra-low noise microwave generation, and fiber sensing. Today, these spectrally pure sources are realized using multiple external cavity tabletop lasers locked to bulk-optic free-space reference cavities. Integration of this technology will enable portable precision applications with improved reliability and robustness. Here, we report wavelength-flexible design and operation, over more than an octave span, of an integrated coil-resonator-stabilized Brillouin laser architecture. Leveraging a versatile two-stage noise reduction approach, we achieve low linewidths and high stability with chip-scale laser designs based on the ultra-low-loss, CMOS-compatible silicon nitride platform. We report operation at 674 and 698 nm for applications to strontium neutral and trapped-ion clocks, quantum sensing and computing, and at 1550 nm for applications to fiber sensing and ultra-low phase noise microwave generation. Over this range we demonstrate frequency noise reduction from 1 Hz to 10 MHz resulting in 1.0 Hz -17 Hz fundamental and 181 Hz - 630 Hz integral linewidths and an Allan deviation of 6.5 x 10-13 at 1 ms for 674 nm, 6.0 x 10-13 at 15 ms for 698 nm, and 2.6 x10-13 at 15 ms for 1550 nm. This represents the lowest achieved linewidths and highest stability for integrated stabilized Brillouin lasers over an order of magnitude improvement in operating wavelength range. These results unlock the potential of integrated, ultra-low-phase-noise stabilized lasers for precision applications and further integration in systems-on-chip solutions.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-scale noise-resistant on-chip spectrometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performant on-chip spectrometers are important for advancing sensing technologies, from environmental monitoring to biomedical diagnostics. As device footprints approach the scale of the operating wavelength, previously strategies, including those relying on multiple scattering in diffusive media, face fundamental accuracy constraints tied to limited optical path lengths. Here, we demonstrate a wavelength-scale, CMOS-compatible on-chip spectrometer that overcomes this challenge by exploiting inverse-designed quasinormal modes in a complex photonic resonator. These modes extend the effective optical path length beyond the physical device dimensions, producing highly de-correlated spectral responses. We show that this strategy is theoretically optimal for minimizing spectral reconstruction error in the presence of measurement noise. The fabricated spectrometer occupies a lateral footprint of only 3.5 times the free-space operating wavelength, with a spectral resolution of 10 nm across the 3.59-3.76 micrometer mid-infrared band, which is suitable for molecular sensing. The design of this miniaturized noise-resistant spectrometer is readily extensible to other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, paving the way for lab-on-a-chip devices, chemical sensors, and other applications.</description>

      <title>Six-telescope integrated optics beam combiner fabricated using ultrafast laser inscription for J- and H-band astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have built and characterized the first six-telescope discrete beam combiner (DBC) for stellar interferometry in the astronomical J-band. It is the DBC with the largest number of beam combinations and was manufactured using ultrafast laser inscription (ULI) in borosilicate glass, with a throughput of approximately 56%. For calibration of the visibility-to-pixel matrix (V2PM), we use a two-input Michelson interferometer and extract the complex visibility. A visibility amplitude of 1.05 and relative precision of 2.9% and 3.8% are extracted for 1328 nm and 1380 nm, respectively. Broadband (&lt; 40 nm) characterization is affected by dispersion, but shows similar performance.</description>

      <title>Topological protection breakdown: a route to frustrated ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14646v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phases manifesting topological patterns in functional systems, like ferroelectric and ferromagnetic vortex superlattices, can manifest intricate and apparently ungovernable behavior, typical of frustrated non-ergodic states with high-dimensional energy landscapes. This is also the case for potassium-tantalate-niobate (KTN) crystals. These transparent ferroelectrics manifest remarkable but little-understood metastable domain patterns at optical (micrometer and above) scales near the cubic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition. Here, we formulate the Topological Breakdown Model based on the competition between intrinsic scales of domain-domain collinear and non-collinear interactions associated with polarization-charge screening. The model is able to explain observed KTN mesoscopic domain patterns and phase diagram as a function of temperature and external electric field. Findings include a precise set of sharp and broad percolative transitions that are experimentally verified, validating our model. Our study identifies the central role played by competing topologically protected states, identifying a fundamental link between topological protection and frustration that supports a hitherto unexplored functional non-ergodic arena.</description>

      <title>Sharing quantum nonlocality and teleportation over long distance using optical hybrid states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze sharing Bell-type nonlocal correlation between two distant parties with optical hybrid states comprising a single photon polarization state and a multiphoton coherent state. By deploying entanglement swapping over the coherent state parts at the middle station, we show that the optical hybrid states can efficiently generate a polarization-entangled state that violates Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell-inequality well over a metropolitan distance. We further assess the quality of the shared entangled state in the information processing task of quantum teleportation of an unknown polarization qubit. Our results with realistic devices, embedding detection inefficiency and transmission losses, indicate the viability of faithful quantum teleportation over large distances, consistent with the quality of the shared correlation.</description>

      <title>Universal dissipators for driven open quantum systems and the correction to linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is composed of two parts. One is universal, meaning that it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term. This form constitutes the relevant part of the dissipator only as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. Then, by considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we derive the other, drive-dependent, term completing the full dissipator. This part of the dissipator, originating from the third cumulant, is usually neglected when modeling the decoherent dynamics of controlled qubits. However, this further term constitutes the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative quantum systems. Also, it notably shows that the structure of our quantum master equation goes beyond the Lindblad form. The Lindblad form is recovered for memory-less baths. Finally, we demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudo-modes for quantum environments.</description>
