      <title>Real-time dynamics from convex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum-mechanical system comes naturally equipped with a convex space: each (Hermitian) operator has a (real) expectation value, and the expectation value of the square any Hermitian operator must be non-negative. This space is of exponential (e.g.~in volume) dimension, but low-dimensional projections can be efficiently explored by standard algorithms. Such approaches have been used to precisely constrain critical exponents of conformal field theories ("conformal bootstrap") and, more recently, to constrain the ground state physics of various quantum-mechanical systems, including lattice field theories. In this talk we discuss related approaches to systematically constraining the real-time dynamics of quantum systems, which are otherwise obstructed from study by sign problems and the ill-posed nature of analytic continuation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy by tensor renormalization group approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on tensor renormalization group calculations of entanglement entropy in one-dimensional quantum systems. The reduced density matrix of a Gibbs state can be represented as a $1 + 1$-dimensional tensor network, which is analogous to the tensor network representation of the partition function. The HOTRG method is used to approximate the reduced density matrix for arbitrary subsystem sizes, from which we obtain the entanglement entropy. We test our method in the quantum Ising model and obtain the entanglement entropy of the ground state by taking the size of time direction to infinity. The central charge $c$ is obtained as $c = 0.49997(8)$ for a bond dimension $D=96$, which agrees with the theoretical value $c=1/2$ within the error.</description>

      <title>Exploring Generative Networks for Manifolds with Non-Trivial Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expressive power of neural networks in modelling non-trivial distributions can in principle be exploited to bypass topological freezing and critical slowing down in simulations of lattice field theories. Some popular approaches are unable to sample correctly non-trivial topology, which may lead to some classes of configurations not being generated. In this contribution, we present a novel generative method inspired by a model previously introduced in the ML community (GFlowNets). We demonstrate its efficiency at exploring ergodically configuration manifolds with non-trivial topology through applications such as triple ring models and two-dimensional lattice scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>$O(a)$-improved QCD+QED Wilson Dirac operator on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations of lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are the only known tool to investigate non-perturbatively the theory of the strong interaction and are required to perform precision tests of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. As the Markov Chain is a serial process, the sole option for improving the sampling rate is accelerating each individual update step. Heterogeneous clusters of GPU-accelerated nodes offer large total memory bandwidth which can be used to speed-up our application, openQxD-1.1, which is dominated by inversions of the Dirac operator, a large sparse matrix. In this work we investigate offloading the inversion to GPU using the lattice-QCD library QUDA, and our early results demonstrate a significant potential speed-up in the time-to-solution for state-of-the-art problem sizes. Minimal extensions to the existing QUDA library are required for our specific physics programme while greatly enhancing the performance portability of our code and retaining the reliability and robustness of existing applications in openQxD-1.1. Our new interface will enable us to utilize pre-exascale infrastructure and reduce the systematic uncertainty in our physics predictions by incorporating the effects of quantum electromagnetism (QED) in our simulations.</description>

      <title>Update on Glueballs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent BESIII announcement of a pseudoscalar glueball candidate makes an update on glueballs from lattice QCD timely. A brief review of how glueballs are studied in lattice QCD is given, and the reasons that glueballs are difficult to study both in lattice QCD with dynamical quarks and in experiments are outlined. Recent glueball studies in lattice QCD are then presented, and an exploratory investigation of the scalar glueball using glueball, meson, and meson-meson operators is summarized, suggesting that no scalar state below 2 GeV or so can be considered to be predominantly a glueball state.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature QCD crossover at non-zero chemical potential: A Dyson-Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study QCD at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential to derive the critical temperature at the chiral phase transition (crossover). We solve a set of Dyson--Schwinger partial differential equations using the exact solution for the Yang--Mills quantum field theory based on elliptical functions. Assuming a Nambu-Jona--Lasino (NJL) model of the quarks, we obtain a very good agreement with recent lattice computations regarding the dependence of the critical temperature on the strong coupling scale. The solution depends on a single scale parameter, as typical for the theory and already known from studies about asymptotic freedom. The analysis is analytically derived directly from QCD.</description>

      <title>Large fluctuations in NSPT computations: a lesson from $O(N)$ non-linear sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last three decades, Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory (NSPT) has proven to be an excellent tool for calculating perturbative expansions in theories such as Lattice QCD, for which standard, diagrammatic perturbation theory is known to be cumbersome. Despite the significant success of this stochastic method and the improvements made in recent years, NSPT apparently cannot be successfully implemented in low-dimensional models due to the emergence of huge statistical fluctuations: as the perturbative order gets higher, the signal to noise ratio is simply not good enough. This does not come as a surprise, but on very general grounds, one would expect that the larger the number of degrees of freedom, the less severe the fluctuations will be. By simulating $2D$ $O(N)$ non-linear sigma models for different values of $N$, we show that indeed the fluctuations are tamed in the large $N$ limit, meeting our expectations: for a large number of internal degrees of freedom (i.e. for large enough $N$), NSPT perturbative computation can be pushed to large perturbative orders $n$. By re-expressing our perturbative expansions as power series in the $gN$ ('t Hooft) coupling, we show some evidence that at any given order $n$ there is a tendency to gaussianity for the stochastic process distributions at large $N$. By summing our series, we can verify leading order results for the energy and its (field theoretic) variance in the large $N$ limit. We finally establish general relationships between the various perturbative orders in the expansion of the (field theoretic) variance of a given observable and combinations of variances and covariances of given orders NSPT stochastic processes. Having established all this, we conclude discussing interesting applications of NSPT computations in the context of theories similar to $O(N)$ (i.e. $CP(N-1)$ models).</description>

      <title>Moments of Axial-Vector GPD from Lattice QCD: Quark Helicity, Orbital Angular Momentum, and Spin-Orbit Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the Mellin moments of the twist-2 axial-vector generalized parton distribution (GPD), $\widetilde{H}(x,\xi,t)$, at zero skewness, $\xi$, with multiple values of the momentum transfer, $t$. Our analysis employs the short-distance factorization framework on ratio-scheme renormalized quasi-GPD matrix elements. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermions ensemble with clover improvement, a lattice spacing of $a = 0.093$ fm, and a pion mass of $m_\pi = 260$ MeV. We consider both the iso-vector and iso-scalar cases, utilizing next-to-leading-order perturbative matching while omitting the disconnected contributions and gluon mixing in the iso-scalar case. For the first time, we determine the Mellin moments of $\widetilde{H}$ up to the fifth order. From these moments, we discuss the quark helicity and orbital angular momentum contributions to the nucleon spin, as well as the spin-orbit correlations of the quarks. Additionally, we perform a Fourier transform over the momentum transfer, which allows us to explore the spin structure in the impact-parameter space.</description>

      <title>Update of HPQCD $B_c\to J/\psi$ Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an update of our lattice QCD determination of the $B_c\to J/\psi$ vector and axial-vector form factors, including new results for the tensor form factors. We use the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action for all valence quarks, together with the second generation MILC $n_f=2+1+1$ HISQ gluon field configurations. This calculation includes two additional ensembles, one with physically light up and down quarks and $a\approx 0.06 \mathrm{fm}$ and one with $a\approx 0.03\mathrm{fm}$ on which we are able to reach the physical bottom quark mass. Our calculation uses nonperturbatively renormalised current operators and covers the full kinematical range of the decay. Our physical-continuum extrapolation utilises the full dispersive parameterisation for $B_c\to J/\psi$.</description>

      <title>Computing theta-dependent mass spectrum of the 2-flavor Schwinger model in the Hamiltonian formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the $\theta$-dependent mass spectrum of the 2-flavor Schwingr model using the tensor network (DMRG) in the Hamiltonian formalism. The pion and the sigma meson are identified as stable particles of the model for nonzero $\theta$ whereas the eta meson becomes unstable. The meson masses are obtained from the one-point functions, using the meson operators defined by diagonalizing the correlation matrix to deal with the operator mixing. We also compute the dispersion relation directly by measuring the energy and momentum of the excited states, where the mesons are distinguished by the isospin quantum number. We confirmed that the meson masses computed by these methods agree with each other and are consistent with the calculation by the bosonized model. Our methods are free from the sign problem and show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to the conventional Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, at the critical point $\theta = \pi$, the mesons become almost massless, and the one-point functions reproduce the expected CFT-like behavior.</description>
