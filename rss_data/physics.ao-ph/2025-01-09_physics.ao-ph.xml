      <title>MERCURY: A fast and versatile multi-resolution based global emulator of compound climate hazards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-impact climate damages are often driven by compounding climate conditions. For example, elevated heat stress conditions can arise from a combination of high humidity and temperature. To explore future changes in compounding hazards under a range of climate scenarios and with large ensembles, climate emulators can provide light-weight, data-driven complements to Earth System Models. Yet, only a few existing emulators can jointly emulate multiple climate variables. In this study, we present the Multi-resolution EmulatoR for CompoUnd climate Risk analYsis: MERCURY. MERCURY extends multi-resolution analysis to a spatio-temporal framework for versatile emulation of multiple variables. MERCURY leverages data-driven, image compression techniques to generate emulations in a memory-efficient manner. MERCURY consists of a regional component that represents the monthly, regional response of a given variable to yearly Global Mean Temperature (GMT) using a probabilistic regression based additive model, resolving regional cross-correlations. It then adapts a reverse lifting-scheme operator to jointly spatially disaggregate regional, monthly values to grid-cell level. We demonstrate MERCURY's capabilities on representing the humid-heat metric, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature, as derived from temperature and relative humidity emulations. The emulated WBGT spatial correlations correspond well to those of ESMs and the 95% and 97.5% quantiles of WBGT distributions are well captured, with an average of 5% deviation. MERCURY's setup allows for region-specific emulations from which one can efficiently "zoom" into the grid-cell level across multiple variables by means of the reverse lifting-scheme operator. This circumvents the traditional problem of having to emulate complete, global-fields of climate data and resulting storage requirements.</description>

      <title>Data fusion of complementary data sources using Machine Learning enables higher accuracy Solar Resource Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we collect solar irradiance and atmospheric condition data from several products, obtained from both numerical models (ERA5 and NORA3) and satellite observations (CMSAF-SARAH3). We then train simple supervised Machine Learning (ML) data fusion models, using these products as predictors and direct in-situ Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) measurements over Norway as ground-truth. We show that combining these products by applying our trained ML models provides a GHI estimate that is significantly more accurate than that obtained from any product taken individually. Using the trained models, we generate a 30-year ML-corrected map of GHI over Norway, which we release as a new open data product. Our ML-based data fusion methodology could be applied, after suitable training and input data selection, to any geographic area on Earth.</description>

      <title>A numerical toy model of Langevin dynamics provides real-time visualization of colloidal microdroplet evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed and tested a simplified but versatile numerical model of nanoparticles' aggregation using Langevin dynamics. The model is particularly capable of simulating aggregation in an evaporating (or condensing) microdroplet. It runs on a graphics processing unit (GPU), which makes it sufficiently fast for real-time conceptualization tasks. We have verified the results of modeling against the findings from two types of experiments we conducted in electrodynamic traps. Firstly, our model helped us to elucidate the phenomenon of scattering `revival', often observed during the evaporation of composite microdroplets. Further on, we were able to mimic our experiments, in which the microdroplets were dried up to form nanoparticle (NP) aggregates, and then soft-landed. Thus we could compare model predictions with SEM imaging. The model was tested for up to $2.5\times 10^5$ nanoparticles of several coexisting types. Several types of interactions can be accounted for: inter-particle: Lennard-Jones and Coulomb; external: dispersion medium viscosity, centrifugal force, gravity, surface tension, and interface movement. Brownian motion of nanoparticles can be freely controlled. The core program is accompanied by scripts extracting statistical NP aggregates properties in post-processing -- fractal dimension and radial distribution functions. The codes are made available in public repositories. Several diverse evolution scenarios are presented.</description>

      <title>How to derive skill from the Fractions Skill Score</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fractions Skill Score (FSS) is a widely used metric for assessing forecast skill, with applications ranging from precipitation to volcanic ash forecasts. By evaluating the fraction of grid squares exceeding a threshold in a neighbourhood, the intuition is that it can avoid the pitfalls of pixel-wise comparisons and identify length scales at which a forecast has skill. The FSS is typically interpreted relative to a `useful' criterion, where a forecast is considered skillful if its score exceeds a simple reference score. However, the typical reference score used is problematic, as it is not derived in a way that provides obvious meaning or that scales with neighbourhood size, and forecasts that do not exceed it can have considerable skill. We therefore provide a new method to determine forecast skill from the FSS, by deriving an expression for the FSS achieved by a random forecast, which provides a more robust and meaningful reference score to compare with. Through illustrative examples we show that this new method considerably changes the length scales at which a forecast would be regarded as skillful, and reveals subtleties in how the FSS should be interpreted.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Shorter-term Radiative Forcings of Aerosols and Ozone to Global Warming in the Last Two Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports observations of regional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface temperature, as well as various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs), ozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent (SIE). We strikingly found warming trends of 0.77(+/-0.57) and 0.69(+/-0.22) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and Antarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since 2002. These UST trends provide fingerprints of decreasing and no significant trends in total GHG effect in polar and non-polar regions respectively. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of surface cooling trends in both the Antarctic since 2005 and the Arctic since 2016 once the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes, which causes the recent rise in global mean surface temperature (GMST). These temperature changing patterns are consistent with the characteristics of the cosmic-ray-driven electron reaction (CRE) mechanism of halogen-containing GHGs (halo-GHGs) with larger destruction rates at higher latitudes. Moreover, the no-parameter physics model of warming caused by halo-GHGs reproduces closely the observed GMSTs from 2000 to 2024, including the almost no warming during 2000-2012 and the significant warming by 0.2-0.3 deg C during 2013-2023, of which 0.27 deg C was calculated to arise from the net radiative forcing of aerosols and ozone due to improved air quality. The results also show that the physics model captures 76% of the variance in the observed GMSTs, exhibiting a warming peak in October 2023 and predicting a gradual GMST reversal thereafter. The results from this study may greatly improve our understanding of global climate change and lead to the identifying of the correct major culprit for human contribution to changing the climate.</description>

      <title>A Mechanism of Stochastic Synchronization in the Climate System: an Interpretation of the Boundary Current Synchronization as a Maxwell's Demon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study has applied information thermodynamics to a bivariate linear stochastic differential equation (SDE) that describes a synchronization phenomenon of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) between the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current, which is referred to as the boundary current synchronization (BCS). Information thermodynamics divides the entire system fluctuating with stochastic noise into subsystems and describes the interactions between these subsystems from the perspective of information transfer. The SDE coefficients have been estimated through regression analysis using observational and numerical simulation data. In the absence of stochastic noise, the solution of the estimated SDE shows that the SSTs relax toward zero without oscillation. The estimated SDE can be interpreted as a Maxwell's demon system, with the Gulf Stream playing the role of the "Particle" and the Kuroshio Current playing the role of the "Demon." The Gulf Stream forces the SST of the Kuroshio Current to be in phase. By contrast, the Kuroshio Current maintains the phase by interfering with the relaxation of the Gulf Stream SST. In the framework of Maxwell's demon, the Gulf Stream is measured by the Kuroshio Current, whereas the Kuroshio Current performs feedback control on the Gulf Stream. When the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current are coupled in an appropriate parameter regime, synchronization is realized with atmospheric and oceanic fluctuations as the driving source. This new mechanism, "stochastic synchronization," suggests that such fluctuations can be converted into directional variations in a subsystem of the climate system through synchronization by utilizing information (i.e., information-to-energy conversion).</description>
