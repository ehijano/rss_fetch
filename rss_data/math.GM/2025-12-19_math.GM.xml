      <title>Representation Of Integers By Sum Of Three Cubes, A New Approach Based On Seed Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have proved in this paper that numbers can be expressed in algebraic form using one variable and two real rational quantities and thus sum of three cubes can also be expressed in algebraic form as a cubic polynomial. Using skeletal or seed equation, the polynomial can be transformed into a quadratic equation. A seed equation denotes a simple equation that represents a given integer as sum of three cubes including 0, for example, a seed equation for integer 2 is 1 cubed plus 1 cubed plus 0 cubed. Resultant quadratic equation can further be transformed into a linear equation which yields value of the variable and substitution of the value of the variable into the algebraic form of numbers results in the required solution. Notwithstanding, finding a single set of three cubes, we have found, using this approach, multiple sets of cubes. We have also given parametrisation for such cubes. Cases, where it is difficult or not possible to determine a seed equation, alternate method has been provided. Methods used are unattempted, innovative and easily comprehensible.</description>

      <title>Normalized Remainders: Definition, Origins, Backgrounds, Recent Results, and Basic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, the author retrospects the ins and outs of the concept of the normalized remainders of the Maclaurin power series expansions of functions, reviews main results on normalized remainders of some elementary functions since 2023, explores the historic backgrounds of the normalized remainders in combinatorics and number theory on the Bernoulli numbers and polynomials, the Stirling numbers and polynomials, and their generalizations by Broder, Carlitz, and Howard, presents several basic properties of normalized remainders, and collects several guesses and problems posed while investigating normalized remainders of several elementary functions.</description>

      <title>A Fuzzy Geometric Study of Equidistant Sets in Fuzzy Metric Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the fuzzy Hausdorff distance is studied, and also the fuzzy equidistant set for two points of a fuzzy metric space is introduced. Here, the fuzzy metric space has been redefined using recently developed fuzzy geometry, and the equidistant sets have been constructed for two different fuzzy points. Different cases for the equidistant sets have been studied, considering two fuzzy points with separate spreads, externally tangent spreads, partially overlapping spreads, internally tangent spreads, fully overlapping spreads, and sets that coincide with the cores of fuzzy points. The proposed construction provides a graded equidistant set that aligns with the classical midset when the metric is precise. Suitable numerical and pictorial examples are given to support the discussions and studies.</description>
