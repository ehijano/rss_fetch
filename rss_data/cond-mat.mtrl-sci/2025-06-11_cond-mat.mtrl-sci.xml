      <title>GPa Pressure Imaging Using Nanodiamond Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate wide-field optical microscopy of the pressure distribution at approximately 20 GPa in a diamond anvil cell (DAC), using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds (NDs) as quantum sensors. Pressure and non-hydrostaticity maps are obtained by fitting optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra with models incorporating hydrostatic and uniaxial stress conditions. Two methods for introducing NDs with a pressure-transmitting medium are compared, revealing that the embedding approach affects the degree of non-hydrostaticity. This ND-based technique offers a powerful imaging platform for probing pressure-induced phenomena and is extendable to other physical quantities such as magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Tip-Based Proximity Ferroelectric Switching and Piezoelectric Response in Wurtzite Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity is a novel paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material, which is unswitchable with an external field below the dielectric breakdown field, becomes a practically switchable ferroelectric in direct contact with a thin switchable ferroelectric layer. Here, we develop a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach to study the proximity effect of local piezoelectric response and polarization reversal in wurtzite ferroelectric multilayers under a sharp electrically biased tip. Using finite element modeling we analyze the probe-induced nucleation of nanodomains, the features of local polarization hysteresis loops and coercive fields in the Al1-xScxN/AlN bilayers and three-layers. Similar to the wurtzite multilayers sandwiched between two parallel electrodes, the regimes of "proximity switching" (where the multilayers collectively switch) and the regime of "proximity suppression" (where they collectively do not switch) are the only two possible regimes in the probe-electrode geometry. However, the parameters and asymmetry of the local piezo-response and polarization hysteresis loops depend significantly on the sequence of the layers with respect to the probe. The physical mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity in the local probe geometry is a depolarizing electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness. The field, whose direction is opposite to the polarization vector in the layer(s) with the larger spontaneous polarization (such as AlN), renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier in the "otherwise unswitchable" polar layers. Tip-based control of domains in otherwise non-ferroelectric layers using proximity ferroelectricity can provide nanoscale control of domain reversal in memory, actuation, sensing and optical applications.</description>

      <title>Electron mobility in AlN from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum nitride is a promising ultra-wide band gap semiconductor for optoelectronics and power electronics. However, its practical applications have been limited by challenges with doping and achieving high electrical conductivity. Recent advances in crystal quality and defect control have led to improvements in experimentally measured mobilities. In this work, we apply first-principles calculations to determine the upper limits of the electron mobility in AlN as a function of temperature, doping, and crystallographic orientation. We account for the combined effects of electron scattering by phonons and ionized impurity to model doped systems, and examine both full and partial ionization conditions. Our results show that the piezoelectric interaction from the long-range component of the acoustic modes is the dominant source of electron-phonon scattering at room temperature. Ionized-impurity scattering starts to dominate scattering at dopant concentrations above $10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$, reducing the mobility by more than an order of magnitude in the high doping regime. Our calculated Hall mobility values are in good agreement with experimental data for samples with comparable dopant concentrations. We also find that electron mobilities as high as $956$ cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s could be achievable at lower dopant concentrations.</description>

      <title>Aluminum oxide coatings on Co-rich cathodes and interactions with organic electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become essential in modern energy storage; however, their performance is often limited by the stability and efficiency of their components, particularly the cathode and electrolyte. Transition metal layered oxide cathodes, a popular choice for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), suffer from several degradation mechanisms, including capacity fading, reactions with the electrolyte, unstable cathode-electrolyte interfaces, and lattice breakdown during cycling. In recent years, oxide coating, such as alumina, has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the durability of cathodes by forming a protective layer that mitigates detrimental reactions and improves the stability of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). This study employs ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the chemical and mechanical behavior of LiCoO2 cathodes with and without aluminum oxide coatings in contact with an organic electrolyte. We examine the interactions between electrolyte molecules with both bare and coated cathode surfaces, focusing on the decomposition of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), the formation of oxygen species, and solvation dynamics, and evaluate the mechanical robustness of the cathode-coating interface using calculations of axial strain and cleavage energy. Our findings reveal that alumina coatings effectively reduce electrolyte degradation and stabilize the cathode structure, particularly under high-charge states. The coating's thickness and structural orientation are crucial in enhancing mechanical strength and minimizing detrimental reactions at the cathode-electrolyte interface. These insights contribute to the development of more durable LIBs by optimizing the interface chemistry and mechanical properties, providing a pathway toward higher energy densities and longer cycle life.</description>

      <title>Comparing classical and machine learning force fields for modeling deformation of solid sorbents relevant for direct air capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct air capture (DAC) with solid sorbents such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a promising approach for negative carbon emissions. Computational materials screening can help identify promising materials from the vast chemical space of potential sorbents. Experiments have shown that MOF framework flexibility and deformation induced by adsorbate molecules can drastically affect adsorption properties such as capacity and selectivity. Force field (FF) models are commonly used as surrogates for more accurate density functional theory (DFT) calculations when modeling sorbents, but most studies using FFs for MOFs assume framework rigidity to simplify calculations. Although flexible FFs for MOFs have been parameterized for specific materials, the generality of FFs for reliably modeling adsorbate-induced deformation to near-DFT accuracy has not been established. This work benchmarks the efficacy of several general FFs in describing adsorbate-induced deformation for DAC against DFT. Specifically, we compare a common classical FF (UFF4MOF) with several machine learning (ML) FFs: M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE-MP-0, MACE-MPA-0, eSEN, and the Equiformer V2 model developed from the recent Open DAC 2023 dataset. Our results show that current classical methods are insufficient for describing framework deformation, especially in cases of interest for DAC where strong interactions exist between adsorbed molecules and MOF frameworks. The emerging ML methods we tested -- particularly CHGNet, MACE-MP-0, and Equiformer V2 -- appear to be more promising than the classical FF for emulating the deformation behavior described by DFT but fail to achieve the accuracy required for practical predictions.</description>

      <title>Surrogate models to optimize plasma assisted atomic layer deposition in high aspect ratio features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore surrogate models to optimize plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) in high aspect ratio features. In plasma-based processes such as PEALD and atomic layer etching, surface recombination can dominate the reactivity of plasma species with the surface, which can lead to unfeasibly long exposure times to achieve full conformality inside nanostructures like high aspect ratio vias. Using a synthetic dataset based on simulations of PEALD, we train artificial neural networks to predict saturation times based on cross section thickness data obtained for partially coated conditions. The results obtained show that just two experiments in undersaturated conditions contain enough information to predict saturation times within 10% of the ground truth. A surrogate model trained to determine whether surface recombination dominates the plasma-surface interactions in a PEALD process achieves 99% accuracy. This demonstrates that machine learning can provide a new pathway to accelerate the optimization of PEALD processes in areas such as microelectronics. Our approach can be easily extended to atomic layer etching and more complex structures.</description>

      <title>Engineering topological phase transitions via sliding ferroelectricity in MBi2Te4 (M = Ge, Sn, Pb) bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials combining electrically switchable ferroelectricity and tunable topological states hold significant promise for advancing both foundamental quantum phenomena and innovative device architectures. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate the sliding ferroelectricity-mediated topological transitions in bilayer MBi2Te4 (M = Ge, Sn, Pb). By strategically engineering interlayer sliding configurations with oppositely polarized states, we demonstrate reversible band inversion accompanied by topological phase transitions. The calculated spin-orbit-coupled bandgaps reach 31 meV (GeBi2Te4), 36 meV (SnBi2Te4), and 35 meV (PbBi2Te4), thereby enabling room-temperature observation of the quantum spin Hall effect. Crucially, these systems exhibit substantial out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization magnitudes of 0.571-0.623 pC/m, with PbBi2Te4 showing the maximum polarization (0.623 pC/m). The topological nontriviality is unambiguously confirmed by two independent signatures: (i) the computed z2 topological invariant, and (ii) the emergence of gapless helical edge states spanning the bulk insulating gap. This synergy arises from the unique sliding-induced charge redistribution mechanism, which simultaneously modulates Berry curvature and breaks in-plane inversion symmetry without disrupting out-of-plane polarization stability. The co-engineering of non-volatile ferroelectric switching and topologically protected conduction channels in MBi2Te4 bilayers establishes a material paradigm for designing reconfigurable quantum devices, where electronic topology can be electrically controlled via polarization reversal. Our results provide critical insights into manipulating correlated quantum states in van der Waals ferroelectrics for multifunctional nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we explore the atomic number ($Z$) dependence of multislice electron ptychography and approaches to optimize Z sensitivity. Specifically, we show that ptychography's $Z$-dependence is highly dependent on the integrated area of an atom column considered. A monotonic $Z$-dependence is found when the reconstructed projected atomic potentials are integrated over a small region. When increasing the integration area, $Z$-contrast changes significantly, becoming highly non-monotonic and following trends in the orbital shell-structure. Moreover, the reconstructed projected potential aligns with the transmission function with an overall deviation of only 2.4\%. The non-monotonic $Z$-dependence is further shown to be useful to accentuate contrast between certain elements, allowing for distinguishability of elements that are only a single atomic number apart, and even in $&gt;$ 20 nm thick samples. This is demonstrated for $\beta$-CuZn ($Z$ = 29 and 30), with the differentiability between the elements explored for different signal quantification methods. The impact of electron dose and finite effective source size are also considered. These results demonstrate that the atom column integration area can optimize ptychographic $Z$-contrast for specific applications and experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of SrTiO$_3$ with Oxygen Vacancies using Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise analysis of point defects in solids requires accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of large-scale systems. However, ab initio MD simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) incur high computational cost, while classical MD simulations lack accuracy. We perform MD simulations using a neural network potential (NNP) model (NNP-MD) to predict the physical quantities of both pristine SrTiO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ in the presence of oxygen vacancies (V$_{\text{O}}$). To verify the accuracy of the NNP models trained on different data sets, their NNP-MD predictions are compared with the results obtained from DFT calculations. The predictions of the total energy show good agreement with the DFT results for all these NNP models, and the NNP models can also predict the formation energy once SrTiO$_3$:V$_{\text{O}}$ data are included in the training data sets. Even for larger supercell sizes that are difficult to calculate using first-principles calculations, the formation energies evaluated from the NNP-MD simulations well reproduce the extrapolated DFT values. This study offer important knowledge for constructing accurate NNP models to describe point-defect systems including SrTiO$_3$:V$_{\text{O}}$.</description>

      <title>Phase Evolution and Substrate-Dependent Nucleation of Quartz GeO$_2$ Films Grown by MOCVD on r- and c-Plane Sapphires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrawide-bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors, such as GeO$_2$, are gaining significant attention for their potential in high-performance applications, particularly in piezoelectric devices. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive understanding of the growth dynamics and phase evolution of GeO$_2$ films via metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) remains insufficient. In this study, we investigate the growth behavior and morphological evolution of GeO$_2$ thin films on r-plane and c-plane sapphire substrates for the MOCVD growth process. The temporal evolution of crystallization and the amorphous-to-quartz phase transition are systematically elucidated for the first time. As growth time increases, the spherulitic quartz patterns expand in size, and elevated growth temperatures are found to enhance the crystallization rate. Distinct morphological symmetries emerge depending on the substrate orientation: quadrangular patterns on r-plane sapphire and hexagonal patterns on c-plane sapphire. Atomic force microscopy reveals that these spherulitic domains exhibit pyramid-like surface topography, consistent with volumetric contraction during the amorphous-to-quartz phase transition. These findings offer new insights into the phase evolution and substrate-dependent crystallization behavior of GeO$_2$ films grown by MOCVD.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric control of bipolar magnetic semiconductor with room Curie temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of room-temperature tunable magnetic semiconductors is crucial for the advancement of low-power, high-performance information technologies. Using density functional theory calculations, we propose a series of two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors with critical temperature above room temperature, including three ferromagnetic and two antiferromagnetic semiconductors.Their stability is confirmed through phonon spectra, molecular dynamics simulations, and formation energy calculations. In particular, we demonstrate a ferromagnetic bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS), Cr2NiSe4, formed via Ni intercalation into bilayer CrSe2, which exhibits a 0.40 eV band gap and a Curie temperature of 352 K. Nonvolatile carrier spin polarization control in Cr2NiSe4 is achieved by switching the ferroelectric polarization of an Al2Se3 substrate. Switching the ferroelectric state of monolayer Al2Se3 induces a BMS-to-half-metal transition. Reversing the polarization of bilayer Al2Se3 yields a half-metallic Cr2NiSe4 with fully opposite carrier spin polarization. Furthermore, we propose a multiferroic nonvolatile memory design: write operations are controlled by the ferroelectric polarization state of bilayer Al2Se3, while read operations rely on detecting the distinct carrier spin polarizations of Cr2NiSe4. Our work reports a two dimensional BMS with Curie temperature above room temperature and presents a feasible strategy for its nonvolatile electrical control.</description>

      <title>Unusual Valence of Ru and Prediction of Magnetism, Anomalous Hall Conductivity in a Newly Synthesized Double Perovskite Compound Ca_2CoRuO_6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a goal to expand on the family of double perovskite compounds, hosting 3d transition metal and 4d or 5d transition metal, two new ordered double perovskite compounds, Ca$_2$FeRuO$_6$ and Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$ are synthesized following the prediction of a recent high throughput machine-learning study [Phys. Rev. Materials 3, 084418]. Experimentally both compounds are found to stabilize in monoclinic symmetry, which is consistent with the high-throughput prediction for Ca$_2$FeRuO$_6$, but at odd for Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$. Among the two synthesized compounds, the properties of Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$, investigated employing the first principles technique \textcolor{black}{and model Hamiltonian calculation}, appear promising. The monoclinic structured Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$ is found to stabilize unusual 6+ valence of Ru, and support a half-metallic ground state with uncompensated net moment. As \textcolor{black}{predicted} by our first-principles study, the finite spin-orbit coupling at the Ru site contributes to the non-trivial topology of the band structure of monoclinic Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$, resulting in a \textcolor{black}{moderately} large value of anomalous Hall conductivity. Our \textcolor{black}{theoretical predictions} should encourage further experimental investigation of this newly synthesized compound.</description>

      <title>Stability, electronic, magnetic and thermoelectric properties of quaternary Heusler alloys CoX'ZrAl (X'=V, Fe, Ir): 3d vs 5d systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermoelectric (TE) properties of quaternary Heusler alloys (CoX'ZrAl; X'= V, Fe, Ir) are studied in the framework of Density Functional Theory and Boltzmann Transport Theory. The compound CoVZrAl is found to be semiconducting and the most difficult to be formed whereas the easier formed newly-predicted CoFeZrAl and CoIrZrAl are pseudo-gapped and half-metal respectively. Ferromagnetic calculations show magnetism in CoVZrAl and CoIrZrAl originating from the non-bonding Co-X' fully-filled t1u state and partially-filled eu state derived from Co-3d and X'-3d and 5d electrons respectively while CoFeZrAl is non-magnetic. The two-dimensional graphene-like density of states at the Fermi level in CoFeZrAl implies large electrical conductivity. We further observe that the presence of two 3d early Transition metal (TM) atoms enhances the Seebeck coefficient as in CoVZrAl and CoFeZrAl and the presence of extended 5d state of Ir diminishes the same for CoIrZrAl. However the higher thermal conductivity in CoFeZrAl renders CoVZrAl the best TE material among the three. The ZT value of n-type CoVZrAl is found to reach a higher value 1.4 at 600 K.</description>

      <title>Efficient broadband terahertz generation by above band-gap excitation of the pyroelectric ZnSnN2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) radiation is a powerful probe of low-energy excitations in all phases of matter. However, it remains a challenge to find materials that efficiently generate THz radiation in a broad range of frequencies following optical excitation. Here, we investigate a pyroelectric material, ZnSnN2, and find that above-band-gap excitation results in the efficient formation of an ultrafast photocurrent generating THz radiation. The resulting THz electric field spans a frequency range from below 1 to above 30 THz. Our results suggest that the photocurrent is primarily driven by an ultrafast pyroelectric effect where the photo-excited carriers screen the spontaneous electric polarization of ZnSnN2. Strong structural disorder reduces the photocarrier lifetime significantly and, thus, enables broadband operation. ZnSnN2 shows similar THz-emitter performance as the best spintronic THz emitters regarding bandwidth and amplitude. Our study unveils the large potential of pyroelectric materials as efficient and broadband THz emitters with built-in bias fields.</description>

      <title>Charge Ordering in out-of-plane Boron Doped Reduced Graphene Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking phase transitions analogous to superconductivity (SC), charge ordering (CO) etc. in metal-intercalated graphene are favorable resulting from modified electronic and phonon band structures. Strong carrier-lattice interaction evolved from the out-of-plane soft vibrations with accumulation of charges at the out-of-plane region, can set a favorable environment for CO in graphene system. Here, we employ boron-doped reduced graphene oxide (BG) to acquire charge-ordered state above a transition temperature, T1~97.5 K. Signatures of this state are identified using ab-initio simulations and low temperature electrical transport measurements. The out-of-plane boron groups play a crucial role in reinforcing the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) allowing an ordered-state transition. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy further supports the emergence of ordering. Key characterization techniques (X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra etc.) are used to quantify the EPC interaction and associated factors like tensile strain, boundary defects, etc. affecting charge ordering with doping. Additionally, we find interesting electric field dependency on the CO in this non-metallic, light-atom-doped chemically derived graphene.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon couplings in locally disordered materials: The case of hybrid halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positional polymorphism in solids refers to distributions of correlated locally disordered unit cells which reflect, on average, the high-symmetry structure observed in diffraction experiments. The standard theory of electron-phonon interactions is unable to account for the temperature-dependent electronic structure of polymorphous materials. A prime example of such materials is hybrid halide perovskites, for which calculations of band gaps at finite temperatures do not agree with experiment. Here, we develop a systematic and accurate methodology to investigate electron-phonon couplings in complex polymorphous materials, demonstrated through calculations of anharmonic phonons and thermally-induced band gap renormalization for a broad family of halide perovskites. Our approach delivers unprecedented agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Type III Valley Polarization and Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in Two-Dimensional Non-Janus and Janus Altermagnet Fe2WS2Se2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting the valley degree of freedom introduces a novel paradigm for advancing quantum information technology. Currently, the investigation on spontaneous valley polarization mainly focuses on two major types of systems. One type magnetic systems by breaking the time-reversal symmetry, the other is ferroelectric materials through breaking the inversion symmetry. Might there be additional scenarios? Here, we propose to realize spontaneous valley polarization by breaking the mirror symmetry in the altermagnets, named type III valley polarization. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we confirm that this mechanism is feasible in Non-Janus Fe2WS2Se2. Monolayer Non-Janus and Janus Fe2WS2Se2 are stable Neel-type antiferromagnetic state with the direct band gap semiconductor. More interestingly, their magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits the rare biaxial anisotropy and a four-leaf clover shape in the xy plane, while the xz and yz planes show the common uniaxial anisotropy. This originated from the fourth-order single ion interactions. More importantly, the valley splitting is spontaneously generated in the Non-Janus Fe2WS2Se2 due to the Mxy symmetry breaking, without requiring the SOC effect. Both the Non-Janus and Janus Fe2WS2Se2 exhibit diverse valley polarization and anomalous valley Hall effect properties. In addition, the magnitude and direction of valley polarization can be effectively tuned by the biaxial strain and magnetic field. Our findings not only expand the realization system of spontaneous valley polarization, but also provide a theoretical basis for the high-density storage of valley degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Electronic Band Alignment and Potentially Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties in Phase-Separated Mg2X (X=Si,Ge,Sn) Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mg2X (X=Si, Ge, Sn) based alloy is an eco-friendly thermoelectric material for mid-temperature applications. The Mg2Si1-xSnx and Mg2Ge1-xSnx alloys can be phase-separated into Si(Ge)- and Sn-rich phases during material synthesis, leading to a nanocomposite with locally varying electronic band structure. First-principles calculations reveal that the valence band offset is eight-times larger than the conduction band offset at the interface between Si- and Sn-rich phases for x=0.6, showing type-I and asymmetric band alignment (0.092 eV versus 0.013 eV). Using Boltzmann transport theory and thermionic emission calculations, we show that the large valence band energy discontinuity could allow for energy filtering effects to take place that can potentially increase the power factor substantially in the p-type material system if designed appropriately.</description>

      <title>Rock-salt ScN(113) layers grown on AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$ by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal nitrides constitute a versatile class of materials with diverse properties and wide-ranging applications. Exploring new surface orientations and uncovering novel properties can enable innovative material configurations with tailored functionalities for device integration. Here, we report the growth and characterization of (85-210)-nm-thick undoped ScN layers on AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$$(10\bar{1}0)$ templates via plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy confirm a pure (113) surface orientation with rotational twins. Two distinct in-plane relationships between ScN(113) and AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$ have been identified: the dominant $[1\bar{1}0]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [\bar{1}\bar{1}23]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ and $[33\bar{2}]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [1\bar{1}00]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ (under tensile-compression), and the less prevalent $[\bar{1}\bar{2}1]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [1\bar{1}00]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ and $[7\bar{4}\bar{1}]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [\bar{1}\bar{1}23]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ (under biaxial compression). Broad photoluminescence spectra with a peak emission energy of $\approx 2.16\,\mathrm{eV}$ originate from the lowest direct gap at the $\mathbf{X}$ point of the ScN band structure. Temperature-dependent Hall-effect measurements (4-380 K) reveal that impurity band conduction dominates. The electron mobility is primarily limited by optical phonon scattering, characterized by an effective phonon energy of $(60 \pm 3)\,\mathrm{meV}$.</description>

      <title>Single Cu Atom Sites on Co3O4 Activate Interfacial Oxygen for Enhanced Reactivity and Selective Gas Sensing at Low Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the redox landscape of transition metal oxides is central to advancing their reactivity for heterogeneous catalysis or high-performance gas sensing. Here we report single Cu atom sites (1.42 wt%) anchored on Co3O4 nanoparticles (Cu1-Co3O4) that dramatically enhance reactivity and molecular sensing properties of the support at low temperature. The Cu1 are identified by X-ray adsorption near edge structure and feature strong metal-support interaction between Cu2+ and Co3O4, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The ability of Cu1 to form interfacial Cu-O-Co linkages strongly reduces the temperature of lattice oxygen activation compared to CuO nanoparticles on Co3O4 (CuONP-Co3O4), as demonstrated by temperature-programmed reduction and desorption analyses. To demonstrate immediate practical impact, we deploy such Cu1-Co3O4 nanoparticles as chemoresistive sensor for formaldehyde vapor that yields more than an order of magnitude higher response than CuONP-Co3O4 and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sensors. That way, formaldehyde is detected down to 5 parts-per-billion at 50% relative humidity and 75 {\deg}C with excellent selectivity over various critical interferents. These results establish a mechanistic platform for activating redox-active supports using single-atom isolates of non-noble nature that yield drastically enhanced and well-defined reactivity to promote low-temperature oxidation reactions and selective analyte sensing.</description>

      <title>Designing Corrosion-Resistant CoCrNi Medium Entropy Alloys via Short-Range Order Modification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equiatomic CoCrNi medium entropy alloys are known for their unique properties linked to chemical short-range order (CSRO), crucial in both percolation processes and/or nucleation and growth processes influencing alloy passivation in aqueous environments. This study combines extended x-ray absorption fine structure, atomistic simulations, electrochemical methods, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to explore CSRO evolution, passive film formation, as well as its characteristics in the as-homogenized CoCrNi condition, both before and after aging treatment. Results reveal a shift in local alloying element bonding environments post-aging, with simulations indicating increased Cr-Cr CSRO in 2nd nearest neighbor shells. Enhanced passive film formation kinetics and superior protection of the aged alloy in harsh acidified 3 mol/L NaCl solution indicate improved aqueous passivation correlated with Cr-Cr CSRO. This work establishes a direct connection between alloy CSRO and aqueous passivation in CoCrNi, highlighting its potential for tailored corrosion-resistant applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report anomalous shot noise in nanojunctions of beta-tantalum, a ``bad" metal whose electronic properties are inconsistent with the Fermi liquid theory. Fano factors cluster around even multiples of the values expected for Fermi liquids, suggesting that beta-Ta may host a correlated charge liquid of Cooper pair-like electron groups. Further evidence for correlations is provided by the effects of magnetic impurities, as well as reduced density of states near the Fermi level indicated by point contact spectroscopy and first principles calculations. Our results open new avenues for studies and applications of electron correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnesium target film has better thermal stability and neutron yield than titanium target, making it a potential neutron generator target film material. The radiation resistance of elemental magnesium targets is relatively weak, and their radiation resistance can be improved by alloying magnesium target films. The irradiation damage of pure magnesium targets and magnesium alloy target films was studied using SRIM. The results indicate that the irradiation damage of magnesium alloy target films (magnesium-niobium, magnesium-zirconium alloys) is lower than that of pure magnesium targets. In addition, under the same alloy ratio, the radiation resistance of magnesium-niobium alloy target film is better than that of magnesium-zirconium alloy. In order to further in-vestigate the performance of magnesium alloy target films, the incident ion energy, protective coatings (nickel oxide, aluminum oxide, palladium oxide), magnesium alloy target films, and alloy doping ratios (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) were changed. After calculating the effects of the above conditions on the neutron generator yield, sputtering yield, and considering irradiation damage, it was determined that a magnesium-zirconium alloy with a doping rate of 0.2 and a nickel oxide protective coating with a thickness of 7.5 nm are potential target film materials for the neutron generator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex chalcogenides in the $M$PS$_3$ family of materials ($M$ = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) display remarkably different phase progressions depending upon the metal center orbital filling, character of the P-P linkage, and size of the van der Waals gap. There is also a stacking pattern and spin state difference between the lighter and heavier transition metal-containing systems that places CoPS$_3$ at the nexus of these activities. Despite these unique properties, this compound is under-explored. Here, we bring together Raman scattering spectroscopy and infrared absorption spectroscopy with X-ray techniques to identify a structural component to the 119 K magnetic ordering transition as well as a remarkable lower temperature set of magnon-phonon pairs that engage in avoided crossings along with a magnetic scattering continuum that correlates with phonon lifetime effects. These findings point to strong spin-phonon entanglement as well as opportunities to control these effects under external stimuli.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elemental Pr metal crystallizes in the double hexagonal close packed (dhcp) structure and is unique among rare-earth elements in featuring a localized partially filled 4f shell without ordered magnetism. Experimental evidence attributes this absence of magnetism to a singlet crystal-field (CF) ground state of the Pr 4f$^2$ configuration, which is energetically well isolated from excited magnetic doublets. Here, we construct a realistic effective magnetic Hamiltonian for dhcp Pr, by combining density-functional theory with dynamical mean-field theory, in the quasiatomic Hubbard-I approximation. Our calculations fully determine the CF potential and predict singlet CF ground states at both inequivalent sites of the dhcp lattice. The intersite exchange interactions, obtained from the magnetic force theorem, are found to be insufficient to close the CF gap to the magnetic doublets. Hence, ab-initio theory is demonstrated to explain the unusual, non-magnetic state of elemental Pr. Extending this analysis to the (0001) surface of Pr, we find that the singlet ground state remains robust preventing conventional magnetic orders. Nevertheless, the gap between the ground state and the lowest excited singlet is significantly reduced at the surface, opening the possibility for exotic two-dimensional multipolar orders to emerge within this two-singlet manifold.</description>

      <title>Identifying Clean and Contaminated Atomic-Sized Gold Contacts under Ambient Conditions Using a Clustering Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular electronics studies have advanced from early, simple single-molecule experiments at cryogenic temperatures to complex and multifunctional molecules under ambient conditions. However, room-temperature environments increase the risk of contamination, making it essential to identify and quantify clean and contaminated rupture traces (i.e., conductance versus relative electrode displacement) within large datasets. Given the high throughput of measurements, manual analysis becomes unfeasible. Clustering algorithms offer an effective solution by enabling automatic classification and quantification of contamination levels. Despite the rapid development of machine learning, its application in molecular electronics remains limited. In this work, we present a methodology based on the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to extract representative traces from both clean and contaminated regimes, providing a scalable and objective tool to evaluate environmental contamination in molecular junction experiments.</description>

      <title>Temperature gradient-driven motion of magnetic domains in a magnetic metal multilayer by entropic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the displacement of magnetic domains under temperature gradients in perpendicularly magnetized Ta/[Pt/Co$_{68}$B$_{32}$/Ir]$_{\times 10}$/Pt multilayer tracks with microfabricated Pt heaters/thermometers by magnetic force microscopy (MFM). Subtracting out the effects of the Oersted field from the heating current reveals the pure temperature gradient-driven motion, which is always towards the heater. The higher the thermal gradient along the track (owing to proximity to the heater or larger heater currents), the greater the observed displacements of the domains, up to a velocity of around 1~nm/s in a temperature gradient of 20~K/$\mu$m. Quantitative estimates of the strength of different driving mechanisms show that entropic forces dominate over those arising from the spin Seebeck and spin-dependent Seebeck effects.</description>

      <title>Influence of preparation and architecture on the elastic modulus of polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elastic modulus $G$ of a polymer network depends notably on parameters such as the initial concentration of the monomers before the synthesis ($\rho_0$), the density of the cross-linker, or the topology of the network. Understanding how these factors influence the stiffness of the sample is hampered by the fact that in experiments it is difficult to tune them individually. Here we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study how these quantities, as well as excluded volume interactions, affect the elastic modulus of the network. We find that for a regular diamond network, $G$ is independent of the initial monomer concentration, while for disordered networks (monodisperse or polydisperse) the modulus increases with $\rho_0$, at odds with the classical predictions for rubber elasticity. Analysis of the network structure reveals that, for the disordered networks, defects contribute only weakly to the observed increase, and that instead the $\rho_0$-dependence of $G$ can be rationalized by the presence of a pre-strain in the sample. This pre-strain can be quantified by the topological factor introduced in the affine network theory (ANT). Comparison of the disordered networks with their phantom counterparts reveals that weakly crosslinked systems show a stronger $\rho_0$-dependence of $G$ due to an increase in entanglements at higher $\rho_0$, and that the polydisperse networks contain more entanglements than the monodisperse ones with the same average strand length. Finally we discuss the quantitative application of ANT to the simulated real networks and their phantom counterparts and conclude that the presence of excluded volume effects must be comprehensively taken into account for reaching a qualitative understanding of the mechanical modulus of the disordered networks.</description>

      <title>Hidden degree of freedom implied by unusual nonlocal transport in a topological semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin Hall and inverse spin Hall effects have established a principle to understand nonlocal charge transport due to an additional degree of freedom. This principle applies successfully to the nonlocal transport due to the valley degree of freedom in graphene or to the chiral degree of freedom in a Weyl semimetal. Here we report the discovery of an unusual nonlocal charge transport that cannot be explained by any known mechanism and hence points to the existence of a hidden degree of freedom. This phenomenon was found in ZrTe$_5$ in the nodal-line semimetal phase and it occurs in the ultraquantun limit driven by the magnetic field applied along the $a$-axis. Surprisingly, the decay length of the nonlocality increases linearly with the sample width and exceeds 100 $\mu$m, suggesting that the relevant degree of freedom experiences little scattering. This nonlocal transport shows up not only as a longitudinal voltage gradient, but also as an unusual nonlocal Hall effect. Such an exotic phenomenon in a topological material is unprecedented and implies new physics.</description>

      <title>Generic Chiral Anomaly and Planar Hall Effect in a Non-Weyl System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The condensed-matter version of the chiral anomaly describes how electrons are pumped from a Weyl node with negative chirality to a Weyl node with positive chirality using parallel electric and magnetic fields. Key experimental signatures are a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) and the planar Hall effect (PHE), both of which have been experimentally observed. Here, we show that the chiral anomaly explains key features of magnetotransport in the nodal-line semimetal ZrTe$_5$ despite the absence of Weyl points. The anomaly physics applies generically to materials in the quantum limit, when electron transport becomes quasi-one-dimensional, provided that Fermi velocities remain sufficiently large. This explains not only the negative LMR but also the PHE with a gigantic Hall angle and a highly unusual magnetic-field-angle dependence in ZrTe$_5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an ab initio molecular dynamics study of fluid mercury at temperature 1750 K in the range of densities 7-13.5 g/cm$^3$. Along this isothermal line we performed an analysis of total charge fluctuations, which make evidence of neutral atom-like screening in fluid Hg for densities less than 9.25 g/cm$^3$, which practically coincides with the emergence of the gap in electronic density of states. High-frequency shear modulus, high-frequency and adiabatic speeds of sound, shear viscosity, Maxwell relaxation time and dispersion of collective excitations are analyzed as a function of density along the isothermal line.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface and effective masses of IrO$_2$ probed by de Haas-van Alphen quantum oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iridium-containing conducting materials are widely investigated for their strong spin-orbit coupling and potential topological properties. Recently the commonly used electrode material iridium dioxide was found to host a large spin-Hall conductivity and was shown to support Dirac nodal lines. Here we present quantum-oscillation experiments on high-quality IrO$_2$ single crystals using the de Haas-van Alphen effect measured using torque magnetometry with a piezo-resistive microcantilever as well as density functional theory-based band-structure calculations. The angle, temperature and field dependencies of the oscillations and the calculated band dispersion provide valuable information on the properties of the charge carriers, including the Fermi-surface geometry and electronic correlations. Comparison of experimental results to calculations allows us to assigns the observed de Haas-van Alphen frequencies to the calculated Fermi surface topology. We find that the effective masses of IrO$_2$ are enhanced compared to the rest electron mass $m_e$, ranging from 1.9 to 3.0~$m_e$, whereas the scattering times indicate excellent sample quality. We discuss our results in context with recent ARPES and band-structure calculation results that found Dirac nodal lines in IrO$_2$ and compare the effective masses and other electronic properties to those of similar materials like the nodal chain metal ReO$_2$ in which Dirac electrons with very light effective masses have been observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional honeycomb lattices, characterized by their low coordination numbers, provide a fertile platform for exploring various quantum phenomena due to the intricate interplay between competing magnetic interactions, spin-orbit coupling, and crystal electric fields. Beyond the widely studied Jeff= 1/2 honeycomb systems, S = 3/2 honeycomb lattices present a promising alternative route to realizing the classical spin liquid-like state within the spin-S Kitaev models. Herein, we present crystal structure, thermodynamic, neutron diffraction and muon spin relaxation (muSR) measurements, complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations on an unexplored 3d transition metal based compound Co2Te3O8, where Co2+ (S = 3/2) ions form a distorted honeycomb lattice in the crystallographic bc-plane without any anti-side disorder between constituent atoms. A clear lambda type anomaly around 55 K in both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat data indicates the onset of a long-range ordered state below TN= 55 K. The dominant antiferromagnetic interaction between S = 3/2 moments is evidenced by a relatively large negative Curie-Weiss temperature of -103 K derived from magnetic susceptibility data and supported by DFT calculations. The signature of long-range antiferomagnetic order state in the thermodynamic data is corroborated by neutron diffraction and muSR results. Furthermore, muSR experiments reveal the coexistence of static and dynamic local magnetic fields below TN, along with a complex magnetic structure that can be associated with XY-like antiferromagnet, as confirmed by neutron diffraction experiments.</description>

      <title>Choosing a Suitable Acquisition Function for Batch Bayesian Optimization: Comparison of Serial and Monte Carlo Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batch Bayesian optimization is widely used for optimizing expensive experimental processes when several samples can be tested together to save time or cost. A central decision in designing a Bayesian optimization campaign to guide experiments is the choice of a batch acquisition function when little or nothing is known about the landscape of the "black box" function to be optimized. To inform this decision, we first compare the performance of serial and Monte Carlo batch acquisition functions on two mathematical functions that serve as proxies for typical materials synthesis and processing experiments. The two functions, both in six dimensions, are the Ackley function, which epitomizes a "needle-in-haystack" search, and the Hartmann function, which exemplifies a "false optimum" problem. Our study evaluates the serial upper confidence bound with local penalization (UCB/LP) batch acquisition policy against Monte Carlo-based parallel approaches: q-log expected improvement (qlogEI) and q-upper confidence bound (qUCB), where q is the batch size. Tests on Ackley and Hartmann show that UCB/LP and qUCB perform well in noiseless conditions, both outperforming qlogEI. For the Hartmann function with noise, all Monte Carlo functions achieve faster convergence with less sensitivity to initial conditions compared to UCB/LP. We then confirm the findings on an empirical regression model built from experimental data in maximizing power conversion efficiency of flexible perovskite solar cells. Our results suggest that when empirically optimizing a "black-box" function in less than or equal to six dimensions with no prior knowledge of the landscape or noise characteristics, qUCB is best suited as the default to maximize confidence in the modeled optimum while minimizing the number of expensive samples needed.</description>

      <title>Optical spin pumping in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of an out-of-equilibrium population of spin-polarized carriers is a keystone process for quantum technologies and spintronics alike. It can be achieved through the so-called optical spin orientation by exciting the material with circularly polarized light. Although this is an established technique for studying direct band-gap semiconductors, it has been proven limited in materials like Si that possess weak oscillator strengths for the optical transitions. In this study, we address the problem by presenting an all-optical analog of the spin pumping method. This involves the optical creation of a non-equilibrium spin population within an absorber, which subsequently transfers spin-polarized carriers to a nearby indirect gap semiconductor, resulting in polarized emission from the latter. By applying this concept to a Ge-on-Si heterostructure we observe luminescence from Si with an unrivaled polarization degree as high as 9%. The progressive etching of the absorbing layer, assisted by magneto-optic experiments, allows us to ascertain that the polarized emission is determined by effective spin injection aided by the carrier lifetime shortening due to extended defects. These findings can facilitate the use of highly promising spin-dependent phenomena of Si, whose optical exploitation has thus far been hampered by fundamental limitations associated with its peculiar electronic structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a systematic and accurate approach for deriving the bulk free energy surface (FES), a function of temperature, polarization, and strain, from the first-principles density functional theory (DFT) of proper ferroelectrics. The core of our approach is the metadynamics algorithm that extracts the polarization dependence of the FES from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations without an a priori ansatz. The rest of the FES is derived from the metadynamics trajectories that span the relevant phase space. We demonstrate our approach in the case of lead titanate. The errors across the phase transition, due to DFT numerics, all-atom molecular dynamics, and free energy evaluation by enhanced sampling, can be systematically controlled and are of the order of 1meV/atom. The accuracy of the resulting ab initio FES is only limited by the adopted functional approximation of DFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reduced dimensionality of multiferroic materials is highly desired for device miniaturization, but the coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism at the two-dimensional limit is yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Here, we used a NbSe2 substrate to break both the C3 rotational and inversion symmetries in monolayer VCl3 and thus introduced exceptional in-plane ferroelectricity into a two-dimensional magnet. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy directly visualized ferroelectric domains and manipulated their domain boundaries in monolayer VCl3, where coexisting antiferromagnetic order with canted magnetic moments was verified by vibrating sample magnetometer measurements. Our density functional theory calculations highlight the crucial role that highly directional interfacial Cl-Se interactions play in breaking the symmetries and thus in introducing in-plane ferroelectricity, which was further verified by examining an ML-VCl3/graphene sample. Our work demonstrates an approach to manipulate the ferroelectric states in monolayered magnets through van der Waals interfacial interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doping properties of Bi, Cr and Ag dopants in thermoelectric and topological materials PbTe and SnTe are analyzed based on density functional theory calculations in the local density approximations and the large supercell method. In agreement with experiment, in both PbTe and SnTe, Bi is a donor and Ag is an acceptor with a vanishing magnetic moment. In contrast, Cr is a resonant donor in PbTe, and an resonant acceptor in SnTe. We also consider the electronic structure of cation vacancies in PbTe and SnTe, since these abundant native defects induce $p$-type conductivity in both hosts. The quantitatively different impact of these dopants/defects on the host band structure of PbTe and SnTe (level energies, band splittings, band inversion, and a different level of hybridization between dopant and host states) is explained based on the group-theoretical arguments.</description>

      <title>Seed-Driven Stepwise Crystallization (SDSC) for Growing Rutile GeO2 Films via MOCVD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Germanium dioxide (r-GeO2) is an emerging new ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor with significant potential for power electronics, thanks to its large-size substrate compatibility and ambipolar doping capability. However, phase segregation during metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on substrates like r-TiO2 has posed a significant barrier to achieving high-quality films. Conventional optimization of growth parameters has been found so far not very insufficient in film coverage and film quality. To address this, a seed-driven stepwise crystallization (SDSC) growth approach was employed in this study, featuring multiple sequential deposition steps on a pre-templated substrate enriched with r-GeO2 seeds. The process began with an initial 180-minute deposition to establish r-GeO2 nucleation seeds, followed by a sequence of shorter deposition steps (90, 60, 60, 60, 60, and 60 minutes). This stepwise growth strategy progressively increased the crystalline coverage to 57.4%, 77.49%, 79.73%, 93.27%, 99.17%, and ultimately 100%. Concurrently, the crystalline quality improved substantially, evidenced by a ~30% reduction in the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of X-ray diffraction rocking curves. These findings demonstrate the potential of the SDSC approach for overcoming phase segregation and achieving high-quality, large-area r-GeO2 films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory that studies the state composition of a bound exciton in magnetic field. Using a basis set made of products of free electron and hole wavefunctions in Landau gauge, we derive a secular equation which shows the relation between Landau levels (LLs) of the electron and hole when a bound exciton is formed. Focusing on excitons in the light cone, we establish a scattering selection rule for the interaction of an electron in LL $n_\text{e}$ with a hole in LL $n_\text{h}$. We solve the resulting secular equation and identify a simple pairing law, $n_\text{e} = n_\text{h} + l$, which informs us on the construction of a bound exciton state with magnetic quantum number $l$, and on the interaction of the exciton magnetic moment with magnetic field. We obtain good agreement between theory results and recent measurements of the diamagnetic shifts of exciton states in WSe$_2$ monolayers.</description>

      <title>The Augmented Potential Method: Multiscale Modeling Toward a Spectral Defect Genome</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modeling of solute chemistry at low-symmetry defects in materials is historically challenging, due to the computation cost required to evaluate thermodynamic properties from first principles. Here, we offer a hybrid multiscale approach called the augmented potential method that connects the chemical flexibility and near-quantum accuracy of a universal machine learning potential at the site of the defect, with the computational speed of a long-range classical potential implemented away from the defect site in a buffer zone. The method allows us to rapidly compute distributions of grain boundary segregation energy for 1,050 binary alloy pairs (including Ag, Al, Au, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, Nb, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ta and V, W solvent), creating a database for polycrystalline grain boundary segregation. This database is ~5x larger than previously published spectral compilations, and yet has improved accuracy. The approach can also address problems far beyond the reach of any other method, such as handling bcc Fe-based alloys, or the complex solute-solute interactions in random polycrystals. The approach thus paves a pathway toward a complete defect genome in crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Circular dichroism in resonant photoelectron diffraction as a direct probe of sublattice magnetization in altermagnets</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of magnetic materials that are promising for spintronics technology. Here it is shown that in altermagnets, the circular dichroism (CD) in resonant photoelectron diffraction (RPED) contains a time-reversal odd signal, which provides a direct probe of the sublattice magnetization. RPED calculations are performed for MnTe at the Mn L2,3-edge resonance, using a combination of atomic multiplet and multiple scattering theory. A large magnetic CD is found for light helicity parallel to the N\'eel vector. This signal has the same angular distribution as the difference between the structural RPED of the two magnetic sublattices and its amplitude is approximately proportional to the X-ray magnetic CD in absorption of a single sublattice, thus providing a direct probe of the local magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>Best practices in Quantum Monte Carlo for metal catalysis: CO hydrolysis on Pt(111)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen production as a clean, sustainable replacement for fossil fuels is gathering pace. Research work and prototyping various aspects of hydrogen power is now a priority. Over 90 \% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. This work describes catalytic selective hydrogen production optimising reactant structure on a model catalyst. Focus is on O-H bond dissociation in format radicals formed after carbon-monoxide is co-adsorbed with water at Pt(111). Finally, hydrogen gas is given off. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. %This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site approach is used. This work demonstrates Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology using a very simple four primitive-cell layer model, oriented to expose Pt (111). QMC is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous systems involving solids. During hydrolysis of carbon monoxide, initial O-H bond stretch is rate-limiting. This dissociation energy is offset by Pt-H bond formation at the surface. The reactive formate (H-O-C=O) species formed, by initial hydrolysis of CO, also interact with a vicinal Pt. These are subsequently desorbed. They then produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a H-atom dissociated from the formate species and another desorbed at the Pt(111) face.
  Our approach allows a high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function is used to guide the QMC calculation.</description>

      <title>What Really Drives Thermopower: Specific Heat or Entropy as the Unifying Principle Across Magnetic, Superconducting, and Nanoscale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermopower, a key parameter in thermoelectric performance, is often linked to either specific heat or entropy, yet the fundamental quantity that governs it has remained elusive. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework that identifies entropy per carrier, not specific heat, as the universal driver of thermopower across both closed and open systems. Using thermodynamic identities and the Onsager-Kelvin relation, we show that thermopower is universally proportional to entropy per carrier, while its apparent proportionality to specific heat arises only in systems where the specific heat follows a continuous power-law temperature dependence. To extend this framework to magnetic systems, we derive a general expression for magnon-drag thermopower that holds in both Newtonian (massive, parabolic) and relativistic (massless, linear) magnon regimes. In particular, we reformulate the momentum balance using a relativistic energy-momentum tensor, resolving conceptual inconsistencies in prior models that relied on ill-defined magnon masses in antiferromagnets. Our framework is further illustrated through three representative systems: (i) magnetic materials, where magnon and paramagnon entropy sustain thermopower across TC and TN; (ii) superconducting Nb, where anomalous thermopower emerges from entropy carried by Bogoliubov quasiparticles near TC; and (iii) a single-molecule junction, where entropy from occupation-number fluctuations governs thermopower in an open quantum system. We validate our unifying principle by comparing it with experimental data: thermopower measurements of superconducting niobium reveal the role of quasiparticle entropy near the critical temperature, and literature-reported specific heat data from a wide range of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials demonstrate consistent entropy-based scaling across magnetic transitions.</description>

      <title>Interface-sensitive microwave loss in superconducting tantalum films sputtered on c-plane sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence in superconducting circuits has increased steadily over the last decades as a result of a growing understanding of the various loss mechanisms. Recently, tantalum (Ta) emerged as a promising material to address microscopic sources of loss found on niobium (Nb) or aluminum (Al) surfaces. However, the effects of film and interface microstructure on low-temperature microwave loss are still not well understood. Here we present a systematic study of the structural and electrical properties of Ta and Nb films sputtered on c-plane sapphire at varying growth temperatures. As growth temperature is increased, our results show that the onset of epitaxial growth of alpha-phase Ta correlates with lower Ta surface roughness, higher critical temperature, and higher residual resistivity ratio, but surprisingly also correlates with a significant increase in loss at microwave frequency. Notably, this high level of loss is not observed in Nb films prepared in the same way and having very similar structure. By experimentally controlling the surface on which the Ta film is nucleated, we determine that the source of loss is only present in samples having an epitaxial Ta/sapphire interface and show that it is apparently mitigated by either growing a thin, epitaxial Nb inter-layer between the Ta film and the substrate or by intentionally treating, and effectively damaging, the sapphire surface with an in-situ argon plasma before Ta growth. In addition to elucidating this interfacial microwave loss, this work provides adequate process details to aid reproducible growth of low-loss Ta films across fabrication facilities.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced proximity effect in topological insulator TaSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetoresistance of superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor structures, with indium as the superconductor and TaSe$_3$ as the topological insulator, shows steplike features on the resistance under magnetic fields. These resistance steps are resulted from the suppression of superconductivity, induced by the superconducting proximity effect in both the bulk and surface states of the topological insulator. The position and amplitude of the steps, occurring at approximately 0.1 T, show an unusual dependence on the magnitude of the uniaxial strain ($\epsilon$), indicating their connection with surface states. This behavior follows the expected transition sequence: semi-metal $\rightarrow$ strong topological insulator $\rightarrow$ trivial insulator, and supports the presence of surface states at $0.46\% \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 0.85\%$.</description>

Abstract: We employ polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy to study the lattice dynamics of the polar charge density wave phase of the superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C with structural chirality. We show the phononic signatures of the charge density wave transition at $T^*$ = 155\,K in Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. The detailed temperature dependence of these phonon modes' frequency, half width at half maximum, and integrated area below $T^*$ reveal anomalies at an intermediate temperature $T' \sim$ 100\,K, especially for the low-energy modes at 130 and 180\,\cm-1. We discuss the origin of these phonon anomalies within the polar charge density wave phase of Mo$_3$Al$_2$C.</description>

      <title>Stress-stress correlations in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stress-stress correlations in crystalline solids with long-range order can be straightforwardly derived using elasticity theory. In contrast, the `emergent elasticity' of amorphous solids, rigid materials characterized by an underlying disordered structure, defies direct explanation within traditional theoretical frameworks. To address this challenge, tensor gauge theories have been recently proposed as a promising approach to describe the emergent elasticity of disordered solids and predict their stress-stress correlations. In this work, we revisit this problem in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids by employing a canonical elasticity theory approach, supported by experimental and simulation data. We demonstrate that, with respect to static stress-stress correlations, the response of a 2D disordered solid is indistinguishable from that of a 2D isotropic crystalline solid and it is well predicted by vanilla elasticity theory. Moreover, we show that the presence of pinch-point singularities in the stress response is not an exclusive feature of amorphous solids. Our results confirm previous observations about the universal character of static stress-stress correlations in crystalline and amorphous packings.</description>

      <title>Multi-Variable Batch Bayesian Optimization in Materials Research: Synthetic Data Analysis of Noise Sensitivity and Problem Landscape Effects</title>

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) machine learning method is increasingly used to guide experimental optimization tasks in materials science. To emulate the large number of input variables and noise-containing results in experimental materials research, we perform batch BO simulation of six design variables with a range of noise levels. Two test cases relevant for materials science problems are examined: a needle-in-a-haystack case (Ackley function) that may be encountered in, e.g., molecule optimizations, and a smooth landscape with a local optimum in addition to the global optimum (Hartmann function) that may be encountered in, e.g., material composition optimization. We show learning curves, performance metrics, and visualization to effectively track the optimization progression and evaluate how the optimization outcomes are affected by noise, batch-picking method, choice of acquisition function, and exploration hyperparameter values. We find that the effects of noise depend on the problem landscape: noise degrades the optimization results of a needle-in-a-haystack search (Ackley) dramatically more. However, with increasing noise, we observe an increasing probability of landing on the local optimum in Hartmann. Therefore, prior knowledge of the problem domain structure and noise level is essential when designing BO for materials research experiments. Synthetic data studies -- with known ground truth and controlled noise levels -- enable us to isolate and evaluate the impact of different batch BO components, {\it e.g.}, acquisition policy, objective metrics, and hyperparameter values, before transitioning to the inherent uncertainties of real experimental systems. The results and methodology of this study will facilitate a greater utilization of BO in guiding experimental materials research, specifically in settings with a large number of design variables to optimize.</description>

Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges in the on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect conformational diversity. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers because of challenges in representation and dataset constraints. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first generative model designed specifically for polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone. polyGen combines graph-based encodings with a latent diffusion transformer using positional biased attention for realistic conformation generation. Given the limited dataset of 3,855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we incorporate joint training with small molecule data to enhance generation quality. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen overcomes the limitations of traditional crystal structure prediction methods for polymers, successfully generating realistic and diverse linear and branched conformations, with promising performance even on challenging large repeat units. As the first atomic-level proof-of-concept capturing intrinsic polymer flexibility, it marks a new capability in material structure generation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Data for More Efficient and Generalizable Learning: A Case Study in Disordered Elastic Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models often require large datasets and struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. These limitations pose significant challenges in scientific and engineering contexts, where generating exhaustive datasets is often impractical and the goal is frequently to discover novel solutions outside the training domain. In this work, we explore the use of dynamical data through a graph neural network-based simulator to enable efficient system-to-property learning and out-of-distribution prediction in the context of uniaxial compression of two-dimensional disordered elastic networks. We find that the simulator can learn the underlying physical dynamics from a small number of training examples and accurately reproduce the temporal evolution of unseen networks. Notably, the simulator is able to accurately predict emergent properties such as the Poisson's ratio and its dependence on strain, even though it was not explicitly trained for this task. In addition, it generalizes well across variations in system temperature, strain amplitude, and most significantly, Poisson's ratios beyond the training range. These findings suggest that using dynamical data to train machine learning models can support more data efficient and generalizable approaches for materials and molecular design, especially in data-scarce settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of altermagnetic materials, supporting spin splitting without net magnetization, opens new directions for spintronics that are fundamentally distinct from conventional ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or spin-orbit coupling systems. Here we investigate spin-selective quantum transport in heterostructures composed of a normal metal and a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet. We focus on two types of $d$-wave altermagnets, namely, weak and strong altermagnets that support close elliptic and open hyperbolic spin-resolved Fermi surfaces, respectively. Building on these distinct electronic structures, we propose all-electrically controlled spin filter and spin valve devices, where quantum resonant tunneling enables highly spin-polarized conductance tunable via gate voltage and interface transparency. In particular, we find that strong altermagnets allow gate-tunable full spin polarization that is robust against interface scattering and can be reversed by gate control. We further demonstrate that a double-gated spin valve electrically switches between parallel and antiparallel spin configurations, analogous to magnetic junctions but without the need for external magnetic fields. Our results establish both weak and strong altermagnets as promising platforms for realizing magnetic-field-free electrically tunable spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoporous metals have emerged as promising functional architectures due to their tunable optical and electronic properties, high surface areas, and versatile use in real-life applications such as sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine. While the optical and morphological properties of nanoporous metals have been extensively studied, their electronic properties at ultrafast timescales remain largely unexplored. Here, we study the transient response of a nanoporous gold metamaterial and compare it with the ultrafast dynamics of a continuous gold film. We unravel that the nanoporous sample supports lower energy interband transitions, due to a much higher electron temperature in the nanoporous material, which causes an enhanced redistribution of electron density around the Fermi level. The experimental results are consistent with the two-temperature model, which highlights the role of nanoscale porosity in enabling the more efficient generation of hot carriers, thus allowing lower energy photons to induce interband transitions. Our findings demonstrate that nanoporosity affects fundamental ultrafast electronic processes and introduces this platform as temporal metamaterial allowing the emergence of tunable electronic properties not supported by the bulk counterpart. Furthermore, we present new insights into ultrafast electronic properties of nanoporous metals, which can impact several areas, from photochemistry and catalysis to energy harvesting and opto-electronics.</description>
