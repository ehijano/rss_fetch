      <title>Quasicrystal Scattering and the Riemann Zeta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I carry out numerical scattering calculations against a family of finite-length one-dimensional point-like arrangements of atoms, $\chi(x)$, related to the distribution of prime numbers by a shift operation making the atomic density approximately constant. I show how the Riemann Zeta Function (RZF) naturally parameterizes the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude and give numerical results.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Schrodinger's equation from the Hamilton-Jacobi and the Eikonal equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most authors of textbooks on quantum mechanics either postulate or sketch a short `ad hoc` derivation of Schrodinger's equation. In this work we give a detailed derivation of Schrodinger's equation from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the Eikonal equation in geometrical optics. We start from the historical debates on the nature of light -- whether it is a beam of particles, or waves in the aether. We derive the Eikonal equation and show the conditions when a wave can behave as a beam of particles. Then we discuss several experiments with an electron gun, that show clearly diffraction and interference of a single electron. Next, in order to explain these experiments, we derive Schrodinger's equation by comparing Hamilton-Jacobi equation in classical mechanics with the Eikonal equation in geometrical optics. To do that, we first show how to derive the wave equation from the Eikonal equation (not the other way around!). Second, we use this method to derive Schrodinger's equation from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Next, we derive Born's statistical rule using the early understanding of de Broglie that both particles and waves exist. Afterwards, we show that historically people preferred to remove the particles (as well as their trajectories) altogether from de Broglie's ideas but retained Born's rule (the so called Copenhagen interpretation). These derivations of the foundations of quantum mechanics do not follow precisely the history of the subject. Rather we select some early ideas and experiments in a judicious manner to present Schrodinger's equation in a logical and ordered way. We use the electron gun experiments instead of black body radiation and photoelectric effect. Our derivation may bring more light and satisfaction for the undergraduate students about the confusing and rather mysterious subject of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Symmetric-Cyclic Bidirectional Quantum Teleportation of Bell-like State via Entanglement-Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation is a primitive foundational protocol for exchanging quantum information in a quantum network as well as infrastructural operational strategy in the measurement-based quantum computation. Designing an efficient scheme for quantum teleportation is a vibrant field of intensive research. We propose a scheme wherein Bell-like states are being exchanged simultaneously in cyclic sequence, i.e., symmetric-cyclic bi-directional quantum teleportation, amongst three communicating parties forming a quantum network, Alice, Bob and Charlie via entanglement-swapping with the aid of a cluster of three maximally entangled GHZ-states as the quantum channel. Moreover, based upon communication- and operation- complexity, we compare our protocol with other equivalent protocols and found that the intrinsic efficiency of our protocol is maximum pegging at 33.33%.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Multiparty Quantum Teleportation Supervised by a Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum network harbours a technology of multiparty transmission and computation of quantum information. We here design a quantum circuit comprising of Hadamard and controlled-Not gates for preparation of a cluster state of symmetric and antisymmetric Bell pairs involving seventeen qubits which is later on utilized as a quantum channel. This seventeen qubits quantum channel is employed to strategize a simultaneous multiparty (quattro directional) quantum teleportation protocol in which four senders (Alice, Bob, Charlie and David) transmit their arbitrary unknown two-qubit states to respective four receivers (Fancy1, Fancy2, Fancy3 and Fancy4) under the supervision of a controller Elle. After successful accomplishment of the protocol, we assess and compare our scheme with contemporary protocols based on quantum (classical) resource consumption, transmitted qubits, operation complexity and efficiency. We found that intrinsic efficiency of our protocol pegs at 21.65 percent.</description>

      <title>Dynamical spectra from one and two-photon Fock state pulses exciting a single chiral qubit in a waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical light emission from few-photon Fock states in waveguide-QED with a chiral two-level system. We first investigate the time dynamics of the system by calculating the emitter population and illustrate the breakdown of the weak excitation approximation, for both 1-photon and 2-photon excitation. We show how a 1-photon pulse yields a transmitted long-time spectrum that is identical to the input pulse, despite significant population effects. However, the dynamical spectra and spectral intensity show rich population effects. We also show the differences between 1-photon and 2-photon excitation, where the latter shows clear signatures of nonlinear saturation effects. Analytical and numerically exact matrix product state solutions are shown.</description>

      <title>Theory and simulations of few-photon Fock state pulses strongly interacting with a single qubit in a waveguide: exact population dynamics and time-dependent spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed quantum theory and simulations of a few-photon Fock state pulse interacting with a two-level system (TLS) in a waveguide. For a rectangular pulse shape, we present an exact temporal scattering theory for the waveguide-QED system to derive analytical expressions for the TLS population, for 1-photon and 2-photon pulses, for both chiral and symmetric emitters. We also derive the stationary (long time) and time-dependent spectra for 1 photon excitation, and show how these differ at a fundamental level when connecting to TLS population effects. Numerically, we also present matrix product state (MPS) simulations, which allow us to compute more general photon correlation functions for arbitrary quantum pulses, and we use this approach to also show results for Gaussian quantum pulses, and to confirm the accuracy of our analytical results. In addition, we show how significant population TLS effects also occur for pulses relatively long compared to the radiative decay time (showing that a weak excitation approximation cannot be made), and investigate the population signatures, nonlinear features and dynamical behavior as a function of pulse length. These detailed theoretical results extend and complement our related Letter results [Arranz Regidor et al., unpublished, 2024].</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Using Repeated Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm based on repeated measurement to solve initial-value problems for nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which may be generated from partial differential equations in plasma physics. We map a dynamical system to a Hamiltonian form, where the Hamiltonian matrix is a function of dynamical variables. To advance in time, we measure expectation values from the previous time step, and evaluate the Hamiltonian function classically, which introduces stochasticity into the dynamics. We then perform standard quantum Hamiltonian simulation over a short time, using the evaluated constant Hamiltonian matrix. This approach requires evolving an ensemble of quantum states, which are consumed each step to measure required observables. We apply this approach to the classic logistic and Lorenz systems, in both integrable and chaotic regimes. Out analysis shows that solutions' accuracy is influenced by both the stochastic sampling rate and the nature of the dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo: A Hybrid Approach to Data Assimilation in 4DVAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QMCMC) with variational particle filters to tackle the computational challenges in Four-Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation (4DVAR). 4DVAR, widely used in numerical weather prediction, suffers from inefficiencies in high-dimensional, non-linear systems. Our approach, the Quantum Variational Particle Filter (QVPF), uses QAOA to optimize particle proposals and QMCMC to efficiently compute particle weights and resample, accelerating convergence while reducing the computational load.
  The QVPF framework addresses the curse of dimensionality by minimizing the number of particles required for accurate state estimation, thus improving efficiency in systems with complex dynamics. The hybrid model offers enhanced accuracy by integrating quantum algorithms into the variational particle filter, making it particularly suited for applications in climate modeling, space weather prediction, and defense. The potential for achieving unprecedented resolution in predictive models could transform sectors that rely on high-resolution forecasting.
  We present the mathematical foundations of the approach, along with discussions on algorithmic implementation and hardware requirements. Early results suggest that this hybrid framework could significantly improve data assimilation, with future implementations on near-term quantum devices offering a practical pathway for scaling up. This work demonstrates how quantum computing can address the growing need for more accurate and computationally feasible methods in large-scale data assimilation.</description>

      <title>Trotterless Simulation of Open Quantum Systems for NISQ Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum systems is one of the flagship applications of near-term NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) computing devices. Efficiently simulating the rich, non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems remains challenging on NISQ hardware. Current simulation methods for open quantum systems employ time-stepped Trotter product formulas ("Trotterization") which can scale poorly with respect to the simulation time and system dimension. Here, we propose a new simulation method based on the derivation of a Kraus operator series representation of the system. We identify a class of open quantum systems for which this method produces circuits of time-independent depth, which may serve as a desirable alternative to Trotterization, especially on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimization with globally driven neutral atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scalable encoding of combinatorial optimization problems with arbitrary connectivity, including higher-order terms, on arrays of trapped neutral atoms requiring only a global laser drive. Our approach relies on modular arrangements of a small number of problem-independent gadgets. These gadgets represent maximum-weight independent set (MWIS) problems on unit-disk graphs, which are native to such devices. Instead of programming MWIS weights with site-dependent laser detunings, the scheme relies on systematic placements of auxiliary atoms. We show, that these auxiliary atoms can be simultaneously used for both problem-specific programming and the mitigation of unwanted effects originating from the tails of long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Efficient self-consistent learning of gate set Pauli noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding quantum noise is an essential step towards building practical quantum information processing systems. Pauli noise is a useful model that has been widely applied in quantum benchmarking, error mitigation, and error correction. Despite intensive study, most existing works focus on learning Pauli noise channels associated with some specific gates rather than treating the gate set as a whole. A learning algorithm that is self-consistent, complete, and efficient at the same time is yet to be established. In this work, we study the task of gate set Pauli noise learning, where a set of quantum gates, state preparation, and measurements all suffer from unknown Pauli noise channels with a customized noise ansatz. Using tools from algebraic graph theory, we analytically characterize the self-consistently learnable degrees of freedom for Pauli noise models with arbitrary linear ansatz, and design experiments to efficiently learn all the learnable information. Specifically, we show that all learnable information about the gate noise can be learned to relative precision, under mild assumptions on the noise ansatz. We then demonstrate the flexibility of our theory by applying it to concrete physically motivated ansatzs (such as spatially local or quasi-local noise) and experimentally relevant gate sets (such as parallel CZ gates). These results not only enhance the theoretical understanding of quantum noise learning, but also provide a feasible recipe for characterizing existing and near-future quantum information processing devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo Integration for Simulation-Based Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of integrating quantum algorithms as subroutines of simulation-based optimisation problems with relevance to and potential applications in mathematical finance. To this end, we conduct a thorough analysis of all systematic errors arising in the formulation of quantum Monte Carlo integration in order to better understand the resources required to encode various distributions such as a Gaussian, and to evaluate statistical quantities such as the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of an asset. Finally, we study the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo integration for fundamental financial use cases in terms of simulation-based optimisations, notably Mean-Conditional-Value-at-Risk (Mean-CVaR) and (risky) Mean-Variance (Mean-Var) optimisation problems. In particular, we study the Mean-Var optimisation problem in the presence of noise on a quantum device, and benchmark a quantum error mitigation method that applies to quantum amplitude estimation -- a key subroutine of quantum Monte Carlo integration -- showcasing the utility of such an approach.</description>

      <title>Simulating Neutron Scattering on an Analog Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron scattering characterization of materials allows for the study of entanglement and microscopic structure, but is inefficient to simulate classically for comparison to theoretical models and predictions. However, quantum processors, notably analog quantum simulators, have the potential to offer an unprecedented, efficient method of Hamiltonian simulation by evolving a state in real time to compute phase transitions, dynamical properties, and entanglement witnesses. Here, we present a method for simulating neutron scattering on QuEra's Aquila processor by measuring the dynamic structure factor (DSF) for the prototypical example of the critical transverse field Ising chain, and propose a method for error mitigation. We provide numerical simulations and experimental results for the performance of the procedure on the hardware, up to a chain of length $L=25$. Additionally, the DSF result is used to compute the quantum Fisher information (QFI) density, where we confirm bipartite entanglement in the system experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for verifying the local unitary (LU) equivalence of graph and stabilizer states. Our approach reduces the problem to solving a system of linear equations in modular arithmetic. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any LU equivalence between two graph states takes a specific form, naturally generalizing the class of local Clifford (LC) equivalences. Lastly, using existing libraries, we verify that for up to $n=11$, the number of LU and LC orbits of stabilizer states is identical.</description>

      <title>Certified Randomness implies Secure Classical Position-Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liu et al. (ITCS22) initiated the study of designing a secure position verification protocol based on a specific proof of quantumness protocol and classical communication. In this paper, we study this interesting topic further and answer some of the open questions that are left in that paper. We provide a new generic compiler that can convert any single round proof of quantumness-based certified randomness protocol to a secure classical communication-based position verification scheme. Later, we extend our compiler to different kinds of multi-round proof of quantumness-based certified randomness protocols. Moreover, we instantiate our compiler with a random circuit sampling (RCS)-based certified randomness protocol proposed by Aaronson and Hung (STOC 23). RCS-based techniques are within reach of today's NISQ devices; therefore, our design overcomes the limitation of the Liu et al. protocol that would require a fault-tolerant quantum computer to realize. Moreover, this is one of the first cryptographic applications of RCS-based techniques other than certified randomness.</description>

      <title>Device-independent quantum secret sharing with advanced random key generation basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) enables a dealer to securely distribute keys to multiple players. Device-independent (DI) QSS can resist all possible attacks from practical imperfect devices and provide QSS the highest level of security in theory. However, DI QSS requires high-performance devices, especially for low-noise channels, which is a big challenge for its experimental demonstration. We propose a DI QSS protocol with the advanced random key generation basis strategy, which combines the random key generation basis with the noise preprocessing and postselection strategies. We develop the methods to simplify Eve's conditional entropy bound and numerically simulate the key generation rate in an acceptable time. Our DI QSS protocol has some advantages. First, it can increase the noise tolerance threshold from initial 7.147% to 9.231% (29.16% growth), and reduce the global detection efficiency threshold from 96.32% to 93.41%. The maximal distance between any two users increases to 1.43 km, which is about 5.5 times of the initial value. Second, by randomly selecting two basis combinations to generate the key, our DI QSS protocol can reduce the entanglement resource consumption. Our protocol has potential for DI QSS's experimental demonstration and application in the future.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum correlations in non-degenerate hyper-Raman process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Possibilities of observing single mode and intermodal quantum correlations (e.g., antibunching, steering and entanglement) are studied for a probed-hyper-Raman system with specific attention on the impact of a probe on the single and multi-mode quantum correlations generated in a hyper-Raman active system. The physical system studied here considers that the probe interacts continuously with the non-degenerate pump modes in the hyper-Raman active system via a nonlinear coupling. The investigation has revealed that quantum correlations in the Raman systems can be controlled using the probe. Further, it is observed that the quantum steering between the pump and anti-Stokes modes can be influenced significantly by controlling the interaction between the system and the probe. Unlike steering, probe could neither deteriorate the nonclassical correlations, namely intermodal entanglement and photon antibunching, nor induce them. Though the witness of the corresponding nonclassical effect depends on the initial state of the probe as well as the coupling strength</description>

      <title>Design the Quantum Instruction Set with the Cartan Coordinate Analysis Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most quantum compiling efforts rely on standard two-qubit basis gates, such as CX and iSWAP, to implement general quantum operations. However, with the advancement of quantum architecture design, more nonstandard two-qubit gates can now be implemented and calibrated on devices. Using these nonstandard gates may improve the performance of quantum computation. Despite this potential, it remains unclear how to efficiently incorporate these nonstandard gates into the quantum instruction set to enhance quantum advantage. To address this, we propose an analytical framework that facilitates the design of quantum instruction sets based on nonstandard gates. Our approach is grounded in the KAK decomposition and an analysis of the Cartan coordinate of two-qubit operations, enabling analytical conversion between any two two-qubit operations. This framework also demonstrates the lower and upper bounds of the conversion cost, revealing the relationship between the entangling power of two-qubit instructions and their Cartan coordinates. We further develop a compiler based on the analytical framework, which reduces the unitary decomposition cost with nonstandard two-qubit instructions. Using the proposed compiler, we evaluate various options for designing a quantum instruction set based on nonstandard gates. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in the quantum instruction set design. Compared to the state-of-the-art method that is based on the numerical search, our framework reduces the time/resource overhead of exploring the instruction set design space by thousands of times. Moreover, with the established framework, we propose feasible designs for the quantum instruction set by modeling real-world quantum processors, further promoting the quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Succinct Fermion Data Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating fermionic systems on a quantum computer requires representing fermionic states using qubits. The complexity of many simulation algorithms depends on the complexity of implementing rotations generated by fermionic creation-annihilation operators, and the space depends on the number of qubits used. While standard fermion encodings like Jordan-Wigner are space optimal for arbitrary fermionic systems, physical symmetries like particle conservation can reduce the number of physical configurations, allowing improved space complexity. Such space saving is only feasible if the gate overhead is small, suggesting a (quantum) data structures problem, wherein one would like to minimize space used to represent a fermionic state, while still enabling efficient rotations. We define a structure which naturally captures mappings from fermions to systems of qubits. We then instantiate it in two ways, giving rise to two new second-quantized fermion encodings of $F$ fermions in $M$ modes. An information theoretic minimum of $\mathcal{I}:=\lceil\log \binom{M}{F}\rceil$ qubits is required for such systems, a bound we nearly match over the entire parameter regime.
  (1) Our first construction uses $\mathcal I+o(\mathcal I)$ qubits when $F=o(M)$, and allows rotations generated by creation-annihilation operators in $O(\mathcal I)$ gates and $O(\log M \log \log M)$ depth.
  (2) Our second construction uses $\mathcal I+O(1)$ qubits when $F=\Theta(M)$, and allows rotations generated by creation-annihilation operators in $O(\mathcal I^3)$ gates.
  In relation to comparable prior work, the first represents a polynomial improvement in both space and gate complexity (against Kirby et al. 2022), and the second represents an exponential improvement in gate complexity at the cost of only a constant number of additional qubits (against Harrison et al. or Shee et al. 2022), in the described parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>A comparison on constrain encoding methods for quantum approximate optimization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) represents a significant opportunity for practical quantum computing applications, particularly in the era before error correction is fully realized. This algorithm is especially relevant for addressing constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), which are critical in various fields such as supply chain management, energy distribution, and financial modeling. In our study, we conduct a numerical comparison of three different strategies for incorporating linear constraints into QAOA: transforming them into an unconstrained format, introducing penalty dephasing, and utilizing the quantum Zeno effect. We assess the efficiency and effectiveness of these methods using the knapsack problem as a case study. Our findings provide insights into the potential applicability of different encoding methods for various use cases.</description>

      <title>Taming plasmonic nanocavities for subradiant entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent rapid advances in quantum nanoplasmonics offer the potential for accessing quantum phenomena at room temperature. Despite this, entangled states have not yet been realised, and remain an outstanding challenge. In this work, we demonstrate how entanglement emerges in plasmonic nanocavities, which are inherently multi-mode, and demonstrate the conditions necessary for entanglement to persist. We find that, in general, these conditions are broken due to coupling with multiple plasmonic modes of different parity. We address this challenge with a new nanocavity design that supports high selective coupling to a single mode, enabling the robust generation of subradiant entanglement in nanoplasmonics. Our results open exciting prospects for leveraging simple plasmonic setups in ambient conditions for applications in quantum communication, sensing and rapid quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Sharp finite statistics for minimum data block sizes in quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) heavily depends on the finite statistics of its security proof. For multiple protocols and proof techniques, the central statistical task is a random sampling problem, which is customarily addressed by invoking suitable tail bounds on the hypergeometric distribution. In this work, we introduce an alternative solution that exploits a link between random sampling with and without replacement. Despite its simplicity, it notably boosts the achievable secret key rate, particularly in the regime of small data block sizes critical for satellite QKD and other envisioned QKD applications. Moreover, as a by-product of the proposed tool, tight Neyman constructions are derived for the average of independent Bernoulli variables. Bounds of this kind naturally fit in finite-key security proofs of decoy-state QKD schemes, further sharpening the finite statistics compared to previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum Stirling heat engine based on Two-qubit Quantum Rabi Model with Spin-Spin Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the efficiency of quantum heat engines (QHEs) is crucial for advancing fundamental research and quantum technology.We here we explore a quantum Stirling cycle using a twoqubit quantum Rabi model with spin-spin coupling as a working medium. We propose parameter optimization strategies to maximize the efficiency of the heat engine, as there are multiple ways for the effective coupling constant to move toward its critical value. In the normal phase of the system, the efficiency can be improved by increasing the temperature ratio of hot-to-cold reservoirs and enhancing spin-mode coupling strength. However, increasing spin-spin coupling strength inhibits the improvement of the efficiency. As the system goes to its critical point, QHE efficiency under low-temperature conditions tends to the Carnot limit. In the superradiant phase, the efficiency approaches the Carnot limit more closely as the cold reservoir's temperature decreases given a constant temperature ratio. Conversely, when the cold reservoir's temperature rises, the efficiency increases due to a higher ratio of spin-mode coupling strength to mode frequency. If the spinspin coupling strength is constant, increasing the hot-to-cold reservoir temperature ratio requires a corresponding increase in spin-mode coupling strength to achieve the Carnot efficiency. Our work deepens the understanding of QHE performance under various conditions and provides operative methods for optimizing the efficiency of QHE.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted Quantum Error Correcting Code Saturating The Classical Singleton Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a construction for entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) that saturates the classical Singleton bound with less shared entanglement than any known method for code rates below $\frac{k}{n} = \frac{1}{3}$. For higher rates, our EAQECC also meets the Singleton bound, although with increased entanglement requirements. Additionally, we demonstrate that any classical $[n,k,d]_q$ code can be transformed into an EAQECC with parameters $[[n,k,d;2k]]_q$ using $2k$ pre-shared maximally entangled pairs. The complexity of our encoding protocol for $k$-qudits with $q$ levels is $O(k \log_{\frac{q}{q-1}}(k))$, excluding the complexity of encoding and decoding the MDS code. While this complexity remains linear in $k$ for systems of reasonable size, it increases significantly for larger-levelled systems, highlighting the need for further research into complexity reduction.</description>

      <title>Limited Parallelization in Gate Operations Leads to Higher Space Overhead and Lower Noise Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence of qubits during gate operations in the error correction phase of fault-tolerant computation is significant since, in practice, gate operations are neither instantaneous nor are they sufficiently parallelized. Thus, in practice, the overhead of a fault-tolerant scheme should depend on the level of parallelization, the speed of gate operations, and the rate of decoherence. In this paper, we obtain a lower bound on the required space overhead for any fault-tolerant technique when the decoherence process is Markov and the errors are either erasure or depolarization. An implication of this bound is that the noise or decoherence threshold, i.e., the noise beyond which no reliable memory (circuit) can be realized, decreases with a decrease in the level of parallelization in gate operations. Also, the noise threshold approaches zero as the level of parallelization approaches zero, implying that any fault-tolerant implementations must strive for sufficient parallelization in gate operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though known to be present, the accessibility of spacelike vacuum entanglement capable of being a fundamental resource for quantum information processing has remained in question at distances beyond the scale of vacuum fluctuations in massive fields. For a broad subclass of physical many-body mixed Gaussian states, including the free scalar field vacuum, the logarithmic negativity is here shown to be a necessary and sufficient measure of entanglement and to be entirely accessible by pairs of single-mode detectors in the continuum. By deriving exact and optimal detection profiles, entanglement resources in the massive field are demonstrated to be available at all distances.</description>

      <title>Binet-Fibonacci Calculus and N = 2 Supersymmetric Golden Quantum Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Binet-Fibonacci calculus, as $\varphi \varphi'$ - two base quantum calculus, relates Fibonacci derivative with Binet formula of Fibonacci number operator, acting in Fock space of quantum states. It provides a tool to study the Golden oscillator with energy spectrum in form of Fibonacci numbers. Here we generalize this model to supersymmetric number operator and corresponding Binet formula for supersymmetric Fibonacci operator ${\cal F}_{\cal N}$. It determines the Hamiltonian of supersymmetric Golden oscillator, acting in $H_f \otimes H_b$ - fermion-boson Hilbert space and belonging to $N=2$ supersymmetric algebra. Trace on fermions of this model reduces the Hamiltonian to the Golden oscillator. The eigenstates of the super Fibonacci number operator are double degenerate and can be characterized by a point on the super-Bloch sphere. By the supersymmetric Fibonacci annihilation operator, we construct the supersymmetric coherent states as eigenstates of this operator. Entanglement of fermions with bosons in these states is calculated by the concurrence, represented by the Gram determinant and Fibonacci exponential functions. These functions have been appeared as descriptive for inner product of the Golden coherent states in Fock-Bargmann representation. We show that the reference state, coming from the limit $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ and corresponding von Neumann entropy, measuring fermion-boson entanglement, are characterized completely by the Golden ratio.</description>

      <title>Lazy Qubit Reordering for Accelerating Parallel State-Vector-based Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes two quantum operation scheduling methods for accelerating parallel state-vector-based quantum circuit simulation using multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). The proposed methods reduce all-to-all communication caused by qubit reordering (QR), which can dominate the overhead of parallel simulation. Our approach eliminates redundant QRs by introducing intentional delays in QR communications such that multiple QRs can be aggregated into a single QR. The delays are carefully introduced based on the principles of time-space tiling, or a cache optimization technique for classical computers, which we use to arrange the execution order of quantum operations. Moreover, we present an extended scheduling method for the hierarchical interconnection of GPU cluster systems to avoid slow inter-node communication. We develop these methods tailored for two primary procedures in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulation: quantum state update (QSU) and expectation value computation (EVC). Experimental validation on 32-GPU executions demonstrates acceleration in QSU and EVC -- up to 54$\times$ and 606$\times$, respectively -- compared to existing methods. Moreover, our extended scheduling method further reduced communication time by up to 15\% in a two-layered interconnected cluster system. Our approach is useful for any quantum circuit simulations, including QSU and/or EVC.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Quantum Computational Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing involving physical systems with continuous degrees of freedom, such as the quantum states of light, has recently attracted significant interest. However, a well-defined quantum complexity theory for these bosonic computations over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces is missing. In this work, we lay foundations for such a research program. We introduce natural complexity classes and problems based on bosonic generalizations of BQP, the local Hamiltonian problem, and QMA. We uncover several relationships and subtle differences between standard Boolean classical and discrete variable quantum complexity classes and identify outstanding open problems. In particular:
  1. We show that the power of quadratic (Gaussian) quantum dynamics is equivalent to the class BQL. More generally, we define classes of continuous-variable quantum polynomial time computations with a bounded probability of error based on higher-degree gates. Due to the infinite dimensional Hilbert space, it is not a priori clear whether a decidable upper bound can be obtained for these classes. We identify complete problems for these classes and demonstrate a BQP lower and EXPSPACE upper bound. We further show that the problem of computing expectation values of polynomial bosonic observables is in PSPACE.
  2. We prove that the problem of deciding the boundedness of the spectrum of a bosonic Hamiltonian is co-NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that the problem of finding the minimum energy of a bosonic Hamiltonian critically depends on the non-Gaussian stellar rank of the family of energy-constrained states one optimizes over: for constant stellar rank, it is NP-complete; for polynomially-bounded rank, it is in QMA; for unbounded rank, it is undecidable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate optical sensing and micromanipulation requires sensitive measurements of the position, orientation, and dynamics of small particles--and sometimes even large objects--under consideration. The signals acquired in the process, including those needed for the feedback control of these particles and objects, are inevitably contaminated by quantum fluctuations and noise that accompany the physical processes of optical interference and photodetection (or photon counting). This paper explores the origins of signal fluctuation and quantum noise that are inevitably associated with such sensitive measurements.</description>

      <title>Spectral Densities, Structured Noise and Ensemble Averaging within Open Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent advances in simulating open quantum systems have lead to significant progress, the applicability of numerically exact methods is still restricted to rather small systems. Hence, more approximate methods remain relevant due to their computational efficiency, enabling simulations of larger systems over extended timescales. In this study, we present advances for one such method, namely the Numerical Integration of Schr\"odinger Equation (NISE). Firstly, we introduce a modified ensemble-averaging procedure that improves the long-time behavior of the thermalized variant of the NISE scheme, termed Thermalized NISE. Secondly, we demonstrate how to use the NISE in conjunction with (highly) structured spectral densities by utilizing a noise generating algorithm for arbitrary structured noise. This algorithm also serves as a tool for establishing best practices in determining spectral densities from excited state calculations along molecular dynamics or quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics trajectories. Finally, we assess the ability of the NISE approach to calculate absorption spectra and demonstrate the utility of the proposed modifications by determining population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Average Hamiltonian Theory for Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of average Hamiltonian theory (AHT) to magnetic resonance and quantum sensing informs pulse sequence design, for example, by providing efficient approximations of spin dynamics while retaining important physical characteristics of system evolution. However, AHT predictions break down in many common experimental conditions, including for sensing with solid-state spins. Here we establish that certain symmetries, such as rapid echos, allow AHT to remain accurate well beyond the perturbative limit. An exact method is presented to determine the sensor response to a target signal, which stays valid beyond the regime of AHT convergence. This beyond AHT approach enables new opportunities in quantum control techniques that leverage complementary analytical and numerical methods, with applications in a variety of quantum sensing platforms, Hamiltonian engineering, and probes of quantum many-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>Operational meaning of the fidelity and the Fisher-Bures path length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the minimum entropy production in near-reversible quantum state transport along a path is a simple function of the path length measured according to the Fisher--Bures metrics. Consequently, the minimum entropy production along a geodesics is the simple function of fidelity. Hence the sharp values of path lengths, also called statistical lengths, and of fidelities obtain operational meaning to quantify the residual irreversibility in near-reversible state transport. Compared to fidelity's operative interpretations based on Uhlmann's theorem, our proposal does not assume extended operations on the purified states. As to the classical limit, the Bhattacharryya fidelity obtains a sharp operational meaning after eighty years.</description>

      <title>Strongest quantum nonlocality in $N$-partite systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of orthogonal states possesses the strongest quantum nonlocality if only a trivial orthogonality-preserving positive operator-valued measure (POVM) can be performed for each bipartition of the subsystems. This concept originated from the strong quantum nonlocality proposed by Halder $et~al.$ [Phy. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{122}$, 040403 (2019)], which is a stronger manifestation of nonlocality based on locally indistinguishability and finds more efficient applications in quantum information hiding. However, demonstrating the triviality of orthogonality-preserving local measurements (OPLMs) is not straightforward. In this paper, we present a sufficient and necessary condition for trivial OPLMs in $N$-partite systems under certain conditions. By using our proposed condition, we deduce the minimum size of set with the strongest nonlocality in system $(\mathbb{C}^{3})^{\otimes N}$, where the genuinely entangled sets constructed in Ref. [Phys. Rev. A $\textbf{109}$, 022220 (2024)] achieve this value. As it is known that studying construction involving fewer states with strongest nonlocality contribute to reducing resource consumption in applications. Furthermore, we construct strongest nonlocal genuinely entangled sets in system $(\mathbb{C}^{d})^{\otimes N}~(d\geq4)$, which have a smaller size than the existing strongest nonlocal genuinely entangled sets as $N$ increases. Consequently, our results contribute to a better understanding of strongest nonlocality.</description>

      <title>Random non-Hermitian Hamiltonian framework for symmetry breaking dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose random non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to model the generic stochastic nonlinear dynamics of a quantum state in Hilbert space. Our approach features an underlying linearity in the dynamical equations, ensuring the applicability of techniques used for solving linear systems. Additionally, it offers the advantage of easily incorporating statistical symmetry, a generalization of explicit symmetry to stochastic processes. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to describe real-time dynamics, starting from an initial symmetry-preserving state and evolving into a randomly distributed, symmetry-breaking final state. Our model serves as a quantum framework for the transition process, from disordered states to ordered ones, where symmetry is spontaneously broken.</description>

      <title>Engineering Si-Qubit MOSFETs: A Phase-Field Modeling Approach Integrating Quantum-Electrostatics at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs advanced phase-field modeling to investigate Si-based qubit MOSFETs, integrating electrostatics and quantum mechanical effects. We adopt a comprehensive modeling approach, utilizing full-wave treatment of the Schrodinger equation solutions, coupled with the Poisson equation at cryogenic temperatures. Our analysis explores the influence of interface traps on quantum dot (QD) barrier heights, affecting coupling due to tunneling. A wider trap distribution leads to the decoupling of quantum dots. Furthermore, the oscillations in the transmission and reflection coefficients increase as the plunger/barrier gate length increases, reducing the coupling between the QDs. By optimizing plunger and barrier gate dimensions, spacer configurations, and gap oxide lengths, we enhance control over quantum well depths and minimize unwanted wave function leakage. The modeling algorithm is also validated against the experimental data and can accurately capture the oscillations in the Id Vgs caused by the Coulomb blockade at cryogenic temperature</description>

      <title>Geometry and Entanglement of Super-Qubit Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the super-qubit quantum state, determined by superposition of the zero and the one super-particle states, which can be represented by points on the super-Bloch sphere. In contrast to the one qubit case, the one super-particle state is characterized by points in extended complex plain, equivalent to another super-Bloch sphere. Then, geometrically, the super-qubit quantum state is represented by two unit spheres, or the direct product of two Bloch spheres. By using the displacement operator, acting on the super-qubit state as the reference state, we construct the super-coherent states, becoming eigenstates of the super-annihilation operator, and characterized by three complex numbers, the displacement parameter and stereographic projections of two super-Bloch spheres. The states are fermion-boson entangled, and the concurrence of states is the product of two concurrences, corresponding to two Bloch spheres. We show geometrical meaning of concurrence as distance from point-state on the sphere to vertical axes - the radius of circle at horizontal plane through the point-state. Then, probabilities of collapse to the north pole state and to the south pole state are equal to half-distances from vertical coordinate of the state to corresponding points at the poles. For complimentary fermion number operator, we get the flipped super-qubit state and corresponding super-coherent state, as eigenstate of transposed super-annihilation operator. The infinite set of Fibonacci oscillating circles in complex plain, and corresponding set of quantum states with uncertainty relations as the ratio of two Fibonacci numbers, and in the limit at infinity becoming the Golden Ratio uncertainty, is derived.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Learning Efficiently Generatable Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the computational complexity of learning efficient classical programs in various learning models has been a fundamental and important question in classical computational learning theory. In this work, we study the computational complexity of quantum state learning, which can be seen as a quantum generalization of distributional learning introduced by Kearns et.al [STOC94]. Previous works by Chung and Lin [TQC21], and B\u{a}descu and O$'$Donnell [STOC21] study the sample complexity of the quantum state learning and show that polynomial copies are sufficient if unknown quantum states are promised efficiently generatable. However, their algorithms are inefficient, and the computational complexity of this learning problem remains unresolved.
  In this work, we study the computational complexity of quantum state learning when the states are promised to be efficiently generatable. We show that if unknown quantum states are promised to be pure states and efficiently generateable, then there exists a quantum polynomial time algorithm $A$ and a language $L \in PP$ such that $A^L$ can learn its classical description. We also observe the connection between the hardness of learning quantum states and quantum cryptography. We show that the existence of one-way state generators with pure state outputs is equivalent to the average-case hardness of learning pure states. Additionally, we show that the existence of EFI implies the average-case hardness of learning mixed states.</description>

      <title>Recipe for observing immediate entanglement death-birth transition through Bell states with environmental Heisenberg exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environment is known to play a dual role in both extinguishing and establishing entanglement, leading to entanglement sudden death (ESD) and entanglement sudden birth (ESB). In this paper, we propose a recipe for the initial states of two qubits to undergo ESD, ESB, or transition of finite duration (TFD) between them. While this recipe is generic, a spin-star model coupled to the environment via Heisenberg exchange is chosen for illustration. Utilizing the Bell states, we introduce the entanglement switch parameter (ESP), whose sign indicates whether the qubit bipartite entanglement is switched on or off. The classical (quantum) weighting of the Bell states encodes the ESP for initial mixed (pure) states. When more than two Bell states are adopted, the ESP permits states to penetrate through the entanglement-unentanglement boundary. In this case, the penetrability of a small ESP ensures the immediate occurrence of ESD or ESB and indicates the TFD if the local time-even symmetry in the entanglement monotone is also satisfied. When no more than two Bell states are employed, the penetrability is lost, and TFD is only identified in some mixed states but not in pure states. For pure states, the environmental quantum degrees of freedom are associated with the number of Bell states. Thanks to the simplicity of this model, analytic results are provided. We also analyze the symmetries that can convert or alter ESD into ESB, and vice versa. The recipe enhances the controllability of entanglement dynamics and facilitates entanglement engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms for Maxmimum Cut on Low-Girth Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum cut (MaxCut) on graphs is a classic NP-hard problem. In quantum computing, Farhi, Gutmann, and Goldstone proposed the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for solving the MaxCut problem. Its guarantee on cut fraction (the fraction of edges in the output cut over all edges) was mainly studied for high-girth graphs, i.e., graphs with only long cycles. On the other hand, low-girth graphs are ubiquitous in theoretical computer science, including expander graphs being outstanding examples with wide applications in theory and beyond. In this paper, we apply QAOA to MaxCut on a set of expander graphs proposed by Mohanty and O'Donnell known as additive product graphs. Additionally, we apply multi-angle QAOA (ma-QAOA) to better utilize the graph structure of additive product graphs in ansatz design. In theory, we derive an iterative formula to calculate the expected cut fraction of such graphs. On the other hand, we conduct numerical experiments to compare between best-known classical local algorithms and QAOA with constant depth. Our results demonstrate that QAOA outperforms the best-known classical algorithms by 0.3% to 5.2% on several additive product graphs, while ma-QAOA further enhances this advantage by an additional 0.6% to 2.5%. In particular, we observe cases that ma-QAOA exhibits superiority over best-known classical algorithms but QAOA does not. Furthermore, we extend our experiments to planar graphs such as tiling grid graphs, where QAOA also demonstrates an advantage.</description>

      <title>The aspect of bipartite coherence in quantum discord to semi-device-independent nonlocality and its implication for quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum discord can demonstrate quantum nonlocality in the context of a semi-device-independent Bell or steering scenario, i.e., by assuming only the Hilbert-space dimension. This work addresses which aspect of bipartite coherence is essential to such semi-device-independent quantum information tasks going beyond standard Bell nonlocality or quantum steering. It has been shown that the global coherence of a single system can be transformed into bipartite entanglement. However, global coherence can also be present in quantum discord. At the same time, discord can display bipartite coherence locally, i.e., only in a subsystem or both subsystems. Thus, global coherence of bipartite separable states is defined here as a form of bipartite coherence that is not reducible to local coherence in any of the subsystems or both subsystems. To operationally identify such a notion of global coherence in discord, we demonstrate that global coherence is necessary to demonstrate semi-device-independent nonlocality of quantum discord in Bell or steering scenarios. From this result, it follows that any local operations of the form $\Phi_A \otimes \Phi_B$ that may create coherence locally are free operations in the resource theory of semi-device-independent nonlocality of discord. Applying this resource theory, it is identified that the quantum nonlocality beyond quantum steering acts as a resource for the quantum communication task of remote state preparation using two-qubit separable states.</description>

      <title>QKAN: Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of learning models in quantum hardware remains an open question. Yet, the field of quantum machine learning persistently explores how these models can take advantage of quantum implementations. Recently, a new neural network architecture, called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), has emerged, inspired by the compositional structure of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. In this work, we design a quantum version of KAN called QKAN. Our QKAN exploits powerful quantum linear algebra tools, including quantum singular value transformation, to apply parameterized activation functions on the edges of the network. QKAN is based on block-encodings, making it inherently suitable for direct quantum input. Furthermore, we analyze its asymptotic complexity, building recursively from a single layer to an end-to-end neural architecture. The gate complexity of QKAN scales linearly with the cost of constructing block-encodings for input and weights, suggesting broad applicability in tasks with high-dimensional input. QKAN serves as a trainable quantum machine learning model by combining parameterized quantum circuits with established quantum subroutines. Lastly, we propose a multivariate state preparation strategy based on the construction of the QKAN architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state discrimination is a fundamental task that is meaningful in quantum information theory. In this manuscript, we consider a revised unambiguous discrimination of quantum resources. First, we present an upper bound of the success probability for a revised unambiguous discrimination task in the unasymptotic and asymptotic scenarios. Next, we generalize the task from quantum states to quantum channels. We present an upper bound of the success probability for the task under the adaptive strategy. Furthermore, we show the bound can be computed efficiently. Finally, compared with the classical unambiguous discrimination, we show the advantage of the quantum by considering a quantifier on a set of semidefinite positive operators.</description>

      <title>Efficient characterization of spatial Schmidt modes of multiphoton entangled states produced from high-gain parametric down-conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to efficiently characterize the spatial correlations of entangled states of light is critical for applications of many quantum technologies such as quantum imaging. Here, we demonstrate highly efficient theoretical and experimental characterization of the spatial Schmidt modes and the Schmidt spectrum of bright multiphoton entangled states of light produced from high-gain parametric down-conversion. In contrast to previous studies, we exploit the approximate quasihomogeneity and isotropy of the signal field and dramatically reduce the numerical computations involved in the experimental and theoretical characterization procedures. In our particular case where our experimental data sets consist of 5000 single-shot images of 256*256 pixels each, our method reduced the overall computation time by 2 orders of magnitude. This speed-up would be even more dramatic for larger input sizes. Consequently, we are able to rapidly characterize the Schmidt modes and Schmidt spectrum for a range of pump amplitudes and study their variation with increasing gain. Our results clearly reveal the broadening of the Schmidt modes and narrowing of the Schmidt spectrum for increasing gain with good agreement between theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Multi-Time Version of the Landau-Peierls Formulation of Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau and Peierls wrote down the Hamiltonian of a simplified version of quantum electrodynamics in the particle-position representation. We present a multi-time version of their Schr\"odinger equation, which bears several advantages over their original equation: the time evolution equations are simpler and more natural; they are more transparent with respect to choice of gauge; and, perhaps most importantly, they are manifestly Lorentz covariant. We discuss properties of the multi-time equations. Along the way, we also discuss the Lorentz covariant 3d Dirac delta distribution for spacelike surfaces and the inner product of photon wave functions on spacelike surfaces in an arbitrary gauge.</description>

      <title>Unitary Closed Timelike Curves can Solve all of NP</title>

Abstract: Born in the intersection between quantum mechanics and general relativity, indefinite causal structure is the idea that in the continuum of time, some sets of events do not have an inherent causal order between them. Process matrices, introduced by Oreshkov, Costa and Brukner (Nature Communications, 2012), define quantum information processing with indefinite causal structure -- a generalization of the operations allowed in standard quantum information processing, and to date, are the most studied such generalization.
  Araujo et al. (Physical Review A, 2017) defined the computational complexity of process matrices, and showed that polynomial-time process matrix computation is equivalent to standard polynomial-time quantum computation with access to a weakening of post-selection Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs), that are restricted to be $\textit{linear}$. Araujo et al. accordingly defined the complexity class for efficient process matrix computation as $\mathbf{BQP}_{\ell CTC}$ (which trivially contains $\mathbf{BQP}$), and posed the open question of whether $\mathbf{BQP}_{\ell CTC}$ contains computational tasks that are outside $\mathbf{BQP}$.
  In this work we solve this open question under a widely believed hardness assumption, by showing that $\mathbf{NP} \subseteq \mathbf{BQP}_{\ell CTC}$. Our solution is captured by an even more restricted subset of process matrices that are purifiable (Araujo et al., Quantum, 2017), which (1) is conjectured more likely to be physical than arbitrary process matrices, and (2) is equivalent to polynomial-time quantum computation with access to $\textit{unitary}$ (which are in particular linear) post-selection CTCs. Conceptually, our work shows that the previously held belief, that non-linearity is what enables CTCs to solve $\mathbf{NP}$, is false, and raises the importance of understanding whether purifiable process matrices are physical or not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of mutual information, entanglement negativity, and multipartite correlations in holographic RG flows, particularly during phase transitions. Mutual information provides a UV-finite measure of total correlations between subsystems, while entanglement negativity and multipartite correlations offer finer insights into quantum structures, especially near critical points. Through numerical simulations, we show that while mutual information remains relatively smooth, both entanglement negativity and multipartite correlations exhibit sharp changes near phase transitions. These results support the hypothesis that multipartite correlations play a dominant role in signaling critical phenomena in strongly coupled quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Positive Conserved Quantities in the Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an embedding of the Klein-Gordon equation into a pair of coupled equations that are first-order in time. The existence of such an embedding is based on a positivity property exhibited by the Klein-Gordon equation. These coupled equations provide a more satisfactory reduction of the Klein-Gordon equation to first-order differential equations in time than the Schrodinger equation. Using this embedding, we show that the "negative probabilities" associated with the Klein-Gordon equation do not need to be resolved by introducing matrices as Dirac did with his eponymous equation. For the case of the massive Klein-Gordon equation, the coupled equations are equivalent to a forward Schrodinger equation in time and a backward Schrodinger equation in time, respectively, corresponding to a particle and its antiparticle. We show that there are two positive integrals that are conserved (constant in time) in the Klein-Gordon equation and thus provide a concrete resolution of the historical puzzle regarding the previously supposed lack of a probabilistic interpretation for the field governed by the Klein-Gordon equation.</description>

Abstract: In this note we prove a necessary set of conditions which must be satisfied by any controlled gate in the qubit Clifford Hierarchy. These conditions are straightforward to derive yet quite restricting. We also extend our proofs to gates composed of certain direct sums of unitaries. Finally, we provide some evidence that these conditions are also sufficient.</description>

      <title>Quantum Group Actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum cryptography, there could be a new world, Microcrypt, where cryptography is possible but one-way functions (OWFs) do not exist. Although many fundamental primitives and useful applications have been found in Microcrypt, they lack ``OWFs-free'' concrete hardness assumptions on which they are based. In classical cryptography, many hardness assumptions on concrete mathematical problems have been introduced, such as the discrete logarithm (DL) problems or the decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) problems on concrete group structures related to finite fields or elliptic curves. They are then abstracted to generic hardness assumptions such as the DL and DDH assumptions over group actions. Finally, based on these generic assumptions, primitives and applications are constructed. The goal of the present paper is to introduce several abstracted generic hardness assumptions in Microcrypt, which could connect the concrete mathematical hardness assumptions with applications. Our assumptions are based on a quantum analogue of group actions. A group action is a tuple $(G,S,\star)$ of a group $G$, a set $S$, and an operation $\star:G\times S\to S$. We introduce a quantum analogue of group actions, which we call quantum group actions (QGAs), where $G$ is a set of unitary operators, $S$ is a set of states, and $\star$ is the application of a unitary on a state. By endowing QGAs with some reasonable hardness assumptions, we introduce a natural quantum analogue of the decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption and pseudorandom group actions. Based on these assumptions, we construct classical-query pseudorandom function-like state generators (PRFSGs). Because classical group actions are instantiated with many concrete mathematical hardness assumptions, our QGAs could also have some concrete (even OWFs-free) instantiations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A particle-hole symmetry protected 2D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is investigated. This version differs from the usual Hermitian version by the inclusion of gain and/or loss terms which are represented by complex on-site potentials. The exceptional points occur, when the dimensionless potential magnitude and the hopping amplitudes become close to unity, leading to the coalescence of eigenvalues and nontrivial eigenvector degeneracies. Furthermore, the vectored Zak phase quantization has been obtained and a topolectric RLC circuit has been analysed. If realized experimentally (in photonic and acoustic crystals), the quantization is expected to lead to an extended bulk-boundary correspondence.</description>

      <title>STIRAP-Inspired Robust Gates for a Superconducting Dual-Rail Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: STImulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) is a powerful technique for robust state transfer capabilities in quantum systems. This method, however encounters challenges for its implementation as a gate in qubit-subspace due to its sensitivity to initial states. By incorporating single-photon detuning into the protocol, the sensitivity to the initial state can effectively be mitigated, enabling STIRAP to operate as a gate. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the implementation of robust $\pi$ and $\pi$/2 rotations in a dual-rail qubit formed by two strongly coupled fixed-frequency transmon qubits. We achieve state preparation fidelity in excess of 0.98 using such rotations. Our analysis reveals these gates exhibit significant resilience to errors. Furthermore, our numerical calculations confirm that these gates can achieve fidelity levels in excess of 0.999. This work suggest a way for realizing quantum gates which are robust against minor drifts in pulse or system parameters.</description>

      <title>Resolvent-based quantum phase estimation: Towards estimation of parametrized eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for estimating the eigenvalues of matrices, including the phase estimation algorithm, serve as core subroutines in a wide range of quantum algorithms, including those in quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning. In standard quantum eigenvalue (phase) estimation, a Hermitian (unitary) matrix and a state in an unknown superposition of its eigenstates are provided, with the objective of estimating and coherently recording the corresponding real eigenvalues (eigenphases) in an ancillary register. Estimating eigenvalues of non-normal matrices presents unique challenges, as the eigenvalues may lie anywhere on the complex plane. Furthermore, the non-orthogonality of eigenvectors and the existence of generalized eigenvectors complicate the implementation of matrix functions. In this work, we propose a novel approach for estimating the eigenvalues of non-normal matrices based on the matrix resolvent formalism. We construct the first efficient algorithm for estimating the phases of the unit-norm eigenvalues of a given non-unitary matrix. We then construct an efficient algorithm for estimating the real eigenvalues of a given non-Hermitian matrix, achieving complexities that match the best known results while operating under significantly relaxed assumptions on the non-real part of the spectrum. The resolvent-based approach that we introduce also extends to estimating eigenvalues that lie on a parametrized complex curve, subject to explicitly stated conditions, thereby paving the way for a new paradigm of parametric eigenvalue estimation.</description>

      <title>Gibbs state preparation for commuting Hamiltonian: Mapping to classical Gibbs sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gibbs state reparation, or Gibbs sampling, is a key computational technique extensively used in physics, statistics, and other scientific fields. Recent efforts for designing fast mixing Gibbs samplers for quantum Hamiltonians have largely focused on commuting local Hamiltonians (CLHs), a non-trivial subclass of Hamiltonians which include highly entangled systems such as the Toric code and quantum double model. Most previous Gibbs samplers relied on simulating the Davies generator, which is a Lindbladian associated with the thermalization process in nature.
  Instead of using the Davies generator, we design a different Gibbs sampler for various CLHs by giving a reduction to classical Hamiltonians, in the sense that one can efficiently prepare the Gibbs state for some CLH $H$ on a quantum computer as long as one can efficiently do classical Gibbs sampling for the corresponding classical Hamiltonian $H^{(c)}$. We demonstrate that our Gibbs sampler is able to replicate state-of-the-art results as well as prepare the Gibbs state in regimes which were previously unknown, such as the low temperature region, as long as there exists fast mixing Gibbs samplers for the corresponding classical Hamiltonians. Our reductions are as follows.
  - If $H$ is a 2-local qudit CLH, then $H^{(c)}$ is a 2-local qudit classical Hamiltonian.
  - If $H$ is a 4-local qubit CLH on 2D lattice and there are no classical qubits, then $H^{(c)}$ is a 2-local qudit classical Hamiltonian on a planar graph. As an example, our algorithm can prepare the Gibbs state for the (defected) Toric code at any non-zero temperature in $\mathcal O(n^2)$ time.
  - If $H$ is a 4-local qubit CLH on 2D lattice and there are classical qubits, assuming that quantum terms are uniformly correctable, then $H^{(c)}$ is a constant-local classical Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Quantum energy teleportation via random bi-partitioning in N-qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates quantum energy teleportation (QET) using stochastic bi-partitioning in an $N-$body Hamiltonian system. In this protocol, project measurements are performed on $(N - m)$ qubits to capture quantum fluctuation information of the $N-$qubit ground state during external energy injection. Significantly, the information reaches the sites of the remaining $m$ qubits faster than the energy diffuses, allowing for extracting the ground state energy through local operations. Our results show that increasing the number of qubits $N$ enhances the available energy for QET, with efficiency peaking when $(N - 1)$ qubits are inputs and one is an output. We also find a strong correlation between energy transfer efficiency and ground-state entanglement. Increasing the parameter $\frac{k}{h}$ improves both efficiency and entanglement until reaching a plateau. Overall, more qubits lead to higher energy transfer efficiency and entanglement, highlighting their critical roles in QET performance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walk Search on Complete Multipartite Graph with Multiple Marked Vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walk is a potent technique for building quantum algorithms. This paper examines the quantum walk search algorithm on complete multipartite graphs with multiple marked vertices, which has not been explored before. Two specific cases of complete multipartite graphs are probed in this paper, and in both cases, each set consists of an equal number of vertices. We employ the coined quantum walk model and achieve quadratic speedup with a constant probability of finding a marked vertex. Furthermore, we investigate the robust quantum walk of two cases and demonstrate that even with an unknown number of marked vertices, it is still possible to achieve a quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms and the success probability oscillates within a small range close to 1. This work addresses the overcooking problem in quantum walk search algorithms on some complete multipartite graphs. We also provide the numerical simulation and circuit implementation of our quantum algorithm.</description>

      <title>Riemannian-geometric generalizations of quantum fidelities and Bures-Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of fidelities based on the Riemannian geometry of the Bures-Wasserstein manifold we call the generalized fidelity. We show that this family of fidelities generalizes standard quantum fidelities such as Uhlamnn-, Holevo-, and Matsumoto fidelity and demonstrate that it satisfies analogous celebrated properties. The generalized fidelity naturally arises from a generalized Bures distance, the natural distance obtained from the linearization of the Bures-Wasserstein manifold. We prove various invariance and covariance properties of generalized fidelity as the point of linearization moves along geodesic-related paths. We also provide a Block-matrix characterization and prove an Uhlmann-like theorem, as well as provide further extensions to the multivariate setting and quantum Renyi divergences, generalizing Petz-, Sandwich-, Reverse sandwich-, and Geometric Renyi divergences of order $\alpha$.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum technology have highlighted the potential of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. However, fully realizing this potential requires addressing challenges related to the size, complexity, and cost of current optical systems used for NV center manipulation. In this work, we present a compact and portable confocal setup specifically designed for the efficient detection and control of single NV centers. Our system facilitates optical initialization and readout of individual NV center photoluminescence signals, enabling coherent spin control and nanoscale-resolution magnetic field sensing.</description>

      <title>Quantum property testing in sparse directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum property testing in sparse directed graphs, and more particularly in the unidirectional model, where the algorithm is allowed to query only the outgoing edges of a vertex.
  In the classical unidirectional model the problem of testing $k$-star-freeness, and more generally $k$-source-subgraph-freeness, is almost maximally hard for large $k$. We prove that this problem has almost quadratic advantage in the quantum setting. Moreover, we prove that this advantage is nearly tight, by showing a quantum lower bound using the method of dual polynomials on an intermediate problem for a new, property testing version of the $k$-collision problem that was not studied before.
  To illustrate that not all problems in graph property testing admit such a quantum speedup, we consider the problem of $3$-colorability in the related undirected bounded-degree model, when graphs are now undirected. This problem is maximally hard to test classically, and we show that also quantumly it requires a linear number of queries.</description>

      <title>AlphaRouter: Quantum Circuit Routing with Reinforcement Learning and Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to outperform classical computers in important tasks such as optimization and number factoring. They are characterized by limited connectivity, which necessitates the routing of their computational bits, known as qubits, to specific locations during program execution to carry out quantum operations. Traditionally, the NP-hard optimization problem of minimizing the routing overhead has been addressed through sub-optimal rule-based routing techniques with inherent human biases embedded within the cost function design. This paper introduces a solution that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our RL-based router, called AlphaRouter, outperforms the current state-of-the-art routing methods and generates quantum programs with up to $20\%$ less routing overhead, thus significantly enhancing the overall efficiency and feasibility of quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing with qudits, quantum systems with $d &gt; 2$ levels, offers a powerful extension beyond qubits, expanding the computational possibilities of quantum systems, allowing the simplification of the implementation of several algorithms and, possibly, providing a foundation for optimised error correction. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of qudit gates that is universally applicable for any number of levels $d$, without restrictions on the dimensionality. By extending the mathematical framework of quantum gates to arbitrary dimensions, we derive explicit gate operations that form a universal set for quantum computation on qudits of any size. We demonstrate the validity of our approach through the implementation of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) for arbitrary $d$, verifying both the correctness and utility of our generalized gates. This novel methodology broadens the design space for quantum algorithms and fault-tolerant architectures, paving the way for advancements in qudit-based quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Data poisoning attacks on machine learning models aim to manipulate the data used for model training such that the trained model behaves in the attacker's favor. In classical models such as deep neural networks, large chains of dot products do indeed cause errors injected by an attacker to propagate or to accumulate. But what about quantum models? Our hypothesis is that, in quantum machine learning, error propagation is limited for two reasons. First of all, data, which in quantum computing is encoded in terms of qubits which are confined to the Bloch sphere. Second of all, quantum information processing happens via the application of unitary operators which are norm-preserving. Testing this hypothesis, we investigate how extensive error propagation and thus poisoning attacks affect quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Single-shot preparation of hypergraph product codes via dimension jump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is a fundamental primitive of fault-tolerant quantum computing. But in order for error correction to proceed, one must first prepare the codespace of the underlying error-correcting code. A popular method for encoding quantum low-density parity-check codes is transversal initialization, where one begins in a product state and measures a set of stabilizer generators. In the presence of measurement errors however, this procedure is generically not fault-tolerant, and so one typically needs to repeat the measurements many times, resulting in a deep initialization circuit. We present a protocol that prepares the codespace of constant-rate hypergraph product codes in constant depth with $O(\sqrt{n})$ spatial overhead, and we show that the protocol is robust even in the presence of measurement errors. Our construction is inspired by dimension-jumping in topological codes and leverages two properties that arise from the homological product of codes. We provide some improvements to lower the spatial overhead and discuss applications to fault-tolerant architectures.</description>

      <title>Optimal Conversion from Classical to Quantum Randomness via Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems provide a unique platform for exploring the rich interplay between chaos, randomness, and complexity. In a recently proposed paradigm known as deep thermalization, random quantum states of system A are generated by performing projective measurements on system B following chaotic Hamiltonian evolution acting jointly on AB. In this scheme, the randomness of the projected state ensemble arises from the intrinsic randomness of the outcomes when B is measured. Here we propose a modified scheme, in which classical randomness injected during the protocol is converted by quantum chaos into quantum randomness of the resulting state ensemble. We show that for generic chaotic systems this conversion is optimal in that each bit of injected classical entropy generates as much additional quantum randomness as adding an extra qubit to B. This significantly enhances the randomness of the projected ensemble without imposing additional demands on the quantum hardware. Our scheme can be easily implemented on typical analog quantum simulators, providing a more scalable route for generating quantum randomness valuable for many applications. In particular, we demonstrate that the accuracy of a shadow tomography protocol can be substantially improved.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the quantum approximate optimization algorithm: ans\"atze, symmetries, and Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has been proposed as a method to obtain approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization tasks. In this work, we study the underlying algebraic properties of three QAOA ans\"atze for the maximum-cut (maxcut) problem on connected graphs, while focusing on the generated Lie algebras as well as their invariant subspaces. Specifically, we analyze the standard QAOA ansatz as well as the orbit and the multi-angle ans\"atze. We are able to fully characterize the Lie algebras of the multi-angle ansatz for arbitrary connected graphs, finding that they only fall into one of just six families. Besides the cycle and the path graphs, dimensions of every graph are exponentially large in the system size, meaning that multi-angle ans\"atze are extremely prone to exhibiting barren plateaus. Then, a similar quasi-graph-independent Lie-algebraic characterization beyond the multi-angle ansatz is impeded as the circuit exhibits additional "hidden" symmetries besides those naturally arising from a certain parity-superselection operator and all automorphisms of the considered graph. Disregarding the "hidden" symmetries, we can upper bound the dimensions of the orbit and the standard Lie algebras, and the dimensions of the associated invariant subspaces are determined via explicit character formulas. To finish, we conjecture that (for most graphs) the standard Lie algebras have only components that are either exponential or that grow, at most, polynomially with the system size. This would imply that the QAOA is either prone to barren plateaus, or classically simulable.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating real-time and low-latency quantum error correction with superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) will be essential to achieve the accuracy needed for quantum computers to realise their full potential. The field has seen promising progress with demonstrations of early QEC and real-time decoded experiments. As quantum computers advance towards demonstrating a universal fault-tolerant logical gate set, implementing scalable and low-latency real-time decoding will be crucial to prevent the backlog problem, avoiding an exponential slowdown and maintaining a fast logical clock rate. Here, we demonstrate low-latency feedback with a scalable FPGA decoder integrated into the control system of a superconducting quantum processor. We perform an 8-qubit stability experiment with up to $25$ decoding rounds and a mean decoding time per round below $1$ ${\mu}s$, showing that we avoid the backlog problem even on superconducting hardware with the strictest speed requirements. We observe logical error suppression as the number of decoding rounds is increased. We also implement and time a fast-feedback experiment demonstrating a decoding response time of $9.6$ ${\mu}s$ for a total of $9$ measurement rounds. The decoder throughput and latency developed in this work, combined with continued device improvements, unlock the next generation of experiments that go beyond purely keeping logical qubits alive and into demonstrating building blocks of fault-tolerant computation, such as lattice surgery and magic state teleportation.</description>

      <title>Double-Logarithmic Depth Block-Encodings of Simple Finite Difference Method's Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving differential equations is one of the most computationally expensive problems in classical computing, occupying the vast majority of high-performance computing resources devoted towards practical applications in various fields of science and engineering. Despite recent progress made in the field of quantum computing and quantum algorithms, its end-to-end application towards practical realization still remains unattainable. In this article, we tackle one of the primary obstacles towards this ultimate objective, specifically the encoding of matrices derived via finite difference method solving Poisson partial differential equations in simple boundary-value problems. To that end, we propose a novel methodology called block-diagonalization, which provides a common decomposition form for our matrices, and similarly a common procedure for block-encoding these matrices inside a unitary operator of a quantum circuit. The depth of these circuits is double-logarithmic in the matrix size, which is an exponential improvement over existing quantum methods and a superexponential improvement over existing classical methods. These improvements come at the price of a constant multiplicative overhead on the number of qubits and the number of gates. Combined with quantum linear solver algorithms, we can utilize these quantum circuits to produce a quantum state representation of the solution to the Poisson partial differential equations and their boundary-value problems.</description>

      <title>Electric polarization and discrete shift from boundary and corner charge in crystalline Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown how topological phases of matter with crystalline symmetry and $U(1)$ charge conservation can be partially characterized by a set of many-body invariants, the discrete shift $\mathscr{S}_{\text{o}}$ and electric polarization $\vec{\mathscr{P}}_{\text{o}}$, where $\text{o}$ labels a high symmetry point. Crucially, these can be defined even with non-zero Chern number and/or magnetic field. One manifestation of these invariants is through quantized fractional contributions to the charge in the vicinity of a lattice disclination or dislocation. In this paper, we show that these invariants can also be extracted from the length and corner dependence of the total charge (mod 1) on the boundary of the system. We provide a general formula in terms of $\mathscr{S}_{\text{o}}$ and $\vec{\mathscr{P}}_{\text{o}}$ for the total charge of any subregion of the system which can include full boundaries or bulk lattice defects, unifying boundary, corner, disclination, and dislocation charge responses into a single general theory. These results hold for Chern insulators, despite their gapless chiral edge modes, and for which an unambiguous definition of an intrinsically two-dimensional electric polarization has been unclear until recently. We also discuss how our theory can fully characterize the topological response of quadrupole insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanophotonic resonators are central to numerous applications, from efficient spin-photon interfaces to laser oscillators and precision sensing. A leading approach consists of photonic crystal (PhC) cavities, which have been realized in a wide range of dielectric materials. However, translating proof-of-concept devices into a functional system entails a number of additional challenges, inspiring new approaches that combine: resonators with wavelength-scale confinement and high quality factors; scalable integration with integrated circuits and photonic circuits; electrical or mechanical cavity tuning; and, in many cases, a need for heterogeneous integration with functional materials such as III-V semiconductors or diamond color centers for spin-photon interfaces. Here we introduce a concept that generates a finely tunable PhC cavity at a select wavelength between two heterogeneous optical materials whose properties satisfy the above requirements. The cavity is formed by stamping a hard-to-process material with simple waveguide geometries on top of an easy-to-process material consisting of dielectric grating mirrors and active tuning capability. We simulate our concept for the particularly challenging design problem of multiplexed quantum repeaters based on arrays of cavity-coupled diamond color centers, achieving theoretically calculated unloaded quality factors of $10^6$, mode volumes as small as $1.2(\lambda/n_{eff})^3$, and maintaining &gt;60 percent total on-chip collection efficiency of fluorescent photons. We further introduce a method of low-power piezoelectric tuning of these hybrid diamond cavities, simulating optical resonance shifts up to ~760 GHz and color center fluorescence tuning of 5 GHz independent of cavity tuning. These results will motivate integrated photonic cavities toward larger scale systems-compatible designs.</description>

      <title>Thickness dependence of the mechanical properties of piezoelectric high-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators made from aluminium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with high quality factors ($Q_m$) enable mechanics-based quantum technologies, in particular quantum sensing and quantum transduction. High-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators in the kHz to MHz frequency range can be realized in tensile-strained thin films that allow the use of dissipation dilution techniques to drastically increase $Q_m$. In our work, we study the material properties of tensile-strained piezoelectric films made from aluminium nitride (AlN). We characterize crystalline AlN films with a thickness ranging from 45nm to 295nm, which are directly grown on Si(111) by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy. We report on the crystal quality and surface roughness, the piezoelectric response, and the residual and released stress of the AlN thin films. Importantly, we determine the intrinsic quality factor of the films at room temperature in high vacuum. We fabricate and characterize AlN nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution to enhance the intrinsic quality factor by utilizing the tensile strain in the film. We find that AlN nanomechanical resonators below 200nm thickness exhibit the highest $Q_m\cdot f_m$-product, on the order of $10^{12}$Hz. We discuss possible strategies to optimize the material growth that should lead to devices that reach even higher $Q_m\cdot f_m$-products. This will pave the way for future advancements of optoelectromechanical quantum devices made from tensile-strained piezoelectric AlN.</description>

      <title>Harnessing quantum chaos in spin-boson models for all-purpose quantum-enhanced sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body quantum chaos has immense potential as a tool to accelerate the preparation of entangled states and overcome challenges due to decoherence and technical noise. Here, we study how chaos in the paradigmatic Dicke model, which describes the uniform coupling of an ensemble of qubits to a common bosonic mode, can enable the rapid generation of non-Gaussian entangled spin-boson states without fine tuning of system parameters or initial conditions. However, the complexity of these states means that unlocking their utility for quantum-enhanced sensing with standard protocols would require the measurement of complex or typically inaccessible observables. To address this challenge, we develop a sensing scheme based on interaction-based readout that enable us to implement near-optimal quantum-enhanced metrology of global spin rotations or bosonic dipslacements using only spin measurements. We show that our approach is robust to technical noise and imperfections and thus opens new opportunities to exploit complex entangled states generated by chaotic dynamics in current quantum science platforms such as trapped-ion and cavity-QED experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for the advection-diffusion equation and the Koopman-von Neumann approach to nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an explicit algorithm based on the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulations technique to simulate both the advection-diffusion equation and a nonunitary discretized version of the Koopman-von Neumann formulation of nonlinear dynamics. By including dissipation into the model, through an upwind discretization of the advection operator, we avoid spurious parasitic oscillations which usually accompany standard finite difference discretizations of the advection equation. In contrast to prior works on quantum simulation of nonlinear problems, we explain in detail how different components of the algorithm can be implemented by using the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) methods. In addition, we discuss the general method for implementing the block-encoding (BE) required for QSP and QSVT circuits and provide explicit implementations of the BE oracles tailored to our specific test cases. We simulate the resulting circuit on a digital emulator of quantum fault-tolerant computers and investigate its complexity and success probability. The proposed algorithm is universal and can be used for modeling a broad class of linear and nonlinear differential equations including the KvN and Carleman embeddings of nonlinear systems, the semiclassical Koopman-van Hove (KvH) equation, as well as the advection and Liouville equations.</description>

      <title>Applying Quantum Autoencoders for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is an important problem with applications in various domains such as fraud detection, pattern recognition or medical diagnosis. Several algorithms have been introduced using classical computing approaches. However, using quantum computing for solving anomaly detection problems in time series data is a widely unexplored research field.
  This paper explores the application of quantum autoencoders to time series anomaly detection. We investigate two primary techniques for classifying anomalies: (1) Analyzing the reconstruction error generated by the quantum autoencoder and (2) latent representation analysis. Our simulated experimental results, conducted across various ansaetze, demonstrate that quantum autoencoders consistently outperform classical deep learning-based autoencoders across multiple datasets. Specifically, quantum autoencoders achieve superior anomaly detection performance while utilizing 60-230 times fewer parameters and requiring five times fewer training iterations. In addition, we implement our quantum encoder on real quantum hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate that quantum autoencoders achieve anomaly detection performance on par with their simulated counterparts.</description>

      <title>Truncated Gaussian basis approach for simulating many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Truncated Gaussian Basis Approach (TGBA) for simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. The approach constructs an effective Hamiltonian within a reduced subspace, spanned by fermionic Gaussian states, and diagonalizes it to obtain approximate eigenstates and eigenenergies. Symmetries can be exploited to perform parallel computation, enabling to simulate systems with much larger sizes. As an example, we compute the dynamic structure factor and study quench dynamics in a non-integrable quantum Ising chain, known as ``$E_8$ magnet''. The mass ratios calculated through the dynamic structure factor show excellent agreement with Zamolodchikov's analytical predictions. For quench dynamics we observe that time-evolving wave functions in the truncated subspace facilitates the simulation of long-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Role of intermediate resonances in attosecond photoelectron interferometry in neon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond photoelectron interferometry based on the combination of an attosecond pulse train and a synchronized infrared field is a fundamental technique for the temporal characterization of attosecond waveforms and for the investigation of electron dynamics in the photoionization process. In this approach, the comb of extreme ultraviolet harmonics typically lies above the ionization threshold of the target under investigation, thus releasing a photoelectron by single-photon absorption. The interaction of the outgoing photoelectron with the infrared pulse results in the absorption or emission of infrared photons, thereby creating additional peaks in the photoelectron spectrum, referred to as sidebands. While, in the absence of resonances in the first ionization step, the phases imparted on the photoionization process evolve smoothly with the photon energy, the presence of intermediate resonances imprints a large additional phase on the outgoing photoelectron wave packet. In this work, using a comb of harmonics below and above the ionization threshold of neon, we investigate the effect of intermediate bound excited states on attosecond photoelectron interferometry. We show that the phase of the oscillations of the sidebands and their angular distributions are strongly affected by such resonances. By slightly tuning the photon energies of the extreme ultraviolet harmonics, we show how the contributions of selected resonances can be enhanced or suppressed.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Future Link Prediction in Quantum Computing Semantic Networks through LLM-Initiated Node Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly evolving in both physics and computer science, offering the potential to solve complex problems and accelerate computational processes. The development of quantum chips necessitates understanding the correlations among diverse experimental conditions. Semantic networks built on scientific literature, representing meaningful relationships between concepts, have been used across various domains to identify knowledge gaps and novel concept combinations. Neural network-based approaches have shown promise in link prediction within these networks. This study proposes initializing node features using LLMs to enhance node representations for link prediction tasks in graph neural networks. LLMs can provide rich descriptions, reducing the need for manual feature creation and lowering costs. Our method, evaluated using various link prediction models on a quantum computing semantic network, demonstrated efficacy compared to traditional node embedding techniques.</description>

Abstract: Recent refinements on a semiclassical approach are reviewed, aiming at describing the inhomogeneous local gap parameter in the presence of non-trivial spatial geometries and at taking into account at the same time pairing fluctuations beyond mean field.

      <description>arXiv:2410.04469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometric series modulated non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice model, and explore its localization and topological properties. The results show that with the ever-increasing summation terms of the geometric series, multiple mobility edges and non-Hermitian point gaps with high winding number can be induced in the system. The point gap spectrum of the system has a Matryoshka doll-like structure in the complex plane, resulting in a high winding number. In addition, we analyze the limit case of summation of infinite terms. The results show that the mobility edges merge together as only one mobility edge when summation terms are pushed to the limit. Meanwhile, the corresponding point gaps are merged into a ring with winding number equal to one. Through Avila's global theory, we give an analytical expression for mobility edges in the limit of infinite summation, reconfirming that mobility edges and point gaps do merge and will result in a winding number that is indeed equal to one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the Canonical Ensemble, we investigate a system of interacting relativistic bosons at finite temperatures and finite isospin densities in a mean-field approach. The mean field contains both attractive and repulsive terms. Temperature and isospin-density dependencies of thermodynamic quantities were obtained. It is shown that in the case of attraction between particles in a bosonic system, a liquid-gas phase transition develops against the background of the Bose-Einstein condensate. The corresponding phase diagrams are given. We explain the reasons why the presence of a Bose condensate significantly increases the critical temperature of the liquid-gas phase transition compared to that obtained for the same system within the framework of the Boltzmann statistics. Our results may have implications for the interpretation of experimental data, in particular, how sensitive the critical point of the mixed phase is to the presence of the Bose-Einstein condensate.</description>

Abstract: We derive the general solution to the coupled Einstein and Dirac field equations in static and hyperplane-symmetric spacetime of arbitrary dimension including a cosmological constant of either sign. As a result, only a massful Dirac field couples via the Einstein equations to spacetime, and in the massless case the Dirac field is required to fulfill appropriate constraints in order to eliminate off-diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor. We also give explicit expressions for curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar and the Kretschmann scalar, indicating physical singularities. Moreover, we reduce the general solution of the geodesic equation to quadratures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved operator for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved operators corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic `in' and `out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOC have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.</description>

Abstract: We develop a correspondence between the PSSY model and the IOP matrix model by comparing their Schwinger-Dyson equations, Feynman diagrams, and parameters. Applying this correspondence, we resum specific non-planar diagrams involving crossing in the PSSY model by using a non-planar analysis of a two-point function in the IOP matrix model. We also compare them with Page's formula on entanglement entropy and discuss the contributions of extra-handle-in-bulk diagrams.</description>

      <title>System Symmetry and the Classification of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator Dynamics in Quantum Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetry of chaotic systems plays a pivotal role in determining the universality class of spectral statistics and dynamical behaviors, which can be described within the framework of random matrix theory. Understanding the influence of system symmetry on these behaviors is crucial for characterizing universal properties in quantum chaotic systems. In this work, we explore the universality of out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) dynamics in quantum chaotic systems, focusing on the kicked rotor and the kicked Harper model. By modulating the periodically kicked potential, we control system symmetry to examine its impact on OTOC dynamics and level spacing distributions. Our results show that ensemble-averaged OTOC dynamics exhibit distinct universal behaviors depending on system symmetry, enabling classification through random matrix theory. These distinctions become evident after the localization time in localized regimes and emerge at specific time scales corresponding to the translational period of the Floquet operator in momentum space under quantum resonance conditions. Our findings provide a rigorous understanding of the relationship between symmetry and quantum chaotic dynamics, contributing to a deeper comprehension of universal behaviors in these systems.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we examine the quantization of Hall conductance in an infinite plane geometry. We consider a charge-conserving system with a pure, gapped infinite-volume ground state. While Hall conductance is well-defined in this scenario, there is no existing proof of its quantization. Assuming that the conditions necessary to construct the braided $C^*$-tensor category which describes anyonic excitations are satisfied, we demonstrate that the Hall conductance is rational under the assumption that the tensor category is finite.</description>

      <title>Fast, Accurate, and Local Temperature Control Using Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many quantum technologies, including quantum computers, quantum heat engines, and quantum sensors, rely on operating conditions in the subkelvin regime. It is therefore desirable to develop practical tools and methods for the precise control of the temperature in nanoscale quantum systems. Here, we present a proposal for fast, accurate, and local temperature control using qubits, which regulate the flow of heat between a quantum system and its thermal environment. The qubits are kept in a thermal state with a temperature that is controlled in an interplay between work done on the qubits by changing their energy splittings and the flow of heat between the qubits and the environment. Using only a few qubits, it is possible to control the thermal environment of another quantum system, which can be heated or cooled by the qubits. As an example, we show how a quantum system at subkelvin temperatures can be significantly and accurately cooled on a nanosecond timescale. Our proposal can potentially be realized with superconducting flux qubits, charge qubits, or spin qubits, which can now be fabricated and manipulated with exquisite control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple method of variational calculations of the electronic structure of a two-electron atom/ion, primarily near the nucleus, is proposed. The method as a whole consists of a standard solution of a generalized matrix eigenvalue equation, all matrix elements of which are reduced to a numerical calculation of one-dimensional integrals. Distinctive features of the method are: The use of the hyperspherical coordinate system. The inclusion of logarithms of the hyperspherical radius $R$ in the basis functions, similar to the Fock expansion. Using a special basis function including the leading angular Fock coefficients to provide the correct behavior of the wave function near the nucleus. The main numerical parameters characterizing the properties of the helium atom and a number of helium-like ions near the nucleus are calculated and presented in tables. Among others, the specific coefficients $a_{21}$ of the Fock expansion, which can only be calculated using a wave function with the correct behavior near the nucleus, are presented in table and graphs.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Majorana modes in the $p$-wave Kitaev chains on a square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological characteristics of the $p$-wave Kitaev chains on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor inter-chains hopping and pairing are investigated. Besides gapless exact zero-energy modes, this model exhibits topological gapless phase hosting edge modes, which do not reside strictly at zero energy. However, these modes can be distinguished from the bulk states. These states are known as pseudo- or quasi-Majorana Modes (qMMs). The exploration of this system's bulk spectrum and Berry curvature reveals singularities and flux-carrying vortices within its Brillouin zone. These vortices indicate the presence of four-fold Dirac points arising from two-fold degenerate bands. Examining the Hamiltonian under a cylindrical geometry uncovers the edge properties, demonstrating the existence of topological edge modes. These modes are a direct topological consequence of the Dirac semimetal characteristics of the system. The system is analyzed under open boundary conditions to distinguish the multiple MZMs and qMMs. This analysis includes a study of the normalized site-dependent local density of states, which pinpoints the presence of localized edge states. Additionally, numerical evidence confirms the robustness of the edge modes against disorder perturbations. The emergence of topological edge states and Dirac points with zero Chern number indicates that this model is a weak topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>A Meta-Complexity Characterization of Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the first meta-complexity characterization of a quantum cryptographic primitive. We show that one-way puzzles exist if and only if there is some quantum samplable distribution of binary strings over which it is hard to approximate Kolmogorov complexity. Therefore, we characterize one-way puzzles by the average-case hardness of a uncomputable problem. This brings to the quantum setting a recent line of work that characterizes classical cryptography with the average-case hardness of a meta-complexity problem, initiated by Liu and Pass. Moreover, since the average-case hardness of Kolmogorov complexity over classically polynomial-time samplable distributions characterizes one-way functions, this result poses one-way puzzles as a natural generalization of one-way functions to the quantum setting. Furthermore, our equivalence goes through probability estimation, giving us the additional equivalence that one-way puzzles exist if and only if there is a quantum samplable distribution over which probability estimation is hard. We also observe that the oracle worlds of defined by Kretschmer et. al. rule out any relativizing characterization of one-way puzzles by the hardness of a problem in NP or QMA, which means that it may not be possible with current techniques to characterize one-way puzzles with another meta-complexity problem.</description>

Abstract: A previous construction of regular rational extensions of the trigonometric Darboux-P\"oschl-Teller potential, obtained by one-step Darboux transformations using seed functions associated with the para-Jacobi polynomials of Calogero and Yi, is generalized by considering $m$-step Darboux transformations. As a result, some novel families of exceptional orthogonal polynomials depending on $m$ discrete parameters, as well as $m$ continuous real ones $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, \ldots, $\lambda_m$, are obtained. The restrictions imposed on these parameters by the rational extensions regularity conditions are studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Localization transitions in quadratic systems without quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transitions from delocalized to localized eigenstates have been extensively studied in both quadratic and interacting models. The delocalized regime typically exhibits diffusion and quantum chaos, and its properties comply with the random matrix theory (RMT) predictions. However, it is also known that in certain quadratic models, the delocalization in position space is not accompanied by the single-particle quantum chaos. Here, we study the one-dimensional Anderson and Wannier-Stark models that exhibit eigenstate transitions from localization in quasimomentum space (supporting ballistic transport) to localization in position space (with no transport) in a nonstandard thermodynamic limit, which assumes rescaling the model parameters with the system size. We show that the transition point may exhibit an unconventional character of Janus type, i.e., some measures hint at the RMT-like universality emerging at the transition point, while others depart from it. For example, the eigenstate entanglement entropies may exhibit, depending on the bipartition, a volume-law behavior that either approaches the value of Haar-random Gaussian states, or converges to a lower, non-universal value. Our results hint at rich diversity of volume-law eigenstate entanglement entropies in quadratic systems that are not maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Quantum Dynamics of Molecules Scattering from Metal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic coupling between electrons and molecular motion at metal surfaces leads to energy dissipation and dynamical steering effects during chemical surface dynamics. We present a theoretical approach to the scattering of molecules from metal surfaces that incorporates all nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects due to the coupling of the molecular degrees of freedom to the electrons in the metal. This is achieved with the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach combined with a matrix product state representation in twin space. The method is applied to the scattering of nitric oxide from Au(111), for which strongly nonadiabatic energy loss during scattering has been experimentally observed, thus presenting a significant theoretical challenge. Since the HEOM approach treats the molecule-surface coupling exactly, it captures the interplay between nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects. Finally, the data obtained by the HEOM approach is used as a rigorous benchmark to assess various mixed quantum-classical methods, from which we derive insights into the mechanisms of energy dissipation and the suitable working regimes of each method.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Modular Spread Complexity for Non-Hermitian Density Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we generalize the concept of modular spread complexity to the cases where the reduced density matrix is non-Hermitian. This notion of complexity and associated Lanczos coefficients contain richer information than the pseudo-entropy, which turns out to be one of the first Lanczos coefficients. We also define the quantity pseudo-capacity which generalizes capacity of entanglement, and corresponds to the early modular-time measure of pseudo-modular complexity. We describe how pseudo-modular complexity can be calculated using a slightly modified bi-Lanczos algorithm. Alternatively, the (complex) Lanczos coefficients can also be obtained from the analytic expression of the pseudo-R\'enyi entropy, which can then be used to calculate the pseudo-modular spread complexity. We show some analytical calculations for 2-level systems and 4-qubit models and then do numerical investigations on the quantum phase transition of transverse field Ising model, from the (pseudo) modular spread complexity perspective. As the final example, we consider the $3d$ Chern-Simon gauge theory with Wilson loops to understand the role of topology on modular complexity. The concept of pseudo-modular complexity introduced here can be a useful tool for understanding phases and phase transitions in quantum many body systems, quantum field theories and holography.</description>

      <title>Embedding cyclic information-theoretic structures in acyclic spacetimes: no-go results for indefinite causality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11245v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notions of causality adopted within the quantum information and spacetime physics communities are distinct. Although both notions play a role in physical experiments, their general interplay is little understood in theory. We develop a theoretical framework that connects the two causality notions, while also clearly distinguishing them. The framework describes a composition of quantum operations through feedback loops, and the embedding of the resulting, possibly cyclic information-theoretic structure in an acyclic spacetime structure. Relativistic causality (which forbids superluminal communication) follows as a graph-theoretic compatibility condition between the two structures. Formulating indefinite causal order (ICO) processes in our framework, we shed light on the links between indefinite and cyclic causality, and on questions regarding their physicality. In particular, there are several experiments that claim to implement ICO processes in Minkowski spacetime, presenting an apparent paradox: how can an indefinite information-theoretic causal structure be consistent with a definite spacetime causal structure? We address this through no-go theorems, showing that as a consequence of relativistic causality, (a) realisations of ICO processes necessarily involve the non-localisation of systems in spacetime and (b) will nevertheless admit an explanation in terms of a definite and acyclic causal order process, at a fine-grained level. This fully resolves the apparent paradox and bears implications for the physical interpretation of ICO experiments, and is achieved by introducing the concept of fine-graining that allows causal structures to be analysed at different levels of detail. Our work also sheds light on the limits of quantum information processing in spacetime and on the operational meaning of indefinite causality, within and beyond the context of a fixed spacetime.</description>

      <title>Certified Quantumness via Single-Shot Temporal Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem states that a non-contextual hidden-variable theory cannot completely reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics. Asher Peres gave a remarkably simple proof of quantum contextuality in a four-dimensional Hilbert space of two spin-1/2 particles. Peres's argument is enormously simpler than that of Kochen and Specker. Peres contextuality demonstrates a logical contradiction between quantum mechanics and the noncontextual hidden variable models by showing an inconsistency when assigning noncontextual definite values to a certain set of quantum observables. In this work, we present a similar proof in time with a temporal version of the Peres-like argument. In analogy with the two-particle version of Peres's argument in the context of spin measurements at two different locations, we examine here single-particle spin measurements at two different times $t=t_1$ and $t=t_2$. We adopt three classical assumptions for time-separated measurements, which are demonstrated to conflict with quantum mechanical predictions. Consequently, we provide a non-probabilistic proof of certified quantumness in time, without relying on inequalities, demonstrating that our approach can certify the quantumness of a device through single-shot, time-separated measurements. Our results can be experimentally verified with the present quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Optical Spin Initialisation and Readout with a Cavity-Coupled Quantum Dot in an In-Plane Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin of a charged semiconductor quantum dot (QD) coupled to an optical cavity is a promising candidate for high fidelity spin-photon interfaces; the cavity selectively modifies the decay rates of optical transitions such that spin initialisation, manipulation, and readout are all possible in a single magnetic field geometry. By performing cavity QED calculations, we show that a cavity with a single, linearly-polarised mode can simultaneously support both high-fidelity optical spin initialisation and readout in a single, in-plane (Voigt geometry) magnetic field. Furthermore, we demonstrate that single mode cavities always outperform bi-modal cavities in experimentally favourable driving regimes. Our analysis, when combined with established methods of control in a Voigt geometry field, provides optimal parameter regimes for high-fidelity initialisation and readout, and coherent control in both cavity configurations, providing insights for the design and development of QD spin-photon interfaces as the basis of quantum network nodes and for the generation of photonic graph states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single photon sources (SPSs) are an essential resource for many quantum information technologies. We demonstrate how the inclusion of time-delayed coherent feedback in a scalable waveguide system, can significantly improve the two key SPS figures of merit: coherence and indistinguishability. Our feedback protocol is simulated using a quantum trajectory discretized waveguide model which can be used to directly model Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) and Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometers. With the proper choice of the round trip phase, the non-Markovian dynamics from the time-delayed feedback improves the indistinguishability of the SPS by up to 57%. We also show how this mechanism suppresses the detrimental effects of off-chip decay and pure dephasing.</description>

      <title>Implementing any Linear Combination of Unitaries on Intermediate-term Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13555v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop three new methods to implement any Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU), a powerful quantum algorithmic tool with diverse applications. While the standard LCU procedure requires several ancilla qubits and sophisticated multi-qubit controlled operations, our methods consume significantly fewer quantum resources. The first method (Single-Ancilla LCU) estimates expectation values of observables with respect to any quantum state prepared by an LCU procedure while requiring only a single ancilla qubit, and no multi-qubit controlled operations. The second approach (Analog LCU) is a simple, physically motivated, continuous-time analogue of LCU, tailored to hybrid qubit-qumode systems. The third method (Ancilla-free LCU) requires no ancilla qubit at all and is useful when we are interested in the projection of a quantum state (prepared by the LCU procedure) in some subspace of interest. We apply the first two techniques to develop new quantum algorithms for a wide range of practical problems, ranging from Hamiltonian simulation, ground state preparation and property estimation, and quantum linear systems. Remarkably, despite consuming fewer quantum resources they retain a provable quantum advantage. The third technique allows us to connect discrete and continuous-time quantum walks with their classical counterparts. It also unifies the recently developed optimal quantum spatial search algorithms in both these frameworks, and leads to the development of new ones that require fewer ancilla qubits. Overall, our results are quite generic and can be readily applied to other problems, even beyond those considered here.</description>

      <title>Fast, tunable, high fidelity cZ-gates between superconducting qubits with parametric microwave control of ZZ-coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future quantum information processors require tunable coupling architectures that can produce high fidelity logical gates between two or more qubits. Parametric coupling is a powerful technique for generating tunable interactions between many qubits. Here, we present a highly flexible parametric coupling scheme with superconducting qubits that provides complete removal of residual $ZZ$ coupling and the implementation of driven SWAP or SWAP-free controlled-$Z$ (c$Z$) gates. Our fully integrated, 2D on-chip coupler design is only weakly flux tunable, cancels static linear coupling between the qubits, avoids internal coupler dynamics or excitations, and is extensible to multi-qubit circuit-QED systems. Exploring gate fidelity versus gate duration allows us to maximize two-qubit gate fidelity, while providing insights into possible error sources for these gates. Randomized benchmarking over several hours reveals that the parametric SWAP c$Z$ gate achieves an average fidelity of $99.44\pm 0.09$\% in a gate duration of 70~ns and a dispersively driven parametric SWAP-free c$Z$ gate attains an average fidelity of $99.47\pm 0.07$\% in only 30~ns. The fidelity remained above this value for over 8~hours and peaked twice with a maximum of $99.67\pm 0.14$\%. Overall, our parametric approach combines versatility, precision, speed, and high performance in one compact coupler design.</description>

      <title>Calculating potential energy surfaces with quantum computers by measuring only the density along adiabatic transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that chemically-accurate potential energy surfaces (PESs) can be generated from quantum computers by measuring only the density along an adiabatic transition between different molecular geometries. In lieu of using phase estimation, the energy is evaluated by performing line-integration using the inverted real-space Time-Dependant Density Functional Theory Kohn-Sham potential obtained from the geometry-varying densities of the full wavefunction. The accuracy of this method depends on the validity of the adiabatic evolution itself and the potential inversion process (which is theoretically exact but can be numerically unstable), whereas total evolution time is the defining factor for the precision of phase estimation. We examine the method with a one-dimensional system of two electrons for both the ground and first triplet state in first quantization, as well as the ground state of three- and four- electron systems in second quantization. It is shown that few accurate measurements can be utilized to obtain chemical accuracy across the full potential energy curve, with shorter propagation time than may be required using phase estimation for a similar accuracy. We also show that an accurate potential energy curve can be calculated by making many imprecise density measurements (using few shots) along the time evolution and smoothing the resulting density evolution. Finally, it is important to note that the method is able to classically provide a check of its own accuracy by comparing the density resulting from a time-independent Kohn-Sham calculation using the inverted potential, with the measured density. This can be used to determine whether longer adiabatic evolution times are required to satisfy the adiabatic theorem.</description>

      <title>Grover Speedup from Many Forms of the Zeno Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11146v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has previously been established that adiabatic quantum computation, operating based on a continuous Zeno effect due to dynamical phases between eigenstates, is able to realise an optimal Grover-like quantum speedup. In other words is able to solve an unstructured search problem with the same $\sqrt{N}$ scaling as Grover's original algorithm. A natural question is whether other manifestations of the Zeno effect can also support an optimal speedup in a physically realistic model (through direct analog application rather than indirectly by supporting a universal gateset). In this paper we show that they can support such a speedup, whether due to measurement, decoherence, or even decay of the excited state into a computationally useless state. Our results also suggest a wide variety of methods to realise speedup which do not rely on Zeno behaviour. We group these algorithms into three families to facilitate a structured understanding of how speedups can be obtained: one based on phase kicks, containing adiabatic computation and continuous-time quantum walks; one based on dephasing and measurement; and finally one based on destruction of the amplitude within the excited state, for which we are not aware of any previous results. These results suggest that there may be exciting opportunities for new paradigms of analog quantum computing based on these effects.</description>

A similar phenomenon has been discovered in quantum information science, where physical transformations become possible by utilizing a quantum degree of freedom that returns to its initial state at the end of the process. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the concept of catalysis in quantum information science is presented and its applications in various physical contexts are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Quantum networks provide a prospective paradigm to connect separated quantum nodes, which relies on the distribution of long-distance entanglement and active feedforward control of qubits between remote nodes. Such approaches can be utilized to construct nonlocal quantum gates, forming building blocks for distributed quantum computing and other novel quantum applications. However, these gates have only been realized within single nodes or between nodes separated by a few tens of meters, limiting the ability to harness computing resources in large-scale quantum networks. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal photonic quantum gates between two nodes spatially separated by 7.0 km using stationary qubits based on multiplexed quantum memories, flying qubits at telecom wavelengths, and active feedforward control based on field-deployed fibers. Furthermore, we illustrate quantum parallelism by implementing the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the quantum phase estimation algorithm between the two remote nodes. These results represent a proof-of-principle demonstration of quantum gates over metropolitan-scale distances and lay the foundation for the construction of large-scale distributed quantum networks relying on existing fiber channels.</description>

Abstract: Understanding quantum systems is of significant importance for assessing the performance of quantum hardware and software, as well as exploring quantum control and quantum sensing. An efficient representation of quantum states enables realizing quantum state tomography with minimal measurements. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to state tomography that uses tensor network representations of mixed states through locally purified density operators and employs a classical data postprocessing algorithm requiring only local measurements. Through numerical simulations of one-dimensional pure and mixed states and two-dimensional pure states up to size $8\times 8$, we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of our proposed methods. Experiments on the IBM and Quafu Quantum platforms complement these numerical simulations. Our study opens avenues in quantum state tomography for two-dimensional systems using tensor network formalism.</description>

      <title>Positive maps and Entanglement Witnesses in different dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07019v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a continuous, multiparameter family of positive maps between spaces of differing dimensions. This framework facilitates the construction of Entanglement Witnesses (EWs) specifically designed for systems in $d_1\times d_2$ dimensions. We derive a simple, closed-form criterion for detecting entanglement in general density matrices based on these witnesses. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this criterion, we apply it to a range of Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) entangled states, revealing that the parameter regions where these states exhibit entanglement are larger than previously reported. Furthermore, we prove that non-unital EWs, corresponding to non-unital maps, are not more powerful than unital EWs, thus supporting the focus on unital positive maps in recent studies. Our method complements existing approaches to separability criteria for density matrices in different dimensions.</description>

      <title>LWE with Quantum Amplitudes: Algorithm, Hardness, and Oblivious Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show new algorithms, hardness results and applications for $\sf{S|LWE\rangle}$ and $\sf{C|LWE\rangle}$ with real Gaussian, Gaussian with linear or quadratic phase terms, and other related amplitudes. Let $n$ be the dimension of LWE samples. Our main results are
  1. There is a $2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})}$-time algorithm for $\sf{S|LWE\rangle}$ with Gaussian amplitude with \emph{known} phase, given $2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})}$ many quantum samples. The algorithm is modified from Kuperberg's sieve, and in fact works for more general amplitudes as long as the amplitudes and phases are completely \emph{known}.
  2. There is a polynomial time quantum algorithm for solving $\sf{S|LWE\rangle}$ and $\sf{C|LWE\rangle}$ for Gaussian with quadratic phase amplitudes, where the sample complexity is as small as $\tilde{O}(n)$. As an application, we give a quantum oblivious LWE sampler where the core quantum sampler requires only quasi-linear sample complexity. This improves upon the previous oblivious LWE sampler given by Debris-Alazard, Fallahpour, Stehl\'{e} [STOC 2024], whose core quantum sampler requires $\tilde{O}(nr)$ sample complexity, where $r$ is the standard deviation of the error.
  3. There exist polynomial time quantum reductions from standard LWE or worst-case GapSVP to $\sf{S|LWE\rangle}$ with Gaussian amplitude with small \emph{unknown} phase, and arbitrarily many samples. Compared to the first two items, the appearance of the unknown phase term places a barrier in designing efficient quantum algorithm for solving standard LWE via $\sf{S|LWE\rangle}$.</description>

      <title>Where does the Born Rule come from? Superposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04188v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Born Rule plays a critical role in quantum mechanics (QM) since it supplies the link between the mathematical formalism and experimental results in terms of probabilities. The Born Rule does not occur in ordinary probability theory. Where then does it come from? This has been a topic of considerable controversy in the literature. We take the approach of asking what is the simplest extension of ordinary probability theory where the Born rule appears. This is answered by showing that the Born Rule appears by adding the notion of superposition events (in addition to the ordinary discrete events) to finite probability theory. Hence the rule does not need any physics-based derivation. It is simply a feature of the mathematics of superposition when only superposition events are added to ordinary probability theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation implies symmetry-protected topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain a broad class of teleportation protocols using insights from locality. In the "standard" teleportation protocols we consider, all outcome-dependent unitaries are Pauli operators conditioned on linear functions of the measurement outcomes. We find that all such protocols involve preparing a "resource state" exhibiting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order with Abelian protecting symmetry $\mathcal{G}_{k}= (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)^k$. The $k$ logical states are teleported between the edges of the chain by measuring the corresponding $2k$ string order parameters in the bulk and applying outcome-dependent Paulis. Hence, this single class of nontrivial SPT states is both necessary and sufficient for the standard teleportation of $k$ qubits. We illustrate this result with several examples, including the cluster state, variants thereof, and a nonstabilizer hypergraph state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With respect to the transversal gate group (an invariant of quantum codes), we demonstrate that non-additive codes can outperform stabilizer codes. We do this by constructing spin codes that correspond to permutation-invariant multiqubit codes that can implement generalized phase gates transversally. Of particular note, we construct permutation-invariant quantum codes that implement a transversal $T$ gate using fewer qubits and with a better minimum distance than is possible with the best known stabilizer codes.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry activation and its relation to coherence under permutation operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Dicke state and its decohered state are invariant for permutation. However, when another qubits state to each of them is attached, the whole state is not invariant for permutation, and has a certain asymmetry for permutation. The amount of asymmetry can be measured by the number of distinguishable states under the group action or the mutual information. Generally, the amount of asymmetry of the whole state is larger than the amount of asymmetry of the added state. That is, the asymmetry activation happens in this case. This paper investigates the amount of the asymmetry activation under Dicke states. To address the asymmetry activation asymptotically, we introduce a new type of central limit theorem by using several formulas on hypergeometric functions. We reveal that the amounts of the asymmetry and the asymmetry activation with a Dicke state have a strictly larger order than those with the decohered state in a specific type of the limit.</description>

      <title>Gapped Clique Homology on weighted graphs is $\text{QMA}_1$-hard and contained in $\text{QMA}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of a classic problem in computational topology, the homology problem: given a description of some space $X$ and an integer $k$, decide if $X$ contains a $k$-dimensional hole. The setting and statement of the homology problem are completely classical, yet we find that the complexity is characterized by quantum complexity classes. Our result can be seen as an aspect of a connection between homology and supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
  We consider clique complexes, motivated by the practical application of topological data analysis (TDA). The clique complex of a graph is the simplicial complex formed by declaring every $k+1$-clique in the graph to be a $k$-simplex. Our main result is that deciding whether the clique complex of a weighted graph has a hole or not, given a suitable promise on the gap, is $\text{QMA}_1$-hard and contained in $\text{QMA}$.
  Our main innovation is a technique to lower bound the eigenvalues of the combinatorial Laplacian operator. For this, we invoke a tool from algebraic topology known as \emph{spectral sequences}. In particular, we exploit a connection between spectral sequences and Hodge theory. Spectral sequences will play a role analogous to perturbation theory for combinatorial Laplacians. In addition, we develop the simplicial surgery technique used in prior work.
  Our result provides some suggestion that the quantum TDA algorithm \emph{cannot} be dequantized. More broadly, we hope that our results will open up new possibilities for quantum advantage in topological data analysis.</description>

      <title>Dynamical transition in controllable quantum neural networks with large depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the training dynamics of quantum neural networks is a fundamental task in quantum information science with wide impact in physics, chemistry and machine learning. In this work, we show that the late-time training dynamics of quantum neural networks with a quadratic loss function can be described by the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, which lead to a transcritical bifurcation transition in the dynamics. When the targeted value of loss function crosses the minimum achievable value from above to below, the dynamics evolve from a frozen-kernel dynamics to a frozen-error dynamics, showing a duality between the quantum neural tangent kernel and the total error. In both regions, the convergence towards the fixed point is exponential, while at the critical point becomes polynomial. We provide a non-perturbative analytical theory to explain the transition via a restricted Haar ensemble at late time, when the output state approaches the steady state. Via mapping the Hessian to an effective Hamiltonian, we also identify a linearly vanishing gap at the transition point. Compared with the linear loss function, we show that a quadratic loss function within the frozen-error dynamics enables a speedup in the training convergence. The theory findings are verified experimentally on IBM quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: The advent of quantum computers, operating on entirely different physical principles and abstractions from those of classical digital computers, sets forth a new computing paradigm that can potentially result in game-changing efficiencies and computational performance. Specifically, the ability to simultaneously evolve the state of an entire quantum system leads to quantum parallelism and interference. Despite these prospects, opportunities to bring quantum computing to bear on problems of computational mechanics remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum computing can indeed be used to solve representative volume element (RVE) problems in computational homogenisation with polylogarithmic complexity of $\mathcal{O}((\log N)^c)$, compared to $\mathcal{O}(N^c)$ in classical computing. Thus, our quantum RVE solver attains exponential acceleration with respect to classical solvers, bringing concurrent multiscale computing closer to practicality. The proposed quantum RVE solver combines conventional algorithms such as a fixed-point iteration for a homogeneous reference material and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However, the quantum computing reformulation of these algorithms requires a fundamental paradigm shift and a complete rethinking and overhaul of the classical implementation. We employ or develop several techniques, including the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), quantum encoding of polynomials, classical piecewise Chebyshev approximation of functions and an auxiliary algorithm for implementing the fixed-point iteration and show that, indeed, an efficient implementation of RVE solvers on quantum computers is possible. We additionally provide theoretical proofs and numerical evidence confirming the anticipated $\mathcal{O} \left ((\log N)^c \right)$ complexity of the proposed solver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-Markovian effect on a two-photon polarization entangled state in which one photon from the pair is stored in a fiber delay-line buffer. We propose a model of a photonic qubit coupled to fiber birefringence and a fiber reservoir representing the environment. We analytically derive a non-Markovian probability function for the buffered photon and its paired photon. To verify the probability function, we perform the full quantum state tomography of the photon pairs. The probability function fits well with the experimental data and the physical values. Our result indicates that our quantum system is operating slightly above the threshold for a non-Markovian transition. We observe a unique polarization dynamic of the buffered photon. We further exploit the measures of quantum mutual information for studying the quantumness of the photon pairs. We find that Werner's well-known separability criterion occurs at the buffer time of about 0.9$\,$ms. Our result implies that the quantum discord can surpass Werner's criterion, and hence the quantum bi-partite correlation can exist for a buffer time greater than 0.9$\,$ms.</description>

Abstract: Many resource theories share an interesting property: An operation is free if and only if its renormalized Choi matrix is a free state. In this letter, we refer to resource theories exhibiting this property as Choi-defined resource theories. We demonstrate how and under what conditions one can construct a Choi-defined resource theory, and prove that when such a construction is possible, the free operations are all and only the completely resource non-generating operations. Moreover, we define resource measures, a complete family of monotones, and conversion distances in such resource theories.</description>

      <title>Resisting high-energy impact events through gap engineering in superconducting qubit arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) provides a practical path to fault-tolerant quantum computing through scaling to large qubit numbers, assuming that physical errors are sufficiently uncorrelated in time and space. In superconducting qubit arrays, high-energy impact events produce correlated errors, violating this key assumption. Following such an event, phonons with energy above the superconducting gap propagate throughout the device substrate, which in turn generate a temporary surge in quasiparticle (QP) density throughout the array. When these QPs tunnel across the qubits' Josephson junctions, they induce correlated errors. Engineering different superconducting gaps across the qubit's Josephson junctions provides a method to resist this form of QP tunneling. By fabricating all-aluminum transmon qubits with both strong and weak gap engineering on the same substrate, we observe starkly different responses during high-energy impact events. Strongly gap engineered qubits do not show any degradation in T1 during impact events, while weakly gap engineered qubits show events of correlated degradation in T1. We also show that strongly gap engineered qubits are robust to QP poisoning from increasing optical illumination intensity, whereas weakly gap engineered qubits display rapid degradation in coherence. Based on these results, gap engineering removes the threat of high-energy impacts to QEC in superconducting qubit arrays.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1)-symmetric circuits for certain weak symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively. A unified understanding of these results is provided through the lens of quantum thermalization with conserved charges.</description>

Abstract: Using a single neutral 87Rb atom held in an optical trap, and "quantum jump" detection of single-photon-initiated state changes, we demonstrate a single-photon quantum jump photodetector (QJPD) with intrinsically narrow bandwidth and strong rejection of out-of-band photons, of interest for detecting weak optical signals in the presence of a strong broadband background. By analyzing fluorescence photon count distributions for the bright and dark states with and without excitation, we measure quantum efficiency of 2.9(2)$\times 10^{-3}$, a record for single-pass quantum jump production, and signal-photon-unprovoked "dark jump" rate - analogous to the dark count rate of other detectors - 3(10)$\times 10^{-3}$ jumps per second during passive accumulation plus 4.0(4)$\times 10^{-3}$ jumps per readout, orders of magnitude below those of traditional single-photon detectors. Available methods can substantially improve QJPD quantum efficiency, dark jump rate, bandwidth and tunability.</description>

Abstract: Sampling from the output distributions of quantum computations comprising only commuting gates, known as instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) computations, is believed to be intractable for classical computers, and hence this task has become a leading candidate for testing the capabilities of quantum devices. Here we demonstrate that for an arbitrary IQP circuit undergoing dephasing or depolarizing noise, whose depth is greater than a critical $O(1)$ threshold, the output distribution can be efficiently sampled by a classical computer. Unlike other simulation algorithms for quantum supremacy tasks, we do not require assumptions on the circuit's architecture, on anti-concentration properties, nor do we require $\Omega(\log(n))$ circuit depth. We take advantage of the fact that IQP circuits have deep sections of diagonal gates, which allows the noise to build up predictably and induce a large-scale breakdown of entanglement within the circuit. Our results suggest that quantum supremacy experiments based on IQP circuits may be more susceptible to classical simulation than previously thought.</description>

      <title>The power of a single Haar random state: constructing and separating quantum pseudorandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the following question: what are the cryptographic implications of having access to an oracle that provides a single Haar random quantum state? We show, perhaps surprisingly, that such an oracle is sufficient to construct quantum pseudorandomness.
  Pseudorandom states (PRS) are a family of states for which it is hard to distinguish between polynomially many copies of either a state sampled uniformly from the family or a Haar random state. A weaker notion, called single-copy pseudorandom states (1PRS), satisfies this property with respect to a single copy. We obtain the following results:
  1. First, we show, perhaps surprisingly, that 1PRS (as well as bit-commitments) exist relative to an oracle that provides a single Haar random state.
  2. Second, we build on this result to show the existence of a unitary oracle relative to which 1PRS exist, but PRS do not.
  Taken together, our contributions yield one of the first black-box separations between central notions of quantum pseudorandomness, and introduce a new framework to study black-box separations between various inherently quantum primitives.</description>

      <title>Gibbs-preserving operations requiring infinite amount of quantum coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gibbs-preserving operations have been studied as one of the standard free processes in quantum thermodynamics. Although they admit a simple mathematical structure, their operational significance has been unclear due to the potential hidden cost to implement them using an operatioanlly motivated class of operations, such as thermal operations. Here, we show that this hidden cost can be infinite -- we present a family of Gibbs-preserving operations that cannot be implemented by thermal operations aided by any finite amount of quantum coherence. Our result implies that there are uncountably many Gibbs-preserving operations that require unbounded thermodynamic resources to implement, raising a question about employing Gibbs-preserving operations as available thermodynamics processes. This finding is a consequence of the general lower bounds we provide for the coherence cost of approximately implementing a certain class of Gibbs-preserving operations with a desired accuracy. We find that our lower bound is almost tight, identifying a quantity -- related to the energy change caused by the channel to implement -- as a fundamental quantifier characterizing the coherence cost for the approximate implementation of Gibbs-preserving operations.</description>

Abstract: Aquila, an analog quantum simulation platform developed by QuEra Computing, supports control of the position and coherent evolution of up to 256 neutral atoms. This study details novel experimental protocols designed for analog quantum simulators that generate Bell state entanglement far away from the blockade regime, construct a $Z_2$ state with a defect induced by an ancilla, and optimize the driving fields schedule to prepare excited states with enhanced fidelity. We additionally evaluate the effectiveness of readout error mitigation techniques in improving the fidelity of measurement results. All experiments were executed on Aquila from QuEra and facilitated by the AWS Braket interface. Our experimental results closely align with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations. The insights gained from this study showcase Aquila's capabilities in handling complex quantum simulations and computations, and also pave the way for new avenues of research in quantum information processing and physics that employ programmable analog hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gradient Estimation of Variational Quantum Circuits with Lie Algebraic Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical optimization and learning strategies are among the most promising approaches to harnessing quantum information or gaining a quantum advantage over classical methods. However, efficient estimation of the gradient of the objective function in such models remains a challenge due to several factors including the exponential dimensionality of the Hilbert spaces, and information loss of quantum measurements. In this work, we developed an efficient framework that makes the Hadamard test efficiently applicable to gradient estimation for a broad range of quantum systems, an advance that had been wanting from the outset. Under certain mild structural assumptions, the gradient is estimated with the measurement shots that scale logarithmically with the number of parameters and with polynomial classical and quantum time. This is an exponential reduction in the measurement cost and polynomial speed up in time compared to existing works. The structural assumptions are (1) the dimension of the dynamical Lie algebra is polynomial in the number of qubits, and (2) the observable has a bounded Hilbert-Schmidt norm.</description>

      <title>Lowering the Exponential Wall: Accelerating High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts Screening using Local Surface Energy Descriptors from Neural Network Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational screening is indispensable for the efficient design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which hold considerable potential for catalytic applications. However, the chemical space of HEAs is exponentially vast with respect to the number of constituent elements, making even machine learning-based screening calculations time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a rapid method for predicting HEA properties using data from monometallic systems (or few-component alloys). Central to our approach is the newly introduced local surface energy (LSE) descriptor, which captures local surface reactivity at atomic resolution. By applying linear regression, we successfully screened adsorption energies of molecules on HEAs based on LSEs derived from monometallic systems. Furthermore, we developed high-precision models by employing both classical and quantum machine learning. Our method enabled CO adsorption-energy calculations for 1000 quinary nanoparticles, comprising 201 atoms each, within a few days, considerably faster than density functional theory, which would require hundreds of years or neural network potentials, which would have taken hundreds of days. The proposed approach accelerates the exploration of the vast HEA chemical space, facilitating the design of novel catalysts.</description>

      <title>Effective light-induced Hamiltonian for atoms with large nuclear spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-cold fermionic atoms, having two valence electrons, exhibit a distinctive internal state structure, wherein the nuclear spin becomes decoupled from the electronic degrees of freedom in the ground electronic state. Consequently, the nuclear spin states are well isolated from the environment, rendering these atomic systems an opportune platform for quantum computation and quantum simulations. Coupling with off-resonance light is an essential tool to selectively and coherently manipulate the nuclear spin states. In this paper, we present a systematic derivation of the effective Hamiltonian for the nuclear spin states of ultra-cold fermionic atoms due to such an off-resonance light. We obtain compact expressions for the scalar, vector and tensor light shifts taking into account both linear and quadratic contributions to the hyperfine splitting. The analysis has been carried out using the Green operator approach and solving the corresponding Dyson equation. Finally, we analyze different scenarios of light configurations which lead to the vector- and tensor-light shifts, as well as the pure spin-orbit coupling for the nuclear spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography, aimed at deriving a classical description of an unknown state from measurement data, is a fundamental task in quantum physics. In this work, we analyse the ultimate achievable performance of tomography of continuous-variable systems, such as bosonic and quantum optical systems. We prove that tomography of these systems is extremely inefficient in terms of time resources, much more so than tomography of finite-dimensional systems: not only does the minimum number of state copies needed for tomography scale exponentially with the number of modes, but it also exhibits a dramatic scaling with the trace-distance error, even for low-energy states, in stark contrast with the finite-dimensional case. On a more positive note, we prove that tomography of Gaussian states is efficient. To accomplish this, we answer a fundamental question for the field of continuous-variable quantum information: if we know with a certain error the first and second moments of an unknown Gaussian state, what is the resulting trace-distance error that we make on the state? Lastly, we demonstrate that tomography of non-Gaussian states prepared through Gaussian unitaries and a few local non-Gaussian evolutions is efficient and experimentally feasible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oblivious transfer between two untrusting parties is an important primitive in cryptography. There are different variants of oblivious transfer. In Rabin oblivious transfer, the sender Alice holds a bit, and the receiver Bob either obtains the bit, or obtains no information with probability $p_?$. Alice should not know whether or not Bob obtained the bit. We examine a quantum Rabin oblivious transfer (OT) protocol that uses two pure states. Investigating different cheating scenarios for the sender and for the receiver, we determine optimal cheating probabilities in each case. Comparing the quantum Rabin oblivious transfer protocol to classical Rabin oblivious transfer protocols, we show that the quantum protocol outperforms classical protocols, which do not use a third party, for some values of $p_?$. We find that quantum Rabin OT protocols that use mixed states can outperform quantum Rabin OT protocols that use pure states for some values of $p_?$.</description>

Abstract: Synchronization manifests itself in oscillators adjusting their frequencies and phases with respect to an external signal or another oscillator. In the quantum case, new features appear such as destructive interferences that can result in the suppression of phase locking. A three-level (spin-1) oscillator with equal gain and damping rates and subject to an external drive does not exhibit any 1:1 phase locking but 2:1 phase locking, i.e., its phase distribution features two maxima. This bistable locking at two opposite phases is a signature of the quantum interference synchronization blockade. An analogous behavior was found for two identical coupled spin-1 oscillators. In this work, we consider two coupled spin-1 oscillators and a drive applied to the first spin. This leads to two interference blockades between the drive and the first spin as well as between both spins. Although both interference blockades persist for strong drive and coupling strengths, remarkably, the undriven spin does show a 1:1 phase locking to the external drive. The magnitude of the locking is proportional to the drive strength if the drive strength is small. In other words, the undriven oscillator synchronizes to the external drive through both interference blockades while the blockades persist. For a chain of three coupled spin-1 oscillators, we find synchronization between the first and third spins mediated via the blockaded, second spin.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of Kolmogorov's theory of probability to the description of quantum phenomena. Part I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a common view that von Neumann laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory" with his axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM). As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of QM was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s.
  In this work I argue in favor of the latter position. In particular, I show that for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, it is possible to construct a mathematically rigorous theory based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables, which reproduces central predictions of QM. The respective theories are distinct, so that an empirical comparison may be possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models.
  Part II of this series will address the projection postulate and the question of measurement in this approach.</description>

Abstract: We provide a new paradigm for quantum simulation that is based on path integration that allows quantum speedups to be observed for problems that are more naturally expressed using the path integral formalism rather than the conventional sparse Hamiltonian formalism.
  We provide two novel quantum algorithms based on Hamiltonian versions of the path integral formulation and another for Lagrangians of the form $\frac{m}{2}\dot{x}^2 - V(x)$. This Lagrangian path integral algorithm is based on a new rigorous derivation of a discrete version of the Lagrangian path integral. Our first Hamiltonian path integral method breaks up the paths into short timesteps. It is efficient under appropriate sparsity assumptions and requires a number of queries to oracles that give the eigenvalues and overlaps between the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian terms that scales as $t^{o(1)}/\epsilon^{o(1)}$ for simulation time $t$ and error $\epsilon$. The second approach uses long-time path integrals for near-adiabatic systems and has query complexity that scales as $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ if the energy eigenvalue gaps and simulation time is sufficiently long. Finally, we show that our Lagrangian simulation algorithm requires a number of queries to an oracle that computes the discrete Lagrangian that scales for a system with $\eta$ particles in $D+1$ dimensions, in the continuum limit, as $\widetilde{O}(\eta D t^2/\epsilon)$ if $V(x)$ is bounded and finite and the wave function obeys appropriate position and momentum cutoffs. This shows that Lagrangian dynamics can be efficiently simulated on quantum computers and opens up the possibility for quantum field theories for which the Hamiltonian is unknown to be efficiently simulated on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Circuit Design of Two-Step Quantum Search Algorithm for Solving Traveling Salesman Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum search algorithms, such as Grover's algorithm, are anticipated to efficiently solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems. However, applying these algorithms to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) on a quantum circuit presents a significant challenge. Existing quantum search algorithms for the TSP typically assume that an initial state -- an equal superposition of all feasible solutions satisfying the problem's constraints -- is pre-prepared. The query complexity of preparing this state using brute-force methods scales exponentially with the factorial growth of feasible solutions, creating a significant hurdle in designing quantum circuits for large-scale TSPs. To address this issue, we propose a two-step quantum search (TSQS) algorithm that employs two sets of operators. In the first step, all the feasible solutions are amplified into their equal superposition state. In the second step, the optimal solution state is amplified from this superposition state. The TSQS algorithm demonstrates greater efficiency compared to conventional search algorithms that employ a single oracle operator for finding a solution within the encoded space. Encoded in the higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HOBO) representation, our approach significantly reduces the qubit requirements. This enables efficient initial state preparation through a unified circuit design, offering a quadratic speedup in solving the TSP without prior knowledge of feasible solutions.</description>

Abstract: A procedure to find optimal regimes for quantum thermal engines (QTMs) is described and demonstrated. The QTMs are modelled as the periodically-driven non-equilibrium steady states of open quantum systems, whose dynamics is approximated in this work with Markovian master equations. The action of the external agent, and the couplings to the heat reservoirs can be modulated with control functions, and it is the time-dependent shape of these control functions the object of optimisation. Those functions can be freely parameterised, which permits to constrain the solutions according to experimental or physical requirements.</description>

Abstract: Many claims of computational advantages have been made for quantum computing over classical, but they have not been demonstrated for practical problems. Here, we present algorithms for solving time-dependent PDEs, with particular reference to fluid equations. We build on an idea based on linear combination of unitaries to simulate non-unitary, non-Hermitian quantum systems, and generate hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that efficiently perform iterative matrix-vector multiplication and matrix inversion operations. Though these algorithms are end-to-end, they require relatively low-depth quantum circuits and protect quantum advantage, with the best-case asymptotic complexities, which we show} are near-optimal. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms by conducting: (a) fully gate level, state-vector simulations using an in-house, high performance, quantum simulator called QFlowS; (b) experiments on a real quantum device; and (c) noisy simulations using Qiskit Aer. We also provide device specifications such as error-rates (noise) and state sampling (measurement) to accurately perform convergent flow simulations on noisy devices. The results offer evidence that the proposed algorithm is amenable for use on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in (2+1)D. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder.</description>

      <title>Provable Optimality of the Square-Tooth Atomic Frequency Comb Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic frequency comb (AFC) quantum memories are a promising technology for quantum repeater networks because they enable multi-mode, high-fidelity storage of photons with on-demand retrieval. The optimization of the retrieval efficiency of an AFC memory is important because it strongly impacts the entanglement generation rate in quantum networks. Despite initial theoretical analyses and recent experimental demonstrations, a rigorous proof of the universally optimal configuration for the highest AFC retrieval efficiency has not been presented. In this paper we offer a simple analytical proof which shows that the optimized square-tooth AFC provides the highest retrieval efficiency among all possible comb tooth shapes, under the physical constraint of maximal optical depth of an atomic ensemble. The optimality still holds even when the non-zero background absorption and the finite optical linewidth of atoms are considered. Our proof provides experimentalists with rigorous arguments how to create optimal AFC under realistic experimental conditions. Finally, we also identify other functional optimization problems where our proof technique is applicable, thus proving the optimality of the square function in more general scenarios.</description>

      <title>Online learning of a panoply of quantum objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many quantum tasks, there is an unknown quantum object that one wishes to learn. An online strategy for this task involves adaptively refining a hypothesis to reproduce such an object or its measurement statistics. A common evaluation metric for such a strategy is its regret, or roughly the accumulated errors in hypothesis statistics. We prove a sublinear regret bound for learning over general subsets of positive semidefinite matrices via the regularized-follow-the-leader algorithm and apply it to various settings where one wishes to learn quantum objects. For concrete applications, we present a sublinear regret bound for learning quantum states, effects, channels, interactive measurements, strategies, co-strategies, and the collection of inner products of pure states. Our bound applies to many other quantum objects with compact, convex representations. In proving our regret bound, we establish various matrix analysis results useful in quantum information theory. This includes a generalization of Pinsker's inequality for arbitrary positive semidefinite operators with possibly different traces, which may be of independent interest and applicable to more general classes of divergences.</description>

      <title>Information scrambling in quantum-walks: discrete-time formulation of Krylov complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study information scrambling -- a spread of initially localized quantum information into the system's many degree of freedom -- in discrete-time quantum walks. We consider out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) and K-complexity as probe of information scrambling. The OTOC for local spin operators in all directions has a light-cone structure which is ``shell-like''. As the wavefront passes, the OTOC approaches to zero in the long-time limit, showing no signature of scrambling. The introduction of spatial or temporal disorder changes the shape of the light-cone akin to localization of wavefunction. We formulate the K-complexity in system with discrete-time evolution, and show that it grows linearly in discrete-time quantum walk. The presence of disorder modifies this growth to sub-linear. Our study present interesting case to explore many-body phenomenon in discrete-time quantum walk using scrambling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first experimental demonstration of the odd-cycle game. We entangle two ions separated by ~2 m and the players use them to win the odd-cycle game with a probability ~26 sigma above that allowed by the best classical strategy. The experiment implements the optimal quantum strategy, is free of loopholes, and achieves 97.8(3) % of the theoretical limit to the quantum winning probability. We perform the associated Bell test and measure a nonlocal content of 0.54(2) -- the largest value for physically separate devices, free of the detection loophole, ever observed.</description>

      <title>Generating QES potentials supporting zero energy normalizable states for an extended class of truncated Calogero Sutherland model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in the search for generating potentials for which the underlying Schr\"{o}dinger equation is solvable, we report in the recent work several situations when a zero-energy state becomes bound depending on certain restrictions on the coupling constants that define the potential. In this regard, we present evidence of the existence of regular zero-energy normalizable solutions for a system of quasi-exactly solvable (QES) potentials that correspond to the rationally extended many-body truncated Calogero-Sutherland (TCS) model. Our procedure is based upon the use of the standard potential group approach with an underlying $so(2, 1)$ structure that utilizes a point canonical transformation with three distinct types of potentials emerging having the same eigenvalues while their common properties are subjected to the evaluation of the relevant wave functions. These cases are treated individually by suitably restricting the coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Integrability of open boundary driven quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Yang-Baxter integrability of doubled quantum circuit of qubits (spins 1/2) with open boundary conditions where the two circuit replicas are only coupled at the left or right boundary. We investigate the cases where the bulk is given by elementary six vertex unitary gates of either the free fermionic XX type or interacting XXZ type. By using the Sklyanin's construction of reflection algebra, we obtain the most general solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for such a setup. We use this solution to build, from the transfer matrix formalism, integrable circuits with two step discrete time Floquet (aka brickwork) dynamics. We prove that, only if the bulk is a free-model, the boundary matrices are in general non-factorizable, and for particular choice of free parameters yield non-trivial unitary dynamics with boundary interaction between the two chains. Then, we consider the limit of continuous time evolution and we give the interpretation of a restricted set of the boundary terms in the Lindbladian setting. Specifically, for a particular choice of free parameters, the solutions correspond to an open quantum system dynamics with the source terms representing injecting or removing particles from the boundary of the spin chain.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity for 1-matrix quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the notion of Krylov complexity, a measure of operator growth, within the framework of 1-matrix quantum mechanics (1-MQM). Krylov complexity quantifies how an operator evolves over time by expanding it in a series of nested commutators with the Hamiltonian. We analyze the Lanczos coefficients derived from the correlation function, revealing their linear growth even in this integrable system. This growth suggests a link to chaotic behavior, typically unexpected in integrable systems. Our findings in both ground and thermal states of 1-MQM provide new insights into the nature of complexity in quantum mechanical models and lay the groundwork for further studies in more complex holographic theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum Query-Space Lower Bounds Using Branching Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Branching programs are quite popular for studying time-space lower bounds. Bera et al. recently introduced the model of generalized quantum branching program aka. GQBP that generalized two earlier models of quantum branching programs. In this work we study a restricted version of GQBP with the motivation of proving bounds on the query-space requirement of quantum-query circuits. We show the first explicit query-space lower bound for our restricted version. We prove that the well-studied OR$_n$ decision problem, given a promise that at most one position of an $n$-sized Boolean array is a 1, satisfies the bound $Q^2 s = \Omega(n^2)$, where $Q$ denotes the number of queries and $s$ denotes the width of the GQBP. We then generalize the problem to show that the same bound holds for deciding between two strings with a constant Hamming distance; this gives us query-space lower bounds on problems such as Parity and Majority. Our results produce an alternative proof of the $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-lower bound on the query complexity of any non-constant symmetric Boolean function.</description>

      <title>Twirled worlds: symmetry-induced failures of tomographic locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tomographic locality is a principle commonly used in the program of finding axioms that pick out quantum theory within the landscape of possible theories. The principle asserts the sufficiency of local measurements for achieving a tomographic characterization of any bipartite state. In this work, we explore the meaning of the principle of tomographic locality by developing a simple scheme for generating a wide variety of theories that violate the principle. In this scheme, one starts with a tomographically local theory -- which can be classical, quantum or post-quantum -- and a physical symmetry, and one restricts the processes in the theory to all and only those that are covariant with respect to the collective action of that symmetry. We refer to the resulting theories as twirled worlds. We show that failures of tomographic locality are ubiquitous in twirled worlds. From the possibility of such failures in classical twirled worlds, we argue that the failure of tomographic locality (i.e., tomographic nonlocality) does not imply ontological holism. Our results also demonstrate the need for researchers seeking to axiomatize quantum theory to take a stand on the question of whether there are superselection rules that have a fundamental status.</description>

Abstract: The intensity correlations due to imperfect modulation during the quantum-state preparation in a measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI QKD) system compromise its security performance. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the impact of intensity correlations on the practical security of MDI QKD systems. In this work, we propose a theoretical model that quantitatively analyzes the secure key rate of MDI QKD systems under intensity correlations. Furthermore, we apply the theoretical model to a practical MDI QKD system with measured intensity correlations, which shows that the system struggles to generate keys efficiently under this model. We also explore the boundary conditions of intensity correlations to generate secret keys. This study extends the security analysis of intensity correlations to MDI QKD protocols, providing a methodology to evaluate the practical security of MDI QKD systems.</description>

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information tasks, but characterizing entanglement structures in continuous variable systems remains challenging, especially in multimode non-Gaussian scenarios. In this work, we introduce a method for detecting multipartite entanglement structures in continuous variable states. By leveraging the quantum Fisher information, we propose a systematic approach to identify feasible operators that capture quantum correlations in multimode non-Gaussian states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on over $10^5$ randomly generated multimode-entangled quantum states, achieving a high success rate in entanglement detection. Additionally, our method exhibits enhanced robustness against losses by expanding the set of accessible operators. This work provides a general framework for characterizing entanglement structures in diverse continuous variable systems, enabling a number of experimentally relevant applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interface between quantum and relativistic theories is crucial for fundamental and practical advances, especially given that key physical concepts such as causality take different forms in these theories. Bell's no-go theorem reveals limits on classical processes, arising from relativistic causality principles. Considering whether similar fundamental limits exist on quantum processes, we derive no-go theorems for quantum experiments realisable in classical background spacetimes. We account for general processes allowed by quantum theory, including those with indefinite causal order (ICO), which have also been the subject of recent experiments. Our first theorem implies that realisations of ICO processes that do not violate relativistic causality must involve the non-localization of systems in spacetime. The second theorem shows that for any such realisation of an ICO process, there exists a more fine-grained description in terms of a definite and acyclic causal order process. This enables a general reconciliation of quantum and relativistic notions of causality and, in particular, applies to experimental realisations of the quantum switch, a prominent ICO process. By showing what is impossible to achieve in classical spacetimes, these no-go results also offer insights into how causality and information processing may differ in future quantum experiments in relativistic regimes beyond classical spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal rate of reliable communication over a quantum channel can be enhanced by pre-shared entanglement. Whereas the enhancement may be unbounded in infinite-dimensional settings even when the input power is constrained, a long-standing conjecture asserts that the ratio between the entanglement-assisted and unassisted classical capacities is bounded in finite-dimensional settings [Bennett et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 3081 (2002)]. In this work, we prove this conjecture by showing that their ratio is upper bounded by $o(d^2)$, where $d$ is the input dimension of the channel. An application to quantum communication with noisy encoders and decoders is given.</description>

Abstract: What is fundamentally quantum? We argue that most of the features, problems, and paradoxes -- such as the measurement problem, the Wigner's friend paradox and its proposed solutions, single particle nonlocality, and no-cloning -- allegedly attributed to quantum physics have a clear classical analogue if one is to interpret classical physics as fundamentally indeterministic. What really characterizes quantum physics boils down only to phenomena that involve $\hbar$, i.e., incompatible observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of testing properties of quantum channels. First, we show that testing identity to any channel $\mathcal N: \mathbb C^{d_{\mathrm{in}} \times d_{\mathrm{in}}} \to \mathbb C^{d_{\mathrm{out}} \times d_{\mathrm{out}}}$ in diamond norm distance requires $\Omega(\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{in}}} / \varepsilon)$ queries, even in the strongest algorithmic model that admits ancillae, coherence, and adaptivity. This is due to the worst-case nature of the distance induced by the diamond norm.
  Motivated by this limitation and other theoretical and practical applications, we introduce an average-case analogue of the diamond norm, which we call the average-case imitation diamond (ACID) norm. In the weakest algorithmic model without ancillae, coherence, or adaptivity, we prove that testing identity to certain types of channels in ACID distance can be done with complexity independent of the dimensions of the channel, while for other types of channels the complexity depends on both the input and output dimensions. Building on previous work, we also show that identity to any fixed channel can be tested with $\tilde O(d_{\mathrm{in}} d_{\mathrm{out}}^{3/2} / \varepsilon^2)$ queries in ACID distance and $\tilde O(d_{\mathrm{in}}^2 d_{\mathrm{out}}^{3/2} / \varepsilon^2)$ queries in diamond distance in this model. Finally, we prove tight bounds on the complexity of channel tomography in ACID distance.</description>

      <title>Hard Quantum Extrapolations in Quantum Cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although one-way functions are well-established as the minimal primitive for classical cryptography, a minimal primitive for quantum cryptography is still unclear. Universal extrapolation, first considered by Impagliazzo and Levin (1990), is hard if and only if one-way functions exist. Towards better understanding minimal assumptions for quantum cryptography, we study the quantum analogues of the universal extrapolation task. Specifically, we put forth the classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation task, where we ask to extrapolate the rest of a bipartite pure state given the first register measured in the computational basis. We then use it as a key component to establish new connections in quantum cryptography: (a) quantum commitments exist if classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation is hard; and (b) classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation is hard if any of the following cryptographic primitives exists: quantum public-key cryptography (such as quantum money and signatures) with a classical public key or 2-message quantum key distribution protocols.
  For future work, we further generalize the extrapolation task and propose a fully quantum analogue. We show that it is hard if quantum commitments exist, and it is easy for quantum polynomial space.</description>

      <title>Polarization-encoded quantum key distribution with a room-temperature telecom single-photon emitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single photon sources (SPSs) are directly applicable in quantum key distribution (QKD) because they allow the implementation of the canonical BB84 protocol. To date, QKD implementations using SPS are not widespread because of the need for cryogenic operation, or frequency conversion to a wavelength efficiently transmitted over telecommunication fibers. We report an observation of polarization-encoded QKD using a room-temperature telecom SPS based on a GaN defect. A field test over 3.5 km of deployed fiber with 4.0 dB loss yielded a secure key rate of 585.9~bps. Further testing in a 32.5 km fiber spool (attenuation of 11.2 dB), which exhibited substantially lower polarization mode dispersion, yielded a secure key rate of 50.4 bps. Both results exhibited a quantum bit error rate (QBER) of approximately 5%. These results illustrate the potential of the GaN defects for supporting polarization-encoded quantum communication.</description>

      <title>AQMLator -- An Auto Quantum Machine Learning E-Platform</title>

Abstract: A successful Machine Learning (ML) model implementation requires three main components: training dataset, suitable model architecture and training procedure. Given dataset and task, finding an appropriate model might be challenging. AutoML, a branch of ML, focuses on automatic architecture search -- a meta method that aims at moving human from ML system design process. The success of ML and the development of quantum computing (QC) in recent years led to a birth of new fascinating field called Quantum Machine Learning (QML) that, amongst others, incorporates quantum computers into ML models. In this paper we present AQMLator, an Auto Quantum Machine Learning platform that aims to automatically propose and train the quantum layers of an ML model with minimal input from the user. This way, data scientists can bypass the entry barrier for QC and use QML. AQMLator uses standard ML libraries, making it easy to introduce into existing ML pipelines.</description>

      <title>The controlled exciton transport of the Multi-chain system by cavity-dressed energy level crossings and anticrossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accomplished functions of a variety of quantum devices are closely associated with the controlling of exciton transport. To this end we study the exciton transport of the two-dimensional system consisting of two-level multichains with various coupling configurations in a cavity. Two types of the chains are considered, including Tavis-Cummings and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain. Two conformations of the coupling between chains are considered, including square and triangle type. The effects of the inter-chain coupling, dimerization parameter, the cavity, the length of chains, and the number of chains on the exciton transport are in detail investigated for different coupling configurations of the multi-chain system through spectra and steady-state dynamics. The results show that in the absence of a cavity the exciton transport effciency is decided by the distribution of population of exciton on whole chains. However, when the cavity is considered the exciton transport currents and effciency of the system is controlled by the cavity-dressed energy level crossings and anticrossings near zero-energy modes, at which the coherent excitation and Landau-Zener transitions occur. Therefore, the exciton transport can be enhanced or suppressed at the crossings and anticrossings, in which the polariton acts as crucial role. Besides, it is discovered that the exciton transport effciency is closely related with the parity of both the length and the number of chains. This work is important for the understanding of the exciton transport mechanism in the multichain-cavity system, and provides theoretical basis for excitonic devices with controllable and effcient exciton transport.</description>

      <title>Error exponent of activated non-signaling assisted classical-quantum channel coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a tight asymptotic characterization of the error exponent for classical-quantum channel coding assisted by activated non-signaling correlations. Namely, we find that the optimal exponent--also called reliability function--is equal to the well-known sphere packing bound, which can be written as a single-letter formula optimized over Petz-R\'enyi divergences. Remarkably, there is no critical rate and as such our characterization remains tight for arbitrarily low rates below the capacity. On the achievability side, we further extend our results to fully quantum channels. Our proofs rely on semi-definite program duality and a dual representation of the Petz-R\'enyi divergences via Young inequalities.</description>

      <title>Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states boost odd-frequency superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict that the occurence of zero energy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov(YSR) bound states in two different setups, metal-spin flipper-metal-s-wave superconductor ($N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$) and superconductor-metal-spin flipper-metal-superconductor ($S-N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$) junctions, can generate multi-fold enhancement of surface-induced odd-frequency superconductivity. On the other hand, in the absence of these bound states, even-frequency superconductivity dominates. Specifically, in a $S-N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$ Josephson junction, the emergence of zero energy YSR bound states leads to a $0-\pi$ junction transition and surface odd-frequency superconductivity dominance. Notably, odd-frequency superconductivity vanishes in the absence of YSR-bound states. Interestingly, the equal spin-triplet pairing is the dominant component in the surface induced odd-frequency superconductivity in both setups, which could have important implications for superconducting spintronics. Overall, our findings may help to detect the presence of YSR-bound states through the observation of surface induced odd-frequency superconductivity and contribute to a better understanding of their relationship.</description>

      <title>New Power Method for Solving Eigenvalue Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new power method to obtain solutions of eigenvalue problems. The method can determine not only the dominant or lowest eigenvalues but also all eigenvalues without the need for a deflation procedure. The method uses a functional of an operator (or a matrix) to select or filter an eigenvalue. The method can freely select a solution by varying a parameter associated to an estimate of the eigenvalue. The convergence of the method is highly dependent on how closely the parameter to the eigenvalues. In this paper, numerical results of the method are shown to be in excellent agreement with the analytical ones.</description>

      <title>Spin exchange-enabled quantum simulator for large-scale non-Abelian gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central requirement for the faithful implementation of large-scale lattice gauge theories (LGTs) on quantum simulators is the protection of the underlying gauge symmetry. Recent advancements in the experimental realizations of large-scale LGTs have been impressive, albeit mostly restricted to Abelian gauge groups. Guided by this requirement for gauge protection, we propose an experimentally feasible approach to implement large-scale non-Abelian $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ and $\mathrm{U}(N)$ LGTs with dynamical matter in $d+1$D, enabled by two-body spin-exchange interactions realizing local emergent gauge-symmetry stabilizer terms. We present two concrete proposals for $2+1$D $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{U}(2)$ LGTs, including dynamical bosonic matter and induced plaquette terms, that can be readily implemented in current ultracold-molecule and next-generation ultracold-atom platforms. We provide numerical benchmarks showcasing experimentally accessible dynamics, and demonstrate the stability of the underlying non-Abelian gauge invariance. We develop a method to obtain the effective gauge-invariant model featuring the relevant magnetic plaquette and minimal gauge-matter coupling terms. Our approach paves the way towards near-term realizations of large-scale non-Abelian quantum link models in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooper quartets represent exotic fermion aggregates describing correlated matter at the basis of charge-$4e$ superconductivity and offer a platform for studying four-body interactions, of interest for topologically protected quantum computing, nuclear matter simulations, and more general strongly correlated matter. Focusing on solid-state systems, we show how to quantum design Cooper quartets in a double-dot system coupled to ordinary superconducting leads through the introduction of an attractive interdot interaction. A fundamentally novel, maximally correlated double-dot ground state, in the form of a superposition of vacuum $|0\rangle$ and four-electron state $|4e\rangle$, emerges as a narrow resonance in a many-body quartet correlator that is accompanied by negligible pair correlations and features a rich phenomenology. The system represents an instance of correlated Andreev matter and the results open the way to the exploration of interaction effects in hybrid superconducting devices, and the study of novel correlated states of matter with ingredients available in a quantum solid-state laboratory.</description>

      <title>Anomaly inflow, dualities, and quantum simulation of abelian lattice gauge theories induced by measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous work [SciPost Phys. 14, 129 (2023)] has demonstrated that quantum simulation of abelian lattice gauge theories (Wegner models including the toric code in a limit) in general dimensions can be achieved by local adaptive measurements on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states with higher-form generalized global symmetries. The entanglement structure of the resource SPT state reflects the geometric structure of the gauge theory. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the anomaly inflow mechanism between the deconfining phase of the simulated gauge theory on the boundary and the SPT state in the bulk, by showing that the anomalous gauge variation of the boundary state obtained by bulk measurement matches that of the bulk theory. Moreover, we construct the resource state and the measurement pattern for the measurement-based quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory with a matter field (Fradkin-Shenker model), where a simple scheme to protect gauge invariance of the simulated state against errors is proposed. We further consider taking an overlap between the wave function of the resource state for lattice gauge theories and that of a parameterized product state, and we derive precise dualities between partition functions with insertion of defects corresponding to gauging higher-form global symmetries, as well as measurement-induced phases where states induced by a partial overlap possess different (symmetry-protected) topological orders. Measurement-assisted operators to dualize quantum Hamiltonians of lattice gauge theories and their non-invertibility are also presented.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of first-class constraints and the quantization of gauge theories: from "matter without matter" to the reappearance of time in quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make a conceptual overview of a particular approach to the initial-value problem in canonical gauge theories. We stress how the first-class phase-space constraints may be relaxed if we interpret them as fixing the values of new degrees of freedom. This idea goes back to Fock and Stueckelberg, leading to restrictions of the gauge symmetry of a theory, and it corresponds, in certain cases, to promoting constants of Nature to physical fields. Recently, different versions of this formulation have gained considerable attention in the literature, with several independent iterations, particularly in classical and quantum descriptions of gravity, cosmology, and electromagnetism. In particular, in the case of canonical quantum gravity, the Fock--Stueckelberg approach is relevant to the so-called problem of time. Our overview recalls and generalizes the work of Fock and Stueckelberg and its physical interpretation with the aim of conceptually unifying the different iterations of the idea that appear in the literature and of motivating further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the quasi-parton distributions of the lightest $\eta'$ meson in massive two-dimensional Quantum electrodynamics (QED2) by performing a digital quantum simulation on a classical computer (exact diagonalization). The Hamiltonian and boost operators are mapped onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. The lowest excited state in the exact diagonalization is shown to interpolate continuously between an anomalous $\eta'$ state at strong coupling,and a non-anomalous heavy meson at weak coupling, with a cusp at the critical point. The boosted $\eta'$ state follows relativistic kinematics but with large deviations in the luminal limit. The spatial quasi-parton distribution function and amplitude for the $\eta'$ state are computed numerically for increasing rapidity both at strong and weak coupling, and compared to the exact light front results. The numerical results from the boosted form of the spatial parton distributions, compare fairly with the inverse Fourier transformation of the luminal parton distributions, derived in the lowest Fock space approximation. Our analysis points out some of the limitations facing the current lattice program for the parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Shortcut to Chemically Accurate Quantum Computing via Density-based Basis-set Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using GPU-accelerated state-vector emulation, we propose to embed a quantum computing ansatz into density-functional theory via density-based basis-set corrections (DBBSC) to obtain quantitative quantum-chemistry results on molecules that would otherwise require brute-force quantum calculations using hundreds of logical qubits. Indeed, accessing a quantitative description of chemical systems while minimizing quantum resources is an essential challenge given the limited qubit capabilities of current quantum processors. We provide a shortcut towards chemically accurate quantum computations by approaching the complete-basis-set limit through coupling the DBBSC approach, applied to any given variational ansatz, to an on-the-fly crafting of basis sets specifically adapted to a given system and user-defined qubit budget. The resulting approach self-consistently accelerates the basis-set convergence, improving electronic densities, ground-state energies, and first-order properties (e.g. dipole moments), but can also serve as a classical, a posteriori, energy correction to quantum hardware calculations with expected applications in drug design and materials science.</description>

      <title>Complexity is not Enough for Randomness</title>

Abstract: We study the dynamical generation of randomness in Brownian systems as a function of the degree of locality of the Hamiltonian. We first express the trace distance to a unitary design for these systems in terms of an effective equilibrium thermal partition function, and provide a set of conditions that guarantee a linear time to design. We relate the trace distance to design to spectral properties of the time-evolution operator. We apply these considerations to the Brownian $p$-SYK model as a function of the degree of locality $p$. We show that the time to design is linear, with a slope proportional to $1/p$. We corroborate that when $p$ is of order the system size this reproduces the behavior of a completely non-local Brownian model of random matrices. For the random matrix model, we reinterpret these results from the point of view of classical Brownian motion in the unitary manifold. Therefore, we find that the generation of randomness typically persists for exponentially long times in the system size, even for systems governed by highly non-local time-dependent Hamiltonians. We conjecture this to be a general property: there is no efficient way to generate approximate Haar random unitaries dynamically, unless a large degree of fine-tuning is present in the ensemble of time-dependent Hamiltonians. We contrast the slow generation of randomness to the growth of quantum complexity of the time-evolution operator. Using known bounds on circuit complexity for unitary designs, we obtain a lower bound determining that complexity grows at least linearly in time for Brownian systems. We argue that these bounds on circuit complexity are far from tight and that complexity grows at a much faster rate, at least for non-local systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional fracton topological orders with boundary Toeplitz braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study a class of 3D non-liquid states that show exotic boundary phenomena in the thermodynamical limit. More concretely, we focus on a class of 3D fracton topological orders formed via stacking 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_N\) topologically ordered layers along \(z\)-direction. Nearby layers are coupled while maintaining translation symmetry along \(z\) direction. The effective field theory is given by the infinite-component Chern-Simons (iCS) field theory, with an integer-valued symmetric block-tridiagonal Toeplitz \(K\)-matrix whose size is thermodynamically large. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along \(z\), certain choice of \(K\)-matrices exhibits exotic boundary ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding phase angle between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in trivial case, the mutual braiding phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamical limit. As a necessary condition, this phenomenon requires the existence of boundary zero modes in the \(K\)-matrix spectrum under OBC. We categorize nontrivial \(K\)-matrices into two distinct types. Each type-I possesses two boundary zero modes, whereas each type-II possesses only one boundary zero mode. Interestingly, the integer-valued Hamiltonian matrix of the familiar 1D SSH can be used as a non-trivial $K$-matrix. Importantly, since large-gauge-invariance ensures integer quantized \(K\)-matrix entries, global symmetries are not needed to protect these zero modes. We also present numerical simulation as well as finite size scaling, further confirming the above analytical results. Symmetry fractionalization is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement harvesting in buckled honeycomb lattices by vacuum fluctuations in a microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement harvesting between two identical buckled honeycomb lattices placed inside a planar microcavity. By applying time dependent perturbation theory, we obtain quantum correlations between both layers induced by the cavity field. Considering the vacuum state as the initial state of the cavity field and tracing out the time-evolved degrees of freedom, we analyze the entanglement formation using the concurrence measure. We show that the concurrence depends on the virtual photon exchanged and the positions of the layer through the interlayer photon propagator. Furthermore, we find that the formation of entanglement between equal energy electrons tends to be enhanced when they move in perpendicular directions. Our results indicate that a buckled honeycomb structure and a large spin-orbit interaction favor the entanglement harvesting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper looks at the intersection of algorithmic information theory and physics, namely quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and black holes. We discuss theorems which characterize the barrier between the quantum world and the classical realm. The notion of a ``semi-classical subspace'' is introduced. Partial signals and partial cloning can be executed on quantum states in semi-classical subspaces. The No Synchronization Law is detailed, which says separate and isolated physical systems evolving over time cannot have thermodynamic algorithmic entropies that are in synch. We look at future work involving the Kolmogorov complexity of black holes.</description>

      <title>Geometric Phases in Optics: Polarization of Light Propagating in Helical Optical Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric phase in optics (GPIO) is directly associated with the polarization of light. We investigate the physical principles underlying the occurrence of the GPIO for a single-mode light beam propagating in a single-mode optical fiber wound into a circular helix configuration, with and without stress-induced birefringence. The effects of the curvature and torsion of the helical fiber on the rotation of the polarization vector and the associated GPIO are discussed. Analytic expressions are derived for the polarization vector and Stokes parameters for any initial polarization state of the light entering the helical fiber, as well as for the GPIO of the light as a function of helix arc-length. Additionally, the intensity of a superposition of the initial and final beams, which depends on the final GPIO, is derived. Furthermore, the relationship between the GPIO and the solid angle subtended by the tangent vector of the helix plotted on the Poincar\'{e} sphere is analyzed, and the effects of fluctuations of the parameters specifying the geometry and the material characteristics of the helical fiber on the GPIO are considered.</description>

      <title>Real-time chiral dynamics at finite temperature from quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the real-time dynamics of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) at a finite temperature in the (1+1)-dimensional QED, the massive Schwinger model. By introducing a chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ through a quench process, we drive the system out of equilibrium and analyze the induced vector currents and their evolution over time. The Hamiltonian is modified to include the time-dependent chiral chemical potential, thus allowing the investigation of the CME within a quantum computing framework. We employ the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm to study the thermal states, and utilize the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for the real-time evolution. This study provides insights into the quantum simulation capabilities for modeling the CME and offers a pathway for studying chiral dynamics in low-dimensional quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm in systems with large condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers an exponential speedup in system size for treating linear equations of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ on quantum computers when compared to their traditional counterparts, it faces a challenge related to the condition number ($\mathcal{\kappa}$) scaling of the $A$ matrix. In this work, we address the issue by introducing the post-selection-improved HHL (Psi-HHL) approach that involves a simple yet effective modification of the HHL algorithm to extract a feature of $|x\rangle$, and which leads to achieving optimal behaviour in $\mathcal{\kappa}$ (linear scaling) for large condition number situations. This has the important practical implication of having to use substantially fewer shots relative to the traditional HHL algorithm. We carry out two sets of simulations, where we go up to 26-qubit calculations, to demonstrate the ability of Psi-HHL to handle situations involving large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ matrices via: (a) a set of toy matrices, for which we go up to size $64 \times 64$ and $\mathcal{\kappa}$ values of up to $\approx$ 1 million, and (b) a deep-dive into quantum chemistry, where we consider matrices up to size $256 \times 256$ that reach $\mathcal{\kappa}$ of about 466. The molecular systems that we consider are Li$_{\mathrm{2}}$, RbH, and CsH. Although the feature of $|x\rangle$ considered in our examples is an overlap between the input and output states of the HHL algorithm, our approach is general and can be applied in principle to any transition matrix element involving $|x\rangle$.</description>

      <title>Ultralight dark matter detection with levitated ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Levitated ferromagnets act as ultraprecise magnetometers, which can exhibit high quality factors due to their excellent isolation from the environment. These instruments can be utilized in searches for ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axionlike dark matter or dark-photon dark matter. In addition to being sensitive to an axion-photon coupling or kinetic mixing, which produce physical magnetic fields, ferromagnets are also sensitive to the effective magnetic field (or ``axion wind") produced by an axion-electron coupling. While the dynamics of a levitated ferromagnet in response to a DC magnetic field have been well studied, all of these couplings would produce AC fields. In this work, we study the response of a ferromagnet to an applied AC magnetic field and use these results to project their sensitivity to axion and dark-photon dark matter. We pay special attention to the direction of motion induced by an applied AC field, in particular, whether it precesses around the applied field (similar to an electron spin) or librates in the plane of the field (similar to a compass needle). We show that existing levitated ferromagnet setups can already have comparable sensitivity to an axion-electron coupling as comagnetometer or torsion balance experiments. In addition, future setups can become sensitive probes of axion-electron coupling, dark-photon kinetic mixing, and axion-photon coupling, for ultralight dark matter masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim\mathrm{feV}$.</description>

      <title>Classification of symmetry protected states of quantum spin chains for continuous symmetry groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry protected states (SPT's) of quantum spin systems were studied by several authors. For one-dimensional systems (spin chains), there is an essentially complete and rigorous understanding: SPT's corresponding to finite on-site symmetry groups $G$ are classified by the second cohomology group $H^2(G,U(1))$, as established by Kapustin et al. [J. Math. Phys. (2021)]. We extend this result to the case of compact topological symmetry groups $G$. We also strengthen the existing results in the sense that our classification results holds within the class of spin chains with locally bounded on-site dimensions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multifractal Critical Phases in Two-Dimensional Quasiperiodic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multifractal critical phase (MCP) fundamentally differs from extended and localized phases, exhibiting delocalized distributions in both position and momentum spaces. The investigation on the MCP has largely focused on one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional (2D) quasiperiodic model with a MCP. We present its phase diagram and investigate the characteristics of the 2D system's MCP in terms of wave packet diffusion and transport based on this model. We further investigate the movement of the phase boundary induced by the introduction of next-nearest-neighbor hopping by calculating the fidelity susceptibility. Finally, we consider how to realize our studied model in superconducting circuits. Our work opens the door to exploring MCP in 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Sub-100 Hz Intrinsic Linewidth 852 nm Silicon Nitride External Cavity Laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an external cavity laser with intrinsic linewidth below 100 Hz around an operating wavelength of 852 nm, selected for its relevance to laser cooling and manipulation of cesium atoms. This system achieves a maximum CW output power of 24 mW, wavelength tunability over 15 nm, and a side-mode suppression ratio exceeding 50 dB. This performance level is facilitated by careful design of a low-loss integrated silicon nitride photonic circuit serving as the external cavity combined with commercially available semiconductor gain chips. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of compact integrated lasers with sub-kHz linewidth centering on the needs of emerging sensor concepts based on ultracold atoms and can be further extended to shorter wavelengths via selection of suitable semiconductor gain media.</description>

      <title>Revealing non-Markovian Kondo transport with waiting time distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-Markovian transport dynamics and signatures of the Kondo effect in a single impurity Anderson model. The model consists of a quantum dot (QD) with ultra-strong coupling to a left lead and weak coupling to a right lead acting as a detector. We calculate the waiting time distribution (WTD) of electrons tunneling into the detector using a combination of the hierarchical equations of motion approach (HEOM) and a dressed master equation. Oscillations emerge in the short-time WTD, becoming more pronounced with stronger left-lead coupling. Fourier analysis reveals a blue shift in the oscillation frequency as coupling increases, indicating enhanced system-bath hybridization. Crucially, comparison with a dressed master equation confirms that these oscillations are a direct consequence of non-Markovian system-bath correlations. We examine the Kondo effect's influence on these oscillations by varying the quantum dot's Coulomb repulsion. Increasing this interaction enhances the WTD oscillations, coinciding with the signatures of a strengthened Kondo resonance in the quantum dot's density of states. Our results demonstrate that WTD oscillations offer a valuable tool for probing non-Markovian system-bath interactions and the emergence of Kondo correlations within quantum dot systems.</description>
