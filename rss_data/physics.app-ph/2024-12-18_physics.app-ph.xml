      <title>Quadrupole topological behavior of elastic waves in two-dimensional square lattices with nonsymmorphic symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel higher-order topological behavior in elastic lattices characterized by nonsymmorphic symmetries. In the theoretical spring-mass lattice, altering the vertex mass allows for fine-tuning of the topological features within the bandgap. We analyze the quadrupole topological behavior in square lattices with nonsymmorphic symmetries using nested Wannier bands. Beyond second-order topological metamaterials, a single-phase topological configuration promotes energy localization at the corners due to a non-zero relative quadrupole moment. Our findings are validated through experimental observations of higher-order topological corner states, which show excellent agreement with simulated results and theoretical predictions. Additionally, the elastic lattices in the self-similar system exhibit fractal higher-order topological behaviors, revealing numerous topological edge and corner states. The self-similar lattice also demonstrates enhanced energy localization, with the number of topological states showing a linear correlation to the corner dimension. This study provides new insights into elastic higher-order topological insulators and inspires innovative strategies for simulating topological elastic materials.</description>

      <title>Application of machine learning in grain-related clustering of Laue spots in a polycrystalline energy dispersive Laue pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the identification of grain-corresponding Laue reflections in energy dispersive Laue diffraction (EDLD) experiments by formulating it as a clustering problem solvable through unsupervised machine learning (ML). To achieve reliable and efficient identification of grains in a Laue pattern, we employ a combination of clustering algorithms, namely hierarchical clustering (HC) and K-means. These algorithms allow us to group together similar Laue reflections, revealing the underlying grain structure in the diffraction pattern. Additionally, we utilise the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring accurate results. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conducted experiments using both simulated and experimental datasets obtained from nickel wires. The simulated datasets were generated to mimic the characteristics of real-world EDLD experiments, while the experimental datasets were obtained from actual measurements.</description>

      <title>Capacitive-Tuned SIW Evanescent-Mode Cavity for Resonant Microwave Plasma Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel atmospheric pressure and frequency-tunable microwave plasma jet utilizing evanescent-mode cavity resonator technology. The design uses a substrate-integrated waveguide approach, where two PCB substrates are assembled to form the resonant microwave plasma jet structure. This configuration provides excellent matching performance across the tuning range and can generate power-efficient plasma jets with a minimal input power of just a few watts. The prototype's resonant frequency can be tuned from 2.94 GHz, with no tuning capacitor, to 2.66 GHz when a capacitor placed in parallel with a circular slot etched on the top PCB board varies up to 1.6 pF. A novel circuit model design approach for this prototype is presented, and close agreement between the measured performance of the fabricated prototype and the simulation results validates this model. The frequency tunability achieved is a critical feature for fine-tuning the plasma jet when fabricated by low-cost PCB manufacturing and for applications in which manipulating the plasma chemistry by varying the ignition frequency is essential.</description>

      <title>Dielectrophoresis-Enhanced Graphene Field-Effect Transistors for Nano-Analyte Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectrophoretic (DEP) sensing is an extremely important sensing modality that enables the rapid capture and detection of polarizable particles of nano-scale size. This makes it a versatile tool for applications in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and materials science. Because DEP relies upon the creation of sharp electrode edges, its sensitivity is fundamentally limited by the electrode thickness. Graphene, with its monolayer thickness, enables scaling of the DEP force, allowing trapping of particles at graphene edges at ultra-low voltages. However, to date, this enhanced trapping efficiency of graphene has not been translated into an effective sensing geometry. Here, we demonstrate the expansion of graphene DEP trapping capability into a graphene field effect transistor (GFET) geometry that allows the trapped particles to be electrically detected. This four-terminal multi-functional hybrid device structure operates in three distinct modes: DEP, GFET, and DEP-GFET. By segmenting the channel of the GFET into multiple parallel channels, greatly increased density of particle trapping is demonstrated using fluorescence microscopy analysis. We show further enhancement of the trapping efficiency using engineered "nano-sites," which are holes in the graphene with size on the order of 200-300 nm. Scanning electron microscope analysis of immobilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) shows trapping efficiency &gt;90% for properly engineered nano-sites. Using nano-site trapping, we also demonstrate real-time, rapid electrical sensing of AuNPs, with &gt;2% current change occurring in 4.1 seconds, as well as rapid sensing of a variety of biomolecule-coated nanoparticles. This work shows that graphene DEP is an effective platform for nanoparticle and bio-molecule sensing that overcomes diffusion-limited and Brownian motion-based interactions.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Effect of Electrical and Thermal Transport Properties on Oxide-Based Memristors Performance and Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving reliable resistive switching in oxide-based memristive devices requires precise control over conductive filament (CF) formation and behavior, yet the fundamental relationship between oxide material properties and switching uniformity remains incompletely understood. Here, we develop a comprehensive physical model to investigate how electrical and thermal conductivities influence CF dynamics in TaOx-based memristors. Our simulations reveal that higher electrical conductivity promotes oxygen vacancy generation and reduces forming voltage, while higher thermal conductivity enhances heat dissipation, leading to increased forming voltage. The uniformity of resistive switching is strongly dependent on the interplay between these transport properties. We identify two distinct pathways for achieving optimal High Resistance State (HRS) uniformity with standard deviation-to-mean ratios as low as 0.045, each governed by different balances of electrical and thermal transport mechanisms. For the Low Resistance State (LRS), high uniformity (0.009) can be maintained when either electrical or thermal conductivity is low. The resistance ratio between HRS and LRS shows a strong dependence on these conductivities, with higher ratios observed at lower conductivity values. These findings provide essential guidelines for material selection in RRAM devices, particularly for applications demanding high reliability and uniform switching characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of Rydberg Atomic REceiver (RARE) is driving a paradigm shift in electromagnetic (EM) wave measurement. RAREs utilize the electron transition phenomenon of highly-excited atoms to interact with EM waves, thereby enabling wireless signal detection. Operating at the quantum scale, such new receivers have the potential to breakthrough the sensitivity limit of classical receivers, sparking a revolution in physical-layer wireless communications. The objective of this paper is to offer insights into RARE-aided communication systems. We first provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of RAREs. Then, a thorough comparison between RAREs and classical receivers is conducted in terms of the antenna size, sensitivity, coverage, and bandwidth. Subsequently, we overview the state-of-the-art design in RARE-aided wireless communications, exploring the latest progresses in frequency-division multiplexing, multiple-input-multiple-output, wireless sensing, and quantum many-body techniques. Finally, we highlight several wireless-communication related open problems as important research directions.</description>

      <title>Quantum charge sensing using semiconductor device based on $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a novel nanoscale device concept based on a highly doped $\delta$-layer tunnel junction embedded in a semiconductor for charge sensing. Recent advances in Atomic Precision Advanced Manufacturing (APAM) processes have enabled the fabrication of devices based on quasi-2D, highly conductive, highly doped regions in semiconductor materials. In this work, we demonstrate that FET-based sensors utilizing APAM $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions are ultrasensitive to the presence of charges near the tunnel junction, allowing the use of these devices for detecting charges by observing changes in the electrical current. We demonstrate that these devices can enhance the sensitivity in the limit, i.e. for small concentrations of charges, exhibiting significantly superior sensitivity compared to traditional FET-based sensors. We also propose that the extreme sensitivity arises from the strong quantization of the conduction band in these highly-confined systems.</description>

      <title>High-performance thin-film lithium niobate Mach-Zehnder modulator on thick silica buffering layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-speed photonic integrated circuits leveraging the thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform present a promising approach to address the burgeoning global data traffic demands. As a pivotal component, TFLN-based electro-optic (EO) Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs) should exhibit low driving voltage, broad operation bandwidth, high extinction ration, and low insertion loss. However, the pursuit of both maximal EO overlap integral and minimal microwave loss necessitates a fundamental compromise between driving voltage and operational bandwidth. Here, we demonstrate high-performance TFLN EO MZMs constructed on a 12-{\mu}m-thick silica buried layer using periodic capacitively loaded traveling-wave electrodes. In contrast to their counterparts utilizing undercut etched silicon substrates or quartz substrates, our devices exhibit streamlined fabrication processes and enhanced modulation efficiency. Notably, the fabricated MZMs attains a high modulation efficiency of 1.25 Vcm in the telecom C-band, while maintaining a low EO roll-off of 1.3 dB at 67 GHz. Our demonstration offers a pathway to achieving perfect group velocity matching and break the voltage-bandwidth limit in a simplified configuration suitable for volume fabrication, thereby laying foundational groundwork for the advancement of high-performance TFLN MZMs and benefiting the next-generation PICs in optical telecommunication, signal processing and other applications.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnetic materials: Origins and progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of ultrafast demagnetization in Ni thin films in 1996, laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics have become a prominent research topic in the field of magnetism and spintronics. This development offers new possibilities for the advancement of spintronics and magnetic storage technology. The subject has drawn a substantial number of researchers, leading to a series of research endeavors. Various models have been proposed to elucidate the physical processes underlying laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics in ferromagnetic materials. However, the potential origins of these processes across different material systems and the true contributions of these different origins remain challenging in the realm of ultrafast spin dynamics. This predicament also hinders the development of spintronic terahertz emitters. In this review, we initially introduce the different experimental methods used in laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics. We then systematically explore the magnetization precession process and present seven models of ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnetic materials. Subsequently, we discuss the physical processes and research status of four ultrafast demagnetization origins (including spin-flipping, spin transport, non-thermal electronic distribution, and laser-induced lattice strain). Since attosecond laser technique and antiferromagnetic materials exhibit promising applications in ultrahigh-frequency spintronics, we acknowledge the emerging studies used by attosecond pules and studies on ultrafast spin dynamics in antiferromagnets, noting the significant challenges that need to be addressed in these burgeoning field.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional imaging of electromagnetic fields via light sheet fluorescence imaging with Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12568v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to image electromagnetic fields holds key scientific and industrial applications, including electromagnetic compatibility, diagnostics of high-frequency devices, and experimental scientific work involving field interactions. Generally electric and magnetic field measurements require conductive elements which significantly distort the field. However, electromagnetic fields can be measured without altering the field via the shift they induce on Rydberg states of alkali atoms in atomic vapor, which are highly sensitive to electric fields. Previous field measurements using Rydberg atoms utilized electromagnetically induced transparency to read out the shift on the states induced by the fields, but did not provide spatial resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that electromagnetically induced transparency can be spatially resolved by imaging the fluorescence of the atoms. We demonstrate that this can be used to image $\sim$ V/cm scale electric fields in the DC-GHz range and $\sim$ mT scale static magnetic fields, with minimal distortion to the fields. We also demonstrate the ability to image $\sim$ 5 mV/cm scale fields for resonant microwave radiation and measure standing waves generated by the partial reflection of the vapor cell walls in this regime. With additional processing techniques like lock-in detection, we predict that our sensitivities could reach down to nV/cm levels. We perform this field imaging with a spatial resolution of 160 $\mu$m, limited by our imaging system, and estimate the fundamental resolution limitation to be 5 $\mu$m.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phased arrays are crucial in various technologies, such as radar and wireless communications, due to their ability to precisely control and steer electromagnetic waves. This precise control improves signal processing and enhances imaging performance. However, extending phased arrays to the terahertz (THz) frequency range has proven challenging, especially for high-frequency operation, broadband performance, two-dimensional (2D) phase control with large antenna arrays, and strong phase modulation. Here, we introduce a photonic platform to realize a THz phased array that bypasses the above challenges. Our method employs 2D phase coding with 2-bit across a broad THz frequency range from 0.8 to 1.4 THz. The core of our design is a pixelated nonlinear Pancharatnam-Berry metasurface driven by a spatially modulated femtosecond laser, allowing precise phase control of THz signals. We showcase the effectiveness of our method through four proof-of-concept applications: single beamforming, dual beamforming, imaging and vortex beam generation. The realized photonic platform provides a promising pathway for developing broadband phased arrays in the THz regime.</description>

Abstract: Neutron time correlation measurements are used to characterize fissile systems. For this purpose, detailed information are obtained using list mode measurements where the neutron detection times are recorded in a file called the time list file. In this article, we present the simulation and analysis of list mode measurements performed on SILENE reactor. Analogue Monte Carlo simulations are performed using MCNPX code and the synthetic time list file is obtained by processing the MCNPX-PTRAC coincidence capture file. Both measured and computed time list files are processed using the same postprocessor that we have developed. This software is used to calculate counting statistics data like counting number probability distribution, Rossi alpha and Feynman functions for time gates of increasing duration. The parameter uncertainties are evaluated using a block bootstrap method.</description>

      <title>Huygens metasurface supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum for terahertz gas sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a terahertz (THz) gas sensing platform based on all-dielectric metasurfaces that support quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC) with both electric and magnetic dipole resonances. The structure is designed to achieve the first Kerker condition, minimizing backscattering and maximizing light-matter interaction, which significantly enhances the sensitivity of the sensor. By optimizing structural parameters, this metasurface selectively resonates at characteristic absorption frequencies of target gases, facilitating detection even at low concentrations. We validate the approach using two gases with strong but distinct THz absorption profiles: hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Furthermore, the free-standing design maximizes gas interaction on both sides of the metasurface, eliminating substrate-induced losses and enabling a reduced physical footprint. Our findings indicate that this metasurface outperforms standard THz sensing approaches in terms of compactness and sensitivity per path length unit, obtaining the same detection threshold as sensing in free space with a path length between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude shorter, underscoring its potential for industrial applications where the available space for sensing can be limited.</description>

      <title>A compact scalable phase modulator with zero static power consumption for visible integrated photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical modulators in the visible regime have far-reaching applications from biophotonics to quantum science. Implementations of such optical phase modulators on a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible platform have been mainly limited to utilization of the thermo-optic effect, liquid crystal technology, as well as piezo-optomechanical effects. Despite excellent performance, the demonstrations using the thermo-optic effect and liquid crystal technology both suffer from limited modulation speed. Moreover, the demonstrations utilizing piezo-optomechanical effects, require very large footprints due to a weak modulation efficiency. Here, we report the demonstration of the first highly scalable compact CMOS-compatible phase modulator in the visible regime based on altering the refractive index of an indium-tin oxide capacitive stack over a Si${_3}$N${_4}$ waveguide through the charge accumulation effect. The implemented modulator achieves a two orders-of-magnitude larger bandwidth compared to thermo-optic and liquid crystal based counterparts and close to 3 orders-of-magnitude higher modulation efficiency with about two orders-of-magnitude smaller footprint compared to piezo-optomechanical modulators. The 50 ${\mu}$m long phase modulator achieves a modulation efficiency, V$_{\pi}$L, of 0.06 V.cm at a zero static power consumption and a 31 MHz bandwidth at 637.9 nm.</description>

      <title>Phase Segregation Dynamics in Mixed-Halide Perovskites Revealed by Plunge-Freeze Cryogenic Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-halide lead perovskites, with photoexcited charge-carrier properties suitable for high-efficiency photovoltaics, hold significant promise for high-efficiency tandem solar cells. However, phase segregation under illumination, where an iodide-rich phase forms carrier trap states, remains a barrier to applications. This study employs plunge-freeze cryogenic electron microscopy to visualize nanoscale phase segregation dynamics in CsPb(Br,I) films. By rapidly freezing the illuminated samples, we preserve transient photoexcited ion distributions for high-resolution structural and compositional analysis at the nanoscale. Cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques (EELS, 4D-STEM) captured the dynamics of photo-induced iodine migration from grain boundaries to centers, identified the buildup of anisotropic strain, and captured the heterogeneous evolution of this process within a single grain. These findings provide new insights into microscopic phase segregation mechanisms and their dynamics, enhancing our understanding of mixed-halide perovskite photostability.</description>

      <title>Effects of Magnetic Focusing on Power and Stability of VE Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theory and modeling of new discovered effects of the oscillating e-beam boundary formed in a magnetic focusing channel on the stability, gain, and power of VE amplifiers are presented. The RF structure and e-beam circuit parameters are computed for different beam envelope radii and oscillation amplitudes and then the self-excitation thresholds are obtained from the Determinant equations. A new solution of the beam envelope equation not limited by the small-amplitude oscillations is derived and used to determine the magnetic focusing conditions providing various beam envelope radii and oscillation amplitudes. It is shown for the example Ka-band serpentine structure that the optimum radius as well as axial position of the oscillating beam envelope allow achieving significantly greater gain and power of RF amplifiers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation damage tests in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) flexible flux and dose-measuring devices have been performed with a 3 MeV proton beam, to evaluate combined displacement and total ionizing dose damage. The tested devices had two different configurations and thicknesses. The first device was a 2 um thick n-i-p diode having a 5 mm x 5 mm area. The second device was a 5 um thick charge selective contact detector having the same area. Both the devices were deposited on a flexible polyimide substrate and were irradiated up to the fluence of 1016 neq/cm2. The response to different proton fluxes has been measured before irradiation and after irradiation at 1016 neq/cm2 for charge-selective contacts and n-i-p devices. The effect of annealing for partial performance recovery at 100{\deg}C for 12 hours was also studied and a final characterization on annealed devices was performed. This test is the first combined displacement and total ionizing dose test on flexible a-Si:H devices.</description>

Abstract: We present experimental wear data for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sliding on tile, sandpaper, and polished steel surfaces, as well as for silica glass and quartz sliding on sandpaper. The experimental results are compared with a recently developed theory of sliding wear\cite{ToBe}. Our findings demonstrate that wear on surfaces with roughness below a critical threshold cannot result from crack propagation induced by frictional shear stress in block-substrate asperity contact regions and must, therefore, originate from a different mechanism.</description>

      <title>Detection of low-energy fluxons from engineered long Josephson junctions for efficient computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-Flux Quantum (SFQ) digital logic is typically energy efficient and fast, and logic that uses ballistic and reversible principles provides a new platform to improve efficiency. We are studying long Josephson junctions (long JJs), SFQs within them, and an SFQ detector, all intended for future ballistic logic gate experiments. Specifically, we launch low-energy SFQ into engineered long JJs made from an array of 80 JJs and connecting inductors. The component JJs have critical currents of only 7.5 uA such that the Josephson penetration depth is approximately 2.4 unit cells, and the SFQ's stationary energy in the LJJ is ~47 zJ. The circuit measured consisted of three components: an SFQ launcher, the LJJ, and an SFQ detector that uses JJ critical currents of only 15-20 uA. The circuit was measured in two environments: at 4.2 K in a helium dunk probe and 3.5~K in a cryogen-free refrigerator. According to calculations, the SFQ may traverse the LJJ ballistically, i.e., with a small change in velocity. Data show that SFQ detection events are synchronous with SFQ launch events in both setups. The jitter extracted from the launch and arrival times is predominantly attributed to the noise in the detector. This study shows that we can create and detect low-energy SFQs made from engineered LJJs, and the importance of jitter studies for future ballistic gate measurements.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Embedded Element Patterns of Reactively Loaded Antenna Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for synthesizing reactively loaded antennas and antenna arrays. The framework comprises two main components: computing the fundamental bound using the semi-definite relaxation and finding a realizable solution via optimization on a Riemannian manifold. The embedded element patterns are subject to the optimization with two distinct goals under study: focusing the radiation in a single direction or synthesizing patterns with desired shapes. The reactive terminations of passive antenna elements serve as optimization variables. We demonstrate the framework using a connected bowtie-slot antenna and antenna array with both beam-focusing and beam-shaping targets. The tests show that the optimization on the Riemannian manifold yields superior results compared to existing methods, such as the genetic algorithm. This is particularly evident in the most complex and extensive problem, which requires the synthesis of shaped embedded element patterns for a sparse reactively loaded antenna array with a limited field of view.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Capacitance in Surfactant Mediated Ion Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ion complexes hold the key for various energy transfer and communication systems in nature and industries. Achieving controllable mechanical and electrical properties in these complex systems is highly desirable but remains challenging. In this work, we propose the use of amphiphilic molecules to mediate salt crystallization. The resultant ionic interfaces can be tunable through reduced surface tensions of crystal facets, an additional intermolecular modifier, and the diffusion-limited crystallization during controlled solvent evaporation. Specifically, we utilized the ionic surfactant Sodium Lauryl sulfoacetate (SLSA) to mediate the crystallization of sodium chloride. Citric acid (CA) was adopted as a hydrogen-bond modifier. Systems mediated by SLSA exhibited the highest capacitance, and a significant enhancement of capacitance was also observed in systems with both SLSA and CA. The substantially increased capacitance of these ionic complexes can be attributed to changes in interfacial and crystalline grain structures. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), optical microscopy (OM), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) were used to study the effects of surfactant molecules in these ionic complexes. Understanding the role of ionic complexation in defining the thermodynamic and kinetic process of the crystallization process will contribute to better optimization in nucleation and scalability of organic and inorganic crystal production.</description>

      <title>Microwave-optics entanglement via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave-optics entanglement plays a crucial role in building hybrid quantum networks with quantum nodes working in the microwave and optical frequency bands. However, there are limited efficient ways to produce such entanglement due to the large frequency mismatch between the two regimes. Here, we present a new mechanism to prepare microwave-optics entanglement based on a hybrid system of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, i.e., a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere holds a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, while the silica sphere supports an optical whispering-gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via an optomechanical interaction. The two mechanical modes are close in frequency and directly coupled via physical contact of the two microspheres. We show that by simultaneously activating the magnomechanical (optomechanical) Stokes (anti-Stokes) scattering, stationary entanglement can be established between the magnon and optical modes via mechanics-mechanics coupling. This leads to stationary microwave-optics entanglement by further coupling the YIG sphere to a microwave cavity and utilizing the magnon-microwave state swapping. Our protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising new approach for preparing microwave-optics entanglement, which finds unique applications in hybrid quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Surface chemistry-based continuous separation of polystyrene particles in a microchannel via diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The separation of colloidal particles is of great importance in many fields, such as purification, sensing, and bioanalysis. However, separating particles based on their surface physical or chemical properties remains challenging. This study demonstrates through experimental and theoretical analyses that diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis enable the continuous separation of carboxylate polystyrene particles with similar sizes and zeta potentials but distinct surface concentrations of carboxyl groups. In the proposed approach, the particles are exposed to salt concentration gradients generated in a double-junction microfluidic device, fed with low and high electrolyte concentration streams. As the particles move across environments with varying salinity levels, their dynamics are influenced by the sensitivity of their zeta potential to the local salt concentration, which in turn is affected by surface conductance effects induced by the surface carboxyl groups. By harnessing these effects, colloids with comparable zeta potentials but different surface concentrations of carboxyl groups are separated with 100% efficiency when they exhibit opposite zeta potential sensitivities to salt. This simple approach, which relies on an easy-to-operate device with no external energy source, has discipline-spanning potential for the continuous separation of colloids distinguished solely by surface properties that influence their zeta potential sensitivities, like roughness, permeability, heterogeneity, and chemical composition.</description>

Abstract: Colour printing based on metallic or dielectric nanostructures has revolutionized colour science due to its unprecedented subwavelength resolution. Evidently, the evolution towards the active control of such structural colours with smart materials is in progress for real applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate a large colour gamut with high intensity and purity, as well as its switching on and off based solely on tungsten trioxide (WO3) cylindrical resonators. The strong resonances in the visible spectral range in these WO3 metasurfaces can be reversibly switched on and off due to its electrochromism by applying alternating voltages of +2.0 V and -0.3 V. Our approach opens up possibilities for the functional diversification of commercial smart windows, as well as the development of new display technologies in the future.</description>
