      <title>Device-Algorithm Co-Design of Ferroelectric Compute-in-Memory In-Situ Annealer for Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are crucial in many applications but are computationally demanding. Traditional Ising annealers address COPs by directly converting them into Ising models (known as direct-E transformation) and solving them through iterative annealing. However, these approaches require vector-matrix-vector (VMV) multiplications with a complexity of $O(n^2)$ for Ising energy computation and complex exponential annealing factor calculations during annealing process, thus significantly increasing hardware costs. In this work, we propose a ferroelectric compute-in-memory (CiM) in-situ annealer to overcome aforementioned challenges. The proposed device-algorithm co-design framework consists of (i) a novel transformation method (first to our known) that converts COPs into an innovative incremental-E form, which reduces the complexity of VMV multiplication from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, and approximates exponential annealing factor with a much simplified fractional form; (ii) a double gate ferroelectric FET (DG FeFET)-based CiM crossbar that efficiently computes the in-situ incremental-E form by leveraging the unique structure of DG FeFETs; (iii) %When feasible solutions are detected, a CiM annealer that approaches the solutions of COPs via iterative incremental-E computations within a tunable back gate-based in-situ annealing flow. Evaluation results show that our proposed CiM annealer significantly reduces hardware overhead, reducing energy consumption by 1503/1716$\times$ and time cost by 8.08/8.15$\times$ in solving 3000-node Max-Cut problems compared to two state-of-the-art annealers. It also exhibits high solving efficiency, achieving a remarkable average success rate of 98\%, whereas other annealers show only 50\% given the same iteration counts.</description>

      <title>Using quantum annealing to generate test cases for cyber-physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a powerful tool to efficiently solve computational challenges, particularly in simulation and optimisation. However, hardware limitations prevent quantum computers from achieving the full theoretical potential. Among the quantum algorithms, quantum annealing is a prime candidate to solve optimisation problems. This makes it a natural candidate for search-based software testing in the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) domain, which demands effective test cases due to their safety-critical nature. This work explores the use of quantum annealing to enhance test case generation for CPS through a mutation-based approach. We encode test case mutation as a binary optimisation problem, and use quantum annealing to identify and target critical regions of the test cases for improvement. Our approach mechanises this process into an algorithm that uses D-Wave's quantum annealer to find the solution. As a main contribution, we offer insights into how quantum annealing can advance software testing methodologies by empirically evaluating the correlation between problem size, hardware limitations, and the effectiveness of the results. Moreover, we compare the proposed method against state-of-the-art classical optimisation algorithms, targeting efficiency (time to generate test cases) and effectiveness (fault detection rates). Results indicate that quantum annealing enables faster test case generation while achieving comparable fault detection performance to state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

      <title>STAMP-2.5D: Structural and Thermal Aware Methodology for Placement in 2.5D Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiplet-based architectures and advanced packaging has emerged as transformative approaches in semiconductor design. While conventional physical design for 2.5D heterogeneous systems typically prioritizes wirelength reduction through tight chiplet packing, this strategy creates thermal bottlenecks and intensifies coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatches, compromising long-term reliability. Addressing these challenges requires holistic consideration of thermal performance, mechanical stress, and interconnect efficiency. We introduce STAMP-2.5D, the first automated floorplanning methodology that simultaneously optimizes these critical factors. Our approach employs finite element analysis to simulate temperature distributions and stress profiles across chiplet configurations while minimizing interconnect wirelength. Experimental results demonstrate that our thermal structural aware automated floorplanning approach reduces overall stress by 11% while maintaining excellent thermal performance with a negligible 0.5% temperature increase and simultaneously reducing total wirelength by 11% compared to temperature-only optimization. Additionally, we conduct an exploratory study on the effects of temperature gradients on structural integrity, providing crucial insights for reliability-conscious chiplet design. STAMP-2.5D establishes a robust platform for navigating critical trade-offs in advanced semiconductor packaging.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Personalized Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Progression: A Survey of Methods, Data Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is marked by significant inter-individual variability in its progression, complicating accurate prognosis and personalized care planning. This heterogeneity underscores the critical need for predictive models capable of forecasting patient-specific disease trajectories. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers powerful tools to address this challenge by analyzing complex, multi-modal, and longitudinal patient data. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AI methodologies applied to personalized AD progression prediction. We review key approaches including state-space models for capturing temporal dynamics, deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks for sequence modeling, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for leveraging network structures, and the emerging concept of AI-driven digital twins for individualized simulation. Recognizing that data limitations often impede progress, we examine common challenges such as high dimensionality, missing data, and dataset imbalance. We further discuss AI-driven mitigation strategies, with a specific focus on synthetic data generation using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment and balance datasets. The survey synthesizes the strengths and limitations of current approaches, emphasizing the trend towards multimodal integration and the persistent need for model interpretability and generalizability. Finally, we identify critical open challenges, including robust external validation, clinical integration, and ethical considerations, and outline promising future research directions such as hybrid models, causal inference, and federated learning. This review aims to consolidate current knowledge and guide future efforts in developing clinically relevant AI tools for personalized AD prognostication.</description>

      <title>Participatory AI, Public Sector AI, Differential Privacy, Conversational Interfaces, Explainable AI, Citizen Engagement in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a conversational interface system that enables participatory design of differentially private AI systems in public sector applications. Addressing the challenge of balancing mathematical privacy guarantees with democratic accountability, we propose three key contributions: (1) an adaptive $\epsilon$-selection protocol leveraging TOPSIS multi-criteria decision analysis to align citizen preferences with differential privacy (DP) parameters, (2) an explainable noise-injection framework featuring real-time Mean Absolute Error (MAE) visualizations and GPT-4-powered impact analysis, and (3) an integrated legal-compliance mechanism that dynamically modulates privacy budgets based on evolving regulatory constraints. Our results advance participatory AI practices by demonstrating how conversational interfaces can enhance public engagement in algorithmic privacy mechanisms, ensuring that privacy-preserving AI in public sector governance remains both mathematically robust and democratically accountable.</description>
