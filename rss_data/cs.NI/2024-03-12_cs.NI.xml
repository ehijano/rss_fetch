      <title>Internet Sanctions on Russian Media: Actions and Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the European Union (EU), through the notion of "digital sovereignty", imposed sanctions on organizations and individuals affiliated with the Russian Federation that prohibit broadcasting content, including online distribution. In this paper, we interrogate the implementation of these sanctions and interpret them as a means to translate the union of states' governmental edicts into effective technical countermeasures. Through longitudinal traffic analysis, we construct an understanding of how ISPs in different EU countries attempted to enforce these sanctions, and compare these implementations to similar measures in other western countries. We find a wide variation of blocking coverage, both internationally and within individual member states. We draw the conclusion that digital sovereignty through sanctions in the EU has a concrete but distinctly limited impact on information flows.</description>

      <title>Enabling 5G QoS configuration capabilities for IoT applications on container orchestration platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Container orchestration platform is the foundation of modern cloud infrastructure. In recent years, container orchestration platform has been evolving to cross the boundary of device, edge, and cloud. More and more IoT applications such as robotics and XR have been deployed across the device-cloud continuum through the container orchestration platform, e.g., the Kubernetes (K8s) framework. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of advanced communication technologies like 5G has endorsed the revolution in IoT applications as more network resource is available for critical IoT use cases. This paper aims to integrate network configuration capabilities provided by a 5G Network Exposure Function (NEF) into the K8s framework which is used to simplify application deployment in an orchestration in the device-cloud continuum. Specifically, a Linux fwmark-based network Quality of Service (QoS) configuration method is proposed to expose the QoS information from an overlay network that is used by the container orchestration platform to the underlay network. A Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin-based implementation is demonstrated to perform QoS configuration for the 5G network. The proposed solution is validated with an existing localization and mapping application to verify the feasibility. The proposed solution has the following benefits: (1) The solution is a Kubernetes-native approach which adopts the CNI plugin mechanism. (2) The solution can expose the QoS information from an overlay network to an underlay network in a non-intrusive manner. (3) No packet manipulation is required to greatly reduce the overhead for packet processing. (4) It extends the K8s bandwidth limit feature from on-node to the access network. (5) It is compatible with the 5G infrastructure without any alteration or adding extra complexity.</description>

      <title>Cached Model-as-a-Resource: Provisioning Large Language Model Agents for Edge Intelligence in Space-air-ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) enable worldwide network coverage beyond geographical limitations for users to access ubiquitous intelligence services. {\color{black}Facing global coverage and complex environments in SAGINs, edge intelligence can provision AI agents based on large language models (LLMs) for users via edge servers at ground base stations (BSs) or cloud data centers relayed by satellites.} As LLMs with billions of parameters are pre-trained on vast datasets, LLM agents have few-shot learning capabilities, e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for complex tasks, which are challenged by limited resources in SAGINs. In this paper, we propose a joint caching and inference framework for edge intelligence to provision sustainable and ubiquitous LLM agents in SAGINs. We introduce "cached model-as-a-resource" for offering LLMs with limited context windows and propose a novel optimization framework, i.e., joint model caching and inference, to utilize cached model resources for provisioning LLM agent services along with communication, computing, and storage resources. We design "age of thought" (AoT) considering the CoT prompting of LLMs, and propose the least AoT cached model replacement algorithm for optimizing the provisioning cost. We propose a deep Q-network-based modified second-bid (DQMSB) auction to incentivize these network operators, which can enhance allocation efficiency while guaranteeing strategy-proofness and free from adverse selection.</description>

      <title>Evaluation and improvement of ETSI ITS Contention-Based Forwarding (CBF) of warning messages in highway scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of the ETSI Contention-Based Forwarding (CBF) GeoNetworking protocol for distributing warning messages in highway scenarios, including its interaction with the Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) mechanism. Several shortcomings of the standard ETSI CBF algorithm are identified, and we propose different solutions to these problems, which are able to reduce the number of transmissions by an order of magnitude, while reducing the message end-to-end delay and providing a reliability close to 100% in a large area of interest.</description>

      <title>ACM MMSys 2024 Bandwidth Estimation in Real Time Communications Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of experience (QoE) delivered by video conferencing systems to end users depends in part on correctly estimating the capacity of the bottleneck link between the sender and the receiver over time. Bandwidth estimation for real-time communications (RTC) remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the continuously evolving heterogeneous network architectures and technologies. From the first bandwidth estimation challenge which was hosted at ACM MMSys 2021, we learnt that bandwidth estimation models trained with reinforcement learning (RL) in simulations to maximize network-based reward functions may not be optimal in reality due to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of aligning network-based rewards with user-perceived QoE. This grand challenge aims to advance bandwidth estimation model design by aligning reward maximization with user-perceived QoE optimization using offline RL and a real-world dataset with objective rewards which have high correlations with subjective user-perceived audio/video quality in Microsoft Teams. All models submitted to the grand challenge underwent initial evaluation on our emulation platform. For a comprehensive evaluation under diverse network conditions with temporal fluctuations, top models were further evaluated on our geographically distributed testbed by using each model to conduct 600 calls within a 12-day period. The winning model is shown to deliver comparable performance to the top behavior policy in the released dataset. By leveraging real-world data and integrating objective audio/video quality scores as rewards, offline RL can therefore facilitate the development of competitive bandwidth estimators for RTC.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-and-Channel Coding for Small Satellite Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small satellites are widely used today as cost effective means to perform Earth observation and other tasks that generate large amounts of high-dimensional data, such as multi-spectral imagery. These satellites typically operate in low earth orbit, which poses significant challenges for data transmission due to short contact times with ground stations, low bandwidth, and high packet loss probabilities. In this paper, we introduce JSCC-Sat, which applies joint source-and-channel coding using neural networks to provide efficient and robust transmission of compressed image data for satellite applications. We evaluate our mechanism against traditional transmission schemes with separate source and channel coding and demonstrate that it outperforms the existing approaches when applied to Earth observation data of the Sentinel-2 mission.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the Venice Lagoon: an IoT Cloud-Based Sensor Nerwork Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring the coastal area of the Venice Lagoon is of significant importance. While the impact of global warming is felt worldwide, coastal and littoral regions bear the brunt more prominently. These areas not only face the threat of rising sea levels but also contend with the escalating occurrence of seaquakes and floods. Additionally, the intricate ecosystems of rivers, seas, and lakes undergo profound transformations due to climate change and pollutants.
  Employing devices like the SENSWICH floating wireless sensor presented in this article and similar measurement instruments proves invaluable to automate environmental monitoring, hence eliminating the need for manual sampling campaigns. The utilization of wireless measurement devices offers cost-effectiveness, real-time analysis, and a reduction in human resource requirements. Storing data in cloud services further enhances the ability to monitor parameter changes over extended time intervals.
  In this article, we present an enhanced sensing device aimed at automating water quality assessment, while considering power consumption and reducing circuit complexity. Specifically, we will introduce the new schematic and circuit of SENSWICH which had changes in circuit and electronic aspects. Furthermore, we outline the methodology for aggregating data in a cloud service environment, such as Amazon Web Service (AWS), and using Grafana for visualization.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Federated Learning Over the Air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a federated version of adaptive gradient methods, particularly AdaGrad and Adam, within the framework of over-the-air model training. This approach capitalizes on the inherent superposition property of wireless channels, facilitating fast and scalable parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, it enhances the robustness of the model training process by dynamically adjusting the stepsize in accordance with the global gradient update. We derive the convergence rate of the training algorithms, encompassing the effects of channel fading and interference, for a broad spectrum of nonconvex loss functions. Our analysis shows that the AdaGrad-based algorithm converges to a stationary point at the rate of $\mathcal{O}( \ln{(T)} /{ T^{ 1 - \frac{1}{\alpha} } } )$, where $\alpha$ represents the tail index of the electromagnetic interference. This result indicates that the level of heavy-tailedness in interference distribution plays a crucial role in the training efficiency: the heavier the tail, the slower the algorithm converges. In contrast, an Adam-like algorithm converges at the $\mathcal{O}( 1/T )$ rate, demonstrating its advantage in expediting the model training process. We conduct extensive experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings and affirm the practical efficacy of our proposed federated adaptive gradient methods.</description>

      <title>Jasper: Scalable and Fair Multicast for Financial Exchanges in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial exchanges have recently shown an interest in migrating to the public cloud for scalability, elasticity, and cost savings. However, financial exchanges often have strict network requirements that can be difficult to meet on the cloud. Notably, market participants (MPs) trade based on market data about different activities in the market. Exchanges often use switch multicast to disseminate market data to MPs. However, if one MP receives market data earlier than another, that MP would have an unfair advantage. To prevent this, financial exchanges often equalize exchange-to-MP cable lengths to provide near-simultaneous reception of market data at MPs.
  As a cloud tenant, however, building a fair multicast service is challenging because of the lack of switch support for multicast, high latency variance, and the lack of native mechanisms for simultaneous data delivery in the cloud. Jasper introduces a solution that creates an overlay multicast tree within a cloud region that minimizes latency and latency variations through hedging, leverages recent advancements in clock synchronization to achieve simultaneous delivery, and addresses various sources of latency through an optimized DPDK/eBPF implementation -- while scaling to 1000+ emulated receivers. Jasper outperforms a prior system CloudEx and a commercial multicast solution provided by Amazon Web Services.</description>

      <title>X-ResQ: Reverse Annealing for Quantum MIMO Detection with Flexible Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA)-accelerated MIMO detection is an emerging research approach in the context of NextG wireless networks. The opportunity is to enable large MIMO systems and thus improve wireless performance. The approach aims to leverage QA to expedite the computation required for theoretically optimal but computationally-demanding Maximum Likelihood detection to overcome the limitations of the currently deployed linear detectors. This paper presents X-ResQ, a QA-based MIMO detector system featuring fine-grained quantum task parallelism that is uniquely enabled by the Reverse Annealing (RA) protocol. Unlike prior designs, X-ResQ has many desirable system properties for a parallel QA detector and has effectively improved detection performance as more qubits are assigned. In our evaluations on a state-of-the-art quantum annealer, fully parallel X-ResQ achieves near-optimal throughput (over 10 bits/s/Hz) for $4\times6$ MIMO with 16-QAM using six levels of parallelism with 240 qubits and $220~\mu$s QA compute time, achieving 2.5--5$\times$ gains compared against other tested detectors. For more comprehensive evaluations, we implement and evaluate X-ResQ in the non-quantum digital setting. This non-quantum X-ResQ demonstration showcases the potential to realize ultra-large $1024\times1024$ MIMO, significantly outperforming other MIMO detectors, including the state-of-the-art RA detector classically implemented in the same way.</description>

      <title>Joint User Association and Resource Allocation for Tailored QoS Provisioning in 6G HetNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of wireless-enabled applications with divergent quality of service (QoS) requirements necessitates tailored QoS provisioning. With the growing complexity of wireless infrastructures, application-specific QoS perceived by a user equipment (UE) is jointly determined by its association with the supporting base station in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) and the amount of resource allocated to it. However, conventional application-agnostic objective-based user association and resource allocation often ignore the differences among applications' specific requirements for resources, inevitably preventing tailored QoS provisioning. Hence, in this paper, the problem of joint user association and resource allocation with application-specific objectives is investigated for achieving tailored QoS provisioning in 6G HetNets. This problem is intrinsically difficult to solve directly due to the extremely large solution space and the combination of discrete and continuous variables. Therefore, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems, i.e. user association and resource allocation, and propose an interactive optimization algorithm (IOA) to solve them iteratively in an interactive way until convergence is achieved. Specifically, matching theory is utilized to solve resource allocation and user association is solved heuristically. Extensive experimental results confirm that IOA algorithm outperforms several baseline algorithms in terms of both average utility and UE satisfaction ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human-centered wireless sensing (HCWS) aims to understand the fine-grained environment and activities of a human using the diverse wireless signals around him/her. While the sensed information about a human can be used for many good purposes such as enhancing life quality, an adversary can also abuse it to steal private information about the human (e.g., location and person's identity). However, the literature lacks a systematic understanding of the privacy vulnerabilities of wireless sensing and the defenses against them, resulting in the privacy-compromising HCWS design.
  In this work, we aim to bridge this gap to achieve the vision of secure human-centered wireless sensing. First, we propose a signal processing pipeline to identify private information leakage and further understand the benefits and tradeoffs of wireless sensing-based inference attacks and defenses. Based on this framework, we present the taxonomy of existing inference attacks and defenses. As a result, we can identify the open challenges and gaps in achieving privacy-preserving human-centered wireless sensing in the era of machine learning and further propose directions for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Topology Learning for Heterogeneous Decentralized Federated Learning over Unreliable D2D Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of intelligent mobile devices in wireless device-to-device (D2D) networks, decentralized federated learning (DFL) has attracted significant interest. Compared to centralized federated learning (CFL), DFL mitigates the risk of central server failures due to communication bottlenecks. However, DFL faces several challenges, such as the severe heterogeneity of data distributions in diverse environments, and the transmission outages and package errors caused by the adoption of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in D2D networks. These challenges often degrade the convergence of training DFL models. To address these challenges, we conduct a thorough theoretical convergence analysis for DFL and derive a convergence bound. By defining a novel quantity named unreliable links-aware neighborhood discrepancy in this convergence bound, we formulate a tractable optimization objective, and develop a novel Topology Learning method considering the Representation Discrepancy and Unreliable Links in DFL, named ToLRDUL. Intensive experiments under both feature skew and label skew settings have validated the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating improved convergence speed and test accuracy, consistent with our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>DT-DDNN: A Physical Layer Security Attack Detector in 5G RF Domain for CAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) is a fundamental component of the 5G New Radio (NR) air interface, crucial for the initial access procedure of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), and serves several key purposes in the network's operation. However, due to the predictable nature of SSB transmission, including the Primary and Secondary Synchronization Signals (PSS and SSS), jamming attacks are critical threats. These attacks, which can be executed without requiring high power or complex equipment, pose substantial risks to the 5G network, particularly as a result of the unencrypted transmission of control signals. Leveraging RF domain knowledge, this work presents a novel deep learning-based technique for detecting jammers in CAV networks. Unlike the existing jamming detection algorithms that mostly rely on network parameters, we introduce a double-threshold deep learning jamming detector by focusing on the SSB. The detection method is focused on RF domain features and improves the robustness of the network without requiring integration with the pre-existing network infrastructure. By integrating a preprocessing block to extract PSS correlation and energy per null resource elements (EPNRE) characteristics, our method distinguishes between normal and jammed received signals with high precision. Additionally, by incorporating of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), the efficacy of training and detection are optimized. A double-threshold double Deep Neural Network (DT-DDNN) is also introduced to the architecture complemented by a deep cascade learning model to increase the sensitivity of the model to variations of signal-to-jamming noise ratio (SJNR). Results show that the proposed method achieves 96.4% detection rate in extra low jamming power, i.e., SJNR between 15 to 30 dB. Further, performance of DT-DDNN is validated by analyzing real 5G signals obtained from a practical testbed.</description>
