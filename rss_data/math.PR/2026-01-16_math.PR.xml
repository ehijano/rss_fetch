      <title>Asymptotic Stability and Equilibrium Selection in Quasi-Feller Systems with Minimal Moment Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equilibrium selection for invariant measures of stochastic dynamical systems with constant step size, under persistent noise and minimal moment assumptions, in a general quasi-Feller framework. Such dynamics arise in projection-based algorithms, learning in games, and systems with discontinuous decision rules, where classical Feller assumptions and small-noise or large-deviation techniques are not applicable.
  Under a global Lyapunov condition, we prove that any weak limit of invariant measures must be supported on the set of fixed points of the associated deterministic dynamics. Beyond localization, we establish a sharp exclusion principle for unstable equilibria: strict local maxima and saddle points of the Lyapunov function are shown to carry zero mass in limiting invariant measures under explicit and verifiable non-degeneracy conditions.
  Our analysis identifies a local mechanism driven by Lyapunov geometry and persistent variance, showing that equilibrium selection in constant-step dynamics is governed by typical fluctuations rather than rare events. These results provide a probabilistic foundation for stability and equilibrium selection in stochastic systems with persistent noise and weak regularity.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Supercritical Bounds for Disconnection in Bernoulli Site Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any infinite, connected, locally finite graph $G=(V,E)$, any parameter $p&gt;p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c}(G)$, and any (finite or infinite) set of vertices $S\subset V$, we derive explicit exponential-type upper bounds on the disconnection probability $\mathbb{P}_{p}(S\nleftrightarrow\infty)$. The estimates are expressed in terms of a packing profile of $S$, encoded by a $(p,\varepsilon,c)$--packing number, which counts how many well-separated vertices in $S$ exhibit controlled local-to-global connectivity. The proof combines a local functional characterization of $p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c}$ from \cite{ZL24,ZL26} with a packing construction and an amplification-by-independence argument, in the direction of Problem~1.6 in \cite{DC20}.</description>

      <title>Planar Site Percolation, End Structure, and the Benjamini-Schramm Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, connected, locally finite planar graph and consider i.i.d.\ Bernoulli$(p)$ site percolation. Write $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ and $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ for the critical and uniqueness thresholds. Using a well--separated Freudenthal embedding $G\hookrightarrow\mathbb S^2$, we introduce a cycle--separation equivalence on ends and associated ``directional'' thresholds $p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c,F}(G)$.
  When the set of end--equivalence classes is countable, we show that $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)=\inf_F p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c,F}(G)$ and that for every $p\in\bigl(\tfrac12,\,1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr)$ there are almost surely infinitely many infinite open clusters. Combined with the $0/\infty$ theorem of Glazman--Harel--Zelesko for $p\le \tfrac12$, this yields non--uniqueness throughout the full coexistence interval $\bigl(p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G),\,1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr)$, and hence $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\ge 1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ in this setting. This resolves the extension problem posed by Glazman--Harel--Zelesko for the upper half of the coexistence regime under a natural countability hypothesis.
  In contrast, for graphs with uncountably many end--equivalence classes we give criteria guaranteeing infinitely many infinite clusters above criticality, and we construct an explicit locally finite planar graph of minimum degree at least $7$ for which $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)&lt;1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$. Consequently, the Benjamini--Schramm conjecture (Conjecture 7 in \cite{bs96}) that planarity together with minimal vertex degree at least 7 forces infinitely many infinite clusters for all $p\in(p_c,1-p_c)$ does not hold in full generality.
  Our proofs combine a cutset characterization of $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}$ with a planar alternating--arm exploration organized by an end--adapted boundary decomposition.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus for Rough Fractional Brownian Motion via Operator Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic framework for stochastic calculus with respect to rough fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H &lt; 1/2. Building on a covariant derivative defined via kernel factorization, we construct a closed unbounded operator on L2(Omega) adapted to the non-semimartingale setting. This approach yields explicit derivative representations for square-integrable functionals and provides a unified analytical framework compatible with rough path techniques. The results extend classical stochastic calculus beyond the semimartingale regime.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus as Operator Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified operator-theoretic formulation of stochastic calculus based on two principles: fluctuations factor through differentiation, predictable projection, and integration, and the appropriate stochastic derivative is the Hilbert adjoint of the stochastic integral on the energy space of the driving process. On an isonormal Gaussian space we recover the identity (Id - E)F = delta Pi D F, where D is the Malliavin derivative, Pi is predictable projection, and delta is the divergence operator. Motivated by this factorization, we define for a square-integrable process X admitting a closed stochastic integral an operator-covariant derivative on L2(Omega) via Riesz representation. This yields a canonical Clark-Ocone representation that unifies Malliavin, Volterra-Malliavin, and functional Ito derivatives and clarifies the operator geometry underlying stochastic calculus.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the convex integration technique applied to singular stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singular stochastic partial differential equations informally refer to the partial differential equations with rough random force that leads to the products in the nonlinear terms becoming ill-defined. Besides the theories of regularity structures and paracontrolled distributions, the technique of convex integration has emerged as a possible approach to construct a solution to such singular stochastic partial differential equations. We review recent developments in this area, and also demonstrate that an application of the convex integration technique to prove non-uniqueness seems unlikely for a particular singular stochastic partial differential equation, specifically the $\Phi^{4}$ model from quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sharp rates for propagation of chaos in R\'enyi divergences for interacting diffusion systems at stationarity. Building upon the entropic hierarchy established in Lacker (2023), we show that under strong isoperimetry and weak interaction conditions, one can achieve $\mathsf R_q(\mu^1 \,\lVert\, \pi) = \widetilde O(\frac{d q^2}{N^2})$ bounds on the $q$-R\'enyi divergence.</description>

      <title>Outlier eigenvalues and eigenvectors of generalized Wigner matrices with finite-rank perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized Wigner matrix perturbed by a finite-rank deterministic matrix is considered. The fluctuations of the largest eigenvalues, which emerge outside the bulk of the spectrum, and the corresponding eigenvectors, are studied. Under certain assumptions on the perturbation and the matrix structure, we derive the first-order behavior of these eigenvalues and show that they are well separated from the bulk. The fluctuations of these eigenvalues are shown to follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution, and the asymptotic behavior of the associated eigenvectors is also studied. We prove central limit theorems that describe the asymptotic alignment of these eigenvectors with the perturbation's eigenvectors, as well as their Gaussian fluctuations around the origin for non-aligned components. Furthermore, we discuss the convergence of the eigenvector process in a Sobolev space framework.</description>

      <title>Critical time of the almost 2-regular random degree constrained process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase transition of the random degree constrained process (RDCP), a time-evolving random graph model introduced by Ruci\'nski and Wormald that generalizes the random $d$-process to the non-regular setting: each vertex of the complete graph $K_n$ has its pre-assigned degree constraint (i.e., a number from the set $\{2,\dots,\Delta \}$), we attempt to add the edges one-by-one in a uniform random order, but a new edge is added only if it does not violate the degree constraints at its end-vertices. Warnke and Wormald identified the critical time of the RDCP when the giant component emerges as $n \to \infty$. R\'ath, Sz\H{o}ke and Warnke identified the local weak limit of the RDCP and gave an alternative characterization of the critical time in terms of the principal eigenvalue of the branching operator of the multi-type branching process that arises as the local limit object.
  In the current paper we use this spectral characterization to study the critical time of the RDCP in the almost 2-regular case, i.e., when the degree constraint of most of the vertices is equal to 2. In this case the giant component emerges quite late, and our main result provides the precise asymptotics of the critical time as the model approaches 2-regularity. Interestingly, our formula asymptotically matches the well-known Molloy-Reed formula, despite the fact that Molloy, Surya and Warnke proved that the final graph of the RDCP is not contiguous to the configuration model with the same degree sequence.</description>

      <title>Triggered urn models for frequently asked questions (FAQ)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a nonclassic urn model with triggers that increase the number of colors. The scheme has emerged as a model for web services that set up frequently asked questions (FAQ). We present a thorough asymptotic analysis of the FAQ urn scheme in generality that covers a large number of special cases, such as Simon urn. For instance, we consider time dependent triggering probabilities. We identify regularity conditions on these probabilities that classify the schemes into those where the number of colors in the urn remains almost surely finite or increases to infinity and conditions that tell us whether all the existing colors are observed infinitely often or not. We determine the rank curve, too. In view of the broad generality of the trigger probabilities, a spectrum of limit distributions appears, from central limit theorems to Poisson approximation, to power-laws, revealing connections to Heap's exponent and Zipf's law. A combinatorial approach to the Simon urn is presented to indicate the possibility of such exact analysis, which is important for short-term predictions. Extensive simulations on real datasets (from Amazon sales) as well as computer-generated data clearly indicate that the asymptotic and exact theory developed agrees with practice.</description>

      <title>An It\^o Formula via Predictable Projection for Non-Semimartingale Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an It\^o-type change-of-variables formula for a class of adapted stochastic processes that do not necessarily admit semimartingale structure. The formulation is based on an intrinsic Hilbert-space derivative together with a predictable projection operator, allowing stochastic integrals to be expressed without reliance on quadratic variation or anticipative calculus.
  The resulting formula replaces the classical quadratic variation term with a computable second-order contribution expressed as a norm of the projected derivative. In the semimartingale case, the formula reduces to the classical It\^o formula. The approach applies naturally to processes with memory and non-Markovian dependence, providing a unified and intrinsic framework for stochastic calculus beyond the semimartingale setting.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus for the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation driven by fractional noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic partial differential equation analyzed in this work is the Cahn-Hilliard equation perturbed by an additive fractional white noise (fractional in time and white in space). We work in the case of one spatial dimension and apply Malliavin calculus to investigate the existence of a density for the stochastic solution $u$. In particular, we show that $u$ admits continuous paths almost surely and construct a localizing sequence through which we prove that its Malliavin derivative exists locally, and that its law is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\bf R$, establishing thus that a density exists. A key contribution of this work is the analysis of the stochastic integral appearing in the mild formulation: we derive sharp estimates for the expectation of the $p$-th power ($p \geq 2$) of the $L^{\infty}(D)$-norm of this stochastic integral as well as for the integral involving the $L^{\infty}(D)$-norm of the operator associated with the kernel appearing in the integral representation of the fractional noise, all of which are essential for this study.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, under the H\"ormander criterion on an It\^{o} process, all its martingale observables are smooth. As a consequence, we also obtain a generalized Feynman-Kac formula providing smooth solutions to certain PDE boundary-value problems, while allowing for degenerate diffusions as well as boundary stopping (under very mild boundary regularity assumptions). We also highlight an application to a question posed on Schramm-Loewner evolutions, by making certain Girsanov transform martingales accessible via It\^{o} calculus.</description>

      <title>Linear independence properties of the signature components of time-augmented stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The addition of the running time as a component of a path before computing its signature is a widespread approach to ensure the one-to-one property between them and leads to universal approximation theorems (Cuchiero, Primavera and Svaluto-Ferro, 2023). However, this also leads to the linear dependence of the components of the terminal value of the signature of the time-augmented path. More precisely, for a given natural number $N$, the signature components associated with words of length $N$ have the same linear span as the signature components associated with words of length not greater than $N$. We generalize this result by exhibiting other subfamilies of signature components with the same spanning properties. In particular we recover the result of Dupire and Tissot-Daguette which states that the spanning of the iterated integrals with the last integrator different from the time variable is the same as the spanning of all iterated integrals. We check that this choice leads to the minimal computation time when the terms of the signature are calculated using Chen's relation in a backward way. The same optimal computation time is symmetrically achieved in a forward way for the iterated integrals with the first integrator different from the time variable. Building on these results, we derive several results regarding the linear independence of the signature components of a time-augmented stochastic process. We show that if the stochastic process we consider is solution to some SDE with additive Brownian noise then any subfamily of components proposed previously is linearly independent. We also prove that the linear independence of these subfamilies of components is still true when we consider the discretization of the sample paths of this stochastic process on a grid with a sufficiently small discretization time step.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a comparison principle for viscosity solutions of a class of nonlinear partial differential equations posed on the space of nonnegative finite measures, thereby extending recent results for PDEs defined on the Wasserstein space of probability measures. As an application, we study a controlled branching McKean-Vlasov diffusion and characterize the associated value function as the unique viscosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. This yields a PDE-based approach to the optimal control of branching processes.</description>

      <title>Local times and excursions for self-similar Markov trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work builds upon the recent monograph [5] on self-similar Markov trees. A self-similar Markov tree is a random real tree equipped with a function from the tree to $[0,\infty)$ that we call the decoration. Here, we construct local time measures $L(x,dt)$ at every level $x&gt;0$ of the decoration for a large class of self-similar Markov trees. This enables us to mark at random a typical point in the tree at which the decoration is $x$. We identify the law of the decoration along the branch from the root to this tagged point in terms of a remarkable (positive) self-similar Markov process. We also show that after a proper normalization, $L(x,dt)$ converges as $x\to 0+$ to the harmonic measure $\mu$ on the tree. Finally, we point out that using a local time measure instead of the usual length measure $\lambda$ to compute distances on the tree turn the latter into a continuous branching tree. This is relevant to analyze the excusions of the decoration away from a given level. Many results of the present work shall be compared with the recent ones in [22,23] about local times and excursions of a Markov process indexed by L\'evy tree.</description>

      <title>Source localisation in simple random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of locating the source (starting vertex) of a simple random walk, given a snapshot of the set of edges (or vertices) visited in the first $n$ steps. Considering lattices $\mathbb{Z}^d$, in dimensions $d \geq 5$, we show that the source can be identified (a) with probability bounded away from $0$ using one guess, and (b) with probability arbitrarily close to $1$ using a constant number of guesses. On the other hand, for dimensions $d \leq 2$, we show that one cannot locate the source with positive constant probability. Our arguments apply more generally to strongly transient and recurrent simple random walks on vertex-transitive graphs.</description>

      <title>Absorption and fixation times for evolutionary processes on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the absorption and fixation times for evolutionary processes on graphs, under different updating rules. While in Moran process a single neighbour is randomly chosen to be replaced, in proliferation processes other neighbours can be replaced using Bernoulli or binomial draws depending on $0 &lt; p \leq 1$. There is a critical value $p_c$ such that the proliferation is advantageous or disadvantageous in terms of fixation probability depending on whether $p &gt; p_c$ or $p &lt; p_c$.
  We clarify the role of symmetries for computing the fixation time in Moran process. We show that the Maruyama-Kimura symmetry depend on the graph structure induced in each state, implying asymmetry for all graphs except cliques and cycles. There is a fitness value, not necessarily $1$, beyond which the fixation time decreases monotonically.
  We apply Harris' graphical method to prove that the fixation time decreases monotonically depending on $p$. Thus there exists another value $p_t$ for which the proliferation is advantageous or disadvantageous in terms of time. However, at the critical level $p=p_c$, the proliferation is highly advantageous when $r \to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>Dedifferentiation stabilizes stem cell lineages: From CTMC to diffusion theory and thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stem-terminally differentiated (TD) lineages in small niches where demographic noise from discrete division and death events is non-negligible. Starting from a mechanistic five-channel, density-dependent CTMC (symmetric self-renewal, symmetric differentiation, asymmetric division, dedifferentiation, TD death), we derive its mean-field limit and a functional CLT, obtaining a chemical Langevin diffusion whose explicit state-dependent covariance exactly matches the CTMC's aggregated channel-wise infinitesimal covariances. Within this diffusion approximation we remove the dedifferentiation flux and obtain a sharp dichotomy: in subcritical regimes the stem coordinate becomes extinct asymptotically almost surely, whereas in supercritical regimes polynomial moments diverge exponentially. This identifies, at the diffusion level, a structural failure mode of strictly hierarchical lineages under demographic fluctuations and clarifies how a cyclic return flux can rescue homeostasis. For interpretation we also derive an exact totals ODE backbone from a damage-structured transport model and obtain two steady-state constraints (ratio and equalization laws) linking compartment ratios to turnover and balancing dedifferentiation against fate bias. Numerical experiments corroborate the $\Omega^{-1/2}$ fluctuation scaling, illustrate the pathology, and contrast theorem-regime global convergence with threshold (Allee-type) behaviour outside the theorem hypotheses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the input-entropy-constrained Gaussian channel capacity problem in the asymptotic high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We show that the capacity-achieving distribution as SNR goes to infinity is given by a discrete Gaussian distribution supported on a scaled integer lattice. Further, we show that the gap between the input entropy and the capacity decreases to zero exponentially in SNR, and characterize this exponent.</description>

Abstract: Let Y be a random variable satisfying specific moment conditions. This paper introduces and investigates probabilistic heterogeneous Stirling numbers of the second kind and probabilistic heterogeneous Bell polynomials. These structures unify several classical and probabilistic families, including those of Stirling, Lah, Bell and Lah-Bell. By integrating the heterogeneous framework of Kim and Kim with probabilistic extensions, we derive explicit formulas, Dobi\'nski-like identities, and recurrence relations. We further establish connections to partial Bell polynomials and provide applications for Poisson and Bernoulli distributions.</description>

      <title>New Second-order Convergent Schemes for Solving decoupled FBSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new second-order symmetric algorithm for solving decoupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations. Inspired by the alternating direction implicit splitting method for partial differential equations, we split the generator into the sum of two functions. In the computation of the value process Y, explicit and implicit schemes are alternately applied to these two generators, while the algorithms from \citep{ZhaoLi2014} are used for the control process Z. We rigorously prove that the two new schemes have second-order convergence rate. The proposed splitting methods show clear advantages for equations whose generator consists of a linear part plus a nonlinear part, as they reduce the number of iterations required for solving implicit schemes, thereby decreasing computational cost while maintaining second-order convergence. Two numerical examples are provided, including the backward stochastic Riccati equation arising in mean-variance hedging. The numerical results verify the theoretical error analysis and demonstrate the advantage of reduced computational cost compared to the algorithm in \citep{ZhaoLi2014}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider general parameter to solution maps $\theta \mapsto \mathcal G(\theta)$ of non-linear partial differential equations and describe an approach based on a Banach space version of the implicit function theorem to verify the gradient stability condition of Nickl&amp;Wang (JEMS 2024) for the underlying non-linear inverse problem, providing also injectivity estimates and corresponding statistical identifiability results. We illustrate our methods in two examples involving a non-linear reaction diffusion system as well as a McKean--Vlasov interacting particle model, both with periodic boundary conditions. We apply our results to prove the polynomial time convergence of a Langevin-type algorithm sampling the posterior measure of the interaction potential arising from a discrete aggregate measurement of the interacting particle system.</description>

      <title>Gene genealogies in diploid populations evolving according to sweepstakes reproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recruitment dynamics, or the distribution of the number of offspring among individuals, is central for understanding ecology and evolution. Sweepstakes reproduction (heavy right-tailed offspring number distribution) is central for understanding the ecology and evolution of highly fecund natural populations. Sweepstakes reproduction can induce jumps in type frequencies and multiple mergers in gene genealogies of sampled gene copies. We take sweepstakes reproduction to be skewed offspring number distribution due to mechanisms not involving natural selection, such as in chance matching of broadcast spawning with favourable environmental conditions. Here, we consider population genetic models of sweepstakes reproduction in a diploid panmictic populations absent selfing and evolving in a random environment. Our main results are {\it (i)} continuous-time Beta and Poisson-Dirichlet coalescents, when combining the results the skewness parameter $\alpha$ of the Beta-coalescent ranges from $0$ to $2$, and the Beta-coalescents may be incomplete due to an upper bound on the number of potential offspring produced by any pair of parents; {\it (ii)} in large populations time is measured in units proportional to either $N/\log N$ or $N$ generations (where $2N$ is the population size when constant); {\it (iii)} it follows that incorporating population size changes leads to time-changed coalescents with the time-change independent of $\alpha$; {\it (iv)} using simulations we show that the ancestral process is not well approximated by the corresponding coalescent (as measured through certain functionals of the processes); {\it (v)} whenever the skewness of the offspring number distribution is increased the conditional (conditioned on the population ancestry) and the unconditional ancestral processes are not in good agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a dynamic reinsurance problem in which the insurer seeks to control the terminal distribution of its surplus while minimizing the L2-norm of the ceded risk. Using techniques from martingale optimal transport, we show that, under suitable assumptions, the problem admits a tractable solution analogous to the Bass martingale. We first consider the case where the insurer wants to match a given terminal distribution of the surplus process, and then relax this condition by only requiring certain moment or risk-based constraints.</description>

Abstract: We study finite-rank normal deformations of rotationally invariant non-Hermitian random matrices. Extending the classical Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e (BBP) framework, we characterize the emergence and fluctuations of outlier eigenvalues in models of the form $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{T}$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is a large rotationally invariant non-Hermitian random matrix and $\mathbf{T}$ is a finite-rank normal perturbation. We also describe the corresponding eigenvector behavior. Our results provide a unified framework encompassing both Hermitian and non-Hermitian settings, thereby generalizing several known cases.</description>

      <title>Parametric RDT approach to computational gap of symmetric binary perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study potential presence of statistical-computational gaps (SCG) in symmetric binary perceptrons (SBP) via a parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl-RDT) [96]. A structural change from decreasingly to arbitrarily ordered $c$-sequence (a key fl-RDT parametric component) is observed on the second lifting level and associated with \emph{satisfiability} ($\alpha_c$) -- \emph{algorithmic} ($\alpha_a$) constraints density threshold change thereby suggesting a potential existence of a nonzero computational gap $SCG=\alpha_c-\alpha_a$. The second level estimate is shown to match the theoretical $\alpha_c$ whereas the $r\rightarrow \infty$ level one is proposed to correspond to $\alpha_a$. For example, for the canonical SBP ($\kappa=1$ margin) we obtain $\alpha_c\approx 1.8159$ on the second and $\alpha_a\approx 1.6021$ (with converging tendency towards $\sim 1.59$ range) on the seventh level. Our propositions remarkably well concur with recent literature: (i) in [20] local entropy replica approach predicts $\alpha_{LE}\approx 1.58$ as the onset of clustering defragmentation (presumed driving force behind locally improving algorithms failures); (ii) in $\alpha\rightarrow 0$ regime we obtain on the third lifting level $\kappa\approx 1.2385\sqrt{\frac{\alpha_a}{-\log\left ( \alpha_a \right ) }}$ which qualitatively matches overlap gap property (OGP) based predictions of [43] and identically matches local entropy based predictions of [24]; (iii) $c$-sequence ordering change phenomenology mirrors the one observed in asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) in [98] and the negative Hopfield model in [100]; and (iv) as in [98,100], we here design a CLuP based algorithm whose practical performance closely matches proposed theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00923v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ is an infinite, connected, planar graph properly embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with minimum degree at least $7$, then i.i.d.\ Bernoulli$(p)$ site percolation on $G$ almost surely has infinitely many infinite open (1-)clusters for every \[ p \in \bigl(p_c^{\mathrm{site}},\, 1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}\bigr). \] Moreover, we show that $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}&lt;\tfrac12$, so this non-uniqueness interval is nonempty. This verifies Conjecture~7 of Benjamini and Schramm~\cite{bs96} for this class of properly embedded planar graphs.
  Our proof introduces a new construction of embedded trees in $G$. These trees yield infinitely many infinite clusters for percolation parameters near $\tfrac12$, and they also enable exponential decay of two-point connection probabilities by partitioning $G$ using infinitely many disjoint trees. Variants of this approach were later used in~\cite{ZL26} to construct a counterexample to Conjecture~7 of~\cite{bs96} for planar graphs with uncountably many ends.
  Finally, the methods developed here have further applications: in~\cite{perc24} they are used to prove a vertex-cut characterization of $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}$ (conjectured by Kahn in~\cite{JK03}) and to refute an edge-cut characterization proposed by Lyons and Peres~\cite{LP16} and Tang (\cite{Tang2023}).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an infinitely-many neutral allelic model of population genetics where all alleles are divided into a finite number of classes, and each class is characterized by its own mutation rate. For this model the allelic composition of a sample taken from a very large population of genes is characterized by a random matrix, and the problem is to describe the joint distribution of the matrix entries. The answer is given by a new generalization of the classical Ewens sampling formula called the refined Ewens sampling formula in the present paper. We discuss a Poisson approximation for the refined Ewens sampling formula, and present its derivation by several methods. As an application we obtain limit theorems for the numbers of alleles in different asymptotic regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional Littlewood-Offord problem for general Ising models. More precisely, we consider the concentration function \[Q_n(x,v)=P\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\varepsilon_iv_i\in(x-1,x+1)\right),\] where $x\in\mathbb{R}$, $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n$ are real numbers such that $|v_1|\geq 1, |v_2|\geq 1,\ldots, |v_n|\geq 1$, and $(\varepsilon_i)_{i=1,2,\ldots,n}\in\{-1,1\}^{n}$ are random spins of some Ising model. Let $Q_n=\sup_{x,v}Q_n(x,v)$. Under natural assumptions, we show that there exists a universal constant $C$ such that for all $n\geq 1$, \[\binom{n}{[n/2]}2^{-n}\leq Q_n\leq Cn^{-\frac{1}{2}}.\] As an application of the method, under the same assumption, we give a lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue of the truncated correlation matrix of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Insights for Efficient Exploration Strategies in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate efficient exploration strategies of environments with unknown stochastic dynamics and sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze first the impact of parallel simulations on the probability of reaching rare states within a finite time budget. Using simplified models based on random walks and L\'evy processes, we provide analytical results that demonstrate a phase transition in reaching probabilities as a function of the number of parallel simulations. We identify an optimal number of parallel simulations that balances exploration diversity and time allocation. Additionally, we analyze a restarting mechanism that exponentially enhances the probability of success by redirecting efforts toward more promising regions of the state space. Our findings contribute to a more qualitative and quantitative theory of some exploration schemes in reinforcement learning, offering insights into developing more efficient strategies for environments characterized by rare events.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic coordinate subset and partition selection of multivariate Markov chains via submodular optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of optimally projecting the transition matrix of a finite ergodic multivariate Markov chain onto a lower-dimensional state space, as well as the problem of finding an optimal partition of coordinates such that the factorized Markov chain gives minimal information loss compared to the original multivariate chain. Specifically, we seek to construct a Markov chain that optimizes various information-theoretic criteria under cardinality constraints. These criteria include entropy rate, information-theoretic distance to factorizability, independence, and stationarity. We formulate these tasks as best subset or partition selection problems over multivariate Markov chains and leverage the (k-)submodular (or (k-)supermodular) structures of the objective functions to develop efficient greedy-based algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Along the way, we introduce a generalized version of the distorted greedy algorithm, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we illustrate the theory and algorithms through extensive numerical experiments with publicly available code on multivariate Markov chains associated with the Bernoulli--Laplace and Curie--Weiss models.</description>

      <title>Voter Model stability with respect to conservative noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notions of noise sensitivity and stability were recently extended for the voter model. In this model, the vertices of a graph have opinions that are updated by uniformly selecting edges. We further extend stability results to different classes of perturbations. We consider two different types of noise: in the first one, an exclusion process is performed on the edge selections, while in the second, independent Brownian motions are applied to such a sequence. In both cases, we prove stability of the consensus opinion provided the noise is run for a short amount of time, depending on the underlying graph structure. This is done by analyzing the expected size of the pivotal set, whose definition differs from the usual one in order to reflect the change associated with these noises.</description>

      <title>Diameter and mixing time of the giant component in the percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider bond percolation on the $d$-dimensional binary hypercube with $p=c/d$ for fixed $c&gt;1$. We prove that the typical diameter of the giant component $L_1$ is of order $\Theta(d)$, and the typical mixing time of the lazy random walk on $L_1$ is of order $\Theta(d^2)$. This resolves long-standing open problems of Bollob\'as, Kohayakawa and {\L}uczak from 1994, and of Benjamini and Mossel from 2003.
  A key component in our approach is a new tight large deviation estimate on the number of vertices in $L_1$ whose proof includes several novel ingredients: a structural description of the residue outside the giant component after sprinkling, a tight quantitative estimate on the spread of the giant in the hypercube, and a stability principle which rules out the disintegration of large connected sets under thinning. This toolkit further allows us to obtain optimal bounds on the expansion in $L_1$.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Theorems and Equivalence of Green's Kernel for Random Walks in Random Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Ergodic Properties of Random Walks in stationary ergodic environments without uniform ellipticity under a minimal assumption. There are two main components in our work. The first step is to adopt the arguments of Lawler to first prove a uniqueness principle. We use a more general definition of environments using~\textit{Environment Functions}. As a corollary, we can deduce an invariance principle under these assumptions for balanced environments under some assumptions. We also use the uniqueness principle to show that any balanced, elliptic random walk must have the same transience behaviour as the simple symmetric random walk. The second is to transfer the results we deduce in balanced environments to general ergodic environments(under some assumptions) using a control technique to derive a measure under which the \textit{local process} is stationary and ergodic. As a consequence of our results, we deduce the Law of Large Numbers for the Random Walk and an Invariance Principle under our assumptions.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein-p Central Limit Theorem Rates: From Local Dependence to Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-time central limit theorem (CLT) rates play a central role in modern machine learning. In this paper, we study CLT rates for multivariate dependent data in Wasserstein-$p$ ($W_p$) distance, for general $p \geq 1$. We focus on two fundamental dependence structures that commonly arise in machine learning: locally dependent sequences and geometrically ergodic Markov chains. In both settings, we establish the first optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$ rate in $W_1$, as well as the first $W_p$ ($p\ge 2$) CLT rates under mild moment assumptions, substantially improving the best previously known bounds in these dependent-data regimes. As an application of our optimal $W_1$ rate for locally dependent sequences, we further obtain the first optimal $W_1$-CLT rate for multivariate $U$-statistics.
  On the technical side, we derive a tractable auxiliary bound for $W_1$ Gaussian approximation errors that is well suited for studying dependent data. For Markov chains, we further prove that the regeneration time of the split chain associated with a geometrically ergodic chain has a geometric tail without assuming strong aperiodicity or other restrictive conditions. These tools may be of independent interests and enable our optimal $W_1$ rates and underpin our $W_p$ ($p\ge 2$) results.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we have analyzed semi-discrete finite element approximations of the Stochastic linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in a bounded convex polygonal domain driven by additive Wiener noise. We use the finite element method for spatial discretization and derive an error estimate with respect to the discretization parameter of the finite element approximation.

      <title>Data-Driven Dynamic Factor Modeling via Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven dynamic factor framework for modeling the joint evolution of high-dimensional covariates and responses without parametric assumptions. Standard factor models applied to covariates alone often lose explanatory power for responses. Our approach uses anisotropic diffusion maps, a manifold learning technique, to learn low-dimensional embeddings that preserve both the intrinsic geometry of the covariates and the predictive relationship with responses. For time series arising from Langevin diffusions in Euclidean space, we show that the associated graph Laplacian converges to the generator of the underlying diffusion. We further establish a bound on the approximation error between the diffusion map coordinates and linear diffusion processes, and we show that ergodic averages in the embedding space converge under standard spectral assumptions. These results justify using Kalman filtering in diffusion-map coordinates for predicting joint covariate-response evolution. We apply this methodology to equity-portfolio stress testing using macroeconomic and financial variables from Federal Reserve supervisory scenarios, achieving mean absolute error improvements of up to 55% over classical scenario analysis and 39% over principal component analysis benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove rapid mixing for almost all random walks generated by $m$ translations on an arbitrary nilmanifold under mild assumptions on the size of $m$. For several classical classes of nilmanifolds, we show $m=2$ suffices. This provides a partial answer to the question raised in \cite{D02} about the prevalence of rapid mixing for random walks on homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>Milstein-type Schemes for Hyperbolic SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies the temporal approximation of hyperbolic semilinear stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative Gaussian noise by Milstein-type schemes. We take the term hyperbolic to mean that the leading operator generates a contractive, not necessarily analytic $C_0$-semigroup. Optimal convergence rates are derived for the pathwise uniform strong error \[
  E_h^\infty := \Big(\mathbb{E}\Big[\max_{1\le j \le M}\|U_{t_j}-u_j\|_X^p\Big]\Big)^{1/p} \] on a Hilbert space $X$ for $p\in [2,\infty)$. Here, $U$ is the mild solution and $u_j$ its Milstein approximation at time $t_j=jh$ with step size $h&gt;0$ and final time $T=Mh&gt;0$. For sufficiently regular nonlinearity and noise, we establish strong convergence of order one, with the error satisfying $E_h^\infty\lesssim h\sqrt{\log(T/h)}$ for rational Milstein schemes and $E_h^\infty \lesssim h$ for exponential Milstein schemes. This extends previous results from parabolic to hyperbolic SPDEs and from exponential to rational Milstein schemes. Moreover, root-mean-square error estimates are strengthened to pathwise uniform estimates. Numerical experiments validate the convergence rates for the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. Further applications to Maxwell's and transport equations are included.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of invariant measures as a structural property of markov kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify indecomposability as a key measure-theoretic underlying uniqueness of invariant probability measures for discrete-time Markov kernels on general state spaces. The argument relies on the mutual singularity of distinct invariant ergodic measures and on the observation that uniqueness follows whenever all invariant probability measures are forced to charge a common reference measure.
  Once existence of invariant probability measures is known, indecomposability alone is sufficient to rule out multiplicity. On standard Borel spaces, this viewpoint is consistent with the classical theory: irreducibility appears as a convenient sufficient condition ensuring indecomposability, rather than as a structural requirement for uniqueness.
  The resulting proofs are purely measure-theoretic and do not rely on recurrence, regeneration, return-time estimates, or regularity assumptions on the transition kernel.</description>

      <title>The Greedy Algorithm for Dissociated Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac \pi 2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1&lt;C&lt;c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</description>
