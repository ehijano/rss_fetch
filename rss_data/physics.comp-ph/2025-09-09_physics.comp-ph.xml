      <title>Causal Multi-fidelity Surrogate Forward and Inverse Models for ICF Implosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continued progress in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) requires solving inverse problems relating experimental observations to simulation input parameters, followed by design optimization. However, such high dimensional dynamic PDE-constrained optimization problems are extremely challenging or even intractable. It has been recently shown that inverse problems can be solved by only considering certain robust features. Here we consider the ICF capsule's deuterium-tritium (DT) interface, and construct a causal, dynamic, multifidelity reduced-order surrogate that maps from a time-dependent radiation temperature drive to the interface's radius and velocity dynamics. The surrogate targets an ODE embedding of DT interface dynamics, and is constructed by learning a controller for a base analytical model using low- and high-fidelity simulation training data with respect to radiation energy group structure. After demonstrating excellent accuracy of the surrogate interface model, we use machine learning (ML) models with surrogate-generated data to solve inverse problems optimizing radiation temperature drive to reproduce observed interface dynamics. For sparse snapshots in time, the ML model further characterizes the most informative times at which to sample dynamics. Altogether we demonstrate how operator learning, causal architectures, and physical inductive bias can be integrated to accelerate discovery, design, and diagnostics in high-energy-density systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling Magnetoelastic Wave Interactions in Magnetic Films and Heterostructures: A finite-difference approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (inverse) magnetostrictive effect in ferromagnets couples the magnetic properties to the mechanical stress, allowing for an interaction between the magnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom. In this work, we present a time-integration scheme for the self-consistent simulation of coupled magnetoelastic dynamics within the framework of finite-difference micromagnetism. The proposed implementation extends the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation by a strain-induced effective field and concurrently solves the elastic equation of motion, while correctly incorporating stress and strain discontinuities at material interfaces. We then present a comprehensive set of examples, ranging from static stress configurations over material boundaries to simulations of surface acoustic wave attenuation in magnetically structured thin and thick films. These computational experiments both validate the implementation and underscore the importance of properly handling jump and boundary conditions in magnon-phonon interaction studies.</description>

      <title>Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses (or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC, which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs, offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance comparable to ORC.</description>

      <title>Universality of physical neural networks with multivariate nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enormous energy demand of artificial intelligence is driving the development of alternative hardware for deep learning. Physical neural networks try to exploit physical systems to perform machine learning more efficiently. In particular, optical systems can calculate with light using negligible energy. While their computational capabilities were long limited by the linearity of optical materials, nonlinear computations have recently been demonstrated through modified input encoding. Despite this breakthrough, our inability to determine if physical neural networks can learn arbitrary relationships between data -- a key requirement for deep learning known as universality -- hinders further progress. Here we present a fundamental theorem that establishes a universality condition for physical neural networks. It provides a powerful mathematical criterion that imposes device constraints, detailing how inputs should be encoded in the tunable parameters of the physical system. Based on this result, we propose a scalable architecture using free-space optics that is provably universal and achieves high accuracy on image classification tasks. Further, by combining the theorem with temporal multiplexing, we present a route to potentially huge effective system sizes in highly practical but poorly scalable on-chip photonic devices. Our theorem and scaling methods apply beyond optical systems and inform the design of a wide class of universal, energy-efficient physical neural networks, justifying further efforts in their development.</description>

      <title>Adaptive time-stepping for the Super-Droplet Method Monte Carlo collision-coalescence scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of an adaptive time-stepping scheme for the Super-Droplet Method (SDM), a Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating particle coagulation. SDM represents cloud droplets as weighted superdroplets, enabling high-fidelity representations of microphysical processes such as collision-coalescence. However, the algorithm can undercount collisions when the expected number of events is not realizable given the superdroplet configuration, introducing a biased error referred here as the collision deficit. While SDM exhibits statistical spread inherent to Monte Carlo schemes, the deficit is a systematic underestimation of collision events. This error can be addressed with adaptive time-stepping, which dynamically adjusts simulation time steps to eliminate this deficit. We analyze the behavior of the deficit across a wide range of timesteps, superdroplet counts, and initialization strategies, and explore trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. Using the classical Safranov-Golovin test case, we show that the deficit increases with timestep and superdroplet count, and that adaptive time-stepping effectively removes the associated error without significant cost. We test a smooth continuum of initial distributions with extrema representing two different initialization methods, and find that while the deficit is sensitive to the choice of attribute-space sampling strategies, adaptive time-stepping substantially reduces the difference, allowing for users to choose initialization methods optimized for other processes. We also propose a method of visualization, capturing both the attribute sampling, droplet interactions over multiple timesteps, and the deficit using network connectivity graphs. In 2-D flow-coupled simulations, we find the deficit can have a stronger effect on convergence than previously shown, with uncorrected deficit delaying the onset of precipitation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Fourier Neural Operator-Plasma Fluid Model for Fast and Accurate Multiscale Simulations of High Power Microwave Breakdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and simulation of High Power Microwave (HPM) breakdown, a multiscale phenomenon, is computationally expensive and requires solving Maxwell's equations (EM solver) coupled with a plasma continuity equation (plasma solver). In this work, we present a hybrid modeling approach that combines the accuracy of a differential equation-based plasma fluid solver with the computational efficiency of FNO (Fourier Neural Operator) based EM solver. Trained on data from an in-house FDTD-based plasma-fluid solver, the FNO replaces computationally expensive EM field updates, while the plasma solver governs the dynamic plasma response. The hybrid model is validated on microwave streamer formation, due to diffusion ionization mechanism, in a 2D scenario for unseen incident electric fields corresponding to entirely new plasma streamer simulations not included in model training, showing excellent agreement with FDTD based fluid simulations in terms of streamer shape, velocity, and temporal evolution. This hybrid FNO based strategy delivers significant acceleration of the order of 60X compared to traditional simulations for the specified problem size and offers an efficient alternative for computationally demanding multiscale and multiphysics simulations involved in HPM breakdown. Our work also demonstrate how such hybrid pipelines can be used to seamlessly to integrate existing C-based simulation codes with Python-based machine learning frameworks for simulations of plasma science and engineering problems.</description>

      <title>Self-learning QMC: application to the classical Holstein-Spin-Fermion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning in systems with competing interactions, we developed a self-learning quantum Monte Carlo (SLQMC) method to simulate the phase transition in the classical Holstein-spin-fermion model. In SLQMC, machine learning techniques are employed to approximate the free energy, thereby bypassing the need for exact diagonalization and significantly reducing computational cost. We assess the performance of SLQMC using both linear regression and neural network models. Our results show that both models are capable of capturing the phase transition from the antiferromagnetic state to the charge-density-wave state. However, the sampling efficiency decreases near the AFM-CDW phase transition, which is attributed to the increased mean-squared-error of the machine learning model. Additionally, the sampling efficiency decreases with increasing lattice size. This suppression is due to the increased root-mean-squared-error as the machine learning model is applied to a large lattice and the finite-size effect, wherein the energy gap between the ground state and low-energy excited states decreases as the lattice grows. Our findings highlight the necessity of highly accurate machine learning models to simulate theoretical models with complex, competing microscopic interactions on a large lattice.</description>

      <title>Persistent Charge and Spin Currents in a Ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping, where non-reciprocal hopping generates a synthetic magnetic flux and drives a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Multigrid-Accelerated Compact Gas-Kinetic Scheme for Fast Convergence in High-Speed Flows on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit methods and GPU parallelization are two distinct yet powerful strategies for accelerating high-order CFD algorithms. However, few studies have successfully integrated both approaches within high-speed flow solvers. The core challenge lies in preserving the robustness of implicit algorithms in the presence of strong discontinuities, while simultaneously enabling massive thread parallelism under the constraints of limited GPU memory. To address this, we propose a GPU-optimized, geometric multigrid-accelerated, high-order compact gas kinetic scheme (CGKS) that incorporates three key innovations:
  (1) a multi-color lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel scheme that eliminates thread conflicts and preserves memory efficiency, serving as an implicit smoother on coarse grids; (2) a discontinuity-adaptive relaxation technique and a multigrid prolongation process, based on a discontinuous feedback factor, which dynamically stabilize shock regions without compromising convergence in smooth zones; and (3) a three-layer V-cycle geometric parallel multigrid strategy specifically tailored for unstructured meshes. Extensive tests on multi-dimensional subsonic to hypersonic flows demonstrate that our GPU-based high-performance solver achieves one to two orders of magnitude faster convergence compared to previous explicit solvers. More importantly, it preserves the shock-capturing robustness of the explicit CGKS and exhibits strong scalability on GPU architectures. This work presents a unified framework that synergistically leverages implicit acceleration and GPU optimization for high-speed flow simulations, effectively overcoming traditional trade-offs between parallelism, memory constraints, and numerical stability in high-order methods.</description>

      <title>GPUTB: Efficient Machine Learning Tight-Binding Method for Large-Scale Electronic Properties Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high computational cost of ab-initio methods limits their application in predicting electronic properties at the device scale. Therefore, an efficient method is needed to map the atomic structure to the electronic structure quickly. Here, we develop GPUTB, a GPU-accelerated tight-binding (TB) machine learning framework. GPUTB employs atomic environment descriptors, enabling the model parameters to incorporate environmental dependence. This allows the model to transfer to different basis, xc-functionals, and allotropes easily. Combined with the linear scaling quantum transport method, we have calculated the electronic density of states for up to 100 million atoms in pristine graphene. Trained on finite-temperature structures, the model can be easily extended to millions of atom finite-temperature systems. Furthermore, GPUTB can also successfully describe h-BN/graphene heterojunction systems, demonstrating its capability to handle complex material with high precision. We accurately reproduce the relationship between carrier concentration and room temperature mobility in graphene to verify the framework's accuracy. Therefore, our GPUTB framework presents a delicate balance between computational accuracy and efficiency, providing a powerful computational tool for investing electronic properties for large systems with millions of atoms.</description>

      <title>Classical Neural Networks on Quantum Devices via Tensor Network Disentanglers: A Case Study in Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of implementing bottleneck layers from classical pre-trained neural networks on a quantum computer, with the goal of achieving quantum advantage on near-term devices. Our approach begins with a compression step in which the target linear layer is represented as an effective matrix product operator (MPO) without degrading model performance. The MPO is then further disentangled into a more compact form. This enables a hybrid classical-quantum execution scheme, where the disentangling circuits are deployed on a quantum computer while the remainder of the network -- including the disentangled MPO -- runs on classical hardware. We introduce two complementary algorithms for MPO disentangling: (i) an explicitly disentangling variational method leveraging standard tensor-network optimization techniques, and (ii) an implicitly disentangling gradient-descent-based approach. We validate these methods through a proof-of-concept translation of simple classical neural networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10 image classification into a hybrid classical-quantum form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum physics, largely due to the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. We present a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) approach, leveraging a flexible neural network ansatz to represent the many-body wavefunction. Focusing on quantum dots with up to 30 electrons, we demonstrate that NN-VMC significantly reduces variational bias and achieves ground-state energies surpassing those of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). A key feature is that the neural network adaptively learns and optimizes nodal structures during energy minimization. We provide qualitative insights into the nodal structure of fermionic wavefunctions by comparing the nodal structures generated by NN-VMC with those obtained from traditional trial functions. Additionally, we reveal spin-resolved radial distributions and electron density profiles, highlighting the versatility and accuracy of NN-VMC. This work underscores the potential of machine learning to advance quantum simulations and deepen our understanding of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>A Fourier finite volume approach for the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new approach for solving the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography is introduced, which interpolates between the well-known diffusion approximation and a radiative transfer equation based model. The proposed formulation combines a spatial finite volume scheme with a truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable for the radiative transfer equation. The finite volume scheme provides a natural and simple approach for representing piecewise constant image data modelled using transport equations. The truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable facilitates the interpolation between the diffusion approximation at low order, and the full radiative transfer model as the truncation limit $N\rightarrow\infty$. It is therefore possible to tune the precision of the model to the demands of the imaging application, taking $N=1$ for cases when the diffusion approximation would suffice and increasing the number of terms otherwise. We will then utilise the non-linear optimisation functionality of Matlab to address the corresponding large-scale nonlinear inverse problem using gradient based quasi-Newton minimisation via the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Numerical experiments for two test-cases of increasing complexity and resolution will be presented, and the effect of logarithmically rescaling the problem data on the accuracy of the reconstructed solutions will be investigated. We will focus on cases where the diffusion approximation is not sufficient to demonstrate that our approach can provide significant accuracy gains with only a modest increase in the number of Fourier terms included.</description>

      <title>High-order Adaptive Rank Integrators for Multi-scale Linear Kinetic Transport Equations in the Hierarchical Tucker Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new adaptive rank approximation technique for computing solutions to the high-dimensional linear kinetic transport equation. The approach we propose is based on a macro-micro decomposition of the kinetic model in which the angular domain is discretized with a tensor product quadrature rule under the discrete ordinates method. To address the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, the proposed low-rank method is cast in the framework of the hierarchical Tucker decomposition. The adaptive rank integrators we propose are built upon high-order discretizations for both time and space. In particular, this work considers implicit-explicit discretizations for time and finite-difference weighted-essentially non-oscillatory discretizations for space. The high-order singular value decomposition is used to perform low-rank truncation of the high-dimensional time-dependent distribution function. The methods are applied to several benchmark problems, where we compare the solution quality and measure compression achieved by the adaptive rank methods against their corresponding full-grid methods. We also demonstrate the benefits of high-order discretizations in the proposed low-rank framework.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Activity-Driven Dynamics of Semiflexible Polymers in Motility Assays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of semiflexible polymers driven by motor proteins (MPs) in two-dimensional motility assays under harmonic confinement. Using a coarse-grained agent-based model that incorporates stochastic motor attachment, detachment, and force generation, we study how activity, filament rigidity, and confinement interact to control polymer behavior. We construct dynamical behavior maps as a function of P\'eclet number, motor processivity, and trap strength. We find a two-state transition from a trapped to a free polymer, with an intermediate coexistence region, and obtain a scaling relation for the critical P\'eclet number, which is supported by simulation data across a range of parameters. Polymer flexibility strongly influences confinement: flexible filaments are more easily trapped, while increasing rigidity destabilizes confinement. Processivity of MPs can also induce a change in the effective rigidity of the polymer and, therefore, influence confinement by the trap. Under moderate confinement and activity, we observe the emergence of stable spiral conformations. The center-of-mass dynamics is analyzed through the mean square displacement, showing diffusive, ballistic, and diffusive regimes that depend on the trap strength and activity. Additionally, time series analysis of the excess kurtosis shows the variation of the non-Gaussian fluctuations with trap strength and activity. Our results provide a minimal physical framework to understand the dynamic organization of active filaments under confinement, with relevance to in vitro motility assays, cytoskeletal filament manipulation by optical traps, and synthetic active polymer systems.</description>

      <title>Crystal structure prediction with host-guided inpainting generation and foundation potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconditional crystal structure generation with diffusion models faces challenges in identifying symmetric crystals as the unit cell size increases. We present the Crystal Host-Guided Generation (CHGGen) framework to address this challenge through conditional generation using an inpainting method, which optimizes a fraction of atomic positions within a predefined and symmetrized host structure to improve the success rate for symmetric structure generation. By integrating inpainting structure generation with a foundation potential for structure optimization, we demonstrate the method on the ZnS-P$_2$S$_5$ and Li-Si chemical systems, where the inpainting method generates a higher fraction of symmetric structures than unconditional generation. The practical significance of CHGGen extends to enabling the structural modification of crystal structures, particularly for systems with partial occupancy or intercalation chemistry. The inpainting method also allows for seamless integration with other generative models, providing a versatile framework for accelerating materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Accelerating point defect photo-emission calculations with machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework leveraging universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to dramatically accelerate the calculation of photoluminescence (PL) spectra of atomic or molecular emitters with ab initio accuracy. By replacing the costly density functional theory (DFT) computation of phonon modes with much faster MLIP phonon mode calculations, our approach achieves speed improvements exceeding an order of magnitude with minimal precision loss. We benchmark the approach using a dataset comprising ab initio emission spectra of 791 color centers spanning various types of crystal point defects in different charge and magnetic states. The method is also applied to a molecular emitter adsorbed on a hexagonal boron nitride surface. Across all the systems, we find excellent agreement for both the Huang-Rhys factor and the PL lineshapes. This application of universal MLIPs bridges the gap between computational efficiency and spectroscopic fidelity, opening pathways to high-throughput screening of defect-engineered materials. Our work not only demonstrates accelerated calculation of PL spectra with DFT accuracy, but also makes such calculations tractable for more complex materials.</description>

      <title>Early Stages of Self-Healing at Tungsten Grain Boundaries from Ab Initio Machine Learning Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanostructured tungsten has been reported as a possible alternative plasma-facing material due to its potential ability to self-heal radiation-induced defects, a property that is attributed to its high density of grain boundaries (GB). Here, we study the initial stages of self-healing at tungsten interfaces with molecular dynamics simulations driven by a machine-learning interatomic potential tailored to one of the most common GBs found in experiments. Our model accurately reproduces the ab initio potential energy surface derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and outperforms previously reported empirical and machine learning interatomic potentials in predicting defect energetics. The simulations reveal low-temperature defect migration to GBs driven by rapid dumbbell-like ordering and subsequent accommodation along GB grooves. In contrast to empirical potentials, which predict unexpected GB degradation at high temperatures after defect migration, our model maintains stable GB motifs over the investigated temperature range. The temperature-dependent defect counts, evaluated using an Arrhenius-like fit, yield an average interstitial migration energy of 0.048 eV, in agreement with experiment.
  This work underscores the capabilities of ab initio machine learning simulations in accurately modeling defect-GB interactions and highlights their potential to contribute to the development of radiation tolerant materials.</description>

      <title>Unconventional tunnel magnetoresistance scaling with altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches form a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomena is explained by adouble-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O-based AMTJ, where the TMR anomalously decreases from 220% to 40% as the layer number of Cr2Se2O increases from 1 to 5. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.</description>

      <title>Direct determination of layer anomalous Hall conductivity using uniaxial Wannier functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for computing layer anomalous Hall conductivity (LAHC) in real space by integrating the Fukui-Hatsugai-Suzuki method with hybrid Wannier functions localized along a single axis. To validate the method, we calculated the LAHC of axion-insulating MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and confirmed the agreement between the sum of LAHC on the surface and the surface AHC previously reported. We further applied the method to antiferromagnetic Mn$_2$Bi$_2$Te$_5$ and examined the dependence on the magnetic structure of LAHC, identifying cases with and without axion insulating behavior. This layer-resolved analysis offers a powerful tool for studying topological transport in complex materials, including heterostructures, and may guide the design of future devices based on the anomalous Hall effect with precise layer control.</description>

      <title>Conservative data-driven finite element framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new data-driven finite element framework that is applicable to a broad range of engineering simulation problems. In the data-driven approach, the conservation laws and boundary conditions are satisfied by means of the finite element method, while the experimental data is used directly in numerical simulations, avoiding material models. Critically, we introduce a "weaker'" mixed finite element formulation, which relaxes the regularity requirements on the approximation space for the primary field. At the same time, the continuity of the normal flux component is enforced across inner boundaries, allowing the conservation law to be satisfied in the strong sense. The relaxed regularity of the approximation spaces makes it easier to observe how imperfections in the datasets, such as missing or noisy data, result in non-uniqueness of the solution. This can be quantified to predict the uncertainty of the results using methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. Furthermore, this formulation provides a posteriori error indicators tailored for the data-driven approach, providing confidence in the results and enabling efficient solution schemes via adaptive hp-refinement. The capabilities of the formulation are demonstrated on an example of the nonlinear heat transfer in nuclear graphite using synthetically generated material datasets. This work provides an essential component for numerical frameworks for complex engineering systems such as digital twins.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Turbulence with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum turbulence spans length scales from the system size $L$ to the healing length $\xi$, making direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation computationally expensive when $L \gg \xi$. We present a matrix product state (MPS) solver for the GP equation that efficiently compresses the wavefunction by truncating weak interlength-scale correlations. This approach reduces memory usage by factors ranging from 10x to over 10,000x compared to DNS. We benchmark our approach on nonlinear excitations, namely dark solitons (1D) and quantized vortices (2D, 3D), capturing key dynamics such as Kelvin wave propagation and vortex ring emission in the case of vortex line reconnection. For turbulent states composed of multiple nonlinear excitations, we find that the memory compression of the MPS representation is directly proportional to the soliton or vortex densities. We also accurately reproduce established results from two-point correlation functions and energy spectra, where we recover the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum with little memory overhead. These results demonstrate the representative capabilities of the MPS ansatz for quantum turbulence and pave the way for studying this nonequilibrium state using previously-prohibited system sizes to uncover novel physics.</description>
