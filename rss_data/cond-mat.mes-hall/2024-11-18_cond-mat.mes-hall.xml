      <title>Coherent Magneto-Conductance Oscillations in Amorphous Topological Insulator Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on amorphous materials have established the existence of surface states similar to those of crystalline three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs). Amorphous topological insulators are also independently of interest for thermo-electric and other properties. To develop an understanding of transport in these systems, we carry out quantum transport calculations for a tight-binding model of an amorphous nano-wire pierced by an axial magnetic flux, then compare the results to known features in the case of crystalline models with disorder. Our calculations complement previous studies in the crystalline case that studied the surface or used a Green's function method. We find that the periodicity of the conductance signal with varying magnetic flux is comparable to the crystalline case, with maxima occurring at odd multiples of magnetic flux quanta. However, the expected amplitude of the oscillation decreases with increasing amorphousness, as defined and described in the main text. We characterize this deviation from the crystalline case by taking ensemble averages of the conductance signatures for various wires with measurements simulated at finite temperatures. This striking transport phenomenon offers a metric to characterize amorphous TIs and stimulate further experiments on this class of materials.</description>

      <title>Random-Flux-Induced Topological Phase Transitions and Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relevance of random flux on stability and emergence of topological phases of matter. A particularly interesting model in the presence of random flux is the anisotropic Wilson-Dirac model in two spatial dimensions. We show that this model exhibits an intriguing topological phase transition from a weak topological insulator to a Chern insulator driven by random flux. We numerically establish a global phase diagram of this model in presence of random flux. We uncover the underlying mechanism of topological phase transitions with an analytical effective medium theory, illustrating momentum-dependent renormalizations of model parameters by random flux. This analysis allows us to identify quasi-critical phase points at transitions between weak and strong topological phases, where eigen states are extended in one spatial direction but localized in the other one. Our results describe a qualitatively new effect of disorder on topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Entangling color centers via magnon-antimagnon pair creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present how entanglement between a spatially separated pair of color centers can be created by letting them weakly interact with the quantum fluctuations of a nonequilibrium magnetic environment. To this end, we consider two coupled ferromagnets, one in the ground state and one in an inverted state with respect to an applied magnetic field. The resulting energetic instability leads to a quantum spin current in the vacuum state that is sustained by the creation of magnon-antimagnon pairs at the interface. We show that these quantum fluctuations imprint a steady-state entanglement onto the two dipole-coupled color centers through nonlocal dissipation. We derive conditions for establishing a maximally entangled Bell state. This entanglement is absent in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Topological geometric frustration in a cube-surface artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin ices provide a controlled platform for investigating diverse physical phenomena, such as geometric frustration, magnetic monopoles, and phase transitions, via deliberate design. Here, we introduce a novel approach by developing artificial spin ice on the surfaces of a three-dimensional cube, which leads to emergent geometric frustration mediated by topologically protected domain walls, distinct from its flat counterparts. These domain walls connect vertices at the corners of cube that acting as intrinsic topological defects. Utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, we observe robust, topologically protected correlations among the intrinsic topological defects, regardless of their spatial separation. Our findings demonstrate that three-dimensional surfaces can unveil emergent properties absent in flat architectures.</description>

      <title>Topological vortices in planar S-TI-S Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the Josephson vortices in planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) junctions, where the TI section is narrow and long. We are motivated by recent experiments, especially by those in junctions of Corbino ring geometry, where non-zero critical current was observed at low temperatures even if a non-zero phase winding number (fluxoid) was enforced in the ring by the perpendicular magnetic field. In this paper we focus on the "atomic" limit in which the low-energy bound states of different vortices do not overlap. In this limit we can associate the non-vanishing critical current with the irregularities (disorder) in the junction's width. We also discuss the microwave spectroscopy of the Josephson vortices in the atomic limit and observe particularly simple selection rules for the allowed transitions.</description>

      <title>2D Theoretically Twistable Material Database</title>

Abstract: The study of twisted two-dimensional (2D) materials, where twisting layers create moir\'e superlattices, has opened new opportunities for investigating topological phases and strongly correlated physics. While systems such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been extensively studied, the broader potential of a seemingly infinite set of other twistable 2D materials remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we define "theoretically twistable materials" as single- or multi-layer structures that allow for the construction of simple continuum models of their moir\'e structures. This excludes, for example, materials with a "spaghetti" of bands or those with numerous crossing points at the Fermi level, for which theoretical moir\'e modeling is unfeasible. We present a high-throughput algorithm that systematically searches for theoretically twistable semimetals and insulators based on the Topological 2D Materials Database. By analyzing key electronic properties, we identify thousands of new candidate materials that could host rich topological and strongly correlated phenomena when twisted. We propose representative twistable materials for realizing different types of moir\'e systems, including materials with different Bravais lattices, valleys, and strength of spin-orbital coupling. We provide examples of crystal growth for several of these materials and showcase twisted bilayer band structures along with simplified twisted continuum models. Our results significantly broaden the scope of moir\'e heterostructures and provide a valuable resource for future experimental and theoretical studies on novel moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring Hall voltage and Hall resistance in an atom-based quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hall effect has a paramount role in a wide range of disciplines, from applied sciences to the fundamental exploration of novel topological phases of matter. In the solid state, this effect describes the emergence of a voltage drop perpendicular to the current flow in the presence of a magnetic field, leading to a transverse Hall resistance. Despite its fundamental nature, a full understanding and control of the Hall effect in interacting quantum systems is still lacking. This has led to the development of quantum simulators based on neutral atoms, where strongly correlated and universal manifestations of the Hall effect were recently unveiled. However, a direct measurement of the Hall voltage and of the Hall resistance in those systems was not achieved so far. Here, we demonstrate a technique for the measurement of the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator. From that we provide the first direct measurement of the Hall resistance in a non-electron-based system and study its dependence on the carrier density, along with theoretical analyses. Our work closes a major gap between analog quantum simulations and measurements performed in real solid-state systems, providing a key tool for the exploration of the Hall effect in highly tunable and strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>A Study of Spherical and Sessile Droplet Dynamics by Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the mesoscopic dynamics of droplets formed by phase separated fluids at nanometer scales where thermal fluctuations are significant. Both spherical droplets fully immersed in a second fluid and sessile droplets which are also in contact with a solid surface are studied. Our model combines a Cahn-Hillard formulation with incompressible fluctuating hydrodynamics; for sessile droplets the fluid-solid contact angle is specified as a boundary condition. Deterministic simulations with an applied body force are used to measure the droplets' mobility from which a diffusion coefficient is obtained using the Einstein relation. Stochastic simulations are independently used to obtain a diffusion coefficient from a linear fit of the variance of a droplet's position with time. In some scenarios these two measurements give the same value but not in the case of a spherical droplet initialized near a slip wall or in the case of sessile droplets with large contact angles (greater than 90 degrees) on both slip and no-slip surfaces.</description>

      <title>Optical response of edge modes in time-reversal symmetric topological superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological superconductors and Majorana edge modes at their boundaries have been theoretically predicted. However, their experimental observation remains controversial. Recent theoretical studies suggest that chiral Majorana edge modes exhibit distinct spatially-resolved optical conductivity compared to chiral Dirac edge modes. In this work, we investigate the optical conductivity and spatially-resolved optical conductivity induced by Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes under time-reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry. We conduct numerical calculations and analytical calculations with edge effective theory for two-dimensional ${\mathbb Z}_2$ topological insulators, strong topological superconductors, and topological crystalline superconductors. Our results show that even under time-reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes exhibit different optical responses.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Dislocation in Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dislocation created in the topological material lays the foundation of many significant findings to control light but requires delicate fabrication of the material. To extend its flexibility and reconfigurability, we propose the magnetic dislocation concept and unveil its properties in a representative model, which effectively combines the topological defect and edge mode at the magnetic domain wall. The results include distinct localization modes and robust light trapping phenomena with the rainbow feature where the eigen-energy of each light-trapping state can be linearly tuned by the magnetic dislocation. The conversion from the trapping state to edge modes can be harnessed by further adiabatically pumping light across an amount of the magnitude of the magnetic dislocation. Our work solves a fundamental problem by introducing magnetic dislocation with new light-manipulation flexibility, which may be implemented in a variety of platforms in photonic, acoustics, and optomechanics with dynamic modulations and synthetic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-Driven Morphing and Control of Topological Modes in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can each delocalize topological zero modes (TZMs) from the boundary. To overcome the challenge of precise parameter tuning imposed by the NHSE-induced delocalization and to enhance the capacity of TZMs limited by nonlinearity-induced partial delocalization in Hermitian systems, we develop non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface models. This model consists of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains, incorporating nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. When the nonlinearity is applied to both chains, the TZM becomes fully delocalized, extending across the entire lattice of two chains without the need for precise parameter tuning. By adjusting nonlinear coefficients in both chains, the wavefunction profile and plateaus across the entire lattice can be effectively controlled and customized through inherent configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Furthermore, the spectral localizer is utilized to demonstrate the topological protection of these extended non-Hermitian TZMs, confirming their robustness against disorder. Their dynamical stability under external pumping is also validated. Our findings provide a deeper insight into how nonlinearity and NHSE affect the behavior of topological modes, opening new possibilities for enhancing their capacity and performance in compact devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optical control of charge orders in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that ultrafast optical pump pulses provide effective control over charge orders in the kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ with $A=$ K, Rb, and Cs. Starting from the real charge density waves (rCDWs) at the $p$-type Van Hove singularity, we conduct a thorough analysis of the post-pump dynamics by time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory. Our analysis uncovers distinct dynamical phenomena under linearly and circularly polarized pumps. Linearly polarized pumps induce directional preferences in the rCDWs, accompanied by an enhancement in the flat band. Unexpectedly, charge nematicity also emerges and receives maximal enhancement at a resonant pump frequency, which we understand with a Rabi-oscillation-like model. On the other hand, circularly polarized pumps suppress the rCDWs uniformly and triggers imaginary CDWs (iCDWs) with charge loop currents. Our results can be directly compared to the pump-probe experiments on the kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

Abstract: We address the precise determination of the phase diagram of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene under hydrostatic pressure within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock method in real space, including all the remote bands of the system. We further present a novel algorithm that maps the full real-space density matrix to a $4\times4$ density matrix based on a $SU(4)$ symmetry of sublattice and valley degrees of freedom. We find a quantum critical point between a nematic and a Kekul\'e phase, and show also that our microscopic approach displays a strong particle-hole asymmetry in the weak coupling regime. We arrive then at the prediction that the superconductivity should be Ising-like in the hole-doped nematic regime, with spin-valley locking, and spin-triplet in the electron-doped regime.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the magnetic responses of bilayer graphene from the perspective of the quantum distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the influence of the quantum geometry on the magnetic responses of quadratic band crossing semimetals. More explicitly, we examine the Landau levels, quantum Hall effect, and magnetic susceptibility of a general two-band Hamiltonian that has fixed isotropic quadratic band dispersion but with tunable quantum geometry, in which the interband coupling is fully characterized by the maximum quantum distance $d_\mathrm{max}$. By continuously tuning $d_\mathrm{max}$ in the range of $0\leq d_\mathrm{max}\leq 1$, we investigate how the magnetic properties of the free electron model with $d_\mathrm{max}=0$ evolve into those of the bilayer graphene with $d_\mathrm{max}=1$. We demonstrate that despite sharing the same energy dispersion $\epsilon(p) =\pm\frac{p^2}{2m}$, the charge carriers in the free electron model and bilayer graphene exhibit entirely distinct Landau levels and quantum Hall responses due to the nontrivial quantum geometry of the wave functions.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale Field Theory for Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mesoscale field theory unifying the modeling of growth, elasticity, and dislocations in quasicrystals. The theory is based on the amplitudes entering their density-wave representation. We introduce a free energy functional for complex amplitudes and assume non-conserved dissipative dynamics to describe their evolution. Elasticity, including phononic and phasonic deformations, along with defect nucleation and motion, emerges self-consistently by prescribing only the symmetry of quasicrystals. Predictions on the formation of semi-coherent interfaces and dislocation kinematics are given.</description>

      <title>Floating Edge Bands in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model with Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floating edge bands (FEB) have been identified in systems such as obstructed atomic insulators and layered nonsymmorphic semimetals, attracting considerable interest recently. Here we demonstrate that FEB can arise in a simplified model incorporating altermagnetism. By enhancing the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model on a square lattice with additional altermagnetic and Zeeman fields perpendicular to the 2D plane, we uncover the emergence of FEB that are distinct from the bulk bands across the entire Brillouin zone and over broad parameter regimes. We calculate topological phase diagrams, highlighting the strong topological properties characterized by the Chern number and the weak topological properties marked by the winding number. Furthermore, we provide analytical results of the energy spectrum and the wave functions of the FEB. We also study the robustness of the FEB, showcasing its resilience against various perturbations such as geometric rotation, energy spectrum asymmetry, and spin coupling. Our findings advance our understanding of FEB and may pave new avenues for further exploration of topological phases in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Enhanced Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly interacting electrons in a topologically non trivial band may form exotic phases of matter. An especially intriguing example of which is the fractional quantum anomalous Hall phase, recently discovered in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides and in moir\'e graphene multilayers. However, it has been shown to be destabilized in certain filling factors at sub-100 mK temperatures in pentalayer graphene, in favor of a novel integer quantum anomalous Hall phase [Z. Lu et al., arXiv:2408.10203 ]. We propose that the culprit stabilizing the fractional phase at higher temperatures is its rich edge state structure. Possessing a multiplicity of chiral modes on its edge, the fractional phase has lower free energy at higher temperatures due to the excess edge modes entropy. We make distinct predictions under this scenario, including the system-size dependency of the fractional phase entropic enhancement, and how the phase boundaries change as a function of temperature.</description>

      <title>Infinite magneto-resistance and bipolar effect in spin valves driven by spin batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that spin valves under suitable symmetry conditions exhibit an ON-OFF response to a spin battery. While a spin valve driven by a charge battery displays the usual GMR (Giant Magneto-Resistance), a pure spin current or pure spin accumulation can generate an infinite magneto-resistance effect(IMR). In practice the effect is curtailed by asymmetry but the achievable magneto-resistance ratio is still predicted to be unusually large in several example setups. It is closely related to the bipolar effect (BE) of Johnson transistor which can be triggered under the same symmetry conditions.</description>

Abstract: By tailoring geometrical properties of magnetic nanocap structures, new possibilities appear to control its magnetic properties, such as the dynamics of magnetic vortices. Here, we develop an approach to describe dynamics of magnetic vortices on a spherical cap. Analytic results for the gyrofrequency of the vortex state are in a good agreement with micromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Circuits based on the Quantum Natural Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient preparation of arbitrary entangled quantum states is crucial for quantum computation. This is particularly important for noisy intermediate scale quantum simulators relying on variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. To that end, we propose symmetry-conserving modified quantum approximate optimization algorithm~(SCom-QAOA) circuits. The depths of these circuits depend not only on the desired fidelity to the target state, but also on the amount of entanglement the state contains. The parameters of the SCom-QAOA circuits are optimized using the quantum natural gradient method based on the Fubini-Study metric. The SCom-QAOA circuit transforms an unentangled state into a ground state of a gapped one-dimensional Hamiltonian with a circuit-depth that depends not on the system-size, but rather on the finite correlation length. In contrast, the circuit depth grows proportionally to the system size for preparing low-lying states of critical one-dimensional systems. Even in the latter case, SCom-QAOA circuits with depth less than the system-size were sufficient to generate states with fidelity in excess of 99\%, which is relevant for near-term applications. The proposed scheme enlarges the set of the initial states accessible for variational quantum algorithms and widens the scope of investigation of non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Extremely weak sub-kelvin electron-phonon coupling in InAs On Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are proposing, as an ideal candidate for caloritronic devices operating at subKelvin temperatures, a hybrid superconductor-semiconductor platform named InAs on insulator (InAsOI). This heterostructure is made by doped InAs grown on an insulating buffer of InAlAs on a GaAs substrate. Caloritronic devices aim to heat or cool electrons out of equilibrium with respect to the phonon degree of freedom. However, their performances are usually limited by the strength of the electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling and the associated power loss. Our work discusses the advantages of the InAsOI platform, which are based on the significantly low e-ph coupling measured compared to all-metallic state-of-the-art caloritronic devices. Our structure demonstrates values of the e-ph coupling constant up to two orders of magnitude smaller than typical values in metallic structures.</description>

      <title>Exploring Topological Boundary Effects through Quantum Trajectories in Dissipative SSH Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model under dissipative dynamics using the quantum trajectory approach. Our study explores the preservation or breakdown of topological edge states, particularly focusing on the effects of symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking dissipations. We employ the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE) as a marker for detecting topological phases in the system, which is subjected to Lindblad dynamics. The analysis reveals that, while dissipation in the bulk minimally affects the system's topological features, dissipation at the boundary leads to the destabilization of the edge modes, independently of the symmetry properties of the dissipation.</description>
