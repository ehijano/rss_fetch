      <title>Legal Retrieval for Public Defenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI tools are increasingly suggested as solutions to assist public agencies with heavy workloads. In public defense, where a constitutional right to counsel meets the complexities of law, overwhelming caseloads and constrained resources, practitioners face especially taxing conditions. Yet, there is little evidence of how AI could meaningfully support defenders' day-to-day work. In partnership with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, we develop the NJ BriefBank, a retrieval tool which surfaces relevant appellate briefs to streamline legal research and writing. We show that existing legal retrieval benchmarks fail to transfer to public defense search, however adding domain knowledge improves retrieval quality. This includes query expansion with legal reasoning, domain-specific data and curated synthetic examples. To facilitate further research, we provide a taxonomy of realistic defender search queries and release a manually annotated public defense retrieval dataset. Together, our work offers starting points towards building practical, reliable retrieval AI tools for public defense, and towards more realistic legal retrieval benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Trust Me on This: A User Study of Trustworthiness for RAG Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of generative AI into information access systems often presents users with synthesized answers that lack transparency. This study investigates how different types of explanations can influence user trust in responses from retrieval-augmented generation systems. We conducted a controlled, two-stage user study where participants chose the more trustworthy response from a pair-one objectively higher quality than the other-both with and without one of three explanation types: (1) source attribution, (2) factual grounding, and (3) information coverage. Our results show that while explanations significantly guide users toward selecting higher quality responses, trust is not dictated by objective quality alone: Users' judgments are also heavily influenced by response clarity, actionability, and their own prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>Predicting Retrieval Utility and Answer Quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of answers generated by large language models (LLMs) in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is largely influenced by the contextual information contained in the retrieved documents. A key challenge for improving RAG is to predict both the utility of retrieved documents -- quantified as the performance gain from using context over generation without context -- and the quality of the final answers in terms of correctness and relevance. In this paper, we define two prediction tasks within RAG. The first is retrieval performance prediction (RPP), which estimates the utility of retrieved documents. The second is generation performance prediction (GPP), which estimates the final answer quality. We hypothesise that in RAG, the topical relevance of retrieved documents correlates with their utility, suggesting that query performance prediction (QPP) approaches can be adapted for RPP and GPP. Beyond these retriever-centric signals, we argue that reader-centric features, such as the LLM's perplexity of the retrieved context conditioned on the input query, can further enhance prediction accuracy for both RPP and GPP. Finally, we propose that features reflecting query-agnostic document quality and readability can also provide useful signals to the predictions. We train linear regression models with the above categories of predictors for both RPP and GPP. Experiments on the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset show that combining predictors from multiple feature categories yields the most accurate estimates of RAG performance.</description>

      <title>When Text-as-Vision Meets Semantic IDs in Generative Recommendation: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic ID learning is a key interface in Generative Recommendation (GR) models, mapping items to discrete identifiers grounded in side information, most commonly via a pretrained text encoder. However, these text encoders are primarily optimized for well-formed natural language. In real-world recommendation data, item descriptions are often symbolic and attribute-centric, containing numerals, units, and abbreviations. These text encoders can break these signals into fragmented tokens, weakening semantic coherence and distorting relationships among attributes. Worse still, when moving to multimodal GR, relying on standard text encoders introduces an additional obstacle: text and image embeddings often exhibit mismatched geometric structures, making cross-modal fusion less effective and less stable.
  In this paper, we revisit representation design for Semantic ID learning by treating text as a visual signal. We conduct a systematic empirical study of OCR-based text representations, obtained by rendering item descriptions into images and encoding them with vision-based OCR models. Experiments across four datasets and two generative backbones show that OCR-text consistently matches or surpasses standard text embeddings for Semantic ID learning in both unimodal and multimodal settings. Furthermore, we find that OCR-based Semantic IDs remain robust under extreme spatial-resolution compression, indicating strong robustness and efficiency in practical deployments.</description>

      <title>Unified Multimodal and Multilingual Retrieval via Multi-Task Learning with NLU Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal retrieval systems typically employ Vision Language Models (VLMs) that encode images and text independently into vectors within a shared embedding space. Despite incorporating text encoders, VLMs consistently underperform specialized text models on text-only retrieval tasks. Moreover, introducing additional text encoders increases storage, inference overhead, and exacerbates retrieval inefficiencies, especially in multilingual settings. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-task learning framework that unifies the feature representation across images, long and short texts, and intent-rich queries. To our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly optimize multilingual image retrieval, text retrieval, and natural language understanding (NLU) tasks within a single framework. Our approach integrates image and text retrieval with a shared text encoder that is enhanced by NLU features for intent understanding and retrieval accuracy.</description>

      <title>PULSE: Socially-Aware User Representation Modeling Toward Parameter-Efficient Graph Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based social recommendation (SocialRec) has emerged as a powerful extension of graph collaborative filtering (GCF), which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture multi-hop collaborative signals from user-item interactions. These methods enrich user representations by incorporating social network information into GCF, thereby integrating additional collaborative signals from social relations. However, existing GCF and graph-based SocialRec approaches face significant challenges: they incur high computational costs and suffer from limited scalability due to the large number of parameters required to assign explicit embeddings to all users and items. In this work, we propose PULSE (Parameter-efficient User representation Learning with Social Knowledge), a framework that addresses this limitation by constructing user representations from socially meaningful signals without creating an explicit learnable embedding for each user. PULSE reduces the parameter size by up to 50% compared to the most lightweight GCF baseline. Beyond parameter efficiency, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 13 GCF and graph-based social recommendation baselines across varying levels of interaction sparsity, from cold-start to highly active users, through a time- and memory-efficient modeling process.</description>

      <title>What Should I Cite? A RAG Benchmark for Academic Citation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of Web-based academic publications, more and more papers are being published annually, making it increasingly difficult to find relevant prior work. Citation prediction aims to automatically suggest appropriate references, helping scholars navigate the expanding scientific literature. Here we present \textbf{CiteRAG}, the first comprehensive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-integrated benchmark for evaluating large language models on academic citation prediction, featuring a multi-level retrieval strategy, specialized retrievers, and generators. Our benchmark makes four core contributions: (1) We establish two instances of the citation prediction task with different granularity. Task 1 focuses on coarse-grained list-specific citation prediction, while Task 2 targets fine-grained position-specific citation prediction. To enhance these two tasks, we build a dataset containing 7,267 instances for Task 1 and 8,541 instances for Task 2, enabling comprehensive evaluation of both retrieval and generation. (2) We construct a three-level large-scale corpus with 554k papers spanning many major subfields, using an incremental pipeline. (3) We propose a multi-level hybrid RAG approach for citation prediction, fine-tuning embedding models with contrastive learning to capture complex citation relationships, paired with specialized generation models. (4) We conduct extensive experiments across state-of-the-art language models, including closed-source APIs, open-source models, and our fine-tuned generators, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework. Our open-source toolkit enables reproducible evaluation and focuses on academic literature, providing the first comprehensive evaluation framework for citation prediction and serving as a methodological template for other scientific domains. Our source code and data are released at https://github.com/LQgdwind/CiteRAG.</description>

      <title>From Insight to Intervention: Interpretable Neuron Steering for Controlling Popularity Bias in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popularity bias is a pervasive challenge in recommender systems, where a few popular items dominate attention while the majority of less popular items remain underexposed. This imbalance can reduce recommendation quality and lead to unfair item exposure. Although existing mitigation methods address this issue to some extent, they often lack transparency in how they operate. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc approach, PopSteer, that leverages a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to both interpret and mitigate popularity bias in recommendation models. The SAE is trained to replicate a trained model's behavior while enabling neuron-level interpretability. By introducing synthetic users with strong preferences for either popular or unpopular items, we identify neurons encoding popularity signals through their activation patterns. We then steer recommendations by adjusting the activations of the most biased neurons. Experiments on three public datasets with a sequential recommendation model demonstrate that PopSteer significantly enhances fairness with minimal impact on accuracy, while providing interpretable insights and fine-grained control over the fairness-accuracy trade-off.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Geometric Curse: High-Dimensional N-Gram Hashing for Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do even the most powerful 7B-parameter embedding models struggle with simple retrieval tasks that the decades old BM25 handles with ease? Recent theory suggests that this happens because of a dimensionality bottleneck. This occurs when we force infinite linguistic nuances into small, fixed-length learned vectors. We developed NUMEN to break this bottleneck by removing the learning process entirely. Instead of training heavy layers to map text to a constrained space, NUMEN uses deterministic character hashing to project language directly onto high-dimensional vectors. This approach requires no training, supports an unlimited vocabulary, and allows the geometric capacity scale as needed. On the LIMIT benchmark, NUMEN achieves 93.90 % Recall@100 at 32,768 dimensions. This makes it the first dense retrieval model to officially surpass the sparse BM25 baseline 93.6 %. Our findings show that the real problem in dense retrieval isn't the architecture, but the embedding layer itself. The solution isn't necessarily smarter training, but simply providing more room to breathe.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Tuning: Understanding and Designing Incentives for Empirical Human-AI Decision-Making Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI has revolutionised decision-making across various fields. Yet human judgement remains paramount for high-stakes decision-making. This has fueled explorations of collaborative decision-making between humans and AI systems, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. To explore this dynamic, researchers conduct empirical studies, investigating how humans use AI assistance for decision-making and how this collaboration impacts results. A critical aspect of conducting these studies is the role of participants, often recruited through crowdsourcing platforms. The validity of these studies hinges on the behaviours of the participants, hence effective incentives that can potentially affect these behaviours are a key part of designing and executing these studies. In this work, we aim to address the critical role of incentive design for conducting empirical human-AI decision-making studies, focusing on understanding, designing, and documenting incentive schemes. Through a thematic review of existing research, we explored the current practices, challenges, and opportunities associated with incentive design for human-AI decision-making empirical studies. We identified recurring patterns, or themes, such as what comprises the components of an incentive scheme, how incentive schemes are manipulated by researchers, and the impact they can have on research outcomes. Leveraging the acquired understanding, we curated a set of guidelines to aid researchers in designing effective incentive schemes for their studies, called the Incentive-Tuning Framework, outlining how researchers can undertake, reflect on, and document the incentive design process. By advocating for a standardised yet flexible approach to incentive design and contributing valuable insights along with practical tools, we hope to pave the way for more reliable and generalizable knowledge in the field of human-AI decision-making.</description>

      <title>Supporting Humans in Evaluating AI Summaries of Legal Depositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to summarize long documents, this trend poses significant challenges in the legal domain, where the factual accuracy of deposition summaries is crucial. Nugget-based methods have been shown to be extremely helpful for the automated evaluation of summarization approaches. In this work, we translate these methods to the user side and explore how nuggets could directly assist end users. Although prior systems have demonstrated the promise of nugget-based evaluation, its potential to support end users remains underexplored. Focusing on the legal domain, we present a prototype that leverages a factual nugget-based approach to support legal professionals in two concrete scenarios: (1) determining which of two summaries is better, and (2) manually improving an automatically generated summary.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Approaches and Functionalities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with the factual error during inference due to the lack of sufficient training data and the most updated knowledge, leading to the hallucination problem. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained attention as a promising solution to address the limitation of LLMs, by retrieving relevant information from external source to generate more accurate answers to the questions. Given the pervasive presence of structured knowledge in the external source, considerable strides in RAG have been made to employ the techniques related to graphs and achieve more complex reasoning based on the topological information between knowledge entities. However, there is currently neither unified review examining the diverse roles of graphs in RAG, nor a comprehensive resource to help researchers navigate and contribute to this evolving field. This survey offers a novel perspective on the functionality of graphs within RAG and their impact on enhancing performance across a wide range of graph-structured data. It provides a detailed breakdown of the roles that graphs play in RAG, covering database construction, algorithms, pipelines, and tasks. Finally, it identifies current challenges and outline future research directions, aiming to inspire further developments in this field. Our graph-centered analysis highlights the commonalities and differences in existing methods, setting the stage for future researchers in areas such as graph learning, database systems, and natural language processing.</description>

      <title>ThinkRec: Thinking-based recommendation via LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15091v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled more semantic-aware recommendations through natural language generation. Existing LLM for recommendation (LLM4Rec) methods mostly operate in a System 1-like manner, relying on superficial features to match similar items based on click history, rather than reasoning through deeper behavioral logic. This often leads to superficial and erroneous recommendations. Motivated by this, we propose ThinkRec, a thinking-based framework that shifts LLM4Rec from System 1 to System 2 (rational system). Technically, ThinkRec introduces a thinking activation mechanism that augments item metadata with keyword summarization and injects synthetic reasoning traces, guiding the model to form interpretable reasoning chains that consist of analyzing interaction histories, identifying user preferences, and making decisions based on target items. On top of this, we propose an instance-wise expert fusion mechanism to reduce the reasoning difficulty. By dynamically assigning weights to expert models based on users' latent features, ThinkRec adapts its reasoning path to individual users, thereby enhancing precision and personalization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ThinkRec significantly improves the accuracy and interpretability of recommendations. Our implementations are available at https://github.com/Yu-Qi-hang/ThinkRec.</description>

      <title>Next Point-of-interest (POI) Recommendation Model Based on Multi-modal Spatio-temporal Context Feature Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the next pickup location of individual users is a fundamental problem in intelligent mobility systems, which requires modeling personalized travel behaviors under complex spatiotemporal contexts. Existing methods mainly learn sequential dependencies from raw trajectories, but often fail to capture high-level behavioral semantics and to effectively disentangle long-term habitual preferences from short-term contextual intentions. In this paper, we propose a semantic embedding based dual stream spatiotemporal attention model for next pickup location prediction. Raw trajectories are first transformed into semantically enriched activity sequences to encode users' stay behaviors and movement semantics. A dual stream architecture is then designed to explicitly decouple long-term historical patterns and short-term dynamic intentions, where each stream employs spatiotemporal attention mechanisms to model dependencies at different temporal scales. To integrate heterogeneous contextual information, a context aware dynamic fusion module adaptively balances the contributions of the two streams. Finally, an attention based matching strategy is used to predict the probability distribution over candidate pickup locations. Experiments on real world ride hailing datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state of the art methods, validating the effectiveness of semantic trajectory abstraction and dual stream spatiotemporal attention for individualized mobility behavior modeling.</description>

      <title>QueStER: Query Specification for Generative keyword-based Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) differs from the traditional index-then-retrieve pipeline by storing relevance in model parameters and generating retrieval cues directly from the query, but it can be brittle out of domain and expensive to scale. We introduce QueStER (QUEry SpecificaTion for gEnerative Keyword-Based Retrieval), which bridges GR and query reformulation by learning to generate explicit keyword-based search specifications. Given a user query, a lightweight LLM produces a keyword query that is executed by a standard retriever (BM25), combining the generalization benefits of generative query rewriting with the efficiency and scalability of lexical indexing. We train the rewriting policy with reinforcement learning techniques. Across in- and out-of-domain evaluations, QueStER consistently improves over BM25 and is competitive with neural IR baselines, while maintaining strong efficiency.</description>

      <title>LLM Reasoning for Cold-Start Item Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.</description>

      <title>RMBRec: Robust Multi-Behavior Recommendation towards Target Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation faces a critical challenge in practice: auxiliary behaviors (e.g., clicks, carts) are often noisy, weakly correlated, or semantically misaligned with the target behavior (e.g., purchase), which leads to biased preference learning and suboptimal performance. While existing methods attempt to fuse these heterogeneous signals, they inherently lack a principled mechanism to ensure robustness against such behavioral inconsistency.
  In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Behavior Recommendation towards Target Behaviors (RMBRec), a robust multi-behavior recommendation framework grounded in an information-theoretic robustness principle. We interpret robustness as a joint process of maximizing predictive information while minimizing its variance across heterogeneous behavioral environments. Under this perspective, the Representation Robustness Module (RRM) enhances local semantic consistency by maximizing the mutual information between users' auxiliary and target representations, whereas the Optimization Robustness Module (ORM) enforces global stability by minimizing the variance of predictive risks across behaviors, which is an efficient approximation to invariant risk minimization. This local-global collaboration bridges representation purification and optimization invariance in a theoretically coherent way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RMBRec not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy but also maintains remarkable stability under various noise perturbations. For reproducibility, our code is available at https://github.com/miaomiao-cai2/RMBRec/.</description>

      <title>QKVQA: Question-Focused Filtering for Knowledge-based VQA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) aims to answer questions by integrating images with external knowledge. Effective knowledge filtering is crucial for improving accuracy. Typical filtering methods use similarity metrics to locate relevant article sections from one article, leading to information selection errors at the article and intra-article levels. Although recent explorations of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based filtering methods demonstrate superior semantic understanding and cross-article filtering capabilities, their high computational cost limits practical application. To address these issues, this paper proposes a question-focused filtering method. This approach can perform question-focused, cross-article filtering, efficiently obtaining high-quality filtered knowledge while keeping computational costs comparable to typical methods. Specifically, we design a trainable Question-Focused Filter (QFF) and a Chunk-based Dynamic Multi-Article Selection (CDA) module, which collectively alleviate information selection errors at both the article and intra-article levels. Experiments show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models by 4.9% on E-VQA and 3.8% on InfoSeek, validating its effectiveness. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/leaffeall/QKVQA.</description>

      <title>PankRAG: Enhancing Graph Retrieval via Globally Aware Query Resolution and Dependency-Aware Reranking Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent graph-based RAG approaches leverage knowledge graphs by extracting entities from a query to fetch their associated relationships and metadata. However, relying solely on entity extraction often results in the misinterpretation or omission of latent critical information and relationships. This can lead to the retrieval of irrelevant or contradictory content, as well as the exclusion of essential information, thereby increasing hallucination risks and undermining the quality of generated responses. In this paper, we propose PankRAG, a framework designed to capture and resolve the latent relationships within complex queries that prior methods overlook. It achieves this through a synergistic combination of a globally-aware hierarchical resolution pathway and a dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first generates a globally aware resolution pathway that captures parallel and progress relationships, guiding LLMs to resolve queries through a hierarchical reasoning path. Additionally, its dependency-aware reranking mechanism utilizes resolved sub-question dependencies to augment and validate the retrieved content of the current unresolved sub-question. Experimental results demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its generalizability.</description>

      <title>SAQ: Pushing the Limits of Vector Quantization through Code Adjustment and Dimension Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a critical role in applications such as search engines, recommender systems, and RAG for LLMs. Vector quantization (VQ), a crucial technique for ANNS, is commonly used to reduce space overhead and accelerate distance computations. However, despite significant research advances, state-of-the-art VQ methods still face challenges in balancing encoding efficiency and quantization accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VQ method called SAQ. To improve accuracy, SAQ employs a new dimension segmentation technique to strategically partition PCA-projected vectors into segments along their dimensions. By prioritizing leading dimension segments with larger magnitudes, SAQ allocates more bits to high-impact segments, optimizing the use of the available space quota. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize dimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error. To speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first quantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized vectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive enumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical methods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ, Extended RabitQ). SAQ achieves up to 80% reduction in quantization error and accelerates encoding speed by over 80x compared to Extended RabitQ.</description>

      <title>Pathways of Thoughts: Multi-Directional Thinking for Long-form Personalized Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalization is well studied in search and recommendation, but personalized question answering remains underexplored due to challenges in inferring preferences from long, noisy, implicit contexts and generating responses that are both accurate and aligned with user expectations. To address this, we propose Pathways of Thoughts (PoT), an inference-stage method that applies to any large language model (LLM) without task-specific fine-tuning. PoT models the thinking as an iterative decision process, where the model dynamically selects among cognitive operations such as reasoning, revision, personalization, and clarification. This enables exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories, producing diverse candidate responses that capture different perspectives. PoT then aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user preferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the complementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA benchmark show that PoT consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to a 10.8\% relative improvement. Human evaluation further validates these improvements, with annotators preferring PoT in 66\% of cases compared to the best-performing baseline and reporting ties in 15\% of cases.</description>
