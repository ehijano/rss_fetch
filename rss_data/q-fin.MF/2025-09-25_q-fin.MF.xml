      <title>Roughness Analysis of Realized Volatility and VIX through Randomized Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel distribution-based estimator for the Hurst parameter of log-volatility, leveraging the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to assess the scaling behavior of entire distributions rather than individual moments. To address the temporal dependence of financial volatility, we propose a random permutation procedure that effectively removes serial correlation while preserving marginal distributions, enabling the rigorous application of the KS framework to dependent data. We establish the asymptotic variance of the estimator, useful for inference and confidence interval construction. From a computational standpoint, we show that derivative-free optimization methods, particularly Brent's method and the Nelder-Mead simplex, achieve substantial efficiency gains relative to grid search while maintaining estimation accuracy. Empirical analysis of the CBOE VIX index and the 5-minute realized volatility of the S&amp;P 500 reveals a statistically significant hierarchy of roughness, with implied volatility smoother than realized volatility. Both measures, however, exhibit Hurst exponents well below one-half, reinforcing the rough volatility paradigm and highlighting the open challenge of disentangling local roughness from long-memory effects in fractional modeling.</description>

      <title>An Ambit Field Framework for the Full Panel of Day-ahead Electricity Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the often overlooked fact that electricity spot prices in individual European generation zones evolve as a high dimensional panel structure. A general continuous time framework is developed by formulating the panel as an ambit field indexed by a cylinder surface, where the cross sectional dimension is represented by a circle. This requires a treatment of ambit fields on manifolds, but the departure from Euclidean space allows for embedding intrinsic dependence structures into the index set in a flexible and parameter-free way, where the daily delivery periods have a canonical mapping onto the circle. The model is a natural space-time extension of volatility modulated L\'evy-driven Volterra processes, which have previously been studied in the context of energy markets, and the pricing of electricity derivatives turns out to be essentially as analytically tractable as in the null-spatial setting. The space-time framework extends the scope of possible derivatives to products written on individual delivery periods, where spreads between these constitute an interesting example. We establish useful formulas for the pricing of various derivatives along with a simulation scheme, and study specifications of the dependence structure in detail.</description>
