      <title>Proactive Detection and Calibration of Seasonal Advertisements with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A myriad of factors affect large scale ads delivery systems and influence both user experience and revenue. One such factor is proactive detection and calibration of seasonal advertisements to help with increasing conversion and user satisfaction. In this paper, we present Proactive Detection and Calibration of Seasonal Advertisements (PDCaSA), a research problem that is of interest for the ads ranking and recommendation community, both in the industrial setting as well as in research. Our paper provides detailed guidelines from various angles of this problem tested in, and motivated by a large-scale industrial ads ranking system. We share our findings including the clear statement of the problem and its motivation rooted in real-world systems, evaluation metrics, and sheds lights to the existing challenges, lessons learned, and best practices of data annotation and machine learning modeling to tackle this problem. Lastly, we present a conclusive solution we took during this research exploration: to detect seasonality, we leveraged Multimodal LLMs (MLMs) which on our in-house benchmark achieved 0.97 top F1 score. Based on our findings, we envision MLMs as a teacher for knowledge distillation, a machine labeler, and a part of the ensembled and tiered seasonality detection system, which can empower ads ranking systems with enriched seasonal information.</description>

      <title>FIRE: Fact-checking with Iterative Retrieval and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fact-checking long-form text is challenging, and it is therefore common practice to break it down into multiple atomic claims. The typical approach to fact-checking these atomic claims involves retrieving a fixed number of pieces of evidence, followed by a verification step. However, this method is usually not cost-effective, as it underutilizes the verification model's internal knowledge of the claim and fails to replicate the iterative reasoning process in human search strategies. To address these limitations, we propose FIRE, a novel agent-based framework that integrates evidence retrieval and claim verification in an iterative manner. Specifically, FIRE employs a unified mechanism to decide whether to provide a final answer or generate a subsequent search query, based on its confidence in the current judgment. We compare FIRE with other strong fact-checking frameworks and find that it achieves slightly better performance while reducing large language model (LLM) costs by an average of 7.6 times and search costs by 16.5 times. These results indicate that FIRE holds promise for application in large-scale fact-checking operations. Our code is available at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/fire.git.</description>

      <title>Interpret and Control Dense Retrieval with Sparse Latent Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense embeddings deliver strong retrieval performance but often lack interpretability and controllability. This paper introduces a novel approach using sparse autoencoders (SAE) to interpret and control dense embeddings via the learned latent sparse features. Our key contribution is the development of a retrieval-oriented contrastive loss, which ensures the sparse latent features remain effective for retrieval tasks and thus meaningful to interpret. Experimental results demonstrate that both the learned latent sparse features and their reconstructed embeddings retain nearly the same retrieval accuracy as the original dense vectors, affirming their faithfulness. Our further examination of the sparse latent space reveals interesting features underlying the dense embeddings and we can control the retrieval behaviors via manipulating the latent sparse features, for example, prioritizing documents from specific perspectives in the retrieval results.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Question Answering Precision with Optimized Vector Retrieval and Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question-answering (QA) is an important application of Information Retrieval (IR) and language models, and the latest trend is toward pre-trained large neural networks with embedding parameters. Augmenting QA performances with these LLMs requires intensive computational resources for fine-tuning. We propose an innovative approach to improve QA task performances by integrating optimized vector retrievals and instruction methodologies. Based on retrieval augmentation, the process involves document embedding, vector retrieval, and context construction for optimal QA results. We experiment with different combinations of text segmentation techniques and similarity functions, and analyze their impacts on QA performances. Results show that the model with a small chunk size of 100 without any overlap of the chunks achieves the best result and outperforms the models based on semantic segmentation using sentences. We discuss related QA examples and offer insight into how model performances are improved within the two-stage framework.</description>

      <title>LLM4PR: Improving Post-Ranking in Search Engine with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alongside the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a notable increase in efforts to integrate LLM techniques in information retrieval (IR) and search engines (SE). Recently, an additional post-ranking stage is suggested in SE to enhance user satisfaction in practical applications. Nevertheless, research dedicated to enhancing the post-ranking stage through LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel paradigm named Large Language Models for Post-Ranking in search engine (LLM4PR), which leverages the capabilities of LLMs to accomplish the post-ranking task in SE. Concretely, a Query-Instructed Adapter (QIA) module is designed to derive the user/item representation vectors by incorporating their heterogeneous features. A feature adaptation step is further introduced to align the semantics of user/item representations with the LLM. Finally, the LLM4PR integrates a learning to post-rank step, leveraging both a main task and an auxiliary task to fine-tune the model to adapt the post-ranking task. Experiment studies demonstrate that the proposed framework leads to significant improvements and exhibits state-of-the-art performance compared with other alternatives.</description>

      <title>Graph Cross-Correlated Network for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering (CF) models have demonstrated remarkable performance in recommender systems, which represent users and items as embedding vectors. Recently, due to the powerful modeling capability of graph neural networks for user-item interaction graphs, graph-based CF models have gained increasing attention. They encode each user/item and its subgraph into a single super vector by combining graph embeddings after each graph convolution. However, each hop of the neighbor in the user-item subgraphs carries a specific semantic meaning. Encoding all subgraph information into single vectors and inferring user-item relations with dot products can weaken the semantic information between user and item subgraphs, thus leaving untapped potential. Exploiting this untapped potential provides insight into improving performance for existing recommendation models. To this end, we propose the Graph Cross-correlated Network for Recommendation (GCR), which serves as a general recommendation paradigm that explicitly considers correlations between user/item subgraphs. GCR first introduces the Plain Graph Representation (PGR) to extract information directly from each hop of neighbors into corresponding PGR vectors. Then, GCR develops Cross-Correlated Aggregation (CCA) to construct possible cross-correlated terms between PGR vectors of user/item subgraphs. Finally, GCR comprehensively incorporates the cross-correlated terms for recommendations. Experimental results show that GCR outperforms state-of-the-art models on both interaction prediction and click-through rate prediction tasks.</description>

Abstract: This poster paper describes the ongoing research project for the creation of a use-case-driven Knowledge Graph resource tailored to the needs of teaching education in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). We gather resources related to KG courses from lectures offered by the Semantic Web community, with the help of the COST Action Distributed Knowledge Graphs and the interest group on KGs at The Alan Turing Institute. Our goal is to create a resource-focused KG with multiple interconnected semantic layers that interlink topics, courses, and materials with each lecturer. Our approach formulates a domain KG in teaching and relates it with multiple Personal KGs created for the lecturers.</description>

      <title>Online and Offline Evaluations of Collaborative Filtering and Content Based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are widely used AI applications designed to help users efficiently discover relevant items. The effectiveness of such systems is tied to the satisfaction of both users and providers. However, user satisfaction is complex and cannot be easily framed mathematically using information retrieval and accuracy metrics. While many studies evaluate accuracy through offline tests, a growing number of researchers argue that online evaluation methods such as A/B testing are better suited for this purpose. We have employed a variety of algorithms on different types of datasets divergent in size and subject, producing recommendations in various platforms, including media streaming services, digital publishing websites, e-commerce systems, and news broadcasting networks. Notably, our target websites and datasets are in Persian (Farsi) language.
  This study provides a comparative analysis of a large-scale recommender system that has been operating for the past year across about 70 websites in Iran, processing roughly 300 requests per second collectively. The system employs user-based and item-based recommendations using content-based, collaborative filtering, trend-based methods, and hybrid approaches. Through both offline and online evaluations, we aim to identify where these algorithms perform most efficiently and determine the best method for our specific needs, considering the dataset and system scale. Our methods of evaluation include manual evaluation, offline tests including accuracy and ranking metrics like hit-rate@k and nDCG, and online tests consisting of click-through rate (CTR). Additionally we analyzed and proposed methods to address cold-start and popularity bias.</description>

      <title>Combining Financial Data and News Articles for Stock Price Movement Prediction Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting financial markets and stock price movements requires analyzing a company's performance, historic price movements, industry-specific events alongside the influence of human factors such as social media and press coverage. We assume that financial reports (such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements), historical price data, and recent news articles can collectively represent aforementioned factors. We combine financial data in tabular format with textual news articles and employ pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict market movements. Recent research in LLMs has demonstrated that they are able to perform both tabular and text classification tasks, making them our primary model to classify the multi-modal data. We utilize retrieval augmentation techniques to retrieve and attach relevant chunks of news articles to financial metrics related to a company and prompt the LLMs in zero, two, and four-shot settings. Our dataset contains news articles collected from different sources, historic stock price, and financial report data for 20 companies with the highest trading volume across different industries in the stock market. We utilized recently released language models for our LLM-based classifier, including GPT- 3 and 4, and LLaMA- 2 and 3 models. We introduce an LLM-based classifier capable of performing classification tasks using combination of tabular (structured) and textual (unstructured) data. By using this model, we predicted the movement of a given stock's price in our dataset with a weighted F1-score of 58.5% and 59.1% and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.175 for both 3-month and 6-month periods.</description>

      <title>Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) systems excel at capturing users' dynamic preferences by leveraging their interaction histories. Most existing SR systems assign a single embedding vector to each item to represent its features, and various types of models are adopted to combine these item embeddings into a sequence representation vector to capture the user intent. However, we argue that this representation alone is insufficient to capture an item's multi-faceted nature (e.g., movie genres, starring actors). Besides, users often exhibit complex and varied preferences within these facets (e.g., liking both action and musical films in the facet of genre), which are challenging to fully represent. To address the issues above, we propose a novel structure called Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model for Sequential Recommendation (FAME). We leverage sub-embeddings from each head in the last multi-head attention layer to predict the next item separately. This approach captures the potential multi-faceted nature of items without increasing model complexity. A gating mechanism integrates recommendations from each head and dynamically determines their importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network in each attention head to disentangle various user preferences within each facet. Each expert within the MoE focuses on a specific preference. A learnable router network is adopted to compute the importance weight for each expert and aggregate them. We conduct extensive experiments on four public sequential recommendation datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing baseline models.</description>

      <title>LinRec: Linear Attention Mechanism for Long-term Sequential Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models have achieved remarkable success in sequential recommender systems (SRSs). However, computing the attention matrix in traditional dot-product attention mechanisms results in a quadratic complexity with sequence lengths, leading to high computational costs for long-term sequential recommendation. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel L2-Normalized Linear Attention for the Transformer-based Sequential Recommender Systems (LinRec), which theoretically improves efficiency while preserving the learning capabilities of the traditional dot-product attention. Specifically, by thoroughly examining the equivalence conditions of efficient attention mechanisms, we show that LinRec possesses linear complexity while preserving the property of attention mechanisms. In addition, we reveal its latent efficiency properties by interpreting the proposed LinRec mechanism through a statistical lens. Extensive experiments are conducted based on two public benchmark datasets, demonstrating that the combination of LinRec and Transformer models achieves comparable or even superior performance than state-of-the-art Transformer-based SRS models while significantly improving time and memory efficiency.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Robust Regularized Federated Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems play a pivotal role across practical scenarios, showcasing remarkable capabilities in user preference modeling. However, the centralized learning paradigm predominantly used raises serious privacy concerns. The federated recommender system (FedRS) addresses this by updating models on clients, while a central server orchestrates training without accessing private data. Existing FedRS approaches, however, face unresolved challenges, including non-convex optimization, vulnerability, potential privacy leakage risk, and communication inefficiency. This paper addresses these challenges by reformulating the federated recommendation problem as a convex optimization issue, ensuring convergence to the global optimum. Based on this, we devise a novel method, RFRec, to tackle this optimization problem efficiently. In addition, we propose RFRecF, a highly efficient version that incorporates non-uniform stochastic gradient descent to improve communication efficiency. In user preference modeling, both methods learn local and global models, collaboratively learning users' common and personalized interests under the federated learning setting. Moreover, both methods significantly enhance communication efficiency, robustness, and privacy protection, with theoretical support. Comprehensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate RFRec and RFRecF's superior performance compared to diverse baselines.</description>

      <title>Co-clustering for Federated Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As data privacy and security attract increasing attention, Federated Recommender System (FRS) offers a solution that strikes a balance between providing high-quality recommendations and preserving user privacy. However, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in FRS, commonly observed due to personalized decision-making patterns, can pose challenges. To address this issue and maximize the benefit of collaborative filtering (CF) in FRS, it is intuitive to consider clustering clients (users) as well as items into different groups and learning group-specific models. Existing methods either resort to client clustering via user representations-risking privacy leakage, or employ classical clustering strategies on item embeddings or gradients, which we found are plagued by the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we delve into the inefficiencies of the K-Means method in client grouping, attributing failures due to the high dimensionality as well as data sparsity occurring in FRS, and propose CoFedRec, a novel Co-clustering Federated Recommendation mechanism, to address clients heterogeneity and enhance the collaborative filtering within the federated framework. Specifically, the server initially formulates an item membership from the client-provided item networks. Subsequently, clients are grouped regarding a specific item category picked from the item membership during each communication round, resulting in an intelligently aggregated group model. Meanwhile, to comprehensively capture the global inter-relationships among items, we incorporate an additional supervised contrastive learning term based on the server-side generated item membership into the local training phase for each client. Extensive experiments on four datasets are provided, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed CoFedRec.</description>

      <title>Transferable Sequential Recommendation via Vector Quantized Meta Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While sequential recommendation achieves significant progress on capturing user-item transition patterns, transferring such large-scale recommender systems remains challenging due to the disjoint user and item groups across domains. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized meta learning for transferable sequential recommenders (MetaRec). Without requiring additional modalities or shared information across domains, our approach leverages user-item interactions from multiple source domains to improve the target domain performance. To solve the input heterogeneity issue, we adopt vector quantization that maps item embeddings from heterogeneous input spaces to a shared feature space. Moreover, our meta transfer paradigm exploits limited target data to guide the transfer of source domain knowledge to the target domain (i.e., learn to transfer). In addition, MetaRec adaptively transfers from multiple source tasks by rescaling meta gradients based on the source-target domain similarity, enabling selective learning to improve recommendation performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, where MetaRec consistently outperforms baseline methods by a considerable margin.</description>

      <title>Dissertation: On the Theoretical Foundation of Model Comparison and Evaluation for Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems have become increasingly important with the rise of the web as a medium for electronic and business transactions. One of the key drivers of this technology is the ease with which users can provide feedback about their likes and dislikes through simple clicks of a mouse. This feedback is commonly collected in the form of ratings, but can also be inferred from a user's browsing and purchasing history. Recommender systems utilize users' historical data to infer customer interests and provide personalized recommendations. The basic principle of recommendations is that significant dependencies exist between user- and item-centric activity, which can be learned in a data-driven manner to make accurate predictions. Collaborative filtering is one family of recommendation algorithms that uses ratings from multiple users to predict missing ratings or uses binary click information to predict potential clicks. However, recommender systems can be more complex and incorporate auxiliary data such as content-based attributes, user interactions, and contextual information.</description>

      <title>Enhancing ID-based Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant attention in various domains, including recommendation systems. Recent research leverages the capabilities of LLMs to improve the performance and user modeling aspects of recommender systems. These studies primarily focus on utilizing LLMs to interpret textual data in recommendation tasks. However, it's worth noting that in ID-based recommendations, textual data is absent, and only ID data is available. The untapped potential of LLMs for ID data within the ID-based recommendation paradigm remains relatively unexplored. To this end, we introduce a pioneering approach called "LLM for ID-based Recommendation" (LLM4IDRec). This innovative approach integrates the capabilities of LLMs while exclusively relying on ID data, thus diverging from the previous reliance on textual data. The basic idea of LLM4IDRec is that by employing LLM to augment ID data, if augmented ID data can improve recommendation performance, it demonstrates the ability of LLM to interpret ID data effectively, exploring an innovative way for the integration of LLM in ID-based recommendation. We evaluate the effectiveness of our LLM4IDRec approach using three widely-used datasets. Our results demonstrate a notable improvement in recommendation performance, with our approach consistently outperforming existing methods in ID-based recommendation by solely augmenting input data.</description>

      <title>Training on the Test Model: Contamination in Ranking Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural approaches to ranking based on pre-trained language models are highly effective in ad-hoc search. However, the computational expense of these models can limit their application. As such, a process known as knowledge distillation is frequently applied to allow a smaller, efficient model to learn from an effective but expensive model. A key example of this is the distillation of expensive API-based commercial Large Language Models into smaller production-ready models. However, due to the opacity of training data and processes of most commercial models, one cannot ensure that a chosen test collection has not been observed previously, creating the potential for inadvertent data contamination. We, therefore, investigate the effect of a contaminated teacher model in a distillation setting. We evaluate several distillation techniques to assess the degree to which contamination occurs during distillation. By simulating a ``worst-case'' setting where the degree of contamination is known, we find that contamination occurs even when the test data represents a small fraction of the teacher's training samples. We, therefore, encourage caution when training using black-box teacher models where data provenance is ambiguous.</description>

      <title>KeyInst: Keyword Instruction for Improving SQL Formulation in Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL parsing involves the translation of natural language queries (NLQs) into their corresponding SQL commands. A principal challenge within this domain is the formulation of SQL queries that are not only syntactically correct but also semantically aligned with the natural language input. However, the intrinsic disparity between the NLQ and the SQL poses a significant challenge. In this research, we introduce Keyword Instruction (KeyInst), a novel method designed to enhance SQL formulation by Large Language Models (LLMs). KeyInst essentially provides guidance on pivotal SQL keywords likely to be part of the final query, thus facilitates a smoother SQL query formulation process. We explore two strategies for integrating KeyInst into Text-to-SQL parsing: a pipeline strategy and a single-pass strategy. The former first generates KeyInst for question, which are then used to prompt LLMs. The latter employs a fine-tuned model to concurrently generate KeyInst and SQL in one step. We developed StrucQL, a benchmark specifically designed for the evaluation of SQL formulation. Extensive experiments on StrucQL and other benchmarks demonstrate that KeyInst significantly improves upon the existing Text-to-SQL prompting techniques.</description>

      <title>Music Foundation Model as Generic Booster for Music Downstream Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the efficacy of using intermediate representations from a single foundation model to enhance various music downstream tasks. We introduce SoniDo , a music foundation model (MFM) designed to extract hierarchical features from target music samples. By leveraging hierarchical intermediate features, SoniDo constrains the information granularity, leading to improved performance across various downstream tasks including both understanding and generative tasks. We specifically evaluated this approach on representative tasks such as music tagging, music transcription, music source separation, and music mixing. Our results reveal that the features extracted from foundation models provide valuable enhancements in training downstream task models. This highlights the capability of using features extracted from music foundation models as a booster for downstream tasks. Our approach not only benefits existing task-specific models but also supports music downstream tasks constrained by data scarcity. This paves the way for more effective and accessible music processing solutions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Hypergraph Contrastive Learning for Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rating is a typical user explicit feedback that visually reflects how much a user likes a related item. The (rating) matrix completion is essentially a rating prediction process, which is also a significant problem in recommender systems. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in matrix completion, which captures users' preferences over items by formulating a rating matrix as a bipartite graph. However, existing methods are susceptible due to data sparsity and long-tail distribution in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the messaging mechanism of GNNs makes it difficult to capture high-order correlations and constraints between nodes, which are essentially useful in recommendation tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Multi-Channel Hypergraph Contrastive Learning framework for matrix completion, named MHCL. Specifically, MHCL adaptively learns hypergraph structures to capture high-order correlations between nodes and jointly captures local and global collaborative relationships through attention-based cross-view aggregation. Additionally, to consider the magnitude and order information of ratings, we treat different rating subgraphs as different channels, encourage alignment between adjacent ratings, and further achieve the mutual enhancement between different ratings through multi-channel cross-rating contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Graph Neural Network for Recommendation with Dynamic De-redundancy and Modality-Guided Feature De-noisy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become crucial in multimodal recommendation tasks because of their powerful ability to capture complex relationships between neighboring nodes. However, increasing the number of propagation layers in GNNs can lead to feature redundancy, which may negatively impact the overall recommendation performance. In addition, the existing recommendation task method directly maps the preprocessed multimodal features to the low-dimensional space, which will bring the noise unrelated to user preference, thus affecting the representation ability of the model. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose Multimodal Graph Neural Network for Recommendation (MGNM) with Dynamic De-redundancy and Modality-Guided Feature De-noisy, which is divided into local and global interaction. Initially, in the local interaction process,we integrate a dynamic de-redundancy (DDR) loss function which is achieved by utilizing the product of the feature coefficient matrix and the feature matrix as a penalization factor. It reduces the feature redundancy effects of multimodal and behavioral features caused by the stacking of multiple GNN layers. Subsequently, in the global interaction process, we developed modality-guided global feature purifiers for each modality to alleviate the impact of modality noise. It is a two-fold guiding mechanism eliminating modality features that are irrelevant to user preferences and captures complex relationships within the modality. Experimental results demonstrate that MGNM achieves superior performance on multimodal information denoising and removal of redundant information compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Communication Avoidance for Recommendation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the major bottlenecks for efficient deployment of neural network based recommendation systems is the memory footprint of their embedding tables. Although many neural network based recommendation systems could benefit from the faster on-chip memory access and increased computational power of hardware accelerators, the large embedding tables in these models often cannot fit on the constrained memory of accelerators. Despite the pervasiveness of these models, prior methods in memory optimization and parallelism fail to address the memory and communication costs of large embedding tables on accelerators. As a result, the majority of models are trained on CPUs, while current implementations of accelerators are hindered by issues such as bottlenecks in inter-device communication and main memory lookups. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that analyses the communication costs of arbitrary distributed systems that use lookup tables. We use this framework to propose algorithms that maximize throughput subject to memory, computation, and communication constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method achieves strong theoretical performance across dataset distributions and memory constraints, applicable to a wide range of use cases from mobile federated learning to warehouse-scale computation. We implement our framework and algorithms in PyTorch and achieve up to 6x increases in training throughput on GPU systems over baselines, on the Criteo Terabytes dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has significantly transformed both the construction and application of information retrieval (IR) systems. However, current interactions between IR systems and LLMs remain limited, with LLMs merely serving as part of components within IR systems, and IR systems being constructed independently of LLMs. This separated architecture restricts knowledge sharing and deep collaboration between them. In this paper, we introduce Self-Retrieval, a novel end-to-end LLM-driven information retrieval architecture. Self-Retrieval unifies all essential IR functions within a single LLM, leveraging the inherent capabilities of LLMs throughout the IR process. Specifically, Self-Retrieval internalizes the retrieval corpus through self-supervised learning, transforms the retrieval process into sequential passage generation, and performs relevance assessment for reranking. Experimental results demonstrate that Self-Retrieval not only outperforms existing retrieval approaches by a significant margin, but also substantially enhances the performance of LLM-driven downstream applications like retrieval-augmented generation.</description>

      <title>Two-stage Conformal Risk Control with Application to Ranked Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many practical machine learning systems, such as ranking and recommendation systems, consist of two concatenated stages: retrieval and ranking. These systems present significant challenges in accurately assessing and managing the uncertainty inherent in their predictions. To address these challenges, we extend the recently developed framework of conformal risk control, originally designed for single-stage problems, to accommodate the more complex two-stage setup. We first demonstrate that a straightforward application of conformal risk control, treating each stage independently, may fail to maintain risk at their pre-specified levels. Therefore, we propose an integrated approach that considers both stages simultaneously, devising algorithms to control the risk of each stage by jointly identifying thresholds for both stages. Our algorithm further optimizes for a weighted combination of prediction set sizes across all feasible thresholds, resulting in more effective prediction sets. Finally, we apply the proposed method to the critical task of two-stage ranked retrieval. We validate the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets, MSLR-WEB and MS MARCO, commonly used for ranked retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Improving Adversarial Collaborative Filtering for Robust Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial Collaborative Filtering (ACF), which typically applies adversarial perturbations at user and item embeddings through adversarial training, is widely recognized as an effective strategy for enhancing the robustness of Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems against poisoning attacks. Besides, numerous studies have empirically shown that ACF can also improve recommendation performance compared to traditional CF. Despite these empirical successes, the theoretical understanding of ACF's effectiveness in terms of both performance and robustness remains unclear. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we first theoretically show that ACF can achieve a lower recommendation error compared to traditional CF with the same training epochs in both clean and poisoned data contexts. Furthermore, by establishing bounds for reductions in recommendation error during ACF's optimization process, we find that applying personalized magnitudes of perturbation for different users based on their embedding scales can further improve ACF's effectiveness. Building on these theoretical understandings, we propose Personalized Magnitude Adversarial Collaborative Filtering (PamaCF). Extensive experiments demonstrate that PamaCF effectively defends against various types of poisoning attacks while significantly enhancing recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Scaling Collaborative Filtering Optimization from the Perspective of Matrix Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods dominate real-world recommender systems given their ability to learn high-quality, sparse ID-embedding tables that effectively capture user preferences. These tables scale linearly with the number of users and items, and are trained to ensure high similarity between embeddings of interacted user-item pairs, while maintaining low similarity for non-interacted pairs. Despite their high performance, encouraging dispersion for non-interacted pairs necessitates expensive regularization (e.g., negative sampling), hurting runtime and scalability. Existing research tends to address these challenges by simplifying the learning process, either by reducing model complexity or sampling data, trading performance for runtime. In this work, we move beyond model-level modifications and study the properties of the embedding tables under different learning strategies. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the singular values of the embedding tables are intrinsically linked to different CF loss functions. These findings are empirically validated on real-world datasets, demonstrating the practical benefits of higher stable rank, a continuous version of matrix rank which encodes the distribution of singular values. Based on these insights, we propose an efficient warm-start strategy that regularizes the stable rank of the user and item embeddings. We show that stable rank regularization during early training phases can promote higher-quality embeddings, resulting in training speed improvements of up to 66%. Additionally, stable rank regularization can act as a proxy for negative sampling, allowing for performance gains of up to 21% over loss functions with small negative sampling ratios. Overall, our analysis unifies current CF methods under a new perspective, their optimization of stable rank, motivating a flexible regularization method.</description>

Abstract: Assessing classification confidence is critical for leveraging large language models (LLMs) in automated labeling tasks, especially in the sensitive domains presented by Computational Social Science (CSS) tasks. In this paper, we make three key contributions: (1) we propose an uncertainty quantification (UQ) performance measure tailored for data annotation tasks, (2) we compare, for the first time, five different UQ strategies across three distinct LLMs and CSS data annotation tasks, (3) we introduce a novel UQ aggregation strategy that effectively identifies low-confidence LLM annotations and disproportionately uncovers data incorrectly labeled by the LLMs. Our results demonstrate that our proposed UQ aggregation strategy improves upon existing methods andcan be used to significantly improve human-in-the-loop data annotation processes.</description>

      <title>Little Giants: Synthesizing High-Quality Embedding Data at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation has become an increasingly popular way of training models without the need for large, manually labeled datasets. For tasks like text embedding, synthetic data offers diverse and scalable training examples, significantly reducing the cost of human annotation. However, most current approaches rely heavily on proprietary models like GPT-4, which are expensive and inefficient for generating large-scale embedding data. In this paper, we introduce SPEED, a framework that aligns open-source small models (8B) to efficiently generate large-scale synthetic embedding data. Through supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, and self-improvement, SPEED enables small open-source models to produce high-quality data. Remarkably, SPEED uses only less than 1/10 of the GPT API calls, outperforming the state-of-the-art embedding model E5_mistral when both are trained solely on their synthetic data. Using this efficient generator, we conduct a comprehensive study on how various factors within the alignment pipeline impact data quality and reveal the scaling law for synthetic embedding data.</description>
