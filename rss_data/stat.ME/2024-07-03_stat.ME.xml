      <title>Generalized Ridge Regression: Biased Estimation for Multiple Linear Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the regressors of a econometric linear model are nonorthogonal, it is well known that their estimation by ordinary least squares can present various problems that discourage the use of this model. The ridge regression is the most commonly used alternative; however, its generalized version has hardly been analyzed. The present work addresses the estimation of this generalized version, as well as the calculation of its mean squared error, goodness of fit and bootstrap inference.</description>

      <title>When Do Natural Mediation Effects Differ from Their Randomized Interventional Analogues: Test and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In causal mediation analysis, the natural direct and indirect effects (natural effects) are nonparametrically unidentifiable in the presence of treatment-induced confounding, which motivated the development of randomized interventional analogues (RIAs) of the natural effects. The RIAs are easier to identify and widely used in practice. Applied researchers often interpret RIA estimates as if they were the natural effects, even though the RIAs could be poor proxies for the natural effects. This calls for practical and theoretical guidance on when the RIAs differ from or coincide with the natural effects, which this paper aims to address. We develop a novel empirical test for the divergence between the RIAs and the natural effects under the weak assumptions sufficient for identifying the RIAs and illustrate the test using the Moving to Opportunity Study. We also provide new theoretical insights on the relationship between the RIAs and the natural effects from a covariance perspective and a structural equation perspective. Additionally, we discuss previously undocumented connections between the natural effects, the RIAs, and estimands in instrumental variable analysis and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests.</description>

      <title>Covariate-dependent hierarchical Dirichlet process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricacies inherent in contemporary real datasets demand more advanced statistical models to effectively address complex challenges. In this article we delve into problems related to identifying clusters across related groups, when additional covariate information is available. We formulate a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach based on mixture models, integrating ideas from the hierarchical Dirichlet process and "single-atoms" dependent Dirichlet process. The proposed method exhibits exceptional generality and flexibility, accommodating both continuous and discrete covariates through the utilization of appropriate kernel functions. We construct a robust and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm involving data augmentation to tackle the intractable normalized weights. The versatility of the proposed model extends our capability to discern the relationship between covariates and clusters. Through testing on both simulated and real-world datasets, our model demonstrates its capacity to identify meaningful clusters across groups, providing valuable insights for a spectrum of applications.</description>

      <title>A dimension reduction approach to edge weight estimation for use in spatial models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models for areal data are traditionally defined using the neighborhood structure of the regions on which data are observed. The unweighted adjacency matrix of a graph is commonly used to characterize the relationships between locations, resulting in the implicit assumption that all pairs of neighboring regions interact similarly, an assumption which may not be true in practice. It has been shown that more complex spatial relationships between graph nodes may be represented when edge weights are allowed to vary. Christensen and Hoff (2023) introduced a covariance model for data observed on graphs which is more flexible than traditional alternatives, parameterizing covariance as a function of an unknown edge weights matrix. A potential issue with their approach is that each edge weight is treated as a unique parameter, resulting in increasingly challenging parameter estimation as graph size increases. Within this article we propose a framework for estimating edge weight matrices that reduces their effective dimension via a basis function representation of of the edge weights. We show that this method may be used to enhance the performance and flexibility of covariance models parameterized by such matrices in a series of illustrations, simulations and data examples.</description>

      <title>Instrumental Variable methods to target Hypothetical Estimands with longitudinal repeated measures data: Application to the STEP 1 trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The STEP 1 randomized trial evaluated the effect of taking semaglutide vs placebo on body weight over a 68 week duration. As with any study evaluating an intervention delivered over a sustained period, non-adherence was observed. This was addressed in the original trial analysis within the Estimand Framework by viewing non-adherence as an intercurrent event. The primary analysis applied a treatment policy strategy which viewed it as an aspect of the treatment regimen, and thus made no adjustment for its presence. A supplementary analysis used a hypothetical strategy, targeting an estimand that would have been realised had all participants adhered, under the assumption that no post-baseline variables confounded adherence and change in body weight. In this paper we propose an alternative Instrumental Variable method to adjust for non-adherence which does not rely on the same `unconfoundedness' assumption and is less vulnerable to positivity violations (e.g., it can give valid results even under conditions where non-adherence is guaranteed). Unlike many previous Instrumental Variable approaches, it makes full use of the repeatedly measured outcome data, and allows for a time-varying effect of treatment adherence on a participant's weight. We show that it provides a natural vehicle for defining two distinct hypothetical estimands: the treatment effect if all participants would have adhered to semaglutide, and the treatment effect if all participants would have adhered to both semaglutide and placebo. When applied to the STEP 1 study, they both suggest a sustained, slowly decaying weight loss effect of semaglutide treatment.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Inference for Partially Observed Markov Processes using Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) has driven recent advances in machine learning, including deep neural networks and Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Partially observed nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems have proved resistant to AD techniques because widely used particle filter algorithms yield an estimated likelihood function that is discontinuous as a function of the model parameters. We show how to embed two existing AD particle filter methods in a theoretical framework that provides an extension to a new class of algorithms. This new class permits a bias/variance tradeoff and hence a mean squared error substantially lower than the existing algorithms. We develop likelihood maximization algorithms suited to the Monte Carlo properties of the AD gradient estimate. Our algorithms require only a differentiable simulator for the latent dynamic system; by contrast, most previous approaches to AD likelihood maximization for particle filters require access to the system's transition probabilities. Numerical results indicate that a hybrid algorithm that uses AD to refine a coarse solution from an iterated filtering algorithm show substantial improvement on current state-of-the-art methods for a challenging scientific benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>Tail calibration of probabilistic forecasts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic forecasts comprehensively describe the uncertainty in the unknown future outcome, making them essential for decision making and risk management. While several methods have been introduced to evaluate probabilistic forecasts, existing evaluation techniques are ill-suited to the evaluation of tail properties of such forecasts. However, these tail properties are often of particular interest to forecast users due to the severe impacts caused by extreme outcomes. In this work, we introduce a general notion of tail calibration for probabilistic forecasts, which allows forecasters to assess the reliability of their predictions for extreme outcomes. We study the relationships between tail calibration and standard notions of forecast calibration, and discuss connections to peaks-over-threshold models in extreme value theory. Diagnostic tools are introduced and applied in a case study on European precipitation forecasts</description>

Abstract: Pattern classification in electroencephalography (EEG) signals is an important problem in biomedical engineering since it enables the detection of brain activity, particularly the early detection of epileptic seizures. In this paper, we propose a k-nearest neighbors classification for epileptic EEG signals based on a t-location-scale statistical representation to detect spike-and-waves. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a real dataset containing both spike-and-wave events and normal brain function signals, where our performance is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Hierarchical Industrial Demand Time-Series Forecasting incorporating Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical time-series forecasting (HTSF) is an important problem for many real-world business applications where the goal is to simultaneously forecast multiple time-series that are related to each other via a hierarchical relation. Recent works, however, do not address two important challenges that are typically observed in many demand forecasting applications at large companies. First, many time-series at lower levels of the hierarchy have high sparsity i.e., they have a significant number of zeros. Most HTSF methods do not address this varying sparsity across the hierarchy. Further, they do not scale well to the large size of the real-world hierarchy typically unseen in benchmarks used in literature. We resolve both these challenges by proposing HAILS, a novel probabilistic hierarchical model that enables accurate and calibrated probabilistic forecasts across the hierarchy by adaptively modeling sparse and dense time-series with different distributional assumptions and reconciling them to adhere to hierarchical constraints. We show the scalability and effectiveness of our methods by evaluating them against real-world demand forecasting datasets. We deploy HAILS at a large chemical manufacturing company for a product demand forecasting application with over ten thousand products and observe a significant 8.5\% improvement in forecast accuracy and 23% better improvement for sparse time-series. The enhanced accuracy and scalability make HAILS a valuable tool for improved business planning and customer experience.</description>

      <title>Practical Guide for Causal Pathways and Sub-group Disparity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the application of causal disparity analysis to unveil intricate relationships and causal pathways between sensitive attributes and the targeted outcomes within real-world observational data. Our methodology involves employing causal decomposition analysis to quantify and examine the causal interplay between sensitive attributes and outcomes. We also emphasize the significance of integrating heterogeneity assessment in causal disparity analysis to gain deeper insights into the impact of sensitive attributes within specific sub-groups on outcomes. Our two-step investigation focuses on datasets where race serves as the sensitive attribute. The results on two datasets indicate the benefit of leveraging causal analysis and heterogeneity assessment not only for quantifying biases in the data but also for disentangling their influences on outcomes. We demonstrate that the sub-groups identified by our approach to be affected the most by disparities are the ones with the largest ML classification errors. We also show that grouping the data only based on a sensitive attribute is not enough, and through these analyses, we can find sub-groups that are directly affected by disparities. We hope that our findings will encourage the adoption of such methodologies in future ethical AI practices and bias audits, fostering a more equitable and fair technological landscape.</description>

      <title>Is Cross-Validation the Gold Standard to Evaluate Model Performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-Validation (CV) is the default choice for evaluating the performance of machine learning models. Despite its wide usage, their statistical benefits have remained half-understood, especially in challenging nonparametric regimes. In this paper we fill in this gap and show that in fact, for a wide spectrum of models, CV does not statistically outperform the simple "plug-in" approach where one reuses training data for testing evaluation. Specifically, in terms of both the asymptotic bias and coverage accuracy of the associated interval for out-of-sample evaluation, $K$-fold CV provably cannot outperform plug-in regardless of the rate at which the parametric or nonparametric models converge. Leave-one-out CV can have a smaller bias as compared to plug-in; however, this bias improvement is negligible compared to the variability of the evaluation, and in some important cases leave-one-out again does not outperform plug-in once this variability is taken into account. We obtain our theoretical comparisons via a novel higher-order Taylor analysis that allows us to derive necessary conditions for limit theorems of testing evaluations, which applies to model classes that are not amenable to previously known sufficient conditions. Our numerical results demonstrate that plug-in performs indeed no worse than CV across a wide range of examples.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction for Causal Effects of Continuous Treatments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of causal effects is crucial for safety-critical applications such as personalized medicine. A powerful approach for this is conformal prediction, which has several practical benefits due to model-agnostic finite-sample guarantees. Yet, existing methods for conformal prediction of causal effects are limited to binary/discrete treatments and make highly restrictive assumptions such as known propensity scores. In this work, we provide a novel conformal prediction method for potential outcomes of continuous treatments. We account for the additional uncertainty introduced through propensity estimation so that our conformal prediction intervals are valid even if the propensity score is unknown. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We derive finite-sample prediction intervals for potential outcomes of continuous treatments. (2) We provide an algorithm for calculating the derived intervals. (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of the conformal prediction intervals in experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose conformal prediction for continuous treatments when the propensity score is unknown and must be estimated from data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.00729v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical network analysis, we often assume either the full network is available or multiple subgraphs can be sampled to estimate various global properties of the network. However, in a real social network, people frequently make decisions based on their local view of the network alone. Here, we consider a partial information framework that characterizes the local network centered at a given individual by path length $L$ and gives rise to a partial adjacency matrix. Under $L=2$, we focus on the problem of (global) community detection using the popular stochastic block model (SBM) and its degree-corrected variant (DCSBM). We derive theoretical properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the signal term of the partial adjacency matrix and propose new spectral-based community detection algorithms that achieve consistency under appropriate conditions. Our analysis also allows us to propose a new centrality measure that assesses the importance of an individual's partial information in determining global community structure. Using simulated and real networks, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare our centrality measure with other popular alternatives to show it captures unique nodal information. Our results illustrate that the partial information framework enables us to compare the viewpoints of different individuals regarding the global structure.</description>

      <title>Optimized variance estimation under interference and complex experimental designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.01709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unbiased and consistent variance estimators generally do not exist for design-based treatment effect estimators because experimenters never observe more than one potential outcome for any unit. The problem is exacerbated by interference and complex experimental designs. Experimenters must accept conservative variance estimators in these settings, but they can strive to minimize conservativeness. In this paper, we show that the task of constructing a minimally conservative variance estimator can be interpreted as an optimization problem that aims to find the lowest estimable upper bound of the true variance given the experimenter's risk preference and knowledge of the potential outcomes. We characterize the set of admissible bounds in the class of quadratic forms, and we demonstrate that the optimization problem is a convex program for many natural objectives. The resulting variance estimators are guaranteed to be conservative regardless of whether the background knowledge used to construct the bound is correct, but the estimators are less conservative if the provided information is reasonably accurate. Numerical results show that the resulting variance estimators can be considerably less conservative than existing estimators, allowing experimenters to draw more informative inferences about treatment effects.</description>

      <title>A flexible and interpretable spatial covariance model for data on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial models for areal data are often constructed such that all pairs of adjacent regions are assumed to have near-identical spatial autocorrelation. In practice, data can exhibit dependence structures more complicated than can be represented under this assumption. In this article we develop a new model for spatially correlated data observed on graphs, which can flexibly represented many types of spatial dependence patterns while retaining aspects of the original graph geometry. Our method implies an embedding of the graph into Euclidean space wherein covariance can be modeled using traditional covariance functions, such as those from the Mat\'{e}rn family. We parameterize our model using a class of graph metrics compatible with such covariance functions, and which characterize distance in terms of network flow, a property useful for understanding proximity in many ecological settings. By estimating the parameters underlying these metrics, we recover the "intrinsic distances" between graph nodes, which assist in the interpretation of the estimated covariance and allow us to better understand the relationship between the observed process and spatial domain. We compare our model to existing methods for spatially dependent graph data, primarily conditional autoregressive models and their variants, and illustrate advantages of our method over traditional approaches. We fit our model to bird abundance data for several species in North Carolina, and show how it provides insight into the interactions between species-specific spatial distributions and geography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02335v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The R package polle is a unifying framework for learning and evaluating finite stage policies based on observational data. The package implements a collection of existing and novel methods for causal policy learning including doubly robust restricted Q-learning, policy tree learning, and outcome weighted learning. The package deals with (near) positivity violations by only considering realistic policies. Highly flexible machine learning methods can be used to estimate the nuisance components and valid inference for the policy value is ensured via cross-fitting. The library is built up around a simple syntax with four main functions policy_data(), policy_def(), policy_learn(), and policy_eval() used to specify the data structure, define user-specified policies, specify policy learning methods and evaluate (learned) policies. The functionality of the package is illustrated via extensive reproducible examples.</description>

      <title>Spatial modeling of extremes and an angular component</title>

Abstract: Many environmental processes such as rainfall, wind or snowfall are inherently spatial and the modelling of extremes has to take into account that feature. In addition, environmental processes are often attached with an angle, e.g., wind speed and direction or extreme snowfall and time of occurrence in year. This article proposes a Bayesian hierarchical model with a conditional independence assumption that aims at modelling simultaneously spatial extremes and an angular component. The proposed model relies on the extreme value theory as well as recent developments for handling directional statistics over a continuous domain. Working within a Bayesian setting, a Gibbs sampler is introduced whose performances are analysed through a simulation study. The paper ends with an application on extreme wind speed in France. Results show that extreme wind events in France are mainly coming from West apart from the Mediterranean part of France and the Alps.</description>

      <title>Automated threshold selection and associated inference uncertainty for univariate extremes</title>

Abstract: Threshold selection is a fundamental problem in any threshold-based extreme value analysis. While models are asymptotically motivated, selecting an appropriate threshold for finite samples is difficult and highly subjective through standard methods. Inference for high quantiles can also be highly sensitive to the choice of threshold. Too low a threshold choice leads to bias in the fit of the extreme value model, while too high a choice leads to unnecessary additional uncertainty in the estimation of model parameters. We develop a novel methodology for automated threshold selection that directly tackles this bias-variance trade-off. We also develop a method to account for the uncertainty in the threshold estimation and propagate this uncertainty through to high quantile inference. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for threshold selection and subsequent extreme quantile estimation, relative to the leading existing methods, and show how the method's effectiveness is not sensitive to the tuning parameters. We apply our method to the well-known, troublesome example of the River Nidd dataset.</description>

      <title>Full Law Identification under Missing Data with Categorical Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Missing data may be disastrous for the identifiability of causal and statistical estimands. In graphical missing data models, colluders are dependence structures that have a special importance for identification considerations. It has been shown that the presence of a colluder makes the full law, i.e., the joint distribution of variables and response indicators, non-parametrically non-identifiable. However, when the variables related to the colluder structure are categorical, it is sometimes possible to regain the identifiability of the full law. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for the identification of the full law in the presence of colluder structures with arbitrary categorical variables. Maximum likelihood estimation of the full law in identifiable models with categorical variables is demonstrated with simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Multiply-Robust Causal Change Attribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comparing two samples of data, we observe a change in the distribution of an outcome variable. In the presence of multiple explanatory variables, how much of the change can be explained by each possible cause? We develop a new estimation strategy that, given a causal model, combines regression and re-weighting methods to quantify the contribution of each causal mechanism. Our proposed methodology is multiply robust, meaning that it still recovers the target parameter under partial misspecification. We prove that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, it can be incorporated into existing frameworks for causal attribution, such as Shapley values, which will inherit the consistency and large-sample distribution properties. Our method demonstrates excellent performance in Monte Carlo simulations, and we show its usefulness in an empirical application. Our method is implemented as part of the Python library DoWhy (arXiv:2011.04216, arXiv:2206.06821).</description>

Abstract: Bayesian and frequentist criteria fundamentally differ, but often posterior and sampling distributions agree asymptotically (e.g., Gaussian with same covariance). For the corresponding single-draw experiment, we characterize the frequentist size of a certain Bayesian hypothesis test of (possibly nonlinear) inequalities. If the null hypothesis is that the (possibly infinite-dimensional) parameter lies in a certain half-space, then the Bayesian test's size is $\alpha$; if the null hypothesis is a subset of a half-space, then size is above $\alpha$; and in other cases, size may be above, below, or equal to $\alpha$. Rejection probabilities at certain points in the parameter space are also characterized. Two examples illustrate our results: translog cost function curvature and ordinal distribution relationships.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the Spectral Measure from ConvexCombinations of Regularly Varying RandomVectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.03832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extremal dependence structure of a regularly varying random vector Xis fully described by its limiting spectral measure. In this paper, we investigate how torecover characteristics of the measure, such as extremal coefficients, from the extremalbehaviour of convex combinations of components of X. Our considerations result in aclass of new estimators of moments of the corresponding combinations for the spectralvector. We show asymptotic normality by means of a functional limit theorem and, focusingon the estimation of extremal coefficients, we verify that the minimal asymptoticvariance can be achieved by a plug-in estimator using subsampling bootstrap. We illustratethe benefits of our approach on simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Estimating Lagged (Cross-)Covariance Operators of $L^p$-$m$-approximable Processes in Cartesian Product Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating parameters of functional ARMA, GARCH and invertible processes requires estimating lagged covariance and cross-covariance operators of Cartesian product Hilbert space-valued processes. Asymptotic results have been derived in recent years, either less generally or under a strict condition. This article derives upper bounds of the estimation errors for such operators based on the mild condition Lp-m-approximability for each lag, Cartesian power(s) and sample size, where the two processes can take values in different spaces in the context of lagged cross-covariance operators. Implications of our results on eigenelements, parameters in functional AR(MA) models and other general situations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the quality of a prediction</title>

Abstract: Shannon defined the mutual information between two variables. We illustrate why the true mutual information between a variable and the predictions made by a prediction algorithm is not a suitable measure of prediction quality, but the apparent Shannon mutual information (ASI) is; indeed it is the unique prediction quality measure with either of two very different lists of desirable properties, as previously shown by de Finetti and other authors. However, estimating the uncertainty of the ASI is a difficult problem, because of long and non-symmetric heavy tails to the distribution of the individual values of $j(x,y)=\log\frac{Q_y(x)}{P(x)}$ We propose a Bayesian modelling method for the distribution of $j(x,y)$, from the posterior distribution of which the uncertainty in the ASI can be inferred. This method is based on Dirichlet-based mixtures of skew-Student distributions. We illustrate its use on data from a Bayesian model for prediction of the recurrence time of prostate cancer. We believe that this approach is generally appropriate for most problems, where it is infeasible to derive the explicit distribution of the samples of $j(x,y)$, though the precise modelling parameters may need adjustment to suit particular cases.</description>

      <title>Estimating Treatment Effects under Recommender Interference: A Structured Neural Networks Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for content-sharing platforms by curating personalized content. To evaluate updates to recommender systems targeting content creators, platforms frequently rely on creator-side randomized experiments. The treatment effect measures the change in outcomes when a new algorithm is implemented compared to the status quo. We show that the standard difference-in-means estimator can lead to biased estimates due to recommender interference that arises when treated and control creators compete for exposure. We propose a "recommender choice model" that describes which item gets exposed from a pool containing both treated and control items. By combining a structural choice model with neural networks, this framework directly models the interference pathway while accounting for rich viewer-content heterogeneity. We construct a debiased estimator of the treatment effect and prove it is $\sqrt n$-consistent and asymptotically normal with potentially correlated samples. We validate our estimator's empirical performance with a field experiment on Weixin short-video platform. In addition to the standard creator-side experiment, we conduct a costly double-sided randomization design to obtain a benchmark estimate free from interference bias. We show that the proposed estimator yields results comparable to the benchmark, whereas the standard difference-in-means estimator can exhibit significant bias and even produce reversed signs.</description>
