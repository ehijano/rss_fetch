      <title>Collective excitations and divergent spin currents in non-centrosymmetric superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective modes in a non-centrosymmetric superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit coupling under laser irradiation. The concept of Anderson Pseudospin Resonance allows to reveal how laser driving gives rise not only to the established resonant enhancement of the third harmonic response, but also to a resonant enhancement in the second harmonic response of the spin current. We propose a theory which explains the phenomenon without including interband transitions. The theory is corroborated by numerical simulations which incorporate interband effects and allow us to clarify the signatures of the collective modes in the long-time dynamics of the superconductor.</description>

      <title>Origin of sublattice particle-hole asymmetry in monolayer FeSe superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In iron-based superconductors, the two Fe atoms in the unit cell are typically related by crystal symmetries; therefore, we expect no intra-unit cell variations in the superconducting gap. However, recent experiments have challenged this expectation, reporting intra-unit cell variations in the gap with an unusual particle-hole asymmetry. Here, we examine the origin of this asymmetry between the two Fe sublattices in monolayer FeSe grown on SrTiO$_3$. We reveal that, in addition to the substrate-induced broken inversion symmetry, substrate nematic symmetry breaking is key to observing this asymmetry. We further identify two possible mechanisms through which this can occur. The first is through an odd-parity gap function that coexists with an extended $s$-wave function. The second is via a nodeless $d$-wave gap function that develops in the presence of a symmetry-breaking substrate. We argue that the latter mechanism is more physical. To test our theory, we performed scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements across the nematic domain walls, which exhibit a clear enhancement of the asymmetry between the two Fe sublattices. In addition, we reveal that the observed sublattice particle-hole asymmetry is associated with odd-frequency pairing correlations, providing an experimental realization of this unusual pairing correlation.</description>

      <title>Electronic state of superconductivity in line nodal material CaSb2 under pressure up to 4.2 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of resistance measurements under pressure up to $4.2\,\mathrm{GPa}$ on single-crystalline $\mathrm{CaSb}_2$ , which shows the maximum of superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ at $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$. At room temperature, $R(P)$ shows a subtle anomaly at $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$. However, Bloch-Gr\"uneisen analysis of $R(T)$ indicates that the electronic state does not change significantly across $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$.</description>

      <title>Spin and orbital excitations in undoped infinite layers: a comparison between superconducting PrNiO2 and insulating CaCuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinitelayer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of photon detection mechanism in superconducting single-photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To elucidate the photon detection mechanism of superconducting single-photon detectors, we theoretically examine the dynamics of type-II superconductors with a bias current using the two-dimensional time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau and the Maxwell equations. The photon injection that weakens the superconducting order parameter is treated phenomenologically as a local temperature increase, and the amount of injection is controlled by the initial hotspot radius. The photon is detected by the voltage change between two electrodes attached to the left and right edges of the superconductor. We find that certain parameter ranges can be explained by the traditionally considered hotspot model, while other parameter ranges are governed by the generation and annihilation of superconducting vortex and antivortex pairs. The photon detection is possible for an initial hotspot radius that exceeds a threshold value. We find that the generation of a vortex--antivortex pair occurs near the threshold. The flow of the pair perpendicular to the current direction finally creates a normal region for the photon detection. The voltage change for the Ginzburg--Landau parameter close to the transition point from type-II to type-I superconductor shows anomalous behavior that is not associated with the dynamics of the vortex--antivortex pair. We also examine the effects of spatially non-uniform current density on the voltage change and the superconducting order parameter to provide a hint to understand the behavior of wide-strip single-photon detectors. The estimated values of incident photon energy and response time for photon detection are reasonable in comparison with experiments. The present comprehensive examination provides useful guidelines for flexible design of device structures.</description>

      <title>Structure-property relation in the cuprates: a possible explanation for the pseudogap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a structure-property relation that could be key to the pseudogap phenomenology in cuprates. The underlying nonsymmorphic crystal structure in the low-temperature orthogonal phase endows the lattice with a sublattice structure that gives rise to two electronic bands near the Fermi surface. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the hybridization of these two bands generates small Fermi pockets and, correspondingly, a change in the number of free carriers. A sublattice structure also leads to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) matrix-element interference, naturally explaining the emergence of Fermi arcs and their consistency with closed Fermi pockets. We employ a symmetry analysis to highlight the expected Fermi surface properties, and complement it with density functional theory (DFT) for a quantitative discussion and comparison with recent experiments in doped La$_2$CuO$_4$. The proposed mechanism can consistently account for the most salient features of the pseudogap in the cuprates, namely, the Fermi surface reconstruction with the formation of small Fermi pockets and the corresponding change in carrier density, and the observation of Fermi arcs by ARPES.</description>

      <title>Superconducting pairing correlations on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum\'s Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Tunable Josephson voltage source for quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noisy voltage sources can be a limiting factor for fundamental physics experiments as well as for device applications in quantum information, mesoscopic circuits, magnetometry, and other fields. The best commercial DC voltage sources can be programmed to approximately six digits and have intrinsic noise in the microvolt range. On the other hand the noise level in metrological Josephson-junction based voltage standards is sub-femtovolt. Although such voltage standards can be considered "noiseless," they are generally not designed for continuous tuning of the output voltage nor for supplying current to a load at cryogenic temperatures. We propose a Josephson effect based voltage source, as opposed to a voltage standard, operating in the 30-160 uV range which can supply over 100 nA of current to loads at milli-Kelvin temperatures. We describe the operating principle, the sample design, and the calibration procedure to obtain continuous tunability. We show current-voltage characteristics of the device, demonstrate how the voltage can be adjusted without DC control connections to room-temperature electronics, and showcase an experiment coupling the source to a mesoscopic load, a small Josephson junction. Finally we characterize the performance of our source by measuring the voltage noise at the load, 50 pV RMS, which is attributed to parasitic resistances in the cabling. This work establishes the use of the Josephson effect for voltage biasing extremely sensitive quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics of the infinite-layer nickelate LaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinite-layer (IL) nickelates have rapidly emerged as a new class of superconductors. However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors. Our findings provide a reference point for future experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the interplay between lattice dynamics and electronic properties in IL nickelates.</description>
