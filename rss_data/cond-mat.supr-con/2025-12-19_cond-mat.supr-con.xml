      <title>Determining the superconducting order parameter of UPt$_3$ using scanning tunneling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity, a state in which electrical currents can flow without resistance, occurs because of pairing of electrons into quasiparticles with integer spin $S$. In practically all known superconducting materials, these pairs form a singlet with $S=0$. Finding a material that has triplet pairing, $S=1$, would have profound fundamental and technological implications. UPt$_3$ has been a key candidate material for spin-triplet superconductivity. Because of a lack of direct evidence for the pairing symmetry, the nature of the superconducting pairing remains under debate. Here, we use ultra-low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy to resolve this question. Our data reveals a zero-bias Andreev bound state within the gap for a surface normal to the $c$-axis of UPt$_3$. The superconducting origin of the features is confirmed through vortex imaging. For triplet pairing, such an Andreev state is fragile against Rashba spin-splitting, whereas for singlet pairing it remains robust, classifying UPt$_3$ as a spin-singlet superconductor with a chiral order parameter.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Pair-breaking Scattering Interference in Bulk FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially periodic modulations of the superconducting gap have been recently reported in diverse materials and are often attributed to pair density wave order. An alternative mechanism, termed pair-breaking scattering interference (PBSI), was proposed to produce gap modulations without finite-momentum pairing. Here we investigate signatures of PBSI in bulk FeSe using scanning tunneling microscopy with superconductive tips, enabling enhanced energy resolution and Josephson tunneling. Subsurface magnetic scatterers with Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states are identified in FeSe, around which we observe particle-hole symmetric gap modulations accompanied by spatial modulation of the Josephson current. Those modulations have wavevectors consistent with intra-pocket PBSI. We further demonstrate that phase-referenced quasiparticle interference imaging offers an independent and direct probe of PBSI beyond gap mapping. These results establish PBSI as a viable origin of gap modulations in superconductors lacking preexisting charge/spin density wave orders, and motivate further investigation of the intriguing gap modulation phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Beyond dpa: an atomistic framework for a quantitative description of radiation damage in YBa2Cu3O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation damage in high-temperature cuprate superconductors represents one of the main technological challenges for their deployment in harsh environments, such as fusion reactors and accelerator facilities. Their complex crystal structure makes modeling irradiation effects in this class of materials a particularly demanding task, for which existing damage models remain inadequate. In this work, we develop an atomistic-based approach for describing primary radiation damage in YBa2Cu3O7, by coupling Molecular Dynamics and Binary Collision Approximation simulations in a way that makes them complementary. When integrated with Primary Knock-on Atom spectra obtained from Monte Carlo codes, our results establish a framework for multiscale modeling of radiation damage, enabling quantitative estimates of several damage descriptors, such as defect production, defect clustering, and the effective damaged volume for any specific irradiation conditions where collision cascades dominate. This computational approach is suitable for the prediction of irradiation effects in any complex functional oxide, with applications ranging from aerospace to nuclear fusion and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Field-free Josephson diode and tunable $\phi_0$-junction in chiral kagome antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent realization of superconducting proximity effect in chiral antiferromagnets (cAFMs) opens a new route to nonreciprocal superconducting transport of fundamental interest and practical importance. Using microscopic modeling and symmetry analysis, we show that Josephson junctions formed by conventional $s$-wave superconductors (SCs) and cAFMs on the kagome lattice exhibit Josephson diode effects and anomalous phase shifts ($\phi_0$-junction state) when space inversion $\mathcal{I}$, time-reversal $\mathcal{T}$, and combined mirror-time-reversal $\mathcal{TM}_z$ symmetries are simultaneously broken. We propose two setups to realize these phenomena and achieve high diode efficiency. (i) An SC/cAFM/SC junction with spin-orbit coupling, which enables a field-free diode effect with a robust tunable $\phi_0$-junction state. (ii) An SC/cAFM/cAFM$^\prime$/SC junction, where two cAFM layers with different in-plane order orientations, under an out-of-plane Zeeman exchange field, produces significant diode effect and anomalous phase shifts. These results establish a direct link between $\mathcal{TM}_z$ symmetry breaking and nonreciprocal superconductivity, suggesting cAFMs as versatile platforms for symmetry-engineered Josephson diodes and tunable $\phi_0$-junctions.</description>

      <title>Entropy stabilization and effect of A-site ionic size in bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has sparked a surge of research into Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates. Currently, stabilizing the bilayer RP phases with smaller $A$-site ions remains a significant challenge. In this work, we have successfully synthesized medium- and high-entropy bilayer nickelates, La$_{1.2}$Pr$_{0.6}$Nd$_{0.6}$Sm$_{0.6}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and La$_{0.67}$Pr$_{0.67}$Nd$_{0.67}$Sm$_{0.33}$Eu$_{0.33}$Gd$_{0.33}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, by utilizing the concept of configuration entropy stabilization. The high-entropy nickelate exhibits the smallest unit-cell volume and the largest orthorhombic distortion reported to date. The chemical pressure induced by the smaller A-site ions significantly enhances the NiO$_6$ octahedral rotation/distortion and shortens the interlayer Ni-Ni interatomic spacing. Physical property measurements reveal bad electrical conductivity alongside a markedly elevated density-wave transition temperature. Notably, the superconducting transition temperature extrapolated from structural correlations is projected to exceed 100 K. Our work not only demonstrates entropy stabilization of bilayer nickelates, but also reveals the effect of $A$-site-ion size on the crystal structure and physical properties, opening a new pathway for developing nickelate superconductors and tuning their electronic properties.</description>

      <title>On the Properties of Elemental and High-Tc Superconductors in an Applied Magnetic Field in a Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unified approach based on the Generalized BCS equations incorporating chemical potential employed to deal with the critical temperature, gap(s) and coherence length(s) of any superconductor (SC) in an earlier paper is shown here to be also applicable when the SC is in an applied field. Presented herein are the calculated values of the following parameters related to its penetration depth and critical current density: the interaction parameter governing the formation of Cooper pairs (CPs), the number of occupied Landau levels, the number density of charge carriers, the critical velocity of CPs, and the values of chemical potential at T = Tc and zero. Our study is found to corroborate the finding reported by Rasolt and Tesanovic [Revs. Mod. Phys., 64, 709 (1992)] that in some systems the effective electron-electron interaction is enhanced with increasing magnetic field and sheds new light on the finding reported by Audouard et al. [Euro. Phys. Lett., 109, 27003 (2015)] that the properties of a superconductor in magnetic fields are controlled by a single band despite the multiband nature of the Fermi surface. The SCs dealt with are Cd, Zn, Al, In, Hg, MgB2, YBCO, Bi-2212 Bi-2223, Tl-2212, Tl-2223 and compressed H3S and LaH10.</description>

      <title>Charge order in the Pr substituted YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ from high-field Hall effect measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism of doping in the composite Pr$_x$Y$_{1-x}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (Pr-YBCO) system is distinct from that of pure YBCO, offering a means to explore the requirements for the numerous electronic orders appearing in the phase diagram. One such example is the ubiquitous 2D charge order and concomitant Fermi surface reconstruction in underdoped YBCO. Here, using magnetotransport and Hall effect measurements, we find signatures of a Fermi surface reconstruction similar to that in pure YBCO indicating the presence of 2D charge order in Pr-YBCO. Additionally, we find that the phase diagrams of Pr-YBCO and YBCO are decidedly symmetric despite the additional disorder in the former and the distinction between hole depletion through Pr substitution and through O reduction. This indicates that while the mechanism of doping differs, the amount of charge carriers in the planes is the most important factor governing the electronic orders in these systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of REBCO delamination in the resistive insulation nested coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The REBCO coated conductor has the potential to be widely used in ultrahigh field magnets. It is well known, however, that it is not mechanically strong against delamination in the direction normal to its surface due to its intrinsic layered structure. Therefore, conductor delamination is one of the major design challenges for REBCO magnet coils. As a part of the development of the 40 T all-superconducting magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, USA (NHMFL), a dry-wound resistive-insulation-nested-coils (RINC) was designed to reach 25.8 T. It used surface-treated stainless-steel tape as a co-wind to control the turn-to-turn contact resistance, and was fabricated and tested in a liquid helium bath. During the test, two of the double pancake modules exhibited resistive transitions at a current significantly lower than the designed value. The postmortem inspection of the REBCO conductor of these modules by reel-to-reel magnetization at 77 K found sections of very low critical current. Further investigations of one section by chemical etching, visual inspection, and electron microscopy revealed that conductor of this section was delaminated. We present the detailed findings of these postmortem characterizations. The implication of this type of delamination for future magnet designs will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Magneto-elasto-resistivity in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FeSe stands out among iron-based superconductors due to its extended nematic phase without the onset of long-range magnetic order. While strain-dependent electrical resistivity has been extensively explored to probe nematicity, its influence on magneto-transport properties remains less understood. In this work, we present measurements of the magneto-elasto-resistivity in FeSe as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. Using a minimal multiband Boltzmann model for transport we derive analytical expressions that capture the magnetic behavior of the whole set of experimental data both in the paramagnetic and in the nematic phase. These findings indicate that a multiband framework can robustly describe the magneto-elasto-transport properties in FeSe and arguably in other iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Nonunitary spin-triplet superconductors in Zeeman magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spin-triplet superconductivity with both unitary and nonunitary pairing in the presence of an external Zeeman magnetic field. Within a mean-field framework, we exactly diagonalize the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and derive general expressions for the quasiparticle spectrum, superconducting gap, critical temperature, and spin magnetization, valid for arbitrary magnetic-field strengths and temperatures. We analyze in detail the nonlinear spin susceptibility and the field evolution of the superconducting gap and transition temperature, highlighting qualitative differences between unitary and nonunitary pairing states. Our results are broadly applicable to a wide range of materials, including systems with both weak and strong spin-orbit coupling. We show that systematic measurements of the critical temperature and spin susceptibility as functions of the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field provide a powerful means to identify the structure of the spin-triplet order parameter, and we discuss implications of our findings for candidate materials such as 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory for edge current and noise in 2D topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the edge current and its fluctuations, i.e. noise, in a 2D topological superconductor using the T-matrix and the Green function techniques. We show that the current is zero for non-chiral edge states and non-zero for chiral edge states, while the edge noise is non-zero whatever the chirality of the edge states. By applying our results to toy models with chiral edge states, we find that the noise is closely related to the Chern number. The edge noise is non-zero only when the Chern number is non-zero, and the bulk noise exhibits a peak each time the Chern number varies, meaning that there is strong current fluctuations when a topological phase transition occurs. Our results suggest that the bulk noise could be seen as a topological susceptibility.</description>

      <title>The Motile Josephson Array: Bridging Active Turbulence and Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support an emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this letter, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for the emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as a macroscopic superconducting phase governed by the Adler equation. The validity of this mapping is confirmed analytically by a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity, corresponding to the saddle-node bifurcation of phase-locking systems. These results define the new minimal chiral flocking model as a motile, disordered Josephson array, bridging active turbulence and quantum superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it has been one of the most important new physics discoveries in the last decade, the nature of superconductivity in the twisted graphene family remains an unsolved problem. Motivated by recent scanning tunneling experiments that report Kekul\'e ordering in moir\'e graphene superconductors, we develop a microscopic theory of this superconductivity for the twisted bilayer system. The pairing we find is an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) that intrinsically carries a Kekul\'e modulation. This state exhibits four salient features: (i) spontaneous breaking of $C_3$ rotation symmetry, producing nematic order (ii)with triplet pairing; and (iii) a quasiparticle density of states that evolves from a V-shaped profile to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum as the attraction increases which is accompanied by (iv) systematic behavior of the temperature dependent zero bias conductance. These features align with key experimental signatures. We find, as well, that with only modest interaction strengths, the state is near to a BEC-like phase, consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Taken together, these results identify a microscopic intra-valley Kekul\'e PDW as a compelling candidate for unconventional superconductivity in the twisted graphene family.</description>

Abstract: Hyperuniform patterns present enhanced physical properties that make them the new generation of cutting-edge technological devices. Synthesizing devices with tens of thousands of components arranged in a hyperuniform fashion has thus become a breakthrough to achieve in order to implement these technologies. Here we provide evidence that extended two-dimensional hyperuniform patterns spanning tens of thousands of components can be nucleated using as a template the low-temperature vortex structure obtained in pristine Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 samples after following a field-cooling protocol.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Changes in Structure, Magnetic Order and Development of Superconductivity in the Ferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi8Te13</title>

Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of pressure-induced evolution of the magnetism and development of superconductivity (SC) in MnBi8Te13, a promising ambient pressure, ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulator candidate. By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n &lt; 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Paramagnon-Interference Mechanism for Three-Dimensional Bond Order in Kagome Metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K): Analysis by the Density-Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11337</link>

Abstract: The mechanism of CDW and its 3D structure are important fundamental issues in kagome metals. We have previously shown that, based on a 2D model, $2\times 2$ bond order (BO) emerges due to the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism and that its fluctuations lead to $s$-wave superconductivity. This paper studies these issues based on realistic 3D models of kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K). We reveal that a commensurate 3D $2\times 2\times 2$ BO is caused by the PMI mechanism, by performing the 3D density-wave (DW) equation analysis for all A=Cs, Rb, K models in detail. Our results indicate a BO transition temperature $T_{\rm BO}\sim 100$K within the regime of moderate electron correlation. The 3D structure of BO is attributed to the three-dimensionality of the Fermi surface, while the 3D structure of BO is sensitively changed, since the Fermi surface is quasi-2D. Based on the analysis of the DW equation, by taking into account a finite third-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) term, (i) shift stacking $2\times 2\times 2$ BO can be realized via a first-order transition below $T_{\rm BO}$. Here, the in-plane BO pattern (tri-hexagonal or star-of-David) is determined by the sign of the third-order GL term, with hole doping tending to favor the tri-hexagonal state. On the other hand, if the third-order GL term is very small, (ii) alternating vertical stacking BO may instead be realized via a second-order transition. The present study enhances our understanding of the rich variety of BOs observed experimentally. It is confirmed that the PMI mechanism is the essential origin of the 3D CDW of kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Superconducting pairing correlations on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character - which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements - and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum's Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</description>
