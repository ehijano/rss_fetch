      <title>Point counts, automorphisms, and gonalities of Shimura curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement an algorithm to compute the number of points over finite fields for the Shimura curves $X_0^D(N)$ and their Atkin--Lehner quotients. Our computations result in many examples of curves which attain the largest known point counts among curves of specified genus over a finite field of given cardinality. To illustrate the utility of our point counts algorithm in addressing arithmetic questions, we prove that all automorphisms are Atkin--Lehner for many curves $X_0^D(N)$ with $DN\leq 10000$, and we determine all tetragonal curves $X_0^D(N)$ up to a small number of possible exceptions.</description>

      <title>A further investigation on covering systems with odd moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s first introduced the idea of covering systems in 1950. Since then, much of the work in this area has concentrated on identifying covering systems that meet specific conditions on their moduli. Among the central open problems in this field is the well-known odd covering problem. In this paper, we investigate a variant of that problem, where one odd integer is permitted to appear multiple times as a modulus in the covering system, while all remaining moduli are distinct odd integers greater than 1.</description>

      <title>The structure of the double discriminant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a polynomial $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i$, we study the double discriminant $DD_{n,k} = \operatorname{disc}_{a_k} \operatorname{disc}_x f(x)$, which appears in the proof of the van der Waerden--Bhargava theorem. We conjecture that $DD_{n,k}$ is the product of a square, a cube, and possibly a linear monomial and we prove this when $k=0$. We also investigate the (typically large and smooth) outlying integer constant in the factorization of $DD_{n,k}$.</description>

      <title>An elementary proof of Newman's eta-quotient theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let eta(z) be the Dedekind eta function. Newman studied the modularity of eta-quotients, giving necessary and sufficient conditions for a function of the form \prod_{0 &lt; m | N} eta(mz)^{r_m} to be a (weakly) holomorphic modular form of level N. We explain a proof of Newman's theorem, developed while teaching a class for talented high school students at Canada/USA Mathcamp. The key observation is that although Gamma_1(N) is not generated by its upper triangular and lower triangular subgroups, it is generated by those subgroups together with any congruence subgroup. Modularity with respect to some congruence subgroup is established using one simple identity involving the multiplier system of eta(z), whose proof is elementary in the sense that it avoids the use of Dedekind sums.</description>

      <title>The SOS Rank of Biquadratic Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1973, Calder\'{o}n proved that an $m \times 2$ positive semidefinite (psd) biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of squares (sos) of ${3m(m+1) \over 2}$ quadratic forms. Very recently, by applying Hilbert's theorem, we proved that a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of squares of three quadratic forms. This improved Calder\'{o}n's result for $m=2$, and left the sos rank problem of $m \times 2$ biquadratic forms for $m \ge 3$ to further exploration. In this paper, we show that an $m \times n$ psd biquadratic form with a nontrivial zero {can} be expressed as an $(m-1) \times (n-1) \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form. Furthermore, we show that an $m \times 2$ positive definite (pd) biquadratic form can be expressed as the sum of a square of a quadratic form, and an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form. Thus, the sos rank problem of $m \times 2$ psd biquadratic forms is reduced to the sos rank problem of an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic forms. We then show that an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form has at least two nontrivial zeros, and the discriminent of a $2 \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form can be expressed as the sum of the square of three cubic forms.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the error-sum function of continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the unweighted error-sum function $\mathcal{E}(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} ( x- p_n(x)/q_n(x) )$, where $p_n(x)/q_n(x)$ is the $n$th convergent of the continued fraction expansion of $x \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of $\mathcal{E}$ is exactly $1$. Our proof is number-theoretic in nature and involves M\"obius inversion, summation over coprime convergent denominators, and precise upper bounds derived via continued fraction recurrence relations. As a supplementary result, we rederive the known upper bound of $3/2$ for the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the relative error-sum function $P(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} (q_n(x)x-p_n(x))$.</description>

      <title>Sign-patterns of Certain Infinite Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signs of Fourier coefficients of certain eta quotients are determined by dissecting expansions for theta functions and by applying a general dissection formula for certain classes of quintuple products. A characterization is given for the coefficient sign patterns for \[ \frac{(q^i;q^i)_{\infty}}{(q^p;q^p)_{\infty}} \] for integers \( i &gt; 1 \) and primes \( p &gt; 3 \). The sign analysis for this quotient addresses and extends a conjecture of Bringmann et al. for the coefficients of \( (q^2;q^2)_{\infty}(q^5;q^5)_{\infty}^{-1} \). The sign distribution for additional classes of eta quotients is considered. This addresses multiple conjectures posed by Bringmann et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize Andrews' partitions separated by parity to overpartitions in two ways. We investigate the generating functions for 16 overpartition families whose parts are separated by parity, and we prove various $q$-series identities for these functions. These identities include relations to modular forms, $q$-hypergeometric series, and mock modular forms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the empirical measures of roots of Eulerian polynomials converge to a certain log-Cauchy distribution. To do so, we show that the moments of the roots of a related family of polynomials not only converge, but are in fact ultimately constant. These asymptotic moments are expressed in terms of N\"orlund's numbers.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic symplectic model for discrete series representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16364v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $D$ be the quatenion division algebra over a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of characteristic zero and odd residual characterisitc. We show that an irreducible discrete series representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(D)$ is $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished only if it is supercuspidal. Here, $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$ is the quaternionic symplectic group. Combined with the recent study on $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished supercuspidal representations by S\'echerre and Stevens, this completes the classification of $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished discrete series representations, as predicted by Dipendra Prasad.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the motivic cohomology of mixed characteristic schemes, introduced in our previous work, satisfies various expected properties of motivic cohomology, including a motivic refinement of Weibel's vanishing in algebraic $K$-theory, the projective bundle formula, a comparison to Milnor $K$-theory, and a universal characterisation in terms of pro cdh descent. These results extend those of Elmanto--Morrow to schemes which are not necessarily defined over a field.</description>

      <title>On Expansions of Monadic Second-Order Logic with Dynamical Predicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expansions of the monadic second-order (MSO) theory of the structure $\langle \mathbb{N} ; &lt; \rangle$ have been a fertile and active area of research ever since the publication of the seminal papers of B\"uchi and Elgot &amp; Rabin on the subject in the 1960s. In the present paper, we establish decidability of the MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N} ; &lt;,P \rangle$, where $P$ ranges over a large class of unary ''dynamical'' predicates, i.e., sets of non-negative values assumed by certain integer linear recurrence sequences. One of our key technical tools is the novel concept of (effective) prodisjunctivity, which we expect may also find independent applications further afield.</description>

      <title>Trace and Observability Inequalities for Laplace Eigenfunctions on the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate trace and observability inequalities for Laplace eigenfunctions on the d-dimensional torus, with respect to arbitrary Borel measures $\mu$. Specifically, we characterize the measures $\mu$ for which the inequalities
  $$ \int |u|^2 d \mu \lesssim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(trace)}, \qquad \int |u|^2 d \mu \gtrsim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(observability)}$$
  hold uniformly for all eigenfunctions $u$ of the Laplacian. Sufficient conditions are derived based on the integrability and regularity of $\mu$, while necessary conditions are formulated in terms of the dimension of the support of the measure. These results generalize classical theorems of Zygmund and Bourgain--Rudnick to higher dimensions. Applications include results in the spirit of Cantor--Lebesgue theorems, constraints on quantum limits, and control theory for the Schr\"odinger equation. Our approach combines several tools: the cluster structure of lattice points on spheres; decoupling estimates; and the construction of eigenfunctions exhibiting strong concentration or vanishing behavior, tailored respectively to the trace and observability inequalities.</description>

      <title>Counting abelian extensions by Artin-Schreier conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian $p$-group. We count \'etale $G$-extensions of global rational function fields $\mathbb F_q(T)$ of characteristic $p$ by the degree of what we call their Artin-Schreier conductor. The corresponding (ordinary) generating function turns out to be rational. This gives an exact answer to the counting problem, and seems to beg for a geometric interpretation.
  This is in contrast with the generating functions for the ordinary conductor (from class field theory) and the discriminant, which in general have no meromorphic continuation to the entire complex plane.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the relation between the universal deformation rings and big Hecke algebras in the residually reducible case. Following the strategy of Skinner-Wiles and Pan's proof of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, we prove a pro-modularity result. Based on this result, we also give a conditional big $R=\mathbb{T}$ theorem over some totally real fields, which is a generalization of Deo's result.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we prove the remaining open cases of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture on two-dimensional regular Galois representations over $\Gal(\overline{\Q}/\Q)$ when $p=3$, hence concluding the conjecture in the regular case for all odd primes. Our result is a sequel to Pan's work, based on some recent progress on $p$-adic Langlands correspondence, Galois deformation theory and a potential pro-modularity result.</description>

      <title>On the Minimal Denominator Problem in Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the minimal denominator problem in function fields. In particular, we compute the probability distribution function of the the random variable which returns the degree of the smallest denominator $Q$, for which the ball of a fixed radius around a point contains a rational function of the form $\frac{P}{Q}$. Moreover, we discuss the distribution of the random variable which returns the denominator of minimal degree, as well as higher dimensional and $P$-adic generalizations. This can be viewed as a function field generalization of a paper by Chen and Haynes.</description>

      <title>A divisor generating $q$-series and cumulants arising from random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uchimura, in 1987, introduced a probability generating function for a random variable $X$ and using properties of this function he discovered an interesting $q$-series identity. He further showed that the $m$-th cumulant with respect to the random variable $X$ is nothing but the generating function for the generalized divisor function $\sigma_{m-1}(n)$. Simon, Crippa, and Collenberg, in 1993, explored the $G_{n,p}$-model of a random acyclic digraph and defined a random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$. Quite interestingly, they found links between limit of its mean and the generating function for the divisor function $d(n)$. Later in 1997, Andrews, Crippa and Simon extended these results using $q$-series techniques. They calculated limit of the mean and variance of the random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$ which correspond to the first and second cumulants. In this paper, we generalize the result of Andrews, Crippa and Simon by calculating limit of the $t$-th cumulant in terms of the generalized divisor function. Furthermore, we also discover limit forms for identities of Uchimura and Dilcher. This provides a fourth side to the Uchimura-Ramanujan-divisor type three way partition identities expounded by the first four authors recently.</description>

      <title>Some topological genera and Jacobi forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit and elucidate the $\widehat{A}$-genus, Hirzebruch's $L$-genus and Witten's $W$-genus, cobordism invariants of special classes of manifolds. After slight modification, involving Hecke's trick, we find that the $\widehat{A}$-genus and $L$-genus arise directly from Jacobi's theta function. For every $k\geq 0,$ we obtain exact formulas for the quasimodular expressions of $\widehat{A}_k$ and $L_k$ as ``traces'' of partition Eisenstein series \[ \widehat{\mathcal{A}}_k(\tau)= \operatorname{Tr}_k(\phi_{\widehat{A}};\tau)\ \ \ \ \ \ {\text {and}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \mathcal{L}_k(\tau)= \operatorname{Tr}_k(\phi_L;\tau), \] which are easily converted to the original topological expressions. Surprisingly, Ramanujan defined twists of the $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}_k(\tau)$ in his ``lost notebook'' in his study of derivatives of theta functions, decades before Borel and Hirzebruch rediscovered them in the context of spin manifolds. In addition, we show that the nonholomorphic $G_2^{\star}$-completion of the characteristic series of the Witten genus is the Jacobi theta function avatar of the $\widehat{A}$-genus.</description>

      <title>Flipping operators and locally harmonic Maass forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the theory of integral weight harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth, two key differential operators, the Bol operator and the shadow operator, play a fundamental role. Harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth canonically split into two parts, and each operator controls one of these parts. A third operator, called the flipping operator, exchanges the role of these two parts. Maass--Poincar\'e series (of parabolic type) form a convenient basis of negative weight harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth, and flipping has the effect of negating an index. Recently, there has been much interest in locally harmonic Maass forms defined by the first author, Kane, and Kohnen. These are lifts of Poincar\'e series of hyperbolic type, and are intimately related to the Shimura and Shintani lifts. In this note, we prove that a similar property holds for the flipping operator applied to these Poincar\'e series.</description>

      <title>Geometric designs and Hilbert-Kamke equations of degree five for classical orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we elucidate the advantage of examining the connections between Hilbert-Kamke equations and geometric designs, or Chebyshev-type quadrature, for classical orthogonal polynomials. We first establish that if a $5$-design with $6$ rational points for a symmetric classical measure is parametrized by rational functions, then the corresponding measure should be the Chebyshev measure $(1-t^2)^{-1/2}dt/\pi$ on $(-1,1)$. Our proof is based on the collaboration of a certain polynomial identity and some advanced techniques on the computation of the genus of a certain irreducible curve. Next, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of rational $5$-designs for the Chebyshev measure. Moreover, as one of our main theorems, we construct an infinite family of ideal solutions for the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem by utilizing rational $5$-designs for the Chebyshev measure, and then establish that, up to affine equivalence over $\mathbb{Q}$, such ideal solutions are included in the famous parametric solutions found by Borwein (2002).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $r,\,f$ be multiplicative functions with $r\geqslant 0$, $f$ is complex valued, $|f|\leqslant r$, and $r$ satisfies some standard growth hypotheses. Let $x$ be large, and assume that, for some real number $\tau$, the quantities $r(p)-\Re\{f(p)/p^{i\tau}\}$ are small in various appropriate average senses over the set of prime numbers not exceeding $x$. We derive from recent effective mean-value estimates an effective comparison theorem between the mean-values of $f$ and of $r$ on the set of integers $\leqslant x$. We also provide effective estimates for certain weighted moments of additive functions and for sifted mean-values of non-negative multiplicative functions.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the co-period integral attached to an automorphic form on $\GL(2)$ and two exceptional theta series on the cubic Kazhdan-Patterson cover of $\GL(2)$. In the local aspect, we show the $\Hom$-space is always of one dimension and conduct the unramified calculations. In the global aspect, we give the Euler decomposition for the co-period integrals of Eisenstein series and propose an Ichino-Ikeda type conjecture relating the co-period integrals of cuspidal forms to the central critical value of symmetric cube $L$-functions. We also deduce from the local multiplicity one result that there exist cuspidal automorphic forms with prescribed local components and non-vanishing central symmetric cube $L$-values.</description>

      <title>On the descent conjecture for rational points and zero-cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The descent method is one of the approaches to study the Brauer--Manin obstruction to the local--global principle and to weak approximation on varieties over number fields, by reducing the problem to ``descent varieties''. In recent lecture notes by Wittenberg, he formulated a ``descent conjecture'' for torsors under linear algebraic groups. The present article gives a proof of this conjecture in the case of connected groups, generalizing the toric case from the previous work of Harpaz--Wittenberg. As an application, we deduce directly from Sansuc's work the theorem of Borovoi for homogeneous spaces of connected linear algebraic groups with connected stabilizers. We are also able to reduce the general case to the case of finite (\'etale) torsors. When the set of rational points is replaced by the Chow group of zero-cycles, an analogue of the above conjecture for arbitrary linear algebraic groups is proved.</description>

Abstract: De Loera, O'Neill and Wilburne introduced a general model for random numerical semigroups in which each positive integer is chosen independently with some probability p to be a generator, and proved upper and lower bounds on the expected Frobenius number and expected embedding dimensions. We use a range of probabilistic methods to improve the upper bounds to within a polylogarithmic factor of the lower bounds in each case. As one of the tools to do this, we prove that for any prime q, if A is a random subset of the cyclic group Z_q whose size is of order log(q) and k is also of order log(q), then with high probability the k-fold sumset kA is all of Z_q.</description>

      <title>Cluster algebraic interpretation of generalized Markov numbers and their matrixizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov numbers, i.e. positive integers appearing in solutions to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz$, can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables. The second author and Matsushita gave a generalization of the Markov equation, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1yz + k_2xz + k_3xy = (3+k_1+k_2+k_3)xyz$, whose solutions can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables in generalized cluster algebras. We give two families of matrices in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}[x_1^\pm,x_2^\pm,x_3^\pm])$ associated to these cluster structures. These matrix formulas relate to previous matrices appearing in the context of Markov numbers, including Cohn matrices and generalized Cohn matrices given by the second author, Maruyama, and Sato, as well as matrices appearing in the context of cluster algebras, including matrix formulas given by Kanatarc{\i} O\u{g}uz and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m. We provide a classification of the two families of matrices and exhibit an explicit family of each. The latter is done by realizing cluster variables in generalized Markov cluster algebras as weight-generating functions of order ideals in certain fence posets which are related to Christoffel words. An interesting observation is that these functions resemble Caldero-Chapoton functions for string modules, and a byproduct of our proofs is a new skein-like formula for such functions.</description>

      <title>A Compact Post-quantum Strong Designated Verifier Signature Scheme from Isogenies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital signatures are essential cryptographic tools that provide authentication and integrity in digital communications. However, privacy-sensitive applications, such as e-voting and digital cash, require more restrictive verification models to ensure confidentiality and control. Strong Designated Verifier Signature (SDVS) schemes address this need by enabling the signer to designate a specific verifier, ensuring that only this party can validate the signature. Existing SDVS constructions are primarily based on number-theoretic assumptions and are therefore vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although post-quantum alternatives, particularly those based on lattices, have been proposed, they often entail large key and signature sizes. In this work, we introduce $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$, a novel isogeny-based SDVS scheme that offers a compact, quantum-resistant alternative. Our construction builds on the ideal class group action framework of CSIDH and the signature techniques of CSI-FiSh, and relies on the hardness of the Multi-Target Group Action Inverse Problem (MT-GAIP). $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$ achieves strong security guarantees; namely, Strong Unforgeability under Chosen-Message Attacks (SUF-CMA), Non-Transferability (NT), and Privacy of Signer's Identity (PSI), in the random oracle model. Remarkably, both the keys and signatures in $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$ are of size $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)$, representing a significant improvement over the typical $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^2)$ bounds in existing post-quantum SDVS schemes, thereby making it among the most compact PQC-based SDVS schemes and the only post-quantum secure construction based on isogenies.</description>
