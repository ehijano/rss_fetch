      <title>Basic Data Processing of Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive guide to gravitational wave data processing, with a particular focus on signal generation, noise modeling, and optimization techniques. Beginning with an introduction to gravitational waves and the detection techniques used by LIGO and Virgo, the manual covers the essentials of signal processing, including Fourier analysis, filtering, and the generation of quadratic chirp signals. The analysis of colored Gaussian noise and its impact on interferometric detectors like LIGO is explored in detail, alongside signal detection methods such as the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT). The paper also delves into optimization techniques like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which can be applied to improve signal estimation accuracy. By providing MATLAB-based implementations, this manual serves as both a theoretical and practical resource for researchers in the field of gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Solving the PTA Data Analysis Problem with a Global Gibbs Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The announcement in the summer of 2023 about the discovery of evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has ignited both the PTA and the larger scientific community's interest in the experiment and the scientific implications of its findings. As a result, numerous scientific works have been published analyzing and further developing various aspects of the experiment, from performing tests of gravity to improving the efficiency of the current data analysis techniques. In this regard, we contribute to the recent advancements in the field of PTAs by presenting the most general, agnostic, per-frequency Bayesian search for a low-frequency (red) noise process in these data. Our new method involves the use of a conjugate Jeffrey's-like multivariate prior which allows one to model all unique parameters of the global PTA-level red noise covariance matrix as a separate model parameter for which a marginalized posterior-probability distribution can be found using Gibbs sampling. Even though perfecting the implementation of the Gibbs sampling and mitigating the numerical stability challenges require further development, we show the power of this new method by analyzing realistic and theoretical PTA simulated data sets. We show how our technique is consistent with the more restricted standard techniques in recovering both the auto and the cross-spectrum of pulsars' low-frequency (red) noise. Furthermore, we highlight ways to approximately characterize a GWB (both its auto- and cross-spectrum) using Fourier coefficient estimates from single-pulsar and so-called CURN (common uncorrelated red noise) analyses via analytic draws from a specific Inverse-Wishart distribution.</description>

      <title>DAXA: Traversing the X-ray desert by Democratising Archival X-ray Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new, open-source, Python module for the acquisition and processing of archival data from many X-ray telescopes - Democratising Archival X-ray Astronomy (hereafter referred to as DAXA). Our software is built to increase access to, and use of, large archives of X-ray astronomy data; providing a unified, easy-to-use, Python interface to the disparate archives and processing tools. We provide this interface for the majority of X-ray telescopes launched within the last 30 years. This module enables much greater access to X-ray data for non-specialists, while preserving low-level control of processing for X-ray experts. It is useful for identifying relevant observations of a single object of interest but it excels at creating multi-mission datasets for serendipitous or targeted studies of large samples of X-ray emitting objects. The management and organization of datasets is also made easier; DAXA archives can be version controlled and updated if new data become available. Once relevant observations are identified, the raw data can be downloaded (and optionally processed) through DAXA, or pre-processed event lists, images, and exposure maps can be downloaded if they are available. X-ray observations are perfectly suited to serendipitous discoveries and archival analyses, and with a decade-long `X-ray desert' potentially on the horizon archival data will take on even greater importance; enhanced access to those archives will be vital to the continuation of X-ray astronomy.</description>

      <title>The STROBE-X Wide Field Monitor Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wide Field Monitor (WFM) is one of the three instruments on the Spectroscopic Time-Resolving Observatory for Broadband Energy X-rays (STROBE-X) mission, which was proposed in response to the NASA 2023 call for a probe class mission. The WFM is a coded-mask camera system that would be the most scientifically capable wide-angle monitor ever flown. The field of view covers one third of the sky, to 50 percent mask coding, and the energy sensitivity is 2 to 50 keV. The WFM is designed to identify new X-ray transients and to capture spectral and timing changes in known sources with data of unprecedented quality. Science applications cover diverse classes, in including X-ray bursts that coincide with gravitational wave detections, gamma ray bursts and their transition from prompt emission to afterglow, subluminous GRBs that may signal shock breakout in supernovae, state transitions in accreting compact objects and their jets, bright flares in fast X-ray transients, accretion onset in transitional pulsars, and coronal flares from many types of active stars.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Low-Order Focal Plane Wavefront Sensing in Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive optics (AO) systems are crucial for high-resolution astronomical observations by compensating for atmospheric turbulence. While laser guide stars (LGS) address high-order wavefront aberrations, natural guide stars (NGS) remain vital for low-order wavefront sensing (LOWFS). Conventional NGS-based methods like Shack-Hartmann sensors have limitations in field of view, sensitivity, and complexity. Focal plane wavefront sensing (FPWFS) offers advantages, including a wider field of view and enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, but accurately estimating low-order modes from distorted point spread functions (PSFs) remains challenging. We propose an AI-powered FPWFS method specifically for low-order mode estimation in infrared wavelengths. Our approach is trained on simulated data and validated on on-telescope data collected from the Keck I adaptive optic (K1AO) bench calibration source in K-band. By leveraging the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio in the infrared and the power of AI, our method overcomes the limitations of traditional LOWFS techniques. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of AI-based FPWFS for low-order wavefront sensing, paving the way for more compact, efficient, and high-performing AO systems for astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>MAVIS: Enabling High-Precision Ground-Based Astrometry in the Visible Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MAVIS (the MCAO-Assisted Visible Imager and Spectrograph), planned for the VLT Adaptive Optics Facility, represents an innovative step in Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems, particularly in its operation at visible wavelengths and anticipated contributions to the field of astronomical astrometry. Recognizing the crucial role of high-precision astrometry in realizing science goals such as studying the dynamics of dense starfields, this study focuses on the challenges of advancing astrometry with MAVIS to its limits, as well as paving the way for further enhancement by incorporating telemetry data as part of the astrometric analysis. We employ MAVISIM, Superstar, and DAOPHOT to simulate both MAVIS imaging performance and provide a pathway to incorporate telemetry data for precise astrometry with MAVIS. Photometry analyses are conducted using the Superstar and DAOPHOT platforms, integrated into a specifically designed pipeline for astrometric analysis in MCAO settings. Combining these platforms, our research aims to elucidate the impact of utilizing telemetry data on improving astrometric precision, potentially establishing new methods for ground-based AO-assisted astrometric analysis. This endeavor not only sheds light on the capabilities of MAVIS but also paves the way for advancing astrometry in the era of next-generation MCAO-enabled giant telescopes.</description>

      <title>A low-cost, high-speed, very high-order Shack-Hartmann sensor for testing TMT deformable mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Thirty Meter Telescope will use a sophisticated adaptive optics system called NFIRAOS. This system utilizes two deformable mirrors conjugate to 0 km and 11.2 km to apply a Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) correction over a 2 arcminute field of view. DM0 and DM11 have 63 and 75 actuators across their respective diameters. To study the behavior of these mirrors, we have developed a low-cost, very high-order Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (WFS). We will use our WFS to calibrate the flatness of the DMs and measure the influence functions of the actuators. NFIRAOS is cooled to reduce the thermal emissivity of optical surfaces visible to the science detectors, so we will also measure the behaviour of the DMs in both warm and cold environments. As the cold chamber is prone to vibrations, a WFS is preferred to a phase-shifting interferometer. Our design was driven by the need to be able to evaluate the DM surface between the actuators, which led to the requirement of at least 248 sub apertures across the diameter. The largest commercially available Shack-Hartmann WFS has only 128 sub-apertures across the diameter, which is not enough to properly sample these DMs. Furthermore, the designed sensor is able to record the wavefront at 50 FPS (50 times per second) at full resolution. To fabricate this WFS, we used a commercial off-the-shelf CMOS detector, camera lens, and lens let array, which kept the total cost less than 20K USD. Here we present the design and performance characteristics of this device.</description>

      <title>Visible-Light High-Contrast Imaging and Polarimetry with SCExAO/VAMPIRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present significant upgrades to the VAMPIRES instrument, a visible-light (600 nm to 800 nm) high-contrast imaging polarimeter integrated within SCExAO on the Subaru telescope. Key enhancements include new qCMOS detectors, coronagraphs, polarization optics, and a multiband imaging mode, improving sensitivity, resolution, and efficiency. These upgrades position VAMPIRES as a powerful tool for studying sub-stellar companions, accreting protoplanets, circumstellar disks, stellar jets, stellar mass-loss shells, and solar system objects. The instrument achieves angular resolutions from 17 mas to 21 mas and Strehl ratios up to 60\%, with 5$\sigma$ contrast limits of $10^{\text{-}4}$ at 0.1'' to $10^{\text{-}6}$ beyond 0.5''. We demonstrate these capabilities through spectro-polarimetric coronagraphic imaging of the HD 169142 circumstellar disk, ADI+SDI imaging of the sub-stellar companion HD 1160B, narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging of the R Aqr emission nebula, and spectro-polarimetric imaging of Neptune.</description>

      <title>Phoebus: Performance Portable GRRMHD for Relativistic Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09146v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the open source code PHOEBUS (phifty one ergs blows up a star) for astrophysical general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations. PHOEBUS is designed for, but not limited to, high energy astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, black-hole accretion disks, and similar phenomena. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics are modeled in the Valencia formulation with conservative finite volume methods. Neutrino radiation transport is included with Monte Carlo and moment methods. PHOEBUS is built on the PARTHENON (Grete et al. 2022) performance portable adaptive mesh refinement framework, uses a GPU first development strategy, and is capable of modeling a large dynamic range in space and time. PHOEBUS utilizes KOKKOS for on-node parallelism and supports both CPU and GPU architectures. We describe the physical model employed in PHOEBUS, the numerical methods used, and demonstrate a suite of test problems to showcase its abilities. We demonstrate weak scaling to over 500 H100 GPUs.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with scattering representations: scattering is all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the first successful use of scattering representations without further compression for simulation-based inference (SBI) with images (i.e. field-level), illustrated with a cosmological case study. Scattering representations provide a highly effective representational space for subsequent learning tasks, although the higher dimensional compressed space introduces challenges. We overcome these through spatial averaging, coupled with more expressive density estimators. Compared to alternative methods, such an approach does not require additional simulations for either training or computing derivatives, is interpretable, and resilient to covariate shift. As expected, we show that a scattering only approach extracts more information than traditional second order summary statistics.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Adapts to Changing PSD in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has opened unparalleled opportunities for observing the universe, particularly through the study of black hole inspirals. These events serve as unique laboratories to explore the laws of physics under conditions of extreme energies. However, significant noise in gravitational wave (GW) data from observatories such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo poses major challenges in signal identification. Traditional noise suppression methods often fall short in fully addressing the non-Gaussian effects in the data, including the fluctuations in noise power spectral density (PSD) over short time intervals. These challenges have led to the exploration of an AI approach that, while overcoming previous obstacles, introduced its own challenges, such as scalability, reliability issues, and the vanishing gradient problem. Our approach addresses these issues through a simplified architecture. To compensate for the potential limitations of a simpler model, we have developed a novel training methodology that enables it to accurately detect gravitational waves amidst highly complex noise. Employing this strategy, our model achieves over 99% accuracy in non-white noise scenarios and shows remarkable adaptability to changing noise PSD conditions. By leveraging the principles of transfer learning, our model quickly adapts to new noise profiles with just a few epochs of fine-tuning, facilitating real-time applications in dynamically changing noise environments.</description>

      <title>SCExAO/CHARIS Near-Infrared Scattered-Light Imaging and Integral Field Spectropolarimetry of the AB Aurigae Protoplanetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze near-infrared integral field spectropolarimetry of the AB Aurigae protoplanetary disk and protoplanet (AB Aur b), obtained with SCExAO/CHARIS in 22 wavelength channels covering the J, H, and K passbands ($\lambda_{\rm o}$ = 1.1--2.4 $\mu m$) over angular separations of $\rho$ $\approx$ 0.13" to 1.1" ($\sim$20--175 au). Our images resolve spiral structures in the disk in each CHARIS channel. At the longest wavelengths, the data may reveal an extension of the western spiral seen in previous polarimetric data at $\rho$ $&lt;$ 0.3" out to larger distances clockwise from the protoplanet AB Aur b, coincident with the ALMA-detected $CO$ gas spiral. While AB Aur b is detectable in complementary total intensity data, it is a non-detection in polarized light at $\lambda$ $&gt;$ 1.3 $\mu $m. While the observed disk color is extremely red across $JHK$, the disk has a blue intrinsic scattering color consistent with small dust grains. The disk's polarization spectrum is redder than AB Aur b's total intensity spectrum. The polarization fraction peaks at $\sim$ 0.6 along the major disk axis. Radiative transfer modeling of the CHARIS data shows that small, porous dust grains with a porosity of $p$ = 0.6--0.8 better reproduce the scattered-light appearance of the disk than more compact spheres ($p$ = 0.3), especially the polarization fraction. This work demonstrates the utility of integral field spectropolarimetry to characterize structures in protoplanetary disks and elucidate the properties of the disks' dust.</description>

      <title>K-Contact Distance for Noisy Nonhomogeneous Spatial Point Data with application to Repeating Fast Radio Burst sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to analyze nonhomogeneous Poisson processes (NHPP) observed with noise, focusing on previously unstudied second-order characteristics of the noisy process. Utilizing a hierarchical Bayesian model with noisy data, we estimate hyperparameters governing a physically motivated NHPP intensity. Simulation studies demonstrate the reliability of this methodology in accurately estimating hyperparameters. Leveraging the posterior distribution, we then infer the probability of detecting a certain number of events within a given radius, the $k$-contact distance. We demonstrate our methodology with an application to observations of fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment's FRB Project (CHIME/FRB). This approach allows us to identify repeating FRB sources by bounding or directly simulating the probability of observing $k$ physically independent sources within some radius in the detection domain, or the $\textit{probability of coincidence}$ ($P_{\text{C}}$). The new methodology improves the repeater detection $P_{\text{C}}$ in 86% of cases when applied to the largest sample of previously classified observations, with a median improvement factor (existing metric over $P_{\text{C}}$ from our methodology) of $\sim$ 3000.</description>

      <title>Infrared Spectra of Solid-State Ethanolamine: Laboratory Data in Support of JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethanolamine (NH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$OH, EA) has been identified in the gas phase of the ISM within molecular clouds. Although EA has not been directly observed in the molecular ice phase, a solid state formation mechanism has been proposed. However, the current literature lacks an estimation of the infrared band strengths of EA ices. We conducted an experimental investigation of solid EA ice at low temperatures to ascertain its infrared band strengths, phase transition temperature, and multilayer binding energy. The commonly used laser interferometry method was not applied. Infrared band strengths were determined using three distinct methods. The obtained lab spectrum of EA was compared with the publicly available MIRI MRS James Webb Space Telescope observations toward a low mass protostar. The phase transition temperature for EA ice falls within the range of 175 to 185 K. Among the discussed methods, the simple pressure gauge method provides a reasonable estimate of band strength. We derive a band strength value of about $1\times10^{-17}$ cm molecule$^{-1}$ for the NH$_2$ bending mode in the EA molecules. Additionally, temperature-programmed desorption analysis yielded a multilayer desorption energy of 0.61$\pm$0.01 eV. By comparing the laboratory data documented in this study with the JWST spectrum of the low mass protostar IRAS 2A, an upper-limit for the EA ice abundances was derived.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian process model for stellar activity in 2-D line profile time-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar active regions like spots and faculae can distort the shapes of spectral lines, inducing variations in the radial velocities that are often orders of magnitude larger than the signals from Earth-like planets. Efforts to mitigate these activity signals have hitherto focused on either the time or the velocity (wavelength) domains. We present a physics-driven Gaussian process (GP) framework to model activity signals directly in time series of line profiles or Cross-Correlation Functions (CCFs). Unlike existing methods which correct activity signals in line profile time series, our approach exploits the time correlation between velocity (wavelength) bins in the line profile variations, and is based on a simplified but physically motivated model for the origin of these variations. When tested on both synthetic and real data sets with signal-to-noise ratios down to $\sim$ 100, our method was able to separate the planetary signal from the activity signal, even when their periods were identical. We also conducted injection/recovery tests using two years of realistically sampled HARPS-N solar data, demonstrating the ability of the method to accurately recover a signal induced by a 1.5-Earth mass planet with a semi-amplitude of 0.3 m/s and a period of 33 days during high solar activity.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning and genetic algorithms for cosmological Bayesian inference speed-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to accelerate the Bayesian inference process, focusing specifically on the nested sampling algorithms. Bayesian inference plays a crucial role in cosmological parameter estimation, providing a robust framework for extracting theoretical insights from observational data. However, its computational demands can be substantial, primarily due to the need for numerous likelihood function evaluations. Our proposed method utilizes the power of deep learning, employing feedforward neural networks to approximate the likelihood function dynamically during the Bayesian inference process. Unlike traditional approaches, our method trains neural networks on-the-fly using the current set of live points as training data, without the need for pre-training. This flexibility enables adaptation to various theoretical models and datasets. We perform simple hyperparameter optimization using genetic algorithms to suggest initial neural network architectures for learning each likelihood function. Once sufficient accuracy is achieved, the neural network replaces the original likelihood function. The implementation integrates with nested sampling algorithms and has been thoroughly evaluated using both simple cosmological dark energy models and diverse observational datasets. Additionally, we explore the potential of genetic algorithms for generating initial live points within nested sampling inference, opening up new avenues for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of Bayesian inference methods.</description>

      <title>The BlackGEM telescope array I: Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main science aim of the BlackGEM array is to detect optical counterparts to gravitational wave mergers. Additionally, the array will perform a set of synoptic surveys to detect Local Universe transients and short time-scale variability in stars and binaries, as well as a six-filter all-sky survey down to ~22nd mag. The BlackGEM Phase-I array consists of three optical wide-field unit telescopes. Each unit uses an f/5.5 modified Dall-Kirkham (Harmer-Wynne) design with a triplet corrector lens, and a 65cm primary mirror, coupled with a 110Mpix CCD detector, that provides an instantaneous field-of-view of 2.7~square degrees, sampled at 0.564\arcsec/pixel. The total field-of-view for the array is 8.2 square degrees. Each telescope is equipped with a six-slot filter wheel containing an optimised Sloan set (BG-u, BG-g, BG-r, BG-i, BG-z) and a wider-band 440-720 nm (BG-q) filter. Each unit telescope is independent from the others. Cloud-based data processing is done in real time, and includes a transient-detection routine as well as a full-source optimal-photometry module. BlackGEM has been installed at the ESO La Silla observatory as of October 2019. After a prolonged COVID-19 hiatus, science operations started on April 1, 2023 and will run for five years. Aside from its core scientific program, BlackGEM will give rise to a multitude of additional science cases in multi-colour time-domain astronomy, to the benefit of a variety of topics in astrophysics, such as infant supernovae, luminous red novae, asteroseismology of post-main-sequence objects, (ultracompact) binary stars, and the relation between gravitational wave counterparts and other classes of transients</description>

      <title>A network of cooler white dwarfs as infrared standards for flux calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate flux calibration of observational data is vital for astrophysics and cosmology because absolute flux uncertainties of stellar standards propagate into scientific results. With the ever higher precision achieved by telescopic missions (e.g. JWST) in the infrared (IR), suitable calibrators are required for this regime. The basis of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) flux scale is defined by model fits of three hot (Teff &gt; 30000 K) hydrogen-atmosphere (DA) white dwarfs, which achieve an accuracy better than 1 per cent at optical wavelengths but falls below this level in the IR range. We present a network of 17 cooler DA white dwarfs with Teff &lt; 20000 K as spectrophotometric flux standards that are equally, if not more, accurate at IR wavelengths. Cooler white dwarfs do not suffer from non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) effects in continuum flux or from UV metal line blanketing, have a larger sky density, are generally closer to Earth with little or negligible interstellar reddening, and have energy distributions peaking in the optical or near-IR. Using the latest grid of DA LTE atmosphere models with three-dimensional (3D) convection, the observed Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer (STIS) and Wide Field Camera three (WFC3) fluxes of our network are accurate to 3 per cent over most of the range 1450 - 16000 AA, with a median standard deviation of 1.41 per cent. Fitting the HST STIS and WFC3 white dwarf SEDs and Balmer lines independently yields SEDs that agree within 3$\sigma$, which demonstrates the precision of the models for our network.</description>
