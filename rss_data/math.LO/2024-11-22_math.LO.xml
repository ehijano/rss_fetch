      <title>The elementary theory of free Steiner triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free Steiner triple systems (STS) are infinite structures that are naturally characterised by a universal property. We consider the class of free STSs from a model theoretic viewpoint. We show that free STSs on any number of generators are elementarily equivalent. We axiomatise their theory and show that it is stable.</description>

      <title>Complete and Terminating Tableau Calculus for Undirected Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid logic is a modal logic with additional operators specifying nominals and is highly expressive. For example, there is no formula corresponding to the irreflexivity of Kripke frames in basic modal logic, but there is in hybrid logic. Irreflexivity is significant in that irreflexive and symmetric Kripke frames can be regarded as undirected graphs reviewed from a graph theoretic point of view. Thus, the study of the hybrid logic with axioms corresponding to irreflexivity and symmetry can help to elucidate the logical properties of undirected graphs. In this paper, we formulate the tableau method of the hybrid logic for undirected graphs. Our main result is to show the completeness theorem and the termination property of the tableau method, which leads us to prove the decidability.</description>

      <title>The subTuring degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a notion of reducibility for partial functions on the natural numbers, which we call subTuring reducibility. One important aspect is that the subTuring degrees correspond to the structure of the realizability subtoposes of the effective topos. We show that the subTuring degrees (that is, the realizability subtoposes of the effective topos) form a dense non-modular (thus, non-distributive) lattice. We also show that there is a nonzero join-irreducible subTuring degree (which implies that there is a realizability subtopos of the effective topos that cannot be decomposed into two smaller realizability subtoposes).</description>

      <title>FCA using the Concept Explorer in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we give a very short introduction to Formal Concept Analysis, accompanied by an example in order to build concept lattices from a context. We build the lattice using the Java-based software Concept Explorer (ConExp) in a recent version of Linux. Installing an appropriate Java version is necessary, because ConExp was developed some time ago using a Sun Java version, which is not open-source. As a result, it has been observed that ConExp will not build a lattice when started with an open-source Java version. Therefore, we also sketch the procedure we followed to install an appropriate Java version which makes ConExp work again, i.e., to "build lattices again". We also show how to start ConExp with a 32 bit Java version, which requires a few additional libraries.</description>

      <title>Homotopy type theory as a language for diagrams of $\infty$-logoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that certain diagrams of $\infty$-logoses are reconstructed in homotopy type theory extended with some lex, accessible modalities, which enables us to use plain homotopy type theory to reason about not only a single $\infty$-logos but also a diagram of $\infty$-logoses. This also provides a higher dimensional version of Sterling's synthetic Tait computability -- a type theory for higher dimensional logical relations.</description>

      <title>Linear Arboreal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10088v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arboreal categories, introduced by Abramsky and Reggio, axiomatise categories with tree-shaped objects. These categories provide a categorical language for formalising behavioural notions such as simulation, bisimulation, and resource-indexing. In this paper, we strengthen the axioms of an arboreal category to exclude `branching' behaviour, obtaining a notion of `linear arboreal category'. We then demonstrate that every arboreal category satisfying a linearisability condition has an associated linear arboreal subcategory related via an adjunction. This identifies the relationship between the pebble-relation comonad, of Montacute and Shah, and the pebbling comonad, of Abramsky, Dawar, and Wang, and generalises it further. As another outcome of this new framework, we obtain a linear variant of the arboreal category for modal logic. By doing so we recover different linear-time equivalences between transition systems as instances of their categorical definitions. We conclude with new preservation and characterisation theorems relating trace inclusion and trace equivalence with different linear fragments of modal logic.</description>

      <title>Measurable splittings and the measured group theoretic structure of wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable group that admits an essential measurable splitting (for instance, any group measure equivalent to a free product of nontrivial groups).
  We show: (1) for any two nontrivial countable groups $B$ and $C$ that are measure equivalent, the wreath product groups $B\wr\Gamma$ and $C\wr\Gamma$ are measure equivalent (in fact, orbit equivalent) -- this is interesting even in the case when the groups $B$ and $C$ are finite; and (2) the groups $B\wr \Gamma$ and $(B\times\mathbf{Z})\wr\Gamma$ are measure equivalent (in fact, orbit equivalent) for every nontrivial countable group $B$.
  On the other hand, we show that certain wreath product actions are not even stably orbit equivalent if $\Gamma$ is instead assumed to be a sofic icc group that is Bernoulli superrigid, and $B$ and $C$ have different cardinalities.</description>
