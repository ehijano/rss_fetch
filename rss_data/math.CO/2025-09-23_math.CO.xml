      <title>Lifting of cycles in functional graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given function from a set to itself, we can define a directed graph called the functional graph, where the vertices are the elements of the set, and the edges are all the pairs of inputs and outputs for the function. In this article we consider functional graphs on Z/mZ with respect to polynomial functions. The main result describes the behavior of cycles in functional graphs on Z/p^nZ while $n$ is increasing, where $p$ is a prime number.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebra maps taking chromatic symmetric functions to their graph complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cho and van Willigenburg (arXiv:1508.07670) and Alinaeifard, Wang, and van Willgenburg (arXiv:2010.00147) introduce multiplicative chromatic bases for the ring $\Lambda$ of symmetric functions, consisting of the chromatic symmetric functions (CSFs) of a sequence of connected graphs $G_1,G_2,\dots$ such that $G_n$ has total weight $n$, together with the CSFs of their disjoint unions. In arXiv:1707.04058, Tsujie introduces an alternative ring structure $\widetilde{\Lambda}$ on the vector space $\Lambda$ that makes CSFs multiply over joins instead of over disjoint unions. The $\widetilde{m}_\lambda$ basis, consisting of all CSFs of weighted cliques, is a multiplicative basis for $\widetilde{\Lambda}$, as is the $r_\lambda$ basis of complete multipartite graphs studied by Penaguiao (arXiv:1803.08824) and Crew and Spirkl (arXiv:2009.14141). We show that one can get more of these "cochromatic bases" (where the starting graphs are combined by joins instead of disjoint unions, hence forming a multiplicative basis for $\widetilde{\Lambda}$ instead of $\Lambda$) if and only if the starting graphs are edgeless. We also show that $\widetilde{\Lambda}$ is a Hopf algebra with the same coproduct as $\Lambda$, and that many of the chromatic bases for $\Lambda$ generated by cliques can be taken to their corresponding cochromatic bases via Hopf algebra isomorphisms $\Lambda \to \widetilde{\Lambda}.$ We also show that there is a single Hopf algebra morphism taking the CSFs of all unweighted triangle-free graphs to the CSFs of their complements, and we give several more conditions and examples for when one can or cannot find Hopf algebra maps taking the CSFs of certain graphs to the CSFs of their complements. Finally, we show that $K$-analogues of many of the above statements also hold if one instead uses the Kromatic symmetric function (KSF) defined by Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl (arXiv:2301.02177).</description>

      <title>The Sunflower-Free Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-sunflower is a collection of $r$ sets such that the intersection of any two sets in the collection is identical. We analyze a random process which constructs a $w$-uniform $r$-sunflower free family starting with an empty family and at each step adding a set chosen uniformly at random from all choices that could be added without creating an $r$-sunflower with the previously chosen sets. To analyze this process, we extend results of the first author and Bohman arXiv:1308.3732v5 [math.CO], who analyzed a general random process which adds one object at a time chosen uniformly at random from all objects that can be added without creating certain forbidden subsets.</description>

      <title>The discrete Laplace asymptotic method and its application to the 3XOR satisfiability problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A standard way to calculate the asymptotic behavior of integrals of the form \int_Wg(x)e^{-nh(x)}dx is the (continuous) Laplace asymptotic method. However, also discrete sums like \sum_{x\in W\cap\Lambda_n}g_n(x)e^{-nh_n(x)} have similar behavior, when \Lambda_n is a discrete grid which becomes infinitely fine, and the functions g_n and h_n converge to g and h respectively. We go even further, and also derive the asymptotic formula for sums of the form \sum_{x\in W\cap\Lambda_n}S_n(x), where the summand S_n asymptotically behaves as g_ne^{-nh_n}. The motivation, and also an immediate application, will be filling in all details in the classical breakthrough paper of Dubois and Mandler from 2002, which gives the solvability (phase transition) threshold of the 3XOR-SAT problem using the second moment method. Various analytical arguments there were lightly described, but the appendix of this paper combines recent results to fill all of them in. We would expect our theorems on asymptotics to apply to other (especially combinatorial) problems as well. For example, they seem effective on 3XOR-GAME problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the approach via flipclasses to the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture for Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of all Coxeter groups. We prove the combinatorial invariance of Kazhdan--Lusztig $\widetilde{R}$-polynomials of Weyl groups modulo $q^7$ and of Kazhdan--Lusztig $\widetilde{R}$-polynomials of type $A$ Weyl groups modulo $q^8$. As a consequence, the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture holds for all intervals up to length 8 in Weyl groups and up to length 10 in type $A$ Weyl groups.</description>

Abstract: The $k$-token graph of $G$ is the graph, $F_k(G)$, whose vertices are all the $k$-subsets of $V(G)$; with two of them adjacent whenever their symmetric difference is a pair of adjacent vertices in $G$. In this paper, we study the domination number of the token graphs of the star, $S_n$, and the complete graph, $K_n$.</description>

      <title>Bicolored bosonic solvable lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent papers in solvable lattice models emphasize models where states can be visualized as colored paths through the lattice. We define a bosonic model in which there are two types of colors, one whose paths move down and to the right, the other whose paths move down and to the left. Depending on their boundary data, systems may have no states, exactly one state, or many states. We prove that these cases depend on a criterion involving two permutations extracted from the boundary data and their Bruhat order. This classification also helps us to characterize the partition functions of our systems, a question at the heart of the study of solvable lattice models. Using the solvability of the model, we derive a four-term recurrence relation on the partition function. Together with the classification of systems by number of states which serves as a base case for the recursion, the recursion completely characterizes the partition function of systems. We also show a color merging property relating the bicolored bosonic models to colored and uncolored bosonic models, and correspondence with Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness and construction of locally most reliable two-terminal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-terminal graph is a graph G equipped with two vertices in V(G) called terminals. Let T(n,m) be the set of two-terminal graphs on n vertices and m edges. Let G be in T(n,m) and let p be in [0,1]. The two-terminal reliability of G at p, denoted R_G(p), is the probability that G has a path joining its terminals after each of its edges is independently removed with probability 1 - p. We say G is a locally most reliable two-terminal graph (LMRTTG) if for each H in T(n,m) there exists a positive real number delta such that for every p in (0, delta) it holds that R_G(p) &gt;= R_H(p).
  It is simple to prove that there exists a unique LMRTTG in T(n,m) when n &gt;= 4 and 5 &lt;= m &lt;= 2n - 3. Gong and Lin [Discrete Appl. Math. 356 (2024), 393-402] further proved that there exists a unique LMRTTG in T(n,m) when n &gt;= 6 and 2n - 3 &lt;= m &lt;= n(n - 1)/2, except for some pairs of integers n and m which satisfy that n &gt;= 6 and (1/2)(n - 2)(n - 3) - (n - 2)/2 &lt;= m - (2n - 3) &lt;= (1/2)(n - 2)(n - 3) + (n - 2)/2. All cases unresolved in earlier works are covered here. In this article it is proved that in each set T(n,m) such that n &gt;= 4 and 5 &lt;= m &lt;= n(n - 1)/2 there exists a unique LMRTTG, called G(n,m). A construction of G(n,m) is also given.</description>

      <title>Exponents of $2$-multiarrangements and Wakefield--Yuzvinsky matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of hyperplane arrangements, M. Wakefield and S. Yuzvinsky utilized a square matrix in their research on the exponents of $2$-dimensional multiarrangements. Using such a matrix, they showed that the exponents of $2$-dimensional multiarrangements are as close as possible in general position for any fixed balanced multiplicity. In this article, we introduce a matrix similar to that of Wakefield and Yuzvinsky and explore its further application to the exponents. In fact, exponents of $2$-dimensional multiarrangements are calculated by verifying whether the corresponding matrices have full rank. As the main result, we introduce a new class of $2$-dimensional arrangements with an explicit sequence of multiplicities for which the exponents are closest. We also provide an alternative proof for some known results on exponents.</description>

      <title>The $S$-packing coloring of the infinite diagonal grid with $S = (1,6,6,\ldots)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a non-decreasing sequence of positive integers $S = (a_1, a_2,\ldots)$, the $S$-packing chromatic number of a graph $G$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that the vertices can be colored with $k$ colors, where the distance between any two distinct vertices of color $i$ is greater than $a_i$. In this paper, we show that the $S$-packing chromatic number of the infinite diagonal grid $P_\infty \boxtimes P_\infty$ with $S = (1,6,6,\ldots)$ is $40$. This confirms a conjecture of the first author and Tiyajamorn.</description>

      <title>Double signs of Hamiltonian circles in doubly signed complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Hamiltonian circles in the doubly signed complete graph $\Sigma_n = (K_n, \sigma, \mathbb{F}_2^2)$. A circle's double sign is defined as the sum of its edge labels. I establish conditions under which Hamiltonian circles realize all four possible double signs and prove that this occurs when the set of triangle double signs contains at least three distinct values. The proof is based on an analysis of triangle bases of the binary cycle space, structural properties of $K_4$ subgraphs, and explicit Hamiltonian constructions.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity spectral properties of $\mathcal{C}$-graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cograph is a simple graph that contains no induced path on four vertices. In this paper, we consider $\mathcal{C}$-graphs, which are a specific class of cographs, defined as $$\overline{\overline{\overline{K_{\alpha_{1}}}\cup K_{\alpha_{2}}}\cup \cdots \cup K_{\alpha_{2k}}},$$ %\text{ where } k \geq 2, \alpha_{2k}\geq 2,$$
  where $k \geq 2$, $\alpha_{2k} \geq 2$, and $K_{\alpha_{i}}$ denotes the complete graph on $\alpha_{i}$ vertices. We investigate the spectral properties of the eccentricity matrix of this particular class of cographs. Additionally, we determine the irreducibility and inertia of the eccentricity matrix of $\mathcal{C}$-graphs. Furthermore, we identify an interval $(-1-\sqrt{2},-2)\cup (-2,0)$ in which these graphs have no eccentricity eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>On Ternary Trees and Fighting Fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16667v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fighting fish is a combinatorial configuration introduced by Duchi et al. as a new model of branching surfaces that generalizes directed convex polyominoes. We come up with an alternative construction of fighting fish, using a tree structure built on the so-called stem cells of fighting fish. From this perspective, we establish a bijection between ternary trees and fighting fish with a marked strip of cells, which specializes to a direct bijection between left ternary trees and fighting fish. Using these results, we obtain a combinatorial enumeration of the fighting fish of size $n$ by establishing a $(n+1)$-to-2 bijection with the ternary trees having $n$ nodes. We present some additional enumerative results including that the fighting fish with a marked tail and the horizontally symmetric fighting fish are equinumerous with the ordered pairs of ternary trees having a total of a prescribed number of nodes.</description>

      <title>List Coloring the Cartesian Product of a Complete Graph and Complete Bipartite Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the list chromatic number of the Cartesian product of a complete graph of order $n$ and a complete bipartite graph with partite sets of size $a$ and $b$, denoted $\chi_{\ell}(K_n \square K_{a,b})$. At the 2024 Sparse Graphs Coalition's Workshop on algebraic, extremal, and structural methods and problems in graph colouring, Mudrock presented the following question: For each positive integer $a$, does $\chi_{\ell}(K_n \square K_{a,b}) = n+a$ if and only if $b \geq (n+a-1)!^a/(a-1)!^a$? In this paper, we show the answer to this question is yes by studying $\chi_{\ell}(H \square K_{a,b})$ when $H$ is strongly chromatic-choosable (a special form of vertex criticality) with the help of the list color function and analytic inequalities such as that of Karamata. Our result can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known result that $\chi_{\ell}(K_{a,b}) = 1+a$ if and only if $b \geq a^a$.</description>

      <title>Line-width and path-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For finite graphs, path-width is an interesting and useful concept, but if we extend it to infinite graphs in the most obvious way (by making the indexing path infinite), it does not work nicely. The simplest extension that works nicely is to allow the indexing set to be any totally-ordered set, and then the corresponding decomposition is called a ``line-decomposition'', and the maximum bag size needed is called ``line-width''.
  In particular, the indexing set need not be a well-order; but the corresponding decomposition would be easier to use if it was. We show that if a graph has line-width at most $k$, it admits a well-ordered line-decomposition with width at most $2k$, and this is best possible.</description>

      <title>Clique-factors in graphs with low $K_{\ell}$-independence number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $r\in \mathbb{N}$ with $r\geq 4$, we show that there exists $n_0\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for every $n\geq n_0$, every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq (\frac{1}{2}+o(1))n$ and $\alpha_{r-2}(G)=o(n)$ contains a $K_{r}$-factor. This resolves the first open case of a question proposed by Nenadov and Pehova, and reiterated by Knierm and Su. We further introduce two lower bound constructions that, along with some known results, fully resolve a question presented by Balogh, Molla, and Sharifzadeh.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proofs of Petrie Pieri rule and Plethystic Pieri rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Petrie symmetric functions $G(k,n)$, also known as truncated homogeneous symmetric functions or modular complete symmetric functions, form a class of symmetric functions interpolating between the elementary symmetric functions $e_n$ and the homogeneous symmetric functions $h_n$. Analogous to the Pieri rule for $s_\mu h_n$ and the dual Pieri rule for $s_\mu e_n$, Grinberg showed that the Schur coefficients for the ``Pieri rule'' of $s_\mu G(k,n)$ can be determined by the determinant $\pet_k(\lambda,\mu)$ of Petrie matrices. Cheng, Chou, Eu, Fu, and Yao provided a ribbon tiling interpretation for the coefficient $\pet_k(\lambda,\varnothing)$, which was later generalized by Jin, Jing, and Liu to $\pet_k(\lambda,\mu)$ in the case where $\lambda/\mu$ is connected.
  The goal of this paper is to offer a more transparent combinatorial perspective on the structure and behavior of Petrie symmetric functions. First, we provide a refined combinatorial formula for the determinant of a Petrie matrix in terms of certain orientations of the associated graph derived from the matrix. We then generalize the result of JJL to arbitrary skew shapes using purely combinatorial proofs. In addition, we investigate the generating function of these orientations with respect to certain statistics. As an application of our method, we present a combinatorial proof of the plethystic Pieri rule.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide versions of Van der Waerden's theorem and Rado's theorem for finite colorings of IP-sets and k-IP-sets. Here, by an IP-set we mean a set of integers that contains all finite sums of an infinite subset of N, and we define k-IP-sets similarly to IP-sets but allowing each summand to appear with multiplicity bounded by k - 1.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Connectivity Index of Strongly Connected Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with non-empty set of vertices $V$ and set of edges $E$. The \emph{eccentric connectivity index} of the graph $G$ is defined as $$\displaystyle{\xi^C(G) = \sum_{u \in V} d_u \;ecc(u)}$$ where $d_u$ is the degree and $ecc(u)$ is the eccentricity of the vertex $u \in V$. This article is an attempt to find the \emph{eccentric connectivity index} of strongly connected digraph $D$ with respect to the metric, \textit{maximum distance} defined by $md(u,v)=\max\{\vec{d}(u,v),\vec{d}(v,u)\}$. An attempt is also made to find the extremal values for strongly connected digraphs.</description>

      <title>Closed Walks Of Low Dimension And Twisted Moments On Self-Loop Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G_S$ be a graph with loops attached at each vertex in $S \subseteq V(G).$ In this article, we develop exact formulae for the number of closed $3$- and $4$-walks on $G_S$ in terms of vertex degrees and certain elementary subgraphs of $G_S.$ We then derive the specific closed walks formulae for several graph families such as complete bipartite self-loop graphs, complete graphs, cycle graphs, etc. We demonstrate that such invariants are non-trivial in $G_S,$ which otherwise may be trivial in the loopless case. Moreover, we study a moment-like quantity $\mathcal{M}_q(G_S)=\sum^n_{i=1} |\lambda_i(G_S) - \frac{\sigma}{n}|^q,$ twisted by the spectral moment $\mathsf{M}_1(G_S)$ for $G_S,$ and show a positivity result. We also establish that the following ratio inequality holds: \[ \frac{\mathcal{M}_{1}}{\mathcal{M}_{0}} \leq \frac{\mathcal{M}_{2}}{\mathcal{M}_{1}} \leq \frac{\mathcal{M}_{3}}{\mathcal{M}_{2}} \leq \frac{\mathcal{M}_{4}}{\mathcal{M}_{3}} \leq \cdots \leq \frac{\mathcal{M}_{n}}{\mathcal{M}_{n-1}} \leq \cdots. \] As a consequence, we obtain lower bounds for the self-loop graph energy $\mathcal{E}(G_S)$ in terms of $\mathcal{M}_i,$ extending some classical bounds.</description>

      <title>On saturation problems for matchings with regularity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $F$-saturated if $G$ is $F$-free but for any edge $e$ in the complement of $G$ the graph $G + e$ contains $F$. Gerbner et al. (Discrete Math., 345 (2022), 112921) initiated the study of $rsat(n,F)$, the minimum number of edges in a regular $n$-vertex $F$-saturated graph, and they posed the problem of for which graphs $rsat(n, F )$ exists. Regarding this problem, we obtain the precise value of $rsat(n,(m+1)K_2)$ for all possible cases, where $(m+1)K_2$ denotes a matching of size $m+1$. As a natural counterpart, we also determine the maximum number of edges in a regular $n$-vertex $(m+1)K_2$-free graph for all $m\ge 1$ and $n\ge 2m+2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malec and Tompkins (EUJC, 2023) considered the localized versions of Tur\'an-type problems, and proved a localized theorem on Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorem on paths. Zhao and Zhang (JGT, 2025) gave a long proof of a localized version of Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorem on cycles.
  In this paper, we consider several types of generalization of Tur\'an-type problems, that is, localized versions, weighted versions, and generalized Tur\'an-type problems, and their connectedness. We first present very short proofs for recent results of Malec-Tompkins and Zhao-Zhang, respectively. We use Small Path Double Cover Conjecture, which was proposed by Bondy (JGT, 1990) and confirmed by Hao Li (JGT, 1990), to prove a weighted localized Tur\'an-type theorem on paths. We prove localized versions of Balister-Bollob\'as-Riordan-Schelp Theorem (JCTB, 2003) on paths and Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorem on matchings, respectively. We show that our first localized result implies Balister-Bollob\'as- Riordan-Schelp Theorem, Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorem, and Malec-Tompkins Theorem on paths. Finally, we present generalized Tur\'an-style generalizations of the Malec-Tompkin's Theorem, and discuss the relationship between some previous theorems in different motivations.</description>

      <title>A bijection between symmetric plane partitions and quasi transpose complementary plane partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve the explicit bijection problem between symmetric plane partitions (SPPs) and quasi transpose complementary plane partitions (QTCPPs), introduced by Schreier-Aigner, who proved their equinumerosity. First, we relate this problem to Proctor's parallel equinumerosities for SPPs, even SPPs, staircase plane partitions, and parity staircase plane partitions, by constructing several bijections, one of which is based on the jeu de taquin algorithm. As a result, we reduce the task to constructing a compatible bijection between even SPPs and staircase plane partitions. We then provide non-intersecting lattice path configurations for these objects, apply the LGV lemma, and transform the resulting path configuration. This process leads us to new combinatorial objects, $I_m$ and $J_m$, and the task is further reduced to constructing a compatible sijection (signed bijection) between $I_m$ and $J_m$, which is carried out in the final part of this paper. Our construction also answers the 35-year-old open problem posed by Proctor: constructing an explicit bijection between even SPPs and staircase plane partitions.</description>

      <title>Computational results on semistrong edge coloring of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semistrong edge coloring, as a relaxation of the well-known strong edge coloring, can be used to model efficient communication scheduling in wireless networks. An edge coloring of a graph $G$ is called \emph{semistrong} if every color class $M$ is a matching such that every edge of $M$ is incident with a vertex of degree 1 in the subgraph of $G$ induced by the endvertices of edges in $M$. The \emph{semistrong chromatic index} $\chi_{ss}'(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum number of colors required for a semistrong edge coloring. In this paper, we prove that the problem of determining whether a graph $G$ has a semistrong edge coloring with $k$ colors is polynomial-time solvable for $k\le2$ and is NP-complete for $k\ge3$. For trees, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm to determine the semistrong chromatic index exactly.</description>

      <title>Two combinatorial puzzles arising from the theory of Kohnert polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work of Hanser and Mayers, we study two combinatorial puzzles arising from the theory of Kohnert polynomials. Such polynomials are defined as generating polynomials for certain collections of diagrams consisting of unit cells arranged in the first quadrant generated from an initial "seed diagram" by applying what are called "Kohnert moves". Each Kohnert move affects the position of at most cell of a diagram, attempting to move the rightmost cell of a given row to the first available position below and in the same column. In this paper, we study the combinatorial puzzles defined as follows: given a diagram $D$, form a diagram that is fixed by all Kohnert moves by applying either the fewest or most possible number of Kohnert moves. For both puzzles, we find complete solutions as well as methods for combinatorially computing the associated number of Kohnert moves in terms of the initial diagram $D$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set partition is $c$-uniform if every block has size $c$. Two families of $c$-uniform partitions of a finite set are said to be cross $t$-intersecting if two partitions from different families share at least $t$ blocks. In this paper, we establish some product-type extremal results for such cross $t$-intersecting families. Our results yield an Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem and a Hilton-Milner theorem for uniform set partitions. Additionally, cross $t$-intersecting families with the maximum sum of their sizes are also characterized.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partition function, $p_A(n)$, is defined to be the number of partitions of $n$ with parts in the set A, where $n$ is a positive integer and $A$ is a set of positive integers. It is well documented that: if A is a finite set with $\gcd(A)=1$ and $|A|=k$, then \[p_A(n)\sim \frac{n^{k-1}}{(\prod_{a\in A}a)(k-1)!}. \] Number of proofs have been obtained for this estimate. In this article, we give a new proof for the above estimate by making use of the fact that: $p_A(n)$ is a $quasi\ polynomial$ when A is a finite set. Present method of proof is purely combinatorial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit two instances of the cyclic sieving phenomenon - one on dissections of a polygon of a fixed type and one on triangulations of a once-punctured polygon. We use these results to give refined enumerations of certain families of frieze patterns. We also give an interpretation of finite, positive integral frieze patterns fixed under nontrivial rotations as frieze patterns from a family of orbifolds and show that these are always unitary. Finally, we give a bijection between Holm-Jorgensen frieze patterns and p-Dyck paths, extending a recent construction of Canadas, Espinosa, Gaviria, and Rios, and discuss an induced rotation map on Dyck paths. Several conjectures and questions for future study are highlighted throughout the article.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore labeled chip-firing on undirected $k$-ary trees, trees where every vertex has degree $k+1$. First, we extend known results for binary trees from Musiker and Nguyen, including the endgame and the locations of the smallest and largest chips, as well as relations between chips at different vertices. Then, inspired by recent work on the binary tree by Inagaki, Khovanova, and Luo, we use these properties to construct an upper bound, which we call the zigzag bound, on the number of stable configurations in labeled chip-firing on $k$-ary trees with $\frac{k^{\ell}-1}{k-1}$ labeled chips starting at the root. We further provide a novel lower bound on the number of stable configurations of $k$-ary trees, complementing our upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Generalized DP-colorings of digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the following three coloring concepts for digraphs. First of all, the generalized coloring concept, in which the same colored vertices of a digraph induce a subdigraph that satisfies a given digraph property. Second, the concept of variable degeneracy, introduced for graphs by Borodin, Kostochka and Toft in 2000; this allows to give a common generalization of the point partition number and the list dichromatic number. Finally, the DP-coloring concept as introduced for graphs by Dvo\v{r}\'ak and Postle in 2018, in which a list assignment of a graph is replaced by a cover. Combining these three coloring concepts leads to generalizations of several classical coloring results for graphs and digraphs, including the theorems of Brooks, of Gallai, of Erd\H{o}s, Rubin, and Taylor, and of Bernshteyn, Kostochka, and Pron for graphs, and the corresponding theorems for digraphs due to Harutyunyan and Mohar. Our main result combines the DP-coloring and variable degeneracy concepts for digraphs.</description>

      <title>Edge version of the inducibility via the entropy method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inducibility of a graph $H$ is about the maximum number of induced copies of $H$ in a graph on $n$ vertices. We consider its edge version, that is, the maximum number of induced copies of $H$ in a graph with $m$ edges. Let $c(G,H)$ be the number of induced copies of $H$ in $G$ and $\rho(H,m) = \max \{c(G,H) \mid |E(G)| = m\}$. For any graph $H$, we prove that $\rho(H,m) = \Theta(m^{\alpha_f(H)})$ where $\alpha_f(H)$ is the fractional independence number of $H$. Therefore, we now focus on the constant factor in front of $m^{\alpha_f(H)}$. In this paper, we give some results of $\rho(H,m)$ when $H$ is a cycle or path. We conjecture that for any cycle $C_k$ with $k \ge 5$, $\rho(C_k,m)= (1+o(1))\left( m/k\right)^{k/2}$ and the bound achieves by the blow up of $C_k$. For even cycles, we establish an upper bound with an extra constant factor. For odd cycles, we can only establish an upper bound with an extra factor depending on $k$. We prove that $\rho(P_{2l},m) \le \frac{m^l}{2(l-1)^{l-1}}$ and $\rho(P_{2l+1},m) \le \frac{m^{l+1}}{4l^l}$, where $l \ge 2$. We also conjecture the asymptotic value of $\rho(P_k, m)$. The entropy method is mainly used to prove our results.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Faces of Order and Chain Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit combinatorial description of the two-dimensional faces of both the order polytope $\mathcal{O}(P)$ and the chain polytope $\mathcal{C}(P)$ of a partially ordered set $P$. Using these descriptions, we show that for any $P$, $\mathcal{C}(P)$ has equally many square faces, and at least as many triangular faces, as $\mathcal{O}(P)$ does. Moreover, the inequality is shown to be strict except when $\mathcal{O}(P)$ and $\mathcal{C}(P)$ are unimodularly equivalent. This proves the case $i=2$ of a conjecture by Hibi and Li.</description>

      <title>Incidence theorems for multivariate polynomials over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several bounds on the number of incidences between two sets of multivariate polynomials of bounded degree over finite fields. From these results, we deduce bounds on incidences between points and multivariate polynomials, extending and strengthening a recent bound of Tamo for points and univariate polynomials. Our bounds are asymptotically tight for a wide range of parameters.
  To prove these results, we establish a novel connection between the incidence problem and a naturally defined Cayley color graph, in which the weight of colored edges faithfully reflects the number of incidences. This motivates us to prove an expander mixing lemma for general abelian Cayley color graphs, which generalizes the classic mixing lemma of Alon and Chung, and controls the total weight of colored edges crossing two vertex subsets via eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>The Sign Pattern Problem for Ehrhart Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate sign patterns of coefficients in the Ehrhart polynomial of the Cartesian product between the $r$-th pyramid over the Reeve tetrahedron and the hypercube $[0,n]^n$. This yields partial results on the sign pattern problem for Ehrhart polynomials. Moreover, we shown that for each $d\geq 4$, there exists a $d$-dimensional integral polytope $\mathcal{P}$ such that an arbitrary number of low-degree coefficients in the Ehrhart polynomial $i(\mathcal{P},t)$ are negative, while all remaining higher-degree coefficients are positive. Finally, we establish five embedding theorems that enables the sign pattern of a lower-dimensional integral polytope to be embedded into a highly-dimensional integral polytope in various ways. As an application, we provide an affirmative answer to the sign pattern problem for $d=7,8,9$.</description>

      <title>Oriented trees in digraphs with large girth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The girth of a graph $G$ is the length of a shortest cycle of $G$. Jiang (JCT-B, 2001) showed that every graph $G$ with girth at least $2\ell+1$ and minimum degree at least $k/\ell$ contains every tree $T$ with $k$ edges whose maximum degree does not exceed the minimum degree of $G$. Let $\delta^0(D)$ be the minimum semidegree of a digraph $D$ and $\Delta(D)$ be the maximum degree of $D$. In this paper, we establish a digraph version of Jiang's result, stating that every oriented graph $D$ of girth at least $2\ell+1$ with $\delta^0(D)\ge \max\{k/\ell,\Delta(T)\}$ contains every oriented tree with $k$ edges, that answers a question raised by Stein and Trujillo-Negrete in affirmative.</description>

      <title>Planar induced paths via a decomposition into non-crossing ordered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In any graph, the maximum size of an induced path is bounded by the maximum size of a path. However, in the general case, one cannot find a converse bound, even up to an arbitrary function, as evidenced by the case of cliques. Galvin, Rival and Sands proved in 1982 that, when restricted to weakly sparse graphs, such a converse property actually holds.
  In this paper, we consider the maximal function $f$ such that any planar graph (and in general, any graph of bounded genus) containing a path on $n$ vertices contains an induced path of size $f(n)$, and prove that $f(n) \in \Theta \left(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n}\right)$ by providing a lower bound matching the upper bound obtained by Esperet, Lemoine and Maffray, up to a constant factor. We obtain these tight bounds by analyzing graphs ordered along a Hamiltonian path that admit an edge partition into a bounded number of sets without crossing edges. In particular, we prove that when such an ordered graph can be partitioned into $2k$ sets of non-crossing edges, then it contains an induced path of size $\Omega_k\left(\left(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n}\right)^{1/k} \right)$ and provide almost matching upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Chow polynomials of totally nonnegative matrices and posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Huh-Stevens and Ferroni-Schr\"oter independently conjectured that the Hilbert-Poincar\'e series of the Chow ring of any geometric lattice has only real zeros, and Ferroni, Matherne and the second author extended this conjecture to the Chow polynomial of any Cohen-Macaulay poset. In this paper we address these conjectures by providing new defining relations and properties of Chow functions of posets and matrices. These are used, in conjunction with new techniques on interlacing sequences of polynomials, to prove that the Chow polynomial of any lower triangular and totally nonnegative matrix with all diagonal entries equal to one is real-rooted. This in turn is used to prove the above conjectures for a large class of posets and matroids that includes projective and affine geometries, dual partition and Dowling lattices, perfect matroid designs and paving matroids.
  A consequence of our theory is a vast generalization of a recent theorem of Athanasiadis on real-rootedness preserving properties of the Eulerian transformation, which was conjectured by the first author and Jochemko.
  We study Chow polynomials of Toeplitz matrices in greater detail. These turn out to be related to a family of generalized Eulerian polynomials with coefficients in the ring of symmetric polynomials that have been studied frequently in the literature, by e.g. Stanley, Brenti, Stembridge and Shareshian-Wachs. Hence the theory developed in this paper serves as a framework for these polynomials, which are proved to be real-rooted by our methods (when suitably specialized).</description>

      <title>Polynomial actions of rings of integers of global fields and quasirandomness of Paley-type graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to undertake an in-depth study of the phenomenon behind the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem, which, in its modern form due to Kamae and Mend\`es-France, states that if $E$ is a set of integers with positive density and $P$ is an intersective polynomial, then there are distinct elements $x, y \in E$ such that $x - y = P(n)$ for some some $n$.
  In this paper, we identify an algebraic framework (rings of integers of global fields) for Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy-type theorems. One of our main results establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial to satisfy the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over the ring of integers of a global field, providing an extension of the result of Kamae and Mend\`es-France.
  The Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy phenomenon goes beyond infinite rings and has interesting additional aspects in finite rings. As an example, classical exponential sum estimates can be used to show that large subsets of finite fields contain the asymptotically ``correct'' number of pairs $(x,y)$ whose difference is a square. In previous work, the class of polynomials satisfying this strong form of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite fields was classified. In the present paper, we establish asymptotic results characterizing sequences of finite principal ideal rings that produce ``correct'' statistics in the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem and show that these families are much more general than finite fields.
  As an application of our enhanced forms of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite rings, we produce new families of examples of quasirandom graphs of algebraic origin. The production of these new examples hinges on a two-way connection between asymptotic total ergodicity -- the phenomenon responsible for enhanced versions of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite fields and rings -- and quasirandomness.</description>

      <title>Monodromy representation of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that every vertex-transitive graph admits a representation as a coset graph. In this paper, we extend this construction by introducing monodromy graphs defined through double cosets. Our main result establishes that every graph is isomorphic to a monodromy graph, providing a new combinatorial framework for graph representation. Moreover, we show that every graph gives rise to an arc-transitive graph through its monodromy representation. Inspired by the monodromy representation of graphs, we denote an algebraic map $\mathcal{M}(G;\Omega,\rho,\tau)$ by $\mathcal{M}(G;U,\rho,\tau)$ where $U$ is a stabiliser in $G$. As an application, we prove an enumeration theorem for orientable maps with a given monodromy group. We underscore a fundamental triad in algebraic graph theory: Where there is a graph, there is a group, an arc-transitive graph, and an orientable regular map--each arising canonically from the underlying combinatorial and algebraic structures.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma_k(V)$ be the Grassmann graph whose vertex set ${\mathcal G}_{k}(V)$ is formed by all $k$-dimensional subspaces of an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ over the finite field $F_q$ consisting of $q$ elements. Denote by $\Pi[n,k]_q$ the subgraph of $\Gamma_k(V)$ formed by projective codes. We give a complete description of cliques $\langle U]^{\Pi}_{k}$ of $\Pi[n,k]_q$ consisting of all $k$-dimensional projective codes contained in a fixed $(k+1)$-dimensional subspace of $V$. We show when and in how many lines of ${\mathcal G}_{k}(V)$ they are contained. Next we prove that $\langle U]^{\Pi}_{k}$ is a maximal clique of $\Pi[n,k]_q$ exactly if it
  is contained in at most one line of ${\mathcal G}_{k}(V)$.</description>

      <title>Colour-biased Hamilton cycles in dense graphs and random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Dirac says that every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $\frac{n}{2}$ contains a Hamilton cycle. A `discrepancy' version of Dirac's theorem was shown by Balogh--Csaba--Jing--Pluh\'ar, Freschi--Hyde--Lada--Treglown, and Gishboliner--Krivelevich--Michaeli as follows. Every $r$-colouring of the edge set of every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2r} + o(1))n$ contains a Hamilton cycle where one of the colours appears at least $(1+o(1))\frac{n}{r}$ times. In this paper, we generalize this result by asymptotically determining the maximum possible value $f_{r,\alpha}(n)$ for every $\alpha \in [\frac{1}{2}, 1]$ such that every $r$-colouring of the edge set of every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $\alpha n$ contains a Hamilton cycle where one of the colours appears at least $f_{r,\alpha}(n)$ times. In particular, we show that $f_{r,\alpha}(n) = (1-o(1)) \min\{(2\alpha - 1)n, \frac{2\alpha n}{r}, \frac{2n}{r+1}\}$ for every $\alpha\in [\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2r}, 1]$.
  A graph $H$ is called an $\alpha$-residual subgraph of a graph $G$ if $d_H(v)\ge \alpha d_{G[V(H)]}(v)$ for every $v\in V(H)$. Extending Dirac's theorem in the setting of random graphs, Lee and Sudakov showed the following. The Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$, with $p$ above the Hamiltonicity threshold, typically has the property that every $(\frac{1}{2} +o(1))$-residual spanning subgraph contains a Hamilton cycle. Motivated by this, we prove the following random version of our `discrepancy' result. The random graph $G \sim G(n,p)$, with $p$ above the Hamiltonicity threshold, typically satisfies that every $r$-colouring of the edge set of every $\alpha$-residual spanning subgraph of $G$ contains a Hamilton cycle where one of the colours appears at least $f_{r,\alpha}(n)$ times.</description>

      <title>The Hom-Ext quiver and applications to exceptional collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study what we call the Hom-Ext quiver and characterize it as a type of 'superquiver'. In type $\widetilde{\mathbb{A}}$, the Hom-Ext quiver of an exceptional set is the tiling algebra of the corresponding geometric model. And, in that case, Hom-Ext quivers classify exceptional sets up to Dehn twist of the corresponding geometric model. We show that these Dehn twists are realized by twist functors and give autoequivalences of the derived category. We provide a generating set for the group of autoequivalences of the derived category in type $\widetilde{\mathbb{A}}$, and show that the Hom-Ext quiver classifies exceptional sets up to derived autoequivalence. We introduce superquivers, which are a generalization of Hom-Ext quivers. Exceptional sets over finite acyclic quivers are realized as representations of superquivers. Throughout, we list several questions and conjectures that make for, what we believe, exciting new research.</description>

      <title>Ordered Leaf Attachment (OLA) Vectors can Identify Reticulation Events even in Multifurcated Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new vector encoding, Ordered Leaf Attachment (OLA), was introduced that represents $n$-leaf phylogenetic trees as $n-1$ length integer vectors by recording the placement location of each leaf. Both encoding and decoding of trees run in linear time and depend on a fixed ordering of the leaves. Here, we investigate the connection between OLA vectors and the maximum acyclic agreement forest (MAAF) problem. A MAAF represents an optimal breakdown of $k$ trees into reticulation-free subtrees, with the roots of these subtrees representing reticulation events. We introduce a corrected OLA distance index over OLA vectors of $k$ trees, which is easily computable in linear time. We prove that the corrected OLA distance corresponds to the size of a MAAF, given an optimal leaf ordering that minimizes that distance. Additionally, a MAAF can be easily reconstructed from optimal OLA vectors. We expand these results to multifurcated trees: we introduce an $O(kn \cdot m\log m)$ algorithm that optimally resolves a set of multifurcated trees given a leaf-ordering, where $m$ is the size of a largest multifurcation, and show that trees resolved via this algorithm also minimize the size of a MAAF. These results suggest a new approach to fast computation of phylogenetic networks and identification of reticulation events via random permutations of leaves. Additionally, in the case of microbial evolution, a natural ordering of leaves is often given by the sample collection date, which means that under mild assumptions, reticulation events can be identified in polynomial time on such datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friezes are infinite arrays of numbers, in which every four neighbouring vertices arranged in a diamond satisfy the same arithmetic rule. Introduced in the late 1960s by Coxeter, and further studied by Conway and Coxeter in their remarkable papers from 1973, this topic has been nearly forgotten for over thirty years. But since the discovery of connections to cluster algebras and categories of type $A$, interest in friezes has exploded, several generalizations have been studied, and links to geometry and combinatorics have been explored.
  In this article we will review some of the most striking results connecting the purely combinatorially defined friezes with triangulations of polygons, Grassmannian cluster algebras and (Grassmannian) cluster categories. Then we will focus on Grassmannian cluster categories and some recent results linking them to friezes.</description>

      <title>Computation of Graph Polynomials via Tree Decomposition: Theory, Algorithms, and Python Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph polynomials encode fundamental combinatorial invariants of graphs. Their computation is investigated using tree and path decomposition frameworks, with formal definitions of treewidth, k-trees, and pathwidth establishing the structural basis for algorithmic efficiency. Explicit algorithms are constructed for each polynomial, leveraging decomposition order and state transformation mappings to enable tractable computation on graphs of bounded treewidth. Python implementations validate the methods, and computational complexity is analyzed with respect to sparse and k-degenerate graph classes. These results advance decomposition-based approaches for polynomial computation in algebraic graph theory.</description>

      <title>On some log-concavity properties of the Alexander-Conway and Links-Gould invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Links--Gould invariant $\mathrm{LG}(L ; t_0, t_1)$ of a link $L$ is a two-variable quantum generalization of the Alexander--Conway polynomial $\Delta_L(t)$ and has been shown to share some of its most geometric features in several recent works. Here we suggest that $\mathrm{LG}$ likely shares another of the Alexander polynomial's most distinctive - and mysterious - properties: for alternating links, the coefficients of the Links-Gould polynomial alternate and appear to form a log-concave two-indexed sequence with no internal zeros. The former was observed by Ishii for knots with up to 10 crossings. We further conjecture that they satisfy a bidimensional property of unimodality, thereby replicating a long-standing conjecture of Fox (1962) regarding the Alexander polynomial, and a subsequent refinement by Stoimenow. We also point out that the Stoimenow conjecture reflects a more structural phenomenon: after a suitable normalization, the Alexander polynomial of an alternating link appears to be a Lorentzian polynomial. We give compelling experimental and computational evidence for these different properties.</description>

      <title>On a Conjecture of Schilling Regarding the Coupon Collector's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses a conjecture by Schilling concerning the optimality of the uniform distribution in the generalized Coupon Collector's Problem (CCP) where, in each round, a subset (package) of $s$ coupons is drawn from a total of $n$ distinct coupons. While the classical CCP (with single-coupon draws) is well understood, the group-draw variant - where packages of size $s$ are drawn - presents new challenges and has applications in areas such as biological network models.
  Schilling conjectured that, for $2 \leq s \leq n-1$, the uniform distribution over all possible packages minimizes the expected number of rounds needed to collect all coupons if and only if $s = n-1$. We prove Schilling's conjecture in full by presenting, for all other values of $s$, "natural" non-uniform distributions yielding strictly lower expected collection times. Explicit formulas and asymptotic analyses are provided for the expected number of rounds under these and related distributions.
  The article further explores the behavior of the expected collection time as $s$ varies under the uniform distribution, including the cases where $s$ is constant, proportional to $n$, or nearly $n$.
  Keywords: Coupon Collector's Problem (CCP), Group Drawings, Uniform Distribution, Expected Collection Time, Schilling's Conjecture, Optimal Distribution.</description>

      <title>Stable Invariants of Words from Random Matrices II: Formulas and Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $w$ be a word in a free group. As was revealed by Magee and Puder in [arXiv:1802.04862], the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices. In the first part of the current work [arXiv:2311.17733], we demonstrated how this phenomenon is much broader: we proved more instances of such results and conjectured others. These new results and conjectures involved other topological invariants (relatives of scl) and different families of groups.
  In the current paper we further extend and support this theory. We provide another instance of the theory and prove that the stable primitivity rank, too, can be expressed in terms of stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements of groups. We introduce concrete formulas for stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements in the symmetric group $S_N$ and its generalizations in the form of the wreath products $G\wr S_N$ where $G$ is an arbitrary compact group. We also define new stable invariants related to these groups, and prove they give bounds to many of the stable Fourier coefficients.
  As an aside, we generalize to tuples of words a result of Puder and Parzanchevski [arXiv:1202.3269] about the expected number of fixed points of $w$-random permutations.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Double Whittaker Polynomials and Motivic Chern Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will describe solvable lattice models whose partition functions depend on two sets of variables, $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ and $y_1, y_2, \cdots $ that have different connections with the representation theory of $\text{GL}(n,F)$ where $F$ is a nonarchimedean local field. If the boundary conditions are chosen in one way, they are essentially the Motivic Chern classes that were used very effectively by Aluffi, Mihalcea, Sch\"urmann and Su (AMSS) to study such problems. In particular, using this specialization we can obtain deformations $r_{u,v}$ of the Kazhdan-Lusztig R-polynomials that were used by Bump, Nakasuji and Naruse to study matrix coefficients of intertwining operators (introduced by Casselman). Thus we are able see that the recursion formula for the $r_{u,v}$ is a reflection of the Yang-Baxter equation. On the other hand, with more general boundary conditions, specializing the parameters $y_i\to 0$ we recover colored lattice models that were previously used by Brubaker, Buciumas, Bump and Gustafsson to represent Iwahori Whittaker functions on $GL(n,F)$. Thus we term the resulting two-variable-set family of functions as ``double Whittaker polynomials.''</description>

      <title>Cohomology of non-finite CL-shellable posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shellable complexes are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres of possibly different dimensions, so that the (co)homology of the constant functor over the complex is concentrated in those degrees. In this work, we introduce the concept of a stable functor -a local weakening of fibrancy- over a shellable poset, which ensures the vanishing of the (co)homology of such a functor in specific degrees. In addition, we extend the notion of shellability to non-finite and non-pure posets. The methods are based on a model category structure on the category of functors indexed by a filtered poset and the combinatorial structure of CL-shellable posets. With these tools, we describe higher limits via explicit fibrant replacements. Applications include acyclicity criteria for Mackey functors, computation of cohomology of $j$-th exterior powers over arrangement lattices, and homological decompositions for Bianchi groups $\Gamma_d$ for $d=1,2,7$ and $11$.</description>

      <title>The hereditariness problem for the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the lifting problem for the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture: namely, whether the validity of the conjecture for a quotient automaton can always be transferred (or "lifted") to the original automaton. Although a complete solution remains open, we show that it is sufficient to verify the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture for three specific subclasses of reset automata: radical, simple, and quasi-simple. Our approach relies on establishing a Galois connection between the lattices of congruences and ideals of the transition monoid. This connection not only serves as the main tool in our proofs but also provides a systematic method for computing the radical ideal and for deriving structural insights about these classes. In particular, we show that for every simple or quasi-simple automaton $\mathcal{A}$, the transition monoid $\text{M}(\mathcal{A})$ possesses a unique ideal covering the minimal ideal of constant (reset) maps; a result of similar flavor holds for the class of radical automata.</description>

      <title>Rees algebras of complementary edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18048v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the Rees algebras of squarefree monomial ideals $I \subset S=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ generated in degree $n-2$, where $K$ is a field. Every such ideal arises as the complementary edge ideal $I_c(G)$ of a finite simple graph $G$. We describe the defining equations of the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(I_c(G))$ in terms of the combinatorics of $G$. If $G$ is a tree or a unicyclic graph whose unique induced cycle has length $3$ or $4$, we prove that $\mathcal{R}(I_c(G))$ is Koszul. We also determine the asymptotic depth of the powers of $I_c(G)$, proving that $\lim_{k \to \infty}\text{depth}\, S/I_c(G)^k=b(G)$, where $b(G)$ is the number of bipartite connected components of $G$. Finally, we show that the index of depth stability of $I_c(G)$ is at most $n-2$, and equality holds when $G$ is a path graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18057v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.
  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.03831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To a singular knot K with n double points, one can associate a chord diagram with n chords. A chord diagram can also be understood as a 4-regular graph endowed with an oriented Euler circuit. L. Traldi introduced a polynomial invariant for such graphs, called a transition polynomial. We specialize this polynomial to a multiplicative weight system, that is, a function on chord diagrams satisfying 4-term relations and determining thus a finite type knot invariant. We prove a similar statement for the transition polynomial of general ribbon graphs and binary delta-matroids defined by R. Brijder and H. J. Hoogeboom, which defines, as a consequence, a finite type invariant of links.</description>

Abstract: The orbital chromatic polynomial introduced by Cameron and Kayibi counts the number of proper $\lambda$-colorings of a graph modulo a group of symmetries. As a generalization of this polynomial we consider the orbital bivariate chromatic polynomial, itself specializing to the orbital independence polynomial, and establish expansions for path, stars and cycles of arbitrary size. As side results, we rediscover Fermat's Little Theorem and a "Fermat-like" congruence for Lucas numbers.</description>

      <title>Chromatic numbers of Cayley graphs of abelian groups: Cases of small dimension and rank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connected Cayley graph on an abelian group with a finite generating set $S$ can be represented by its Heuberger matrix, i.e., an integer matrix whose columns generate the group of relations between members of $S$. In a previous article, the authors laid the foundation for the use of Heuberger matrices to study chromatic numbers of abelian Cayley graphs. We call the number of rows in the Heuberger matrix the {\it dimension}, and the number of columns the {\it rank}. In this paper, we give precise numerical conditions that completely determine the chromatic number in all cases with dimension $1$; with rank $1$; and with dimension $\leq 3$ and rank $\leq 2$. For such a graph without loops, we show that it is $4$-colorable if and only if it does not contain a $5$-clique, and it is $3$-colorable if and only if it contains neither a diamond lanyard nor a $C_{13}(1,5)$, both of which we define herein. It is shown in another paper that as a special case of our theorem for dimension $3$ and rank $2$, we obtain improved upper bounds for minimal periods of optimal colorings of $6$-valent integer distance graphs.</description>

      <title>Generalised core partitions and Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study generalised core partitions arising from affine Grassmannian elements in arbitrary Dynkin type. The corresponding notion of size is given by the atomic length in the sense of [CLG22]. In this paper, we first develop the theory for extended affine Weyl groups. In a series of applications, we give some remarkable parametrisations of the solutions of certain Diophantine equations resembling Pell's equation, by refining the results of [BN22] and [Alp14], and generalising them to further types.</description>

      <title>Treewidth of generalized Hamming graph, bipartite Kneser graph and generalized Petersen graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $t,q$ and $n$ be positive integers. Write $[q] = \{1,2,\ldots,q\}$. The generalized Hamming graph $H(t,q,n)$ is the graph whose vertex set is the cartesian product of $n$ copies of $[q]$ ($q\ge 2$), where two vertices are adjacent if their Hamming distance is at most $t$. In particular, $H(1,q,n)$ is the well-known Hamming graph and $H(1,2,n)$ is the hypercube. In 2006, Chandran and Kavitha described the asymptotic value of $tw(H(1,q,n))$, where $tw(G)$ denotes the treewidth of $G$. In this paper, we give the exact pathwidth of $H(t,2,n)$ and show that $tw(H(t,q,n)) = \Theta(tq^n/\sqrt{n})$ when $n$ goes to infinity. Based on those results, we show that the treewidth of the bipartite Kneser graph $BK(n,k)$ is $\binom{n}{k} - 1$ when $n$ is sufficiently large relative to $k$ and the bounds of $tw(BK(2k+1,k))$ are given. Moreover, we present the bounds of the treewidth of the generalized Petersen graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is common if its Ramsey multiplicity, i.e., the minimum number of monochromatic copies of $H$ contained in any $2$-edge-coloring of $K_n$, is asymptotically the same as the number of monochromatic copies in the random $2$-edge-coloring of $K_n$. Erd\H{o}s conjectured that every complete graph is common, which was disproved by Thomason in the 1980s. Till today, a classification of common graphs remains a widely open challenging problem. Grzesik, Lee, Lidick\'y and Volec [Combin. Prob. Comput. 31 (2022), 907--923] conjectured that every $k$-apex of any connected Sidorenko graph is common. We prove for $k\le 5$ that the $k$-apex of any tree is common.</description>

      <title>Sharing tea on a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the analysis of consensus formation in the Deffuant model for social interaction, we consider the following procedure on a graph $G$. Initially, there is one unit of tea at a fixed vertex $r \in V(G)$, and all other vertices have no tea. At any time in the procedure, we can choose a connected subset of vertices $T$ and equalize the amount of tea among vertices in $T$. We prove that if $x \in V(G)$ is at distance $d$ from $r$, then $x$ will have at most $\frac{1}{d+1}$ units of tea during any step of the procedure. This bound is best possible and answers a question of Gantert.
  We also consider arbitrary initial weight distributions. For every finite graph $G$ and $w \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{V(G)}$, we prove that the set of weight distributions reachable from $w$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{V(G)}$.</description>

      <title>Growth Rates Of Permutations With Given Descent Or Peak Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, consider the sequences $\{d_n(I)\},\{p_n(I)\}$ where for any $n$, $d_n(I)$ and $p_n(I)$ respectively count the number of permutations in the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ whose descent set (respectively peak set) is $I \cap [n-1]$. We investigate the growth rates $\text{gr} \ d_n(I) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(d_n(I)/n!\right)^{1/n}$ and $\text{gr} \ p_n(I) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(p_n(I)/n!\right)^{1/n}$ over all $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Our main contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we prove that the numbers $\text{gr} \ d_n(I)$ over all $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ are exactly the interval $\left[0,2/\pi\right]$. To do so, we construct an algorithm that explicitly builds $I$ for any desired limit $L$ in the interval. Secondly, we prove that the numbers $\text{gr} \ p_n(I)$ for periodic sets $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ form a dense set in $\left[0,1/\sqrt[3]{3}\right]$. We do this by explicitly finding, for any prescribed $L$ in the interval, a set $I$ whose corresponding growth rate is arbitrarily close to $L$.</description>

      <title>Modified Macdonald polynomials and mu-Mahonian statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Haglund--Haiman--Loehr theorem provides the following combinatorial formula for the modified Macdonald polynomials: $$\tilde{H}_{\mu}(X;q,t)=\sum_{\sigma: \mu\rightarrow \mathbb{P}}x^{\sigma}t^{maj(\sigma)}q^{inv(\sigma)}.$$ Inspired by Martin's multiline-queue formula for the stationary distribution of multitype asymmetric simple exclusion processes, Corteel, Haglund, Mandelshtam, Mason and Williams recently introduced the queue inversion statistic $quinv$ and conjectured that the tableaux formula for $\tilde{H}_{\mu}(X;q,t)$ is invariant if the inversion statistic $inv$ is replaced by $quinv$. This was subsequently resolved by Ayyer, Mandelshtam and Martin, who proposed a stronger conjecture on the equivalence of the two refined formulas for $\tilde{H}_{\mu}(X;q,t)$.
  Our main result confirms this Ayyer--Mandelshtam--Martin conjecture. We establish an equidistribution between the pairs $(inv,maj)$ and $(quinv,maj)$ of $\mu$-Mahonian statistics on any row-equivalency class $[\tau]$, where $\tau$ is a filling of the Young diagram of $\mu$. As a byproduct of our approach, we show that if $\tau$ is a rectangular filling, the triples $(inv,quinv,maj)$ and $(quinv,inv,maj)$ have the same distribution over $[\tau]$.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks and (Virtual) Extended Formulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or maxout, are among the most fundamental models in modern machine learning. We make a step towards proving lower bounds on the size of such neural networks by linking their representative capabilities to the notion of the extension complexity $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ of a polytope $P$. This is a well-studied quantity in combinatorial optimization and polyhedral geometry describing the number of inequalities needed to model $P$ as a linear program. We show that $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any monotone or input-convex neural network that solves the linear optimization problem over $P$. This implies exponential lower bounds on such neural networks for a variety of problems, including the polynomially solvable maximum weight matching problem.
  In an attempt to prove similar bounds also for general neural networks, we introduce the notion of virtual extension complexity $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, which generalizes $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ and describes the number of inequalities needed to represent the linear optimization problem over $P$ as a difference of two linear programs. We prove that $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any neural network that optimizes over $P$. While it remains an open question to derive useful lower bounds on $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, we argue that this quantity deserves to be studied independently from neural networks by proving that one can efficiently optimize over a polytope $P$ using a small virtual extended formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work concerns a construction of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences from right to left we call the generating tree growing on the left. We first apply this construction to inversion sequences avoiding 201 and 210, resulting in a new way of computing their generating function. We then use a slightly modified construction to compute the generating function of inversion sequences avoiding 010 and 102, which was only conjectured before. These generating functions are algebraic in both instances. We end by discussing how the generating tree growing on the left can be applied in a more general setting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a generalization of cooperative games to the case where a coalition can distribute the earned utility not only among its members but also to other players. In particular, we consider an example where coalitions are required to share their winnings with non-contributing players. For these generalized games, we also provide an analogue of Scarf's theorem. It turns out that in this generalization, the existence of a non-empty core is closely related to a homotopy invariant of covers defined by the cooperative game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cycle set of a graph $G$ is the set consisting of all sizes of cycles in $G$. Answering a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Faudree, Verstra\"{e}te showed that there are at most $2^{n - n^{1/10}}$ different cycle sets of graphs with $n$ vertices. We improve this bound to $2^{n - n^{1/2 - o(1)}}$. Our proof follows the general strategy of Verstra\"{e}te of reducing the problem to counting cycle sets of Hamiltonian graphs with many chords or a large maximum degree. The key new ingredients are near-optimal container lemmata for cycle sets of such graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multi-symmetric generalization of the classical Schur functions called the multi-symmetric Schur functions. These functions form an integral basis for the ring of multi-symmetric functions indexed by tuples of partitions and are defined as certain stable-limits of key polynomials. We prove combinatorial results about the monomial expansions of the multi-symmetric Schur functions including a diagrammatic combinatorial formula and a triangularity result which completely characterizes their monomial multi-symmetric supports. The triangularity result involves a non-trivial generalization of the dominance order on partitions to tuples of partitions. We prove, using the Demazure character formula, that the multi-symmetric Schur functions expand positively into the basis of tensor products of ordinary Schur functions and describe the expansion coefficients as multiplicities of certain irreducible representations for Levi subgroups inside particular Demazure modules. Lastly, we find a family of multi-symmetric plethystic operators related to the classical Bernstein operators which act on the multi-symmetric Schur basis by a simple recurrence relation.</description>

      <title>Bounding the SNPR distance between two tree-child networks using generalised agreement forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agreement forests continue to play a central role in the comparison of phylogenetic trees since their introduction more than 25 years ago. More specifically, they are used to characterise several distances that are based on tree rearrangement operations and related quantifiers of dissimilarity between phylogenetic trees. In addition, the concept of agreement forests continues to underlie most advancements in the development of algorithms that exactly compute the aforementioned measures. In this paper, we introduce agreement digraphs, a concept that generalises agreement forests for two phylogenetic trees to two phylogenetic networks. Analogous to the way in which agreement forests compute the subtree prune and regraft distance between two phylogenetic trees but inherently more complex, we then use agreement digraphs to bound the subnet prune and regraft distance between two tree-child networks from above and below and show that our bounds are tight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strip of square stamps can be folded in many ways such that all of the stamps are stacked in a single pile in the folded state. The stamp folding problem asks for the number of such foldings and has previously been studied extensively. We consider this problem with the additional restriction of fixing the mountain-valley assignment of each crease in the stamp pattern. We provide a closed form for counting the number of legal foldings on specific patterns of mountain-valley assignments, including a surprising appearance of the Catalan numbers. We construct upper and lower bounds for the number of ways to fold a given mountain-valley assignment on the strip of stamps. Lastly, we provide experimental evidence towards more general results.</description>

Abstract: We derive a formula for computing the size of lower Bruhat intervals for elements in the dominant cone of an affine Weyl group of type $A$. This enumeration problem is reduced to counting lattice points in certain polyhedra. Our main tool is a decomposition -- or tiling -- of each interval into smaller, combinatorially tractable pieces, which we call paper boats. We also conjecture a generalization of this formula to all affine Weyl groups, restricted to elements in the lowest two-sided Kazhdan-Lusztig cell, which contains almost all of the elements.</description>

Abstract: We extend reconstruction methods for phylogenetic trees to ultrametrics of arbitrary matroids and study the stability of these data analysis methods in the combinatorial spirit of Andreas Dress. In particular, we generalize Atteson's work on the safety radius of phylogenetic reconstruction methods, as well as Gascuel and Steel's work on the stochastic safety radius, to arbitrary matroids. We also show that although the tropical Fermat-Weber points of an $M$-ultrametric sample are generally not contained in the space of $M$-ultrametrics, the intersection between the Fermat-Weber set and the space of $M$-ultrametrics is non-empty.</description>

Abstract: We study symmetric function analogues of the higher order Bell numbers. Their construction involves iterated plethystic exponential towers mimicking the single variable exponential generating functions for the higher order Bell numbers. We derive explicit recurrence relations for the expansion coefficients of the Bell functions into the monomial and power sum bases of the ring of symmetric functions. Using the machinery of combinatorial species, the Bell functions are proven to be the Frobenius characteristics of the permutation representations of symmetric groups on hyper-partitions of certain orders and sizes. In the order 1 case, we are able to give more details about the expansion coefficients of the Bell functions in terms of vector partitions and divisor sums as well as give a recurrence relation analogous to the well known recursion for the Bell numbers. Lastly, we use Littlewood's reciprocity theorem and the Hardy-Littlewood Tauberian theorem to prove that the Schur expansion coefficients of the order 1 Bell functions are certain asymptotic averages of restriction coefficients.</description>

      <title>On Weary Drivers, Records of Trees, and Parking Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work builds on a decomposition of a Cayley tree using the notion of a record, a concept closely related to the blob encoding of a tree introduced by Kreweras and Moszkowski, and Picciotto, that we explore and extend. We provide an alternative definition of parking functions and derive from it a record-preserving bijection between Cayley trees and parking functions. Finally, we use this bijection to establish an equidistribution between a sextuple of statistics on Cayley trees and a corresponding sextuple of statistics on parking functions.</description>

      <title>Splitting a graph by a given partition of the set of vertices based on the minimum weight of the induced trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method for considering a weighted directed graph with an accuracy of up to a given partition of the set of vertices is proposed. The resulting digraph (the splitting graph) does not contain arcs inside each partition element, and the arcs between the partition atoms are calculated in a special way taking into account the arcs of the original directed graph inside the atoms. This accounting is based on minimal trees defined on atoms. A study was made of what information about the original digraph is preserved in its splitting.</description>

      <title>2-switch-degree classification of split graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2-switch-degree of $G$ is the number of distinct 2-switches acting on a graph $G$. In this work we study structural properties of the 2-switch-degree, with a focus on split graphs. Our approach is motivated by the Tyshkevich decomposition, which uniquely expresses any graph as a composition $G_r \circ \ldots \circ G_1$ of indecomposable graphs, where $G_2, \ldots, G_r$ are split. Our key tool is the factor graph $\Phi(S)$, a multigraph associated with a split graph $S$ that encodes 2-switch-degree information via edge multiplicities between independet vertices of $S$. By leveraging $\Phi(S)$, we reduce the problem of classifying indecomposable split graphs to enumerating and analyzing unlabeled connected multigraphs of fixed size. Using this method, we fully classify indecomposable split graphs of degrees 1, 2, 3, and 4. Further, we introduce and investigate the $\Delta$-property, a surprising connection between Graph Theory and Number Theory that arises from $n$-simple triangles (3-cycles with uniform edge multiplicity $n$) of the factor graph.</description>

      <title>Fair coalition in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph. A dominating set of $G$ is a subset $D\subseteq V$ such that every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$. The cardinality of a smallest dominating set of $G$, denoted by $\gamma(G)$, is the domination number of $G$. For $k \geq 1$, a $k$-fair dominating set ($kFD$-set) in $G$, is a dominating set $S$ such that $|N(v) \cap D|=k$ for every vertex $ v \in V\setminus D$. A fair dominating set in $G$ is a $kFD$-set for some integer $k\geq 1$. We consider $1FD$-sets and define a fair coalition in a graph $G$ as a pair of disjoint subsets $A_1, A_2 \subseteq A$ that satisfy the following conditions: (a) neither $A_1$ nor $A_2$ constitutes a $1$-fair dominating set of $G$, and (b) $A_1\cup A_2$ constitutes a $1$-fair dominating set of $G$. A fair coalition partition of a graph $G$ is a partition $\Upsilon = \{A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_k\}$ of its vertex set such that every set $A_i$ of $\Upsilon$ is either a singleton $1$-fair dominating set of $G$, or is not a $1$-fair dominating set of $G$ but forms a fair coalition with another non-$1$-fair dominating set $A_j\in \Upsilon$. We define the fair coalition number of $G$ as the maximum cardinality of a fair coalition partition of $G$, and we denote it by $\mathcal{C}_f(G)$. We initiate the study of the fair coalition in graphs and obtain $\mathcal{C}_f(G)$ for some specific graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jacobi permutations, introduced by Viennot in the context of Jacobi elliptic functions, are counted by the Euler numbers $E_{n}$ appearing in the series expansion $\sec x+\tan x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}E_{n}x^{n}/n!$. We conduct a systematic study of pattern avoidance in Jacobi permutations, achieving a complete enumeration of Jacobi permutations avoiding a prescribed set of length 3 patterns. In the case of a single pattern restriction, we obtain refined enumerations with respect to several permutation statistics: the number of ascents (or descents), the number of left-to-right minima, and the last letter. Bijections involving certain subfamilies of binary trees and Dyck paths, as well as generating function techniques, play important roles in our proofs.</description>

      <title>Equitably Coloring Planar and Outerplanar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proper $s$-coloring of an $n$-vertex graph is \emph{equitable} if every color class has size $\lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$ or $\lceil{n/s}\rceil$. A necessary condition to have an equitable $s$-coloring is that every vertex $v$ appears in an independent set of size at least $\lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$. That is $\min_{v\in V(G)}\alpha_v\ge \lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$. Various authors showed that when $G$ is a tree and $s\ge 3$ this obvious necessary condition is also sufficient. Kierstead, Kostochka, and Xiang asked whether this result holds more generally for all outerplanar graphs. We show that the answer is No when $s=3$, but that the answer is Yes when $s\ge 6$. The case $s\in\{4,5\}$ remains open. We also prove an analogous result for planar graphs, with a necessary and sufficient hypothesis. Fix $s\ge 40$. Let $G$ be a planar graph, and let $w_0,w_1$ be its $2$ vertices with largest degrees. If there exist disjoint independent sets $I_0, I_1$ such that $|I_0|=\lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$ and $|I_1| = \lfloor{(n+1)/s}\rfloor$ and $w_0,w_1\in I_0\cup I_1$, then $G$ has an equitable $s$-coloring.</description>

Abstract: We generalize an inequality conjectured by Pohst in 1977 and recently proved by the author and independently by Battistoni and Molteni. This new inequality improves a bound for the regulator in terms of the discriminant for totally real number fields by taking into account the signs of conjugates of the fundamental unit. We give a new interpretation to the problem and exploit the combinatorial method used by Pohst.</description>

      <title>Minimizing an Uncrossed Collection of Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the following new concept in graph drawing. Our task is to find a small collection of drawings such that they all together satisfy some property that is useful for graph visualization. We propose investigating a property where each edge is not crossed in at least one drawing in the collection. We call such collection uncrossed. This property is motivated by a quintessential problem of the crossing number, where one asks for a drawing where the number of edge crossings is minimum. Indeed, if we are allowed to visualize only one drawing, then the one which minimizes the number of crossings is probably the neatest for the first orientation. However, a collection of drawings where each highlights a different aspect of a graph without any crossings could shed even more light on the graph's structure.
  We propose two definitions. First, the uncrossed number, minimizes the number of graph drawings in a collection, satisfying the uncrossed property. Second, the uncrossed crossing number, minimizes the total number of crossings in the collection that satisfy the uncrossed property. For both definitions, we establish initial results. We prove that the uncrossed crossing number is NP-hard, but there is an FPT algorithm parameterized by the solution size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine clusters in the cluster tube of rank $n+1$ using exceptional sequences in the abelian tube of rank $n+1$. Although the abelian tube has more exceptional sequences than the module categories of type $B_{n}/C_{n}$, we obtain a bijection between the set of signed exceptional sequences of any length in these categories. This bijection gives a reinterpretation of the formula of Buan-Marsh-Vatne comparing clusters of type $B_n/C_n$ with maximal rigid objects in the cluster tube of rank $n+1$. The bijection passes through the set of "augmented" rooted labeled trees.</description>

      <title>The weakness of finding descending sequences in ill-founded linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11807v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the Weihrauch degree of the problems ``find a bad sequence in a non-well quasi order'' ($\mathsf{BS}$) and ``find a descending sequence in an ill-founded linear order'' ($\mathsf{DS}$). We prove that $\mathsf{DS}$ is strictly Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{BS}$, correcting our mistaken claim in [arXiv:2010.03840]. This is done by separating their respective first-order parts. On the other hand, we show that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have the same finitary and deterministic parts, confirming that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have very similar uniform computational strength. We prove that K\"onig's lemma $\mathsf{KL}$ and the problem $\mathsf{wList}_{2^{\mathbb{N}},\leq\omega}$ of enumerating a given non-empty countable closed subset of $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ are not Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{DS}$ or $\mathsf{BS}$, resolving two main open questions raised in [arXiv:2010.03840]. We also answer the question, raised in [arXiv:1804.10968], on the existence of a ``parallel quotient'' operator, and study the behavior of $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ under the quotient with some known problems.</description>

      <title>Computing the $D$-base and $D$-relation in finite closure systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicational bases (IBs) are a common representation of finite closure systems and lattices, along with meet-irreducible elements. They appear in a wide variety of fields ranging from logic and databases to Knowledge Space Theory. Different IBs can represent the same closure system. Therefore, several IBs have been studied, such as the canonical and canonical direct bases. In this paper, we investigate the $D$-base, a refinement of the canonical direct base. It is connected with the $D$-relation, an essential tool in the study of free lattices. The $D$-base demonstrates desirable algorithmic properties, and together with the $D$-relation, it conveys essential properties of the underlying closure system. Hence, computing the $D$-base and the $D$-relation of a closure system from another representation is crucial to enjoy its benefits. However, complexity results for this task are lacking. In this paper, we give algorithms and hardness results for the computation of the $D$-base and $D$-relation. Specifically, we establish the $NP$-completeness of finding the $D$-relation from an arbitrary IB; we give an output-quasi-polynomial time algorithm to compute the $D$-base from meet-irreducible elements; and we obtain a polynomial-delay algorithm computing the $D$-base from an arbitrary IB. These results complete the picture regarding the complexity of identifying the $D$-base and $D$-relation of a closure system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem for $n$ points in the plane. It is known that any deterministic approximation algorithm whose approximation ratio depends only on $n$ requires at least $\Omega(n \log n)$ time. We propose such an algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem with runtime $O(n\log n)$ and show that it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.206})$. This improves the so far best known approximation ratio of $n/2$. We also develop an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem in higher dimensions and show it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.412})$ in all fixed dimensions.</description>

      <title>Co-Engel graphs of certain finite non-Engel groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. The co-Engel graph of $G$) with $G$ whose vertex set is $G$ and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if $[x,{}_k y]\neq1$ and $[y,{}_k x] \neq 1$ for all positive integer $k$, where $[x,{}_ky]$ is the iterated commutator $[x,y,y,\ldots,y]$, with $k$ terms $y$ in the expression; usually we delete isolated vertices (these are the left Engel elements).
  This graph, under the name ``Engel graph'', was introduced by Abdollahi~\cite{aa}. However, we argue that it is more naturally called the ``co-Engel graph''.
  We compute genus, various spectra, energies and Zagreb indices of co-Engel graphs for groups including the dihedral and generalized quaternion groups and nonabelian groups of order $pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are primes. As a consequence, we determine (up to isomorphism) all finite non-Engel group $G$ such that the clique number of the co-Engel is at most $4$ and the graph is toroidal or projective. Further, we show that the co-Engel graph is super integral and satisfies the E-LE conjecture and the Hansen--Vuki{\v{c}}evi{\'c} conjecture for the groups considered in this paper.
  We also look briefly at the directed Engel graph, with an arc $x\to y$ if $[y,{}_kx]=1$ for some $k$. We show that, if $G$ is a finite soluble group, this graph either is the complete directed graph (which occurs only if $G$ is nilpotent), or has pairs of vertices joined only by single arcs. We also show that the (directed or undirected) Engel graph of a group $G$ is the lexicographic product of a complete graph of order $Z_\infty(G)$ by the (directed or undirected) Engel graph of $G/Z_\infty(G)$, where $Z_\infty(G)$ is the hypercenter of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the periodic tiling (PT) property for finite abelian groups. A finite abelian group is said to have the PT property if every non-periodic set that tiles the group by translation admits a periodic tiling complement. This notion extends the scope beyond groups with the Haj\'os property. We give a complete classification of cyclic groups possessing the PT property and identify certain non-cyclic groups that enjoy the PT property but fail to satisfy the Haj\'os property.. As a byproduct, we obtain new families of groups for which the implication ``Tile $\Longrightarrow$ Spectral" holds. Furthermore, for elementary $p$-groups with the PT property, by analyzing the structure of tiles, we prove that every tile is a complete set of representatives of the cosets of some subgroup.</description>

      <title>Bridge indices of spatial graphs and diagram colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the Wirtinger number of links, an invariant originally defined by Blair, Kjuchukova, Velazquez, and Villanueva in terms of extending initial colorings of some strands of a diagram to the entire diagram, to spatial graphs. We prove that the Wirtinger number equals the bridge index of spatial graphs, and we implement an algorithm in Python which gives a more efficient way to estimate upper bounds of bridge indices. Combined with lower bounds from diagram colorings by elements from certain algebraic structures and clasping techniques, we obtain exact bridge indices for a large family of almost unknotted spatial graphs. We also show that for every possible negative Euler characteristic, there exist almost unknotted graphs of arbitrarily large bridge index.</description>

      <title>Vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>Divisibility relation between the number of certain surjective group and ring homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we identify the existence of a divisibility relationship between the number of ring homomorphisms and surjective group homomorphisms. We demonstrate that for finite cyclic structures, the number of ring homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a divisor of the number of surjective group homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$, where $n$ is not of the form $2 \cdot \alpha$, where each prime factor $p$ of $\alpha$ satisfies $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. We further extend this result for finite abelian structures.</description>

      <title>Parameterized complexity of isometric path partition: treewidth and diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the parameterized complexity of the Isometric Path Partition problem when parameterized by the treewidth ($\mathrm{tw}$) of the input graph, arguably one of the most widely studied parameters. Courcelle's theorem shows that graph problems that are expressible as MSO formulas of constant size admit FPT algorithms parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. This encompasses many natural graph problems. However, many metric-based graph problems, where the solution is defined using some metric-based property of the graph (often the distance) are not expressible as MSO formulas of constant size. These types of problems, Isometric Path Partition being one of them, require individual attention and often draw the boundary for the success story of parameterization by treewidth.
  We prove that Isometric Path Partition is $W[1]$-hard when parameterized by treewidth (in fact, even pathwidth), answering the question by Dumas et al. [SIDMA, 2024], Fernau et al. [CIAC, 2023], and confirming the aforementioned tendency. We complement this hardness result by designing a tailored dynamic programming algorithm running in $n^{O(\mathrm{tw})}$ time. This dynamic programming approach also results in an algorithm running in time $\textrm{diam}^{O(\mathrm{tw}^2)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $\textrm{diam}$ is the diameter of the graph. Note that the dependency on treewidth is unusually high, as most problems admit algorithms running in time $2^{O(\mathrm{tw})}\cdot n^{O(1)}$ or $2^{O(\mathrm{tw} \log (\mathrm{tw}))}\cdot n^{O(1)}$. However, we rule out the possibility of a significantly faster algorithm by proving that Isometric Path Partition does not admit an algorithm running in time $\textrm{diam}^{o(\mathrm{tw}^2/(\log^3(\mathrm{tw})))} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, unless the Randomized-ETH fails.</description>

      <title>Max-Min and 1-Bounded Space Algorithms for the Bin Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the (1-dimensional) bin packing problem, we are asked to pack all the given items into bins, each of capacity one, so that the number of non-empty bins is minimized. Zhu~[Chaos, Solitons \&amp; Fractals 2016] proposed an approximation algorithm $MM$ that sorts the item sequence in a non-increasing order by size at the beginning, and then repeatedly packs, into the current single open bin, first as many of the largest items in the remaining sequence as possible and then as many of the smallest items in the remaining sequence as possible. In this paper we prove that the asymptotic approximation ratio of $MM$ is at most 1.5. Next, focusing on the fact that $MM$ is at the intersection of two algorithm classes, max-min algorithms and 1-bounded space algorithms, we comprehensively analyze the theoretical performance bounds of each subclass derived from the two classes. Our results include a lower bound of 1.25 for the intersection of the two classes. Furthermore, we extend the theoretical analysis over algorithm classes to the cardinality constrained bin packing problem.</description>

      <title>Rigidifying simplicial complexes and realizing group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any action of a finite group on a finitely presentable group arises as the action of the group of self-homotopy equivalences of a space on its fundamental group. In doing so, we prove that any finite connected (abstract) simplicial complex $\mathbf{K}$ can be rigidified -- meaning it can be perturbed in a way that reduces the full automorphism group to any subgroup -- while preserving the homotopy type of the geometric realization $| \mathbf{K} |$. We also obtain that every action of a finite group on a finitely generated abelian group is the action of the group of self-homotopy equivalences of a space on one of its higher homotopy groups.</description>

      <title>An improved lower bound for Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1959, Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres posed a series of problems concerning the size of polynomials of the form $$ P_n(z) = \prod_{j=1}^n (1 - z^{s_j}), $$ where $s_1, \dots, s_n$ are positive integers. Of particular interest is the quantity $$ f(n) = \inf_{s_1,\dots,s_n\ge 1} \max_{|z|=1} |P_n(z)|. $$They proved that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f(n)^{1/n} = 1$, and also established the classical lower bound $f(n) \ge \sqrt{2n}$. However, despite extensive effort over more than six decades, no stronger general lower bound had been established.
  In this paper, we obtain the new bound $$ f(n) \ge 2\sqrt{n}. $$This gives the first improvement of the classical lower bound for the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem in the general case since 1959. In particular, our result confirms a remark of Billsborough et al., who observed that if the original Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres proof could be fixed, the O'Hara--Rodriguez bound would yield exactly this inequality.</description>

      <title>The Serre depth of Stanley-Reisner rings and the depth of their symbolic powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an invariant, called the Serre depth, from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra. In this paper, we establish several properties of an analogue of the depth of Stanley-Reisner rings. In particular, we relate the Serre depth both to the minimal free resolution of a Stanley-Reisner ring and to that of its Alexander dual. Also, we establish an analogue of a known result that describes the depth of Stanley-Reisner rings in terms of skeletons. Moreover, we study the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ and the depth on the symbolic powers of Stanley--Reisner ideals. It had been an open question whether the depth of the symbolic powers of Stanley-Reisner ideals satisfies a non-increasing property, but Nguyen and Trung provided a negative answer. We construct an example that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ and the depth do not satisfy this property and its second symbolic power is Cohen-Macaulay. Moreover, we prove that the sequence of the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on the symbolic powers is convergent and that its limit coincides with the minimum value. Finally, we study the Serre depth on edge and cover ideals. Whether the depth on symbolic powers of edge ideals satisfies a non-increasing property has remained an open question. We address a related problem and show that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on edge ideals of any well-covered graph satisfies a non-increasing property. In addition, we prove that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on the cover ideals of any graph also satisfies a non-increasing property. Moreover, we determine the Serre depth on edge ideals of very well-covered graphs.</description>
