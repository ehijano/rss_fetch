      <title>CSRec: Rethinking Sequential Recommendation from A Causal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The essence of sequential recommender systems (RecSys) lies in understanding how users make decisions. Most existing approaches frame the task as sequential prediction based on users' historical purchase records. While effective in capturing users' natural preferences, this formulation falls short in accurately modeling actual recommendation scenarios, particularly in accounting for how unsuccessful recommendations influence future purchases. Furthermore, the impact of the RecSys itself on users' decisions has not been appropriately isolated and quantitatively analyzed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel formulation of sequential recommendation, termed Causal Sequential Recommendation (CSRec). Instead of predicting the next item in the sequence, CSRec aims to predict the probability of a recommended item's acceptance within a sequential context and backtrack how current decisions are made. Critically, CSRec facilitates the isolation of various factors that affect users' final decisions, especially the influence of the recommender system itself, thereby opening new avenues for the design of recommender systems. CSRec can be seamlessly integrated into existing methodologies. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed implementation significantly improves upon state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>CF-KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Collaborative Filtering to Mitigate Catastrophic Forgetting in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering (CF) remains essential in recommender systems, leveraging user--item interactions to provide personalized recommendations. Meanwhile, a number of CF techniques have evolved into sophisticated model architectures based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). However, MLPs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, and thus lose previously acquired knowledge when new information is learned, particularly in dynamic environments requiring continual learning. To tackle this problem, we propose CF-KAN, a new CF method utilizing Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs). By learning nonlinear functions on the edge level, KANs are more robust to the catastrophic forgetting problem than MLPs. Built upon a KAN-based autoencoder, CF-KAN is designed in the sense of effectively capturing the intricacies of sparse user--item interactions and retaining information from previous data instances. Despite its simplicity, our extensive experiments demonstrate 1) CF-KAN's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in recommendation accuracy, 2) CF-KAN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting, underscoring its effectiveness in both static and dynamic recommendation scenarios, and 3) CF-KAN's edge-level interpretation facilitating the explainability of recommendations.</description>

      <title>LexBoost: Improving Lexical Document Retrieval with Nearest Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse retrieval methods like BM25 are based on lexical overlap, focusing on the surface form of the terms that appear in the query and the document. The use of inverted indices in these methods leads to high retrieval efficiency. On the other hand, dense retrieval methods are based on learned dense vectors and, consequently, are effective but comparatively slow. Since sparse and dense methods approach problems differently and use complementary relevance signals, approximation methods were proposed to balance effectiveness and efficiency. For efficiency, approximation methods like HNSW are frequently used to approximate exhaustive dense retrieval. However, approximation techniques still exhibit considerably higher latency than sparse approaches. We propose LexBoost that first builds a network of dense neighbors (a corpus graph) using a dense retrieval approach while indexing. Then, during retrieval, we consider both a document's lexical relevance scores and its neighbors' scores to rank the documents. In LexBoost this remarkably simple application of the Cluster Hypothesis contributes to stronger ranking effectiveness while contributing little computational overhead (since the corpus graph is constructed offline). The method is robust across the number of neighbors considered, various fusion parameters for determining the scores, and different dataset construction methods. We also show that re-ranking on top of LexBoost outperforms traditional dense re-ranking and leads to results comparable with higher-latency exhaustive dense retrieval.</description>

      <title>What makes a good concept anyway ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A good medical ontology is expected to cover its domain completely and correctly. On the other hand, large ontologies are hard to build, hard to understand, and hard to maintain. Thus, adding new concepts (often multi-word concepts) to an existing ontology must be done judiciously. Only "good" concepts should be added; however, it is difficult to define what makes a concept good. In this research, we propose a metric to measure the goodness of a concept. We identified factors that appear to influence goodness judgments of medical experts and combined them into a single metric. These factors include concept name length (in words), concept occurrence frequency in the medical literature, and syntactic categories of component words. As an added factor, we used the simplicity of a term after mapping it into a specific foreign language. We performed Bayesian optimization of factor weights to achieve maximum agreement between the metric and three medical experts. The results showed that our metric had a 50.67% overall agreement with the experts, as measured by Krippendorff's alpha.</description>

      <title>HierLLM: Hierarchical Large Language Model for Question Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question recommendation is a task that sequentially recommends questions for students to enhance their learning efficiency. That is, given the learning history and learning target of a student, a question recommender is supposed to select the question that will bring the most improvement for students. Previous methods typically model the question recommendation as a sequential decision-making problem, estimating students' learning state with the learning history, and feeding the learning state with the learning target to a neural network to select the recommended question from a question set. However, previous methods are faced with two challenges: (1) learning history is unavailable in the cold start scenario, which makes the recommender generate inappropriate recommendations; (2) the size of the question set is much large, which makes it difficult for the recommender to select the best question precisely. To address the challenges, we propose a method called hierarchical large language model for question recommendation (HierLLM), which is a LLM-based hierarchical structure. The LLM-based structure enables HierLLM to tackle the cold start issue with the strong reasoning abilities of LLM. The hierarchical structure takes advantage of the fact that the number of concepts is significantly smaller than the number of questions, narrowing the range of selectable questions by first identifying the relevant concept for the to-recommend question, and then selecting the recommended question based on that concept. This hierarchical structure reduces the difficulty of the recommendation.To investigate the performance of HierLLM, we conduct extensive experiments, and the results demonstrate the outstanding performance of HierLLM.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sequential Recommendations through Multi-Perspective Reflections and Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequence recommendation (SeqRec) aims to predict the next item a user will interact with by understanding user intentions and leveraging collaborative filtering information. Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in recommendation tasks through prompt-based, fixed reflection libraries, and fine-tuning techniques. However, these methods face challenges, including lack of supervision, inability to optimize reflection sources, inflexibility to diverse user needs, and high computational costs. Despite promising results, current studies primarily focus on reflections of users' explicit preferences (e.g., item titles) while neglecting implicit preferences (e.g., brands) and collaborative filtering information. This oversight hinders the capture of preference shifts and dynamic user behaviors. Additionally, existing approaches lack mechanisms for reflection evaluation and iteration, often leading to suboptimal recommendations. To address these issues, we propose the Mixture of REflectors (MoRE) framework, designed to model and learn dynamic user preferences in SeqRec. Specifically, MoRE introduces three reflectors for generating LLM-based reflections on explicit preferences, implicit preferences, and collaborative signals. Each reflector incorporates a self-improving strategy, termed refining-and-iteration, to evaluate and iteratively update reflections. Furthermore, a meta-reflector employs a contextual bandit algorithm to select the most suitable expert and corresponding reflections for each user's recommendation, effectively capturing dynamic preferences. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MoRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, requiring less training time and GPU memory compared to other LLM-based approaches in SeqRec.</description>

      <title>Operational Advice for Dense and Sparse Retrievers: HNSW, Flat, or Inverted Indexes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practitioners working on dense retrieval today face a bewildering number of choices. Beyond selecting the embedding model, another consequential choice is the actual implementation of nearest-neighbor vector search. While best practices recommend HNSW indexes, flat vector indexes with brute-force search represent another viable option, particularly for smaller corpora and for rapid prototyping. In this paper, we provide experimental results on the BEIR dataset using the open-source Lucene search library that explicate the tradeoffs between HNSW and flat indexes (including quantized variants) from the perspectives of indexing time, query evaluation performance, and retrieval quality. With additional comparisons between dense and sparse retrievers, our results provide guidance for today's search practitioner in understanding the design space of dense and sparse retrievers. To our knowledge, we are the first to provide operational advice supported by empirical experiments in this regard.</description>

      <title>Critical Features Tracking on Triangulated Irregular Networks by a Scale-Space Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scale-space method is a well-established framework that constructs a hierarchical representation of an input signal and facilitates coarse-to-fine visual reasoning. Considering the terrain elevation function as the input signal, the scale-space method can identify and track significant topographic features across different scales. The number of scales a feature persists, called its life span, indicates the importance of that feature. In this way, important topographic features of a landscape can be selected, which are useful for many applications, including cartography, nautical charting, and land-use planning. The scale-space methods developed for terrain data use gridded Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) to represent the terrain. However, gridded DEMs lack the flexibility to adapt to the irregular distribution of input data and the varied topological complexity of different regions. Instead, Triangulated Irregular Networks (TINs) can be directly generated from irregularly distributed point clouds and accurately preserve important features. In this work, we introduce a novel scale-space analysis pipeline for TINs, addressing the multiple challenges in extending grid-based scale-space methods to TINs. Our pipeline can efficiently identify and track topologically important features on TINs. Moreover, it is capable of analyzing terrains with irregular boundaries, which poses challenges for grid-based methods. Comprehensive experiments show that, compared to grid-based methods, our TIN-based pipeline is more efficient, accurate, and has better resolution robustness.</description>

      <title>Assessing SPARQL capabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offers significant synergistic potential for knowledge-driven applications. One possible integration is the interpretation and generation of formal languages, such as those used in the Semantic Web, with SPARQL being a core technology for accessing KGs. In this paper, we focus on measuring out-of-the box capabilities of LLMs to work with SPARQL and more specifically with SPARQL SELECT queries applying a quantitative approach.
  We implemented various benchmarking tasks in the LLM-KG-Bench framework for automated execution and evaluation with several LLMs. The tasks assess capabilities along the dimensions of syntax, semantic read, semantic create, and the role of knowledge graph prompt inclusion.
  With this new benchmarking tasks, we evaluated a selection of GPT, Gemini, and Claude models. Our findings indicate that working with SPARQL SELECT queries is still challenging for LLMs and heavily depends on the specific LLM as well as the complexity of the task. While fixing basic syntax errors seems to pose no problems for the best of the current LLMs evaluated, creating semantically correct SPARQL SELECT queries is difficult in several cases.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Bridges for Unsupervised Musical Audio Timbre Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music timbre transfer is a challenging task that involves modifying the timbral characteristics of an audio signal while preserving its melodic structure. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on dual diffusion bridges, trained using the CocoChorales Dataset, which consists of unpaired monophonic single-instrument audio data. Each diffusion model is trained on a specific instrument with a Gaussian prior. During inference, a model is designated as the source model to map the input audio to its corresponding Gaussian prior, and another model is designated as the target model to reconstruct the target audio from this Gaussian prior, thereby facilitating timbre transfer. We compare our approach against existing unsupervised timbre transfer models such as VAEGAN and Gaussian Flow Bridges (GFB). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves both better Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) and melody preservation, as reflected by lower pitch distances (DPD) compared to VAEGAN and GFB. Additionally, we discover that the noise level from the Gaussian prior, $\sigma$, can be adjusted to control the degree of melody preservation and amount of timbre transferred.</description>

      <title>A Counterfactual Explanation Framework for Retrieval Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainability has become a crucial concern in today's world, aiming to enhance transparency in machine learning and deep learning models. Information retrieval is no exception to this trend. In existing literature on explainability of information retrieval, the emphasis has predominantly been on illustrating the concept of relevance concerning a retrieval model. The questions addressed include why a document is relevant to a query, why one document exhibits higher relevance than another, or why a specific set of documents is deemed relevant for a query.
  However, limited attention has been given to understanding why a particular document is considered non-relevant to a query with respect to a retrieval model. In an effort to address this gap, our work focus on the question of what terms need to be added within a document to improve its ranking. This in turn answers the question of which words played a role in not being favored by a retrieval model for a particular query. We use an optimization framework to solve the above-mentioned research problem. % To the best of our knowledge, we mark the first attempt to tackle this specific counterfactual problem. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach in predicting counterfactuals for both statistical (e.g. BM25) and deep-learning-based models (e.g. DRMM, DSSM, ColBERT).</description>

Abstract: Frequently, users of an Information Retrieval (IR) system start with an overarching information need (a.k.a., an analytic task) and proceed to define finer-grained queries covering various important aspects (i.e., sub-topics) of that analytic task. We present a novel, interactive system called $\textit{QueryBuilder}$, which allows a novice, English-speaking user to create queries with a small amount of effort, through efficient exploration of an English development corpus in order to rapidly develop cross-lingual information retrieval queries corresponding to the user's information needs. QueryBuilder performs near real-time retrieval of documents based on user-entered search terms; the user looks through the retrieved documents and marks sentences as relevant to the information needed. The marked sentences are used by the system as additional information in query formation and refinement: query terms (and, optionally, event features, which capture event $'triggers'$ (indicator terms) and agent/patient roles) are appropriately weighted, and a neural-based system, which better captures textual meaning, retrieves other relevant content. The process of retrieval and marking is repeated as many times as desired, giving rise to increasingly refined queries in each iteration. The final product is a fine-grained query used in Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR). Our experiments using analytic tasks and requests from the IARPA BETTER IR datasets show that with a small amount of effort (at most 10 minutes per sub-topic), novice users can form $\textit{useful}$ fine-grained queries including in languages they don't understand. QueryBuilder also provides beneficial capabilities to the traditional corpus exploration and query formation process. A demonstration video is released at https://vimeo.com/734795835</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems research lacks standardized benchmarks for reproducibility and algorithm comparisons. We introduce RBoard, a novel framework addressing these challenges by providing a comprehensive platform for benchmarking diverse recommendation tasks, including CTR prediction, Top-N recommendation, and others. RBoard's primary objective is to enable fully reproducible and reusable experiments across these scenarios. The framework evaluates algorithms across multiple datasets within each task, aggregating results for a holistic performance assessment. It implements standardized evaluation protocols, ensuring consistency and comparability. To facilitate reproducibility, all user-provided code can be easily downloaded and executed, allowing researchers to reliably replicate studies and build upon previous work. By offering a unified platform for rigorous, reproducible evaluation across various recommendation scenarios, RBoard aims to accelerate progress in the field and establish a new standard for recommender systems benchmarking in both academia and industry. The platform is available at https://rboard.org and the demo video can be found at https://bit.ly/rboard-demo.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal Video Search by Examples (MVSE) investigates using video clips as the query term for information retrieval, rather than the more traditional text query. This enables far richer search modalities such as images, speaker, content, topic, and emotion. A key element for this process is highly rapid and flexible search to support large archives, which in MVSE is facilitated by representing video attributes with embeddings. This work aims to compensate for any performance loss from this rapid archive search by examining reranking approaches. In particular, zero-shot reranking methods using large language models (LLMs) are investigated as these are applicable to any video archive audio content. Performance is evaluated for topic-based retrieval on a publicly available video archive, the BBC Rewind corpus. Results demonstrate that reranking significantly improves retrieval ranking without requiring any task-specific in-domain training data. Furthermore, three sources of information (ASR transcriptions, automatic summaries and synopses) as input for LLM reranking were compared. To gain a deeper understanding and further insights into the performance differences and limitations of these text sources, we employ a fact-checking approach to analyse the information consistency among them.</description>

      <title>Multi-Margin Cosine Loss: Proposal and Application in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems guide users through vast amounts of information by suggesting items based on their predicted preferences. Collaborative filtering-based deep learning techniques have regained popularity due to their straightforward nature, relying only on user-item interactions. Typically, these systems consist of three main components: an interaction module, a loss function, and a negative sampling strategy. Initially, researchers focused on enhancing performance by developing complex interaction modules. However, there has been a recent shift toward refining loss functions and negative sampling strategies. This shift has led to an increased interest in contrastive learning, which pulls similar pairs closer while pushing dissimilar ones apart. Contrastive learning may bring challenges like high memory demands and under-utilization of some negative samples. The proposed Multi-Margin Cosine Loss (MMCL) addresses these challenges by introducing multiple margins and varying weights for negative samples. It efficiently utilizes not only the hardest negatives but also other non-trivial negatives, offers a simpler yet effective loss function that outperforms more complex methods, especially when resources are limited. Experiments on two well-known datasets demonstrated that MMCL achieved up to a 20\% performance improvement compared to a baseline loss function when fewer number of negative samples are used.</description>

      <title>PhishLang: A Lightweight, Client-Side Phishing Detection Framework using MobileBERT for Real-Time, Explainable Threat Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PhishLang, an open-source, lightweight language model specifically designed for phishing website detection through contextual analysis of the website. Unlike traditional heuristic or machine learning models that rely on static features and struggle to adapt to new threats, and deep learning models that are computationally intensive, our model leverages MobileBERT, a fast and memory-efficient variant of the BERT architecture, to learn granular features characteristic of phishing attacks. PhishLang operates with minimal data preprocessing and offers performance comparable to leading deep learning anti-phishing tools, while being significantly faster and less resource-intensive. Over a 3.5-month testing period, PhishLang successfully identified 25,796 phishing URLs, many of which were undetected by popular antiphishing blocklists, thus demonstrating its potential to enhance current detection measures. Capitalizing on PhishLang's resource efficiency, we release the first open-source fully client-side Chromium browser extension that provides inference locally without requiring to consult an online blocklist and can be run on low-end systems with no impact on inference times. Our implementation not only outperforms prevalent (server-side) phishing tools, but is significantly more effective than the limited commercial client-side measures available. Furthermore, we study how PhishLang can be integrated with GPT-3.5 Turbo to create explainable blocklisting -- which, upon detection of a website, provides users with detailed contextual information about the features that led to a website being marked as phishing.</description>

      <title>Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has achieved remarkable success in addressing the challenges of Large Language Models (LLMs) without necessitating retraining. By referencing an external knowledge base, RAG refines LLM outputs, effectively mitigating issues such as ``hallucination'', lack of domain-specific knowledge, and outdated information. However, the complex structure of relationships among different entities in databases presents challenges for RAG systems. In response, GraphRAG leverages structural information across entities to enable more precise and comprehensive retrieval, capturing relational knowledge and facilitating more accurate, context-aware responses. Given the novelty and potential of GraphRAG, a systematic review of current technologies is imperative. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of GraphRAG methodologies. We formalize the GraphRAG workflow, encompassing Graph-Based Indexing, Graph-Guided Retrieval, and Graph-Enhanced Generation. We then outline the core technologies and training methods at each stage. Additionally, we examine downstream tasks, application domains, evaluation methodologies, and industrial use cases of GraphRAG. Finally, we explore future research directions to inspire further inquiries and advance progress in the field. In order to track recent progress in this field, we set up a repository at \url{https://github.com/pengboci/GraphRAG-Survey}.</description>
