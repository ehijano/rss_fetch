      <title>Can ChatGPT pass a physics degree? Making a case for reformation of assessment of undergraduate degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of conversational natural language processing models presents a significant challenge for Higher Education. In this work, we use the entirety of a UK physics undergraduate (BSc with Honours) degree including all examinations and coursework to test if ChatGPT (GPT-4) can pass a degree. We adopt a "maximal cheating" approach wherein we permit ourselves to modify questions for clarity, split questions up into smaller sub-components, expand on answers given - especially for long form written responses, obtaining references, and use of advanced coaching, plug-ins and custom instructions to optimize outputs. In general, there are only certain parts of the degree in question where GPT-4 fails. Explicitly these include compulsory laboratory elements, and the final project which is assessed by a viva. If these were no issue, then GPT-4 would pass with a grade of an upper second class overall. In general, coding tasks are performed exceptionally well, along with simple single-step solution problems. Multiple step problems and longer prose are generally poorer along with interdisciplinary problems. We strongly suggest that there is now a necessity to urgently re-think and revise assessment practice in physics - and other disciplines - due to the existence of AI such as GPT-4. We recommend close scrutiny of assessment tasks: only invigilated in-person examinations, vivas, laboratory skills testing (or "performances" in other disciplines), and presentations are not vulnerable to GPT-4, and urge consideration of how AI can be embedded within the disciplinary context.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and general relativity (GR) in upper secondary school through new targeted teaching materials: a study on student learning and motivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmology and GR remain largely inaccessible to high-school teaching due to the advanced prerequisites to master these topics. Integrating them into upper secondary teaching is a significant challenge that remains unresolved. This contribution reports on an implementation study of a GR and cosmology course for upper secondary school students as part of an educational project launched during the centenary of GR and tested ever since for several years. The course aimed to expand students' knowledge to include current physics topics while highlighting their foundations in areas of classical physics such as Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, and waves. Targeted teaching and learning materials are focused on conceptual and qualitative understanding, while systematically combined with a mathematical treatment accessible at the upper secondary level, avoiding oversimplification. A key element is an active learning approach, incorporating activities and tasks such as engaging applications related to current research, reflective exercises, thought experiments, and hands-on tasks. The main research objective was to explore whether a conceptually deep and educationally effective GR and cosmology course could be successfully implemented for non-specialist upper secondary students. A pre-post study assessed both conceptual learning and affective outcomes, including interest, curiosity, self-concept, and perceived relevance of science. Results showed encouraging gains in both learning and motivation, with large to very large effect sizes for conceptual learning of core principles. Additionally, no or small effects of predictors such as gender were observed. We conclude that the integration of GR and cosmology into upper secondary physics teaching, in the form of courses and materials that are engaging, comprehensible, and impactful, is feasible.</description>

      <title>Assisting Tibetan Students in Learning Quantum Mechanics via Mathematica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Undergraduate students of physics in Tibet have great difficulty learning quantum mechanics (QM). We attempt to use PER-based methods to help Tibetan students learn QM. In this preliminary study, we incorporate Mathematica in a QM course at Tibet University and record students' learning experiences. Tibetan students tend to have subjective feelings of learning Mathematica, whereas Han students (majority) are more focused on the operational techniques of Mathematica. The results also suggest that both Tibetan students and Han students show limited improvement in time-independent Schrodinger equations after learning QM with Mathematica. Further effort is needed to improve the academic literacy skills of physics students in Tibet.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT-Assisted Visualization of Atomic Orbitals: Understanding Symmetry, Mixed State, and Superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For undergraduate students newly introduced to quantum mechanics, solving simple Schr\"{o}dinger equations is relatively straightforward. However, the more profound challenge lies in comprehending the underlying physical principles embedded in the solutions. During my academic experience, a recurring conceptual difficulty was understanding why only $s$ orbitals, and not others like $p$ orbitals, exhibit spherical symmetry. At first glance, this seems paradoxical, given that the potential energy function itself is spherically symmetric. Specifically, why do $p$ orbitals adopt a dumbbell shape instead of a spherical one? For a hydrogen atom with an electron in the $2p$ state, which specific $2p$ orbital does the electron occupy, and how do the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes in $2p_x$, $2p_y$, and $2p_z$ connect to the real world? Additionally, is the atom still spherically symmetric in such a state? These questions relate to core concepts of quantum mechanics concerning symmetry, mixed state, and superposition. This paper delves into these questions by investigating this specific case, utilizing the advanced visualization capabilities offered by ChatGPT. This paper underscores the importance of emerging AI tools in enhancing students' understanding of abstract principles.</description>
