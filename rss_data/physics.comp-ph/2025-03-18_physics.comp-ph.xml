      <title>Benchmarking semi-empirical quantum chemical methods on liquid water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated by the renewed interest and recent developments in semi-empirical quantum chemical (SQC) methods for noncovalent interactions, we examine the properties of liquid water at ambient conditions by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, both with the conventional NDDO-type (neglect of diatomic differential overlap) methods, e.g. AM1 and PM6, and with DFTB-type (density-functional tight-binding) methods, e.g. DFTB2 and GFN-xTB. Besides the original parameter sets, some specifically reparametrized SQC methods (denoted as AM1-W, PM6-fm, and DFTB2-iBi) targeting various smaller water systems ranging from molecular clusters to bulk are considered as well. The quality of these different SQC methods for describing liquid water properties at ambient conditions are assessed by comparison to well-established experimental data and also to BLYP-D3 density functional theory-based ab initio MD simulations. Our analyses reveal that static and dynamics properties of bulk water are poorly described by all considered SQC methods with the original parameters, regardless of the underlying theoretical models, with most of the methods suffering from too weak hydrogen bonds and hence predicting a far too fluid water with highly distorted hydrogen bond kinetics. On the other hand, the reparametrized force-matchcd PM6-fm method is shown to be able to quantitatively reproduce the static and dynamic features of liquid water, and thus can be used as a computationally efficient alternative to electronic structure-based MD simulations for liquid water that requires extended length and time scales. DFTB2-iBi predicts a slightly overstructured water with reduced fluidity, whereas AM1-W gives an amorphous ice-like structure for water at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Forecasting for Dynamical Systems with Missing or Imperfect Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of dynamical systems is essential in many fields, but applying machine learning techniques is often challenging due to incomplete or noisy data. This study introduces a variant of stochastic interpolation (SI) for probabilistic forecasting, estimating future states as distributions rather than single-point predictions. We explore its mathematical foundations and demonstrate its effectiveness on various dynamical systems, including the challenging WeatherBench dataset.</description>

      <title>Carbon capture capacity estimation of taiga reforestation and afforestation at the western boreal edge using spatially explicit carbon budget modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canada's northern boreal has considerable potential for tree planting related climate change mitigation solutions, considering the sparsity of trees and large portions of non-forested land at the northern forest edge. Moreover, afforestation at the northern boreal edge would enable further the observed gradual tree-line advancement of the taiga into the southern arctic, assisting forests in their migration northward while capitalizing on their carbon capture capacity. However, significant uncertainties remain about the carbon capture capacity of large-scale tree planting in the northern boreal ecozones under changing climatic conditions due to lack of spatially explicit ecozone specific modeling. In this paper, we provide monte carlo estimates of carbon capture capacity of taiga reforestation and afforestation at the north-western boreal edge using spatially explicit carbon budget modeling. We combine satellite-based forest inventory data and probabilistic fire regime representations to simulate how total ecosystem carbon (TEC) might evolve from 2025 until 2100 under different scenarios composed of fire return intervals (FRI), historical land classes, planting mortality, and climatic variables. Our findings suggest that afforestation at the north-western boreal edge could provide meaningful carbon sequestration toward Canada's climate targets, potentially storing approximately 3.88G Tonnes of $CO_{2}$e over the next 75 years in the average case resulting from afforestation on approximately 6.4M hectares, with the Northwest Territories (NT)-Taiga Shield West (TSW) zone showing the most potential. Further research is needed to refine these estimates using improved modeling, study economic viability of such a project, and investigate the impact on other regional processes such as permafrost thaw, energy fluxes, and albedo feedbacks.</description>

      <title>Proposal for the Application of Fractional Operators in Polynomial Regression Models to Enhance the Determination Coefficient $R^2$ on Unseen Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since polynomial regression models are generally quite reliable for data with a linear trend, it is important to note that, in some cases, they may encounter overfitting issues during the training phase, which could result in negative values of the coefficient of determination $R^2$ for unseen data. For this reason, this work proposes the partial implementation of fractional operators in polynomial regression models to generate a fractional regression model. The goal of this proposal is to attempt to mitigate overfitting, which could improve the value of the coefficient of determination for unseen data, compared to the polynomial model, under the assumption that this would contribute to generating predictive models with better performance. The methodology for constructing these fractional regression models is detailed, and examples applicable to both Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional operators are presented.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Sheds Light on Integer and Fractional Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic topological phases of matter, characterized by robust boundary states derived from topologically nontrivial bulk states, are pivotal for next-generation electronic devices. However, understanding their complex quantum phases, especially at larger scales and fractional fillings with strong electron correlations, has long posed a formidable computational challenge. Here, we employ a deep learning framework to express the many-body wavefunction of topological states in twisted ${\rm MoTe_2}$ systems, where diverse topological states are observed. Leveraging neural networks, we demonstrate the ability to identify and characterize topological phases, including the integer and fractional Chern insulators as well as the $Z_2$ topological insulators. Our deep learning approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, not only in computational efficiency but also in accuracy, enabling us to study larger systems and differentiate between competing phases such as fractional Chern insulators and charge density waves. Our predictions align closely with experimental observations, highlighting the potential of deep learning techniques to explore the rich landscape of topological and strongly correlated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Noise-strength-adapted approximate quantum codes inspired by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that machine learning provides a powerful tool for discovering new approximate quantum error-correcting (AQEC) codes beyond conventional algebraic frameworks. Building upon results from hybrid quantum-classical learning, we construct two novel types of noise-strength-adapted (NSA) AQEC codes, namely a self-complementary code and a pair-complementary code, which can outperform conventional codes for amplitude damping (AD) noise. The 4-qubit self-complementary NSA code outperforms its non-NSA counterpart in fidelity and Knill-Laflamme condition violation. The pair-complementary code, which has no known non-NSA analog, achieves even better performance with higher-order loss suppression and better fidelity. We further generalize both approaches to families of NSA AD codes of arbitrary system size, as well as an NSA variant of the 0-2-4 binomial code for single-photon loss. Our results demonstrate that adaptation to noise strength can lead to significant improvements in error correction capability, and highlight how machine learning can help discover new valuable codes that may be missed through conventional algebraic approaches.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Small-Angle Scattering for Accelerated Soft Material Formulation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pace of soft material formulation (re)development and design is rapidly increasing as both consumers and new legislation demand products that do less harm to the environment while maintaining high standards of performance. To meet this need, we have developed the Autonomous Formulation Lab (AFL), a platform that can automatically prepare and measure the microstructure of liquid formulations using small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering and, soon, a variety of other techniques. Here, we describe the design, philosophy, tuning, and validation of our active learning agent that guides the course of AFL experiments. We show how our extensive in silico tuning results in an efficient agent that is robust to both the number of measurements and signal to noise variation. Finally, we experimentally validate our virtually tuned agent by addressing a model formulation problem: replacing a petroleum-derived component with a natural analog. We show that the agent efficiently maps both formulations and how post hoc analysis of the measured data reveals the opportunity for further specialization of the agent. With the tuned and proven active learning agent, our autonomously guided AFL platform will accelerate the pace of discovery of liquid formulations and help speed us towards a greener future.</description>

      <title>Trilinear coupling and toroidicity in multiferroics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric responses are related in general to magnetic multipoles, and in particular the off-diagonal linear response is proportional to the toroidization order parameter. In multiferroics with three order parameters (polarization, magnetization, and toroidization), such response turns out to be also proportional to the trilinear coupling between the order parameters. Here we explore this scenario, discussing the effects of such trilinear coupling within a Landau theory framework, and using ab initio calculations to discuss a specific model system for this effect, namely the recently predicted three-order-parameter multiferroic metal Bi$_5$Mn$_5$O$_{17}$.</description>

      <title>Neural Operator Modeling of Platelet Geometry and Stress in Shear Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thrombosis involves processes spanning large-scale fluid flow to sub-cellular events such as platelet activation. Traditional CFD approaches often treat blood as a continuum, which can limit their ability to capture these microscale phenomena. In this paper, we introduce a neural operator-based surrogate model to bridge this gap. Our approach employs DeepONet, trained on high-fidelity particle dynamics simulations performed in LAMMPS under a single shear flow condition. The model predicts both platelet membrane deformation and accumulated stress over time, achieving a mode error of ~0.3% under larger spatial filtering radii. At finer scales, the error increases, suggesting a correlation between the DeepONet architecture's capacity and the spatial resolution it can accurately learn. These findings highlight the importance of refining the trunk network to capture localized discontinuities in stress data. Potential strategies include using deeper trunk nets or alternative architectures optimized for graph-structured meshes, further improving accuracy for high-frequency features. Overall, the results demonstrate the promise of neural operator-based surrogates for multi-scale platelet modeling. By reducing computational overhead while preserving accuracy, our framework can serve as a critical component in future simulations of thrombosis and other micro-macro fluid-structure problems.</description>

      <title>Photostriction Facilitates Relaxation of Lattice Distortion in Two-Dimensional Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photostriction effect, a light-induced mechanical deformation in materials, originates from the intricate interplay between lattice structure and electronic excitation. In photovoltaic semiconductors, this effect plays a crucial role in shaping non-equilibrium structural responses, yet its fundamental mechanism remains elusive. Here, we uncover lattice expansion and structural reconfiguration in two-dimensional (2D) perovskites driven by photoinduced excitation using first-principles calculations. Our findings reveal that the photoinduced carriers lead to a substantial lattice expansion by about 2%. The expanded lattice facilitates strain relaxation with the amplitude of 20% by increasing interatomic distances and reducing internal stresses, thereby enhancing structural stability. The lattice dynamics can be systematically engineered through photodoping density, unveiling a new pathway to modulate light-matter interactions in 2D perovskites. These insights not only advance the understanding of optically driven structural dynamics but also offer a guiding principle for optimizing next-generation high-efficiency photovoltaic devices and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Non-van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond the study of individual materials, their interfaces and arising functionality are crucial enablers of fundamental science and technological applications. Recently, the arena of two-dimensional (2D) materials was extended to so-called non-van der Waals (non-vdW) compounds derived from strongly bonded non-layered bulk crystals. These nanosystems with their active surfaces complement now - through their chemically bonded heterostructure (HS) interfaces - the established space of weakly interacting vdW HSs. Here, we study a wide range of 55 candidate non-vdW HSs with autonomous density functional calculations and find that the resulting interfacial chemical hybridization and bonding is the key factor determining their electronic and magnetic properties. It gives rise to the formation of hybrid interface bands, strong magnetic coupling, and substantial electronic as well as magnetic moire surface property modulations upon twisting. Our work thus provides a significant step towards charting the new interface class of non-vdW HSs.</description>

      <title>Impact of structural distortions on the correlated electronic structure of orbital-selective Mott insulating Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ under strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.</description>

      <title>On Local Minimum Entropy Principle of High-Order Schemes for Relativistic Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the minimum entropy principle (MEP) for the relativistic Euler equations with a broad class of equations of state (EOSs) and addresses the challenge of preserving the local version of the discovered MEP in high-order numerical schemes. At the continuous level, we find out a family of entropy pairs for the relativistic Euler equations and provide rigorous analysis to prove the strict convexity of entropy under a necessary and sufficient condition. At the numerical level, we develop a rigorous framework for designing provably entropy-preserving high-order schemes that ensure both physical admissibility and the discovered MEP. The relativistic effects, coupled with the abstract and general EOS formulation, introduce significant challenges not encountered in the nonrelativistic case or with the ideal EOS. In particular, entropy is a highly nonlinear and implicit function of the conservative variables, making it particularly difficult to enforce entropy preservation. To address these challenges, we establish a series of auxiliary theories via highly technical inequalities. Another key innovation is the use of geometric quasi-linearization (GQL), which reformulates the nonlinear constraints into equivalent linear ones by introducing additional free parameters. These advancements form the foundation of our entropy-preserving analysis. We propose novel, robust, locally entropy-preserving high-order frameworks. A central challenge is accurately estimating the local minimum of entropy, particularly in the presence of shock waves at unknown locations. To address this, we introduce two new approaches for estimating local lower bounds of specific entropy, which prove effective for both smooth and discontinuous problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our entropy-preserving methods maintain high-order accuracy while effectively suppressing spurious oscillations.</description>

      <title>TBHubbard: tight-binding and extended Hubbard model database for metal-organic frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers. Their diverse compositions and structures offer a wide range of applications, such as electrical conductivity and diffusion, which can be optimized by tuning the combination of different building blocks. The ease of modifying metal centers or organic linkers makes MOFs ideal for property prediction and inverse material design through computational modeling. Data science driven techniques can aid in the exploration of novel structures with optimize properties by employing machine learning models and using available simulation data in the literature. Here, we provide an extensive data collection with the simulation of MOFs, derived from the QMOF database, based on density-functional-theory, along with their corresponding tight-binding lattice Hamiltonian, offering insights into the electronic structure of each material. The topology information is augmented by the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors which are used as fingerprints of the local environment. Besides, the Extended Hubbard model is also used to describe a sub-set of MOFs with transition metals, where the Hubbard parameters intra-site U and inter-site V are computed. Due to the highly computational cost associated with the Hubbard calculations and the comprehensive amount of data for the tight-binding Hamiltonian, the database provided here stands as a significant contribution not only for the training of ML models to predict new properties but also to perform inverse design of new MOFs with enhanced target properties.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nanostructures in High-Entropy Alloys via Machine-Learning Accelerated Scalable Monte Carlo Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale simulations are a powerful tool for understanding material behavior and designing new materials. However, the computational limitations of atomistic-scale simulations stemming from constraints in computational power, algorithmic efficiency, and accuracy, prevent us from modeling large systems, even at ground state,(DFT)-level precision. Here, we introduce an efficient and Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC) method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks inherent in conventional MC simulation algorithms, reducing the computational complexity of an MC sweep from cubic to linear. Leveraging the large degree of parallelization inherent in our method, we present a GPU accelerated implementation, SMC_GPU, which enables the simulation of atomistic systems exceeding one billion atoms while maintaining the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT). Using this unprecedented capability, we perform large-scale thermodynamic simulations to investigate the microstructure evolution in the FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW high entropy alloys (HEAs). Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanoscale phenomena, including short-range and long-range order, nanoparticles, and nanophases. The size, composition, and morphology of these nanostructures, which can comprise millions of atoms and thus present significant challenges for traditional methods, are analyzed with high-accuracy atomistic simulations for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Our simulations produce thermodynamic properties and nanostructures that align well with available theoretical and experimental data. More intriguingly, our results reveal that the intricate nanoscale interplay of order and disorder in HEA stems from the combined effects of chemical complexity and temperature. This work underscores the promising potential of large-scale MC simulation for HEAs.let alone at finite temperatures, with density functional theory</description>

      <title>Thermal-induced ion magnetic moment in H$_4$O superionic state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrogen ions in the superionic ice can move freely, playing the role of electrons in metals. Its electromagnetic behavior is the key to explaining the anomalous magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune. Based on the ab initio evolutionary algorithm, we searched for the stable H4O crystal structure under pressures of 500-5000 GPa and discovered a new layered chain $Pmn2_1$-H$_4$O structure with H$_3$ ion clusters. Interestingly, H3 ion clusters rotate above 900 K (with an instantaneous speed of 3000 m/s at 900 K), generating an instantaneous magnetic moment ($10^{-26}$ Am$^2 \approx 0.001 \mu_B$). Moreover, H ions diffuse in a direction perpendicular to the H-O atomic layer at 960-1000 K. This is because the hydrogen oxygen covalent bonds within the hydrogen oxygen plane hinder the diffusion behavior of H$_3$ ion clusters within the plane, resulting in the diffusion of H$_3$ ion clusters between the hydrogen oxygen planes and the formation of a one-dimensional conductive superionic state. One-dimensional diffusion of ions may generate magnetic fields. We refer to these two types of magnetic moments as "thermal-induced ion magnetic moments". When the temperature exceeds 1000 K, H ions diffuse in three directions. When the temperature exceeds 6900 K, oxygen atoms diffuse and the system becomes fluid. These findings provide important references for people to re-recognize the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen and oxygen under high pressure, as well as the sources of abnormal magnetic fields in Uranus and Neptune.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce matrix quantum phase-space distributions. These extend the idea of a quantum phase-space representation via projections onto a density matrix of global symmetry variables. The method is applied to verification of low-loss Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) quantum computational advantage experiments with up to 10,000 modes, where classically generating photon-number counts is exponentially hard. We demonstrate improvements in sampling error by a factor of 1000 or more compared to unprojected methods, which are infeasible for such cases.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Stability of Geopolymer Activator Solutions for Optimised Synthesis through Thermodynamic Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geopolymers are an emerging class of binding materials used in sustainable cements, concretes, and composites. However, despite growing research, the lack of standardised processes and stability analyses for formulating activator solutions - a crucial component of geopolymer systems - remains a barrier to quality control and research advancement. This study presents an experimentally validated energy balance with thermodynamic phenomenon mathematically modelled for synthesising consistent geopolymer activator solutions. The model's general applicability enables dynamic assessments of user-specified systems, offering stability metrics for quality control in laboratory and industrial settings. Fundamentally, the mathematical model can be used towards batching optimisation under user-defined conditions where dissolution of geopolymer precursors can be maximised via solution preparation and batching optimisation. The model results quantify experimentally validated temperature dynamics, thermodynamic stability, and process design/batching optimisation, challenging traditional practices in the literature that rely on undefined equilibration periods. Key findings demonstrate that stable, ready-to-use activator solutions can be achieved in as little as 1 minute, compared to the typically used 24-hour batching periods. This research paves the way towards standardised activator solution preparation and supports the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for geopolymer synthesis, promoting consistency and scalability in geopolymer technology.</description>

      <title>Tunable topological protection in Rydberg lattices via a novel quantum Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have recently been conjectured to host $Z_2$ quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in certain parameter regimes. Due to the strong interactions between these atoms, it is not possible to analytically study these systems, and one must resort to Monte Carlo sampling of the path integral to reach definite conclusions. We use a tailored update, specifically designed to target the low energy excitations of the QSL. This allows us to reliably simulate Rydberg atoms on a triangular lattice in the proposed QSL regime. We identify a correlated paramagnetic phase at low temperatures which hosts topological protection similar to a $Z_2$ spin liquid up to a length scale tuned by Hamiltonian parameters. However, this correlated paramagnet seems to be continuously connected to the trivial paramagnetic regime and thus does not seem to be a true QSL. This result indicates the feasibility of Rydberg atom arrays to act as topological qubits.</description>

      <title>High-performance and reliable probabilistic Ising machine based on simulated quantum annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic computing with pbits is emerging as a computational paradigm for machine learning and for facing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with the so-called probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs). From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled pbits, and the energy minimization algorithm. Regarding the latter, in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems, planted Ising problem, and travelling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the architecture of a fully connected CMOS based PIM able to run the SQA algorithm having a spin-update time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are hardware agnostic and can be applied in the co-design of any hybrid analog digital Ising machine implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation of reliable and scalable PIMs.</description>

      <title>Giant energy density nitride dielectrics enabled by a paraelectric-metaparaelectric phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrostatic dielectric capacitors are foundational to advance the electronics and electric power devices due to their ultrafast charging/discharging capability and high-power density. However, the low energy density limits the potential for next generation devices in terms of miniaturization and integration. We propose a strategy that relies on inducing a field-driven phase transition that we denote paraelectric-metaparaelectric, which yields an ultrahigh energy density in III-nitrides. III-nitride compounds (Al, Sc, B)N with certain cation concentrations possess a nonpolar hexagonal ground phase which could transform into a polar wurtzite phase under a very large electric field, which is denoted as metaparaelectric with nearly null hysteresis P-E loop. This paraelectric-metaparaelectric transition leads to a polarization saturation at large electric field. The corresponding P-E loop displays a giant energy density of 308 J/cm$^3$ with high efficiency nearly 100%. The proposed paraelectric-metaparaelectric phase transition strategy in nitrides opens an avenue to design of next generation high performance dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Emergent B2 chemical orderings in the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys studied via first-principles theory and atomistic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys using a combination of \textit{ab initio} electronic structure theory -- namely a concentration wave analysis -- and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. Our multiscale approach is suitable both for examining atomic short-range order in the solid solution, as well as for studying the emergence of long-range crystallographic order with decreasing temperature. In both alloys considered in this work, in alignment with experimental observations, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging at high temperatures, which is driven primarily by Al and Ti, with other elements expressing weaker site preferences. The predicted B2 ordering temperature for AlTiVNb is higher than that for AlTiCrMo. These chemical orderings are discussed in terms of the alloys' electronic structure, with hybridisation between the $sp$ states of Al and the $d$ states of the transition metals understood to play an important role. Within our modelling, the chemically ordered B2 phases for both alloys have an increased predicted residual resistivity compared to the A2 (disordered bcc) phases. These increased resistivity values are understood to originate in a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, in conjunction with qualitative changes to the alloys' smeared-out Fermi surfaces. These results highlight the close connections between composition, structure, and physical properties in this technologically relevant class of materials.</description>

      <title>Robust Machine Learning Inference from X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectra through Featurization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a commonly-employed technique for characterizing functional materials. In particular, x-ray absorption near edge spectra (XANES) encodes local coordination and electronic information and machine learning approaches to extract this information is of significant interest. To date, most ML approaches for XANES have primarily focused on using the raw spectral intensities as input, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating spectral transformations and dimensionality reduction techniques into ML predictions. In this work, we focused on systematically comparing the impact of different featurization methods on the performance of ML models for XAS analysis. We evaluated the classification and regression capabilities of these models on computed datasets and validated their performance on previously unseen experimental datasets. Our analysis revealed an intriguing discovery: the cumulative distribution function (CDF) feature achieves both high prediction accuracy and exceptional transferability. This remarkably robust performance can be attributed to its tolerance to horizontal shifts in spectra, which is crucial when validating models using experimental data. While this work exclusively focuses on XANES analysis, we anticipate that the methodology presented here will hold promise as a versatile asset to the broader spectroscopy community.</description>

      <title>Performance of wave function and Green's functions based methods for non equilibrium many-body dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical descriptions of non equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems essentially employ either (i) explicit treatments, relying on truncation of the expansion of the many-body wave function, (ii) compressed representations of the many-body wave function, or (iii) evolution of an effective (downfolded) representation through Green's functions. In this work, we select representative cases of each of the methods and address how these complementary approaches capture the dynamics driven by intense field perturbations to non equilibrium states. Under strong driving, the systems are characterized by strong entanglement of the single particle density matrix and natural populations approaching those of a strongly interacting equilibrium system. We generate a representative set of results that are numerically exact and form a basis for critical comparison of the distinct families of methods. We demonstrate that the compressed formulation based on similarity transformed Hamiltonians (coupled cluster approach) is practically exact in weak fields and, hence, weakly or moderately correlated systems. Coupled cluster, however, struggles for strong driving fields, under which the system exhibits strongly correlated behavior, as measured by the von Neumann entropy of the single particle density matrix. The dynamics predicted by Green's functions in the (widely popular) GW approximation are less accurate by improve significantly upon the mean-field results in the strongly driven regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of experimental results with Python often requires writing many code scripts which all need access to the same set of functions. In a common field of research, this set will be nearly the same for many users. The qspec Python package was developed to provide functions for physical formulas, simulations and data analysis routines widely used in laser spectroscopy and related fields. Most functions are compatible with numpy arrays, enabling fast calculations with large samples of data. A multidimensional linear regression algorithm enables a King plot analyses over multiple atomic transitions. A modular framework for constructing lineshape models can be used to fit large sets of spectroscopy data. A simulation module within the package provides user-friendly methods to simulate the coherent time-evolution of atoms in electro-magnetic fields without the need to explicitly derive a Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Velocity Jumps approach, denoted as JUMP, a new class of Molecular dynamics integrators, replacing the Langevin dynamics by a hybrid model combining a classical Langevin diffusion and a piecewise deterministic Markov process, where the expensive computation of long-range pairwise interactions is replaced by a resampling of the velocities at random times. This framework allows for an acceleration in the simulation speed while preserving sampling and dynamical properties such as the diffusion constant. It can also be integrated in classical multi-timestep methods, pushing further the computational speedup, while avoiding some of the resonance issues of the latter thanks to the random nature of jumps. The JUMP, JUMP-RESPA and JUMP-RESPA1 integrators have been implemented in the GPU-accelerated version of the Tinker-HP package and are shown to provide significantly enhanced performances compared to their BAOAB, BAOAB-RESPA and BAOAB-RESPA1 counterparts respectively.</description>

Abstract: Inverse design enables automating the discovery and optimization of devices achieving performance significantly exceeding that of traditional human-engineered designs. However, existing methodologies to inverse design electromagnetic devices require computationally expensive and time-consuming full-wave electromagnetic simulation at each inverse design iteration or generation of large datasets for training neural-network surrogate models. This work introduces the Precomputed Numerical Green Function method, an approach for ultrafast electromagnetic inverse design. The static components of the design are incorporated into a numerical Green function obtained from a single fully parallelized precomputation step, reducing the cost of evaluating candidate designs during optimization to only being proportional to the size of the region under modification. A low-rank matrix update technique is introduced that further decreases the cost of the method to milliseconds per iteration without any approximations or compromises in accuracy. The complete method is shown to have linear time complexity, reducing the total runtime for an inverse design by several orders of magnitude compared to using conventional electromagnetics solvers. The design examples considered demonstrate speedups of up to 16,000x, lowering the design process from multiple days to weeks down to minutes. The approach stands to transform inverse design in electromagnetics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing nuclear cross-section predictions with deep learning: the DINo algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of nuclear reaction cross-sections is crucial for applications such as hadron therapy, radiation protection, and nuclear reactor design. Despite continuous advancements in nuclear physics, significant discrepancies persist between experimental data and theoretical models such as TENDL, and ENDF/B. These deviations introduce uncertainties in Monte Carlo simulations widely used in nuclear physics and medical applications. In this work, DINo (Deep learning Intelligence for Nuclear reactiOns) is introduced as a deep learning-based algorithm designed to improve cross-section predictions by learning correlations between charge-changing and total cross-sections. Trained on the TENDL-2021 dataset and validated against experimental data from the EXFOR database, DINo demonstrates a significant improvement in predictive accuracy over conventional nuclear models. The results show that DINo systematically achieves lower chi2 values compared to TENDL-2021 across multiple isotopes, particularly for proton-induced reactions on a 12C target. Specifically, for 11C production, DINo reduces the discrepancy with experimental data by \sim 28\% compared to TENDL-2021. Additionally, DINo provides improved predictions for other relevant isotopes produced, such as 4He, 6Li, 9Be, and 10B, which play a crucial role in modeling nuclear fragmentation processes. By leveraging neural networks, DINo offers fast cross-section predictions, making it a promising complementary tool for nuclear reaction modeling. However, the algorithm's performance evaluation is sensitive to the availability of experimental data, with increased uncertainty in sparsely measured energy ranges. Future work will focus on refining the model through data augmentation, expanding its applicability to other reaction channels, and integrating it into Monte Carlo transport codes for real-time nuclear data processing.</description>

      <title>Acoustics-based Active Control of Unsteady Flow Dynamics using Reinforcement Learning Driven Synthetic Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to actively control wakes and noise from flow past a cylinder by leveraging acoustic-based pressure feedback. A hydrophone array captures downstream signals, enabling a DRL agent to adjust jet actuators on the cylinder's surface in real-time. The method reduces noise levels by up to 9.5\% and drag coefficients by up to 23.8\%, effectively minimizing flow-induced vibrations. This highlights the potential of DRL-driven active flow control for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>HETRI: Heterogeneous Ising Multiprocessing</title>

Abstract: Ising machines are effective solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems. The idea is mapping the optimal solution(s) to a combinatorial optimization problem to the minimum energy state(s) of a physical system, which naturally converges to a minimum energy state upon perturbance. The underlying mathematical abstraction, the Ising model, can capture the dynamic behavior of different physical systems by mapping each problem variable to a spin which can interact with other spins. Ising model as a mathematical abstraction can be mapped to hardware using traditional devices. In this paper we instead focus on Ising machines which represent a network of physical spins directly implemented in hardware using, e.g., quantum bits or electronic oscillators. To eliminate the scalability bottleneck due to the mismatch in problem vs. Ising machine size and connectivity, in this paper we make the case for HETRI: Heterogeneous Ising Multiprocessing. HETRI organizes the maximum number of physical spins that the underlying technology supports in Ising cores; and multiple independent Ising cores, in Ising chips. Ising cores in a chip feature different inter-spin connectivity or spin counts to match the problem characteristics. We provide a detailed design space exploration and quantify the performance in terms of time or energy to solution and solution accuracy with respect to homogeneous alternatives under the very same hardware budget and considering the very same spin technology.</description>

      <title>Machine learning interatomic potential for the low-modulus Ti-Nb-Zr alloys in the vicinity of dynamical instability</title>

Abstract: Traditionally, alloying and thermal treatment are considered as the main tools for design of new materials. Application of first-principles simulations can significantly accelerate the process of materials design, however, to account for both, multicomponent chemical disorder and finite temperature effects in theoretical simulations is a challenging task. In this work we have trained machine learning interatomic potential to effectively simulate finite temperature elastic properties of multicomponent \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys. Our simulations predict the presence of the elinvar effect for the wide range of temperatures. Importantly, we predict that in a vicinity of dynamical and mechanical instability, the \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys demonstrate strongly non-linear concentration-dependence of elastic moduli, which leads to low values of moduli comparable to that of human bone. Moreover, these alloys demonstrate a strong anisotropy of directional Young's modulus which can be helpful for microstructure tailoring and design of materials with desired elastic properties.</description>

      <title>Open-source Flux Transport (OFT). I. HipFT -- High-performance Flux Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global solar photospheric magnetic maps play a critical role in solar and heliospheric physics research. Routine magnetograph measurements of the field occur only along the Sun-Earth line, leaving the far-side of the Sun unobserved. Surface Flux Transport (SFT) models attempt to mitigate this by modeling the surface evolution of the field. While such models have long been established in the community (with several releasing public full-Sun maps), none are open source. The Open Source Flux Transport (OFT) model seeks to fill this gap by providing an open and user-extensible SFT model that also builds on the knowledge of previous models with updated numerical and data acquisition/assimilation methods along with additional user-defined features. In this first of a series of papers on OFT, we introduce its computational core: the High-performance Flux Transport (HipFT) code (github.com/predsci/hipft). HipFT implements advection, diffusion, and data assimilation in a modular design that supports a variety of flow models and options. It can compute multiple realizations in a single run across model parameters to create ensembles of maps for uncertainty quantification and is high-performance through the use of multi-CPU and multi-GPU parallelism. HipFT is designed to enable users to easily write extensions, enhancing its flexibility and adaptability. We describe HipFT's model features, validations of its numerical methods, performance of its parallel and GPU-accelerated code implementation, analysis/post-processing options, and example use cases.</description>

      <title>Development and validation of a high-fidelity full-spectrum Monte Carlo model for the Swiss airborne gamma-ray spectrometry system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02102</link>

Abstract: Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS) is a critical tool for radiological emergency response, enabling the rapid identification and quantification of hazardous terrestrial radionuclides over large areas. However, existing calibration methods are limited to a few gamma-ray sources, excluding most radionuclides released in severe nuclear accidents and nuclear weapon detonations, compromising effective response and risk assessment. Here, we present a high-fidelity Monte Carlo model that overcomes these limitations, offering full-spectrum calibration for any gamma-ray source. Unlike previous approaches, our model integrates a detailed mass model of the aircraft and a calibrated non-proportional scintillation model, enabling accurate event-by-event predictions of the spectrometer's response to arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. Validation in near-, mid-, and far-field scenarios demonstrates that the model not only addresses major deficiencies of previous approaches but also achieves the accuracy required to supersede empirical calibration methods. This advancement enables high-fidelity spectral signature generation for any gamma-ray source, reduces calibration time and costs, minimizes reliance on high-intensity sources, and eliminates related radioactive waste. The approach presented here is a critical step toward integrating advanced full-spectrum data reduction methods for AGRS, unlocking new capabilities beyond emergency response, such as atmospheric cosmic-ray flux quantification for geophysics and trace-level airborne radionuclide identification for nuclear security.</description>
