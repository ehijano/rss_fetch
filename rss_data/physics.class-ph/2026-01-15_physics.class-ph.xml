      <title>Topological mode conservation and conversion in phononic crystals with temporal interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sudden change in material properties creates a temporal interface and forces a propagating wave to change its frequency while preserving its wavenumber. In contrast to monoatomic lattices with a single frequency-wavenumber pair, polyatomic lattices support multiple frequencies for each wavenumber. To date, experimental observations are limited to topologically trivial monoatomic phononic systems. Here, we utilize analytical, numerical, and experimental methods to examine topologically non-trivial phononic lattices subject to temporal interfaces. In particular, we realize phononic lattices demonstrating single-frequency shift (i.e., mode conservation) and multi-frequency splitting (i.e., mode conversion) following a temporal interface. Accordingly, we generalize temporal analogues of Snell's law and Fresnel equations. Moreover, we utilize Bloch mode overlaps to obtain a phononic time lens and a classical analogue of dynamic quantum phase transitions for phonons. Such overlap determines the probability of mode conversion or conservation after a temporal interface and, more importantly, can carry hidden topological characteristics. Our methodology paves the way for the use of temporal interfaces in probing phonon band topology and the realization of advanced acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the Rankine Vortex Model for Modeling the Gas Entrainment in a Representative Mock-up of a Sodium Fast Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since decades, the CEA has been involved in the development of 4th generation reactors cooled by sodium. The dedicated experimental platform PLATEAU was erected to study the different issues and built a results database for the code validation. As experiments with sodium are complex, the tests are led in mock-ups using water as a simulant fluid. The MICAS mock-up, model of the upper plenum, aims at studying the gas entrainment at the free surface. Gas is prohibited in the reactor core due to neutron effects, which may induce reactivity variations. Since vortices are difficult to handle by numerical codes in complex geometries such as reactor ones, criteria have been developed based on the Rankine vortex model to forecast the air entrainment. However, in some case, numerical results do not correlate the experimental ones and those discrepancies are may be due to the vortex model. This article aims at comparing the vortices characteristics calculated using the Rankine vortex model with experimental results in order to improve the gas entrainment criteria. The parameters of the Rankine model are determined using the velocity fields measured by the Particle Image Velocity (PIV) method and the vortices diameter is calculated using the raw PIV images.</description>

      <title>Finite-system size effects in gravity-capillary wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the effects of finite-system size on the dynamics of weakly nonlinear random gravity-capillary surface waves. Experiments are conducted in rectangular tanks with varying aspect ratios, in which the fluid surface is perturbed locally and erratically by small, partially submerged magnets. Driven by an oscillating vertical electromagnetic field, these magnets generate a statistically homogeneous and isotropic random wave field. This setup enables us to probe finite-size effects without the dominant influence of global forcing present in horizontally oscillated tanks. Spatiotemporal measurements of the wave field reveal multiple branches in the wave-energy spectrum along the unconfined direction, corresponding to sloshing modes in the confined direction. We show that the spectral properties of these modes can be tuned by varying either the wave steepness or the confinement. Signatures of discrete wave turbulence in the confined direction and mesoscopic continuous wave turbulence in the unconfined direction are observed. As the confinement is gradually relaxed, we further demonstrate a smooth transition from discrete to continuous wave turbulence, consistent with the nonlinear-to-discreteness timescale ratio. Using high-order correlation analysis, we also show that finite-size effects alter wave dynamics by depleting two-dimensional three-wave resonant interactions along the confined direction.</description>
