      <title>Mass measurements of neutron-rich nuclides using the Canadian Penning Trap to inform predictions in the $r$-process rare-earth peak region probe the $r$-process rare-earth peak</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies aiming to determine the astrophysical origins of nuclei produced by the rapid neutron capture process ($r$ process) rely on nuclear properties as inputs for simulations. The solar abundances can be used as a benchmark for such calculations, with the $r$-process rare-earth peak (REP) around mass number ($A$) $164$ being of special interest due to its presently unknown origin. With the advancement of rare isotope beam production over the last decade and improvement in experimental sensitivities, many of these REP nuclides have become accessible for measurement. Masses are one of the most critical inputs as they impact multiple nuclear properties, namely the neutron-separation energies, neutron capture rates, $\beta$-decay rates, and $\beta$-delayed neutron emission probabilities. In this work, we report masses of 20 neutron-rich nuclides (along the Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Gd, Dy and Ho isotopic chains) produced at the CAlifornium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) facility at Argonne National Laboratory. The masses were measured with the Canadian Penning trap (CPT) mass spectrometer using the Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance (PI-ICR) technique. We then use these new masses along with previously published CPT masses to inform predictions for a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure aiming to identify the astrophysical conditions consistent with both solar data and mass measurements. We show that the MCMC responds to this updated mass information, producing refined results for both mass predictions and REP abundances.</description>

      <title>Study of baryon-strangeness and charge-strangeness correlations in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest to unravel the mysteries of the strong force and the underlying properties of the quark-gluon plasma, the ALICE collaboration at CERN has carried out a comprehensive study focusing on the correlations between net-conserved quantities such as net-baryon, net-charge and net-strangeness. These correlations play a crucial role in the study of QCD phase structure as they are closely related to the ratios of thermodynamic susceptibilities in lattice QCD calculations. This work mainly focuses on the correlations between net-kaon and net-proton, and net-kaon and net-charge in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV using data recorded during LHC Run 2. The net-proton and net-kaon serve as proxies for net-baryon and net-strangeness, respectively, with measurements analyzed as a function of collision centrality. Theoretical predictions from the Thermal-FIST model are compared with experimental results, providing insights into the effects of resonance decays and charge conservation laws on the correlations.</description>

      <title>Proton emission in ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{\textit{s}_{\mathrm{\textbf{NN}}}}=5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first measurements of proton emission accompanied by neutron emission in the electromagnetic dissociation (EMD) of $^{208}$Pb nuclei in the ALICE experiment at the LHC are presented. The EMD protons and neutrons emitted at very forward rapidities are detected by the proton and neutron Zero Degree Calorimeters of the ALICE experiment. The emission cross sections of zero, one, two, and three protons accompanied by at least one neutron were measured in ultraperipheral $^{208}$Pb-$^{208}$Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$~TeV. These 0p, 1p, 2p, and 3p cross sections are described by the RELDIS model, and according to this model, they are associated with the production of various isotopes of Pb, Tl, Hg, and Au in the EMD of $^{208}$Pb. The cross sections of the emission of a single proton accompanied by the emission of one, two, or three neutrons in EMD were also measured. The data are significantly overestimated by the RELDIS model, which predicts that the (1p,1n), (1p,2n), and (1p,3n) cross sections are very similar to the cross sections for the production of the thallium isotopes $^{206,205,204}$Tl.</description>

      <title>Measurements of differential two-particle number and transverse momentum correlation functions in pp collisions at $\sqrt{\textit{s}}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential two-particle normalized cumulants ($R_2$) and transverse momentum correlations ($P_2$) are measured as a function of the relative pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle difference $( \Delta \eta, \Delta \varphi )$ of charged particle pairs in minimum bias pp collisions at $\sqrt{\textit{s}}$ = 13 TeV. The measurements use charged hadrons in the pseudorapidity region of $|\eta| &lt; 0.8$ and the transverse momentum range 0.2 $&lt; \textit{p}_{\mathrm T} &lt; $ 2.0 $\mathrm{GeV}/\textit{c}$ in order to focus on soft multiparticle interactions and to complement prior measurements of these correlation functions in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions. The correlation functions are reported for both unlike-sign and like-sign pairs and their charge-independent and charge-dependent combinations. Both the $R_2$ and $P_2$ measured in pp collisions exhibit features qualitatively similar to those observed in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions. The $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\varphi$ root mean square widths of the near-side peak of the correlation functions are evaluated and compared with those observed in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions and show smooth evolution with the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the collision. The comparison of the measured correlation functions with predictions from PYTHIA8 shows that this model qualitatively captures their basic structure and characteristics but feature important differences. In addition, the $R_2^{\rm CD}$ is used to determine the charge balance function of hadrons produced within the detector acceptance of the measurements. The integral of the balance function is found to be compatible with those reported by a previous measurement in Pb-Pb collisions. These results, which are sensitive to the interplay between the underlying event and mini-jets in pp collisions, establish a baseline for heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Spin Transfer to $\Lambda$ in Deep Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $\Lambda$ production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering using a polarized lepton beam and find that the spin transfer is significantly suppressed by target fragmentation. As further demonstrated by a model estimation, experimental data can be well described once the target fragmentation is taken into account, which alleviates the tension with calculations solely based on current fragmentation. Our findings suggest that, at the energies of existing fixed-target experiments, the separation of current and fragmentation regions is not distinct. Spin transfer as well as other spin effects offers a sensitive probe into the origin of the produced hadron.</description>

      <title>Heavy Flavor Production at the Large Hadron Collider: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charmonia suppression has been considered as a smoking gun signature of quark-gluon plasma. However, the Large Hadron Collider has observed a lower degree of suppression as compared to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider energies, due to regeneration effects in heavy-ion collisions. Though proton collisions are considered to be the baseline measurements to characterize a hot and dense medium formation in heavy-ion collisions, LHC proton collisions with its new physics of heavy-ion-like QGP signatures have created new challenges. To understand this, the inclusive charmonia production at the forward rapidities in the dimuon channel is compared with the corresponding measurements in the dielectron channel at the midrapidity as a function of final state charged particle multiplicity. None of the theoretical models quantitatively reproduce the experimental findings leaving out a lot of room for theory. To circumvent this and find a reasonable understanding, we use machine learning tools to separate prompt and nonprompt charmonia and open charm mesons using the decay daughter track properties and the decay topologies of the mother particles. Using PYTHIA8 data, we train the machine learning models and successfully separate prompt and nonprompt charm hadrons from the inclusive sample to study various directions of their production dynamics. This study enables a domain of using machine learning techniques, which can be used in the experimental analysis to better understand charm hadron production and build possible theoretical understanding.</description>

      <title>Re-investigation of the interplay of fission modes and non-equilibrium fission processes in heavy actinide nuclei 249Bk and 257Md</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.07903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of mass and angular distributions of fission fragments from actinide nuclei 249Bk and 257Md, produced in fusion reactions 11B and 19F + 238238U, are presented. Experimentally observed mass ratio distributions indicate 'multi-chance fission' through the interplay of fission modes in the fission process, and they agree well with predictions from calculations using the GEF ('GEneral description of Fission observables') model code. Furthermore, to test the signatures of events from non-compound nuclear processes in the fission of 249Bk and 257Md nuclei, Monte Carlo statistical decay model calculations using GEMINI++ were performed for the measured mass distribution at all energies. For comparison purposes, the fission fragment mass distributions of neighboring heavy actinide nuclei, previously measured in the fission of 250Cf and 254Fm nuclei produced by 12C and 16O projectiles on a 238U target, are also presented. The measured angular anisotropy data for the 19F + 238U reaction differ from the results of the Transition State Model at energies below the fusion barrier. As a result of the present study, we suggest considering the interplay between K relaxation time, dynamic dissipation, and their influence on shell correction to understand the evolution of fission dynamics in heavy-ion-induced actinide nuclei</description>

      <title>Candidate toroidal electric dipole mode in the spherical nucleus $^{58}$Ni</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04736v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dipole toroidal modes appear in many fields of physics. In nuclei, such a mode was predicted more than 50 years ago, but clear experimental evidence was lacking so far. Using a combination of high-resolution inelastic scattering experiments with photons, electrons and protons, we identify for the first time candidates for toroidal dipole excitations in the nucleus $^{58}$Ni and demonstrate that transverse electron scattering form factors represent a relevant experimental observable to prove their nature.</description>

      <title>Photo-nuclear cross sections on $^{197}$Au, an update on the gold standard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method was developed for measuring photonuclear reactions concurrently at several discrete photon beam energies on a stack of different target materials via a single irradiation. Concentric ring targets of the materials (in order from front to back targets: Au, TiO$_2$, Zn, Os, and Au) were irradiated at the High Intensity Gamma-ray Source (HI$\gamma$S). As a proof of principle, we report the result of the cross section measurements from the front Au target. The excitation functions of the $^{197}$Au($\gamma$,n)$^{196}$Au and $^{197}$Au($\gamma$,3n)$^{194}$Au reactions were determined in the incident photon energy range of 13-31 MeV using quasi-monoenergetic photon beams provided at HI$\gamma$S. The cross sections of the combined ground state (2$^{-}$) and short-lived first isomeric state (m1, 5$^{+}$), and of the second isomeric state (m2, 12$^{-}$) in the $^{196}$Au production are obtained separately by subtracting the $\gamma$ rays from the internal conversion of the second isomeric state. The excitation function of the second isomeric state via the photon-induced reaction $^{197}$Au($\gamma$,n)$^{196m2}$Au was measured for the first time. By using the activation method rather than direct neutron counting, the exclusive cross sections for the ($\gamma$,n) and ($\gamma$,3n) reactions were determined. Comparing the yields from the front and back gold targets validates our ability to simulate the effect of photon scattering in the target stack and provides a method for assessing the systematic uncertainty of our technique.</description>

      <title>Exploring $\beta^+$ decay/EC residues in $^{118}$Sn($^{12}$C,x)$^{130}$Ba reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fusion cross-sections of $^{126}$Ba, $^{127,126,125}$Cs, $^{125,123,122}$Xe and $^{124,123}$I residues, populated via $x$n, p$x$n, $\alpha$$x$n, and $\alpha$p$x$n channels, have been measured in $^{12}$C+$^{118}$Sn system at E$_{\textrm{lab}}$ $\approx$ 65-85 MeV. For an insight into the formation and decay modes of these residues, experimentally measured cross-sections have been analyzed in the framework of theoretical model codes PACE4 and EMPIRE. The cross-sections of p$x$n ($^{127,126,125}$Cs), $\alpha$xn ($^{125}$Xe), and $\alpha$p$x$n ($^{123}$I) channels have been found to be substantially fed from their higher charge isobars via $\beta^+$ decay and electron capture. In order to deduce the contribution of higher charge isobars in the population of these residues, the independent cross-sections of evaporation residues have been calculated using the prescription of Cavinato $et$ $al.$ and compared with that calculated using theoretical model codes. It has been found that the PACE4 and EMPIRE calculations fairly reproduce the independent cross-sections of evaporation residues within the experimental uncertainties. Interestingly, it has been found that the $\alpha$-emitting channels, contrary to established findings in reactions involving $\alpha$ cluster projectiles (e.g., $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, etc.) at low incident energies, display negligible contribution of incomplete fusion (ICF). A comparison of incomplete fusion fraction as a function of entrance channel mass-asymmetry for reactions involving $^{12}$C projectile with nearby targets indicates dissimilar behavior of $^{118}$Sn target.</description>

      <title>Nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions: flavour separation and zeroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>

      <title>An alternative way to decipher the nature of the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$: its antiparticle $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ photoproduction off nuclei near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the inclusive photoproduction of $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ mesons (which are the antiparticles of the doubly charmed tetraquarks $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ discovered recently by the LHCb Collaboration) from nuclei in the near-threshold energy region within the nuclear spectral function approach by considering incoherent direct (${\gamma}p(n) \to D^+(D^0){T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-}\Lambda^+_c$) photon--nucleon $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ creation processes as well as five possible different scenarios for their internal structure with the main goal of clarifying the possibility to decipher this structure (and, hence, that of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$) in photoproduction via integral and differential observables. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production off $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold photon beam energies of 30--38 GeV, the absolute differential cross sections for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$ as well as the A and momentum dependences of the relative (transparency ratios) cross sections for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production at photon energy of 35 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ meson intrinsic structure. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables considered show a certain sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the measurement of such observables in future experiments at the proposed high-luminosity electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC in the US and China in the near-threshold energy region might shed light on the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ internal structure.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements complete up to N$^2$LO in heavy nuclei</title>

Abstract: We evaluate all nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) up to next-to-next-to leading order (N$^2$LO) in chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) for the neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of the nuclei most relevant for experiments, including $^{76}$Ge, $^{100}$Mo, and $^{136}$Xe. We use the proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation (pnQRPA) and the nuclear shell model to calculate the N$^2$LO NMEs from very low-momentum (ultrasoft) neutrinos and from loop diagrams usually neglected in $0\nu\beta\beta$ studies. Our results indicate that the overall N$^2$LO contribution is centered around $-(5$-$10)\%$ for the shell model and $+(10$-$15)\%$ for the pnQRPA, with sizable uncertainties due to the scale dependence of the ultrasoft NMEs and the short-range nature of the loop NMEs. The sign discrepancy between many-body methods is common to all studied nuclei and points to the different behaviour of the intermediate states of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. Within uncertainties, our results for the ultrasoft NME are of similar size as contributions usually referred to as ``beyond the closure approximation''.</description>

      <title>Impressions of Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (DFs) have long been recognised as key measures of hadron structure. Today, theoretical prediction of such DFs is becoming possible using diverse methods for continuum and lattice analyses of strong interaction (QCD) matrix elements. Recent developments include a demonstration that continuum and lattice analyses yield mutually consistent results for all pion DFs, with behaviour on the far valence domain of light-front momentum fraction that matches QCD expectations. Theory is also delivering an understanding of the distributions of proton mass and spin amongst its constituents, which varies, of course, with the resolving scale of the measuring probe. Aspects of the pion DF and proton spin developments are sketched herein, along with some novel perspectives on gluon and quark orbital angular momentum.</description>
