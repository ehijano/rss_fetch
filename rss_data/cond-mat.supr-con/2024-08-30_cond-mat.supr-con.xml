      <title>Topological superconductivity from repulsive interactions in twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ raises intriguing questions concerning the origin and the properties of superconducting states realized in bands with non-trivial topological properties and repulsive electron-electron interactions. Using a continuum band structure model, we analyze a mechanism for Coulomb interaction-driven superconductivity in twisted bilayers of WSe$_2$. We discuss the symmetries and the phenomenological properties of the resulting superconducting phases and their evolution with interlayer potential difference, tunable via an out of plane electric field. The pairing strength is a non-monotonic function of interlayer potential, being larger at intermediate values due to mixing of singlet and triplet pairing. In contrast, at larger interlayer potential, the pairing tendency is suppressed due to enhanced Coulomb repulsion. The superconducting state is chiral in a large regime of parameters and undergoes a transition to a nodal nematic superconductor at a critical potential difference. The chiral state, characterized by an intervalley-symmetric superposition of triplet and singlet pairs, is classified as a topological superconductor within the Altland-Zirnbauer class C. At zero interlayer potential difference, the superconducting state is instead of class D, which hosts Majorana zero modes, making it a promising candidate for applications in quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Signatures of a Spin-Active Interface and Locally Enhanced Zeeman field in a Superconductor-Chiral Material Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A localized Zeeman field, intensified at heterostructure interfaces, could play a crucial role in a broad area including spintronics and unconventional superconductors. Conventionally, the generation of a local Zeeman field is achieved through magnetic exchange coupling with a magnetic material. However, magnetic elements often introduce defects, which could weaken or destroy superconductivity. Alternatively, the coupling between a superconductor with strong spin-orbit coupling and a non-magnetic chiral material could serve as a promising approach to generate a spin active interface. In this study, we leverage an interface superconductor, namely induced superconductivity in noble metal surface states, to probe the spin active interface. Our results unveil an enhanced interface Zeeman field, which selectively closes the surface superconducting gap while preserving the bulk superconducting pairing. The chiral material, i.e. trigonal tellurium, also induces Andreev bound states (ABS) exhibiting spin polarization. The field dependence of ABS manifests a substantially enhanced interface Land\'e g-factor (g_eff ~ 12), thereby corroborating the enhanced interface Zeeman energy.</description>

      <title>Predicting topological invariants and unconventional superconducting pairing from density of states and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competition between magnetism and superconductivity can lead to unconventional and topological superconductivity. However, the experimental confirmation of the presence of Majorana edge states and unconventional pairing currently poses a major challenge. Here we consider a two-dimensional lattice model for a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling to randomly distributed magnetic impurities. Depending on parameters of the model, this system may display topologically trivial or nontrivial edge states. We map out the phase diagram by computing the Bott index, a topological invariant defined in real space. We then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the Bott index from the local density of states (LDOS) at zero energy, obtaining high-accuracy results. We also train ML models to predict the amplitude of odd-frequency pairing in the anomalous Green's function at zero energy. Once the ML models are trained using the LDOS, which is experimentally accessible via scanning tunneling spectroscopy, our method could be applied to predict the number of Majorana edge states and to estimate the magnitude of odd-frequency pairing in real materials.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Amorphous Shiba State in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The iron-based superconductor FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ is a peculiar material: it hosts a surface state with a Dirac dispersion, is a putative topological superconductor hosting Majorana modes in vortices, and has an unusually low Fermi energy. The superconducting state is generally thought to be characterized by three gaps in different bands, with the usual homogenous, spatially extended Bogoliubov excitations -- in this work, we uncover evidence that it is instead of a very different nature. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy data shows several peaks in the density of states above a full gap, and by analyzing the spatial and junction-resistance dependence of the peaks, we conclude that the peaks above the first one are not coherence peaks from different bands. Instead, comparisons with our simulations indicate that they originate from generalized Shiba states that are spatially overlapping. This can lead to an amorphous state of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, reminiscent of impurity bands in semiconductors. We discuss the origin and implications of this new state.</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: exact solutions and dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</description>

      <title>In-situ scanning gate imaging of individual two-level material defects in live superconducting quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low temperature physics of structurally amorphous materials is governed by two-level system defects (TLS), the exact origin and nature of which remain elusive despite decades of study. Recent advances towards realising stable high-coherence platforms for quantum computing has increased the importance of studying TLS in solid-state quantum circuits, as they are a persistent source of decoherence and instability. Here we perform scanning gate microscopy on a live superconducting quantum circuit at millikelvin temperatures to locate individual TLS. Our method directly reveals the microscopic nature of TLS and is also capable of deducing the three dimensional orientation of individual TLS electric dipole moments. Such insights, when combined with structural information of the underlying materials, can help unravel the detailed microscopic nature and chemical origin of TLS, directing strategies for their eventual mitigation.</description>

      <title>Pseudogap regime of the unitary Fermi gas with lattice auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo in the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unitary Fermi gas (UFG) is a strongly correlated system of two-species (spin-1/2) fermions with a short-range attractive interaction modeled by a contact interaction and has attracted much interest across different disciplines. The UFG is considered a paradigm for strongly correlated superfluids and has been investigated extensively, with generally good agreement found between theory and experiment. However, the extent of a pseudogap regime above the critical temperature $T_c$ for superfluidity is still debated both theoretically and experimentally. Here we study thermodynamic properties of the UFG across the superfluid phase transition using finite-temperature lattice auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFMC) methods in the canonical ensemble of fixed particle numbers. We extrapolate our lattice AFMC results to the continuous time and continuum limits, thus removing the systematic error associated with the finite filling factor of previous AFMC studies. We determine the critical temperature to be $T_c=0.16(1)\, T_{F}$. For the largest particle number studied $N=114$, the energy-staggering pairing gap is suppressed above a pairing scale temperature of $T^{*}\approx 0.2\,T_F$. The spin susceptibility displays moderate suppression above $T_c$ with a spin gap temperature of $T_s\approx 0.2 \,T_F$. We also calculate a free energy-staggering pairing gap, which shows substantially reduced statistical errors when compared with the energy-staggering gap, allowing for a clear signature of pairing correlations in the finite-size system. All results indicate that the pseudogap regime is narrow, with pseudogap signatures emerging at temperatures below $T^{*}\approx 0.2 \, T_F$. The reduced statistical errors of the free energy gap enable an extrapolation at low temperatures, allowing an estimate of the zero-temperature pairing gap $\Delta_E = 0.576(24) \, \epsilon_F$.</description>

      <title>Mixed higher-order topology and nodal and nodeless flat band topological phases in a superconducting multiorbital model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phases that appear in an orbital version of the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) model in the presence of conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity and with the possibility of tuning an in-plane magnetic field. We chart out the phase diagram by considering different boundary conditions, with the topology of the individual phases further examined by considering both the Wannier and entanglement spectra, as well as the Majorana polarization.
  For weak to moderate values of magnetic field and superconducting pairing amplitude, we find a second-order topological superconductor phase with eight zero-energy corner modes. Further increasing field or pairing, half of the corner states can be turned into zero-energy edge-localized modes, thus forming a type of hybrid-order phase. Then, we find two different putative first-order topological phases, a nodal and a nodeless phase, both with zero-energy flat bands localized along mirror-symmetric open edges. For the nodal phase, the flat bands are localized between the nodes in reciprocal space, while in the nodeless phase, with its a full bulk gap, the zero-energy boundary flat band spans the whole Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>The Drude weight of a flatband metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flatband systems form a new class of materials that challenge the conventional wisdom of transport. The intrinsically strong electronic correlations combined with the vanishing kinetic energy scale suggest a sensitive dependence of transport properties on the flat band states and make interacting flat bands promising candidates for exotic quantum transport. Utilizing the Drude weight, we investigate the low-frequency spectral properties of the electrical conductivity within a controlled analytic treatment of the many-body response at temperatures above the bandwidth and the interaction strength and below the bandgap. Focusing on this new transport regime, we demonstrate the potential of a quantum geometric approach for interacting systems and intermediate temperatures. The derived spectral weight yields unexplored 4-point geometric contributions unrelated to the quantum metric, which questions the previously proposed projection methods. For long-ranged interactions, we show that the low-frequency spectral weight reduces to the variance of the Berry curvature.</description>
