      <title>XANE Background Acoustic Embeddings: Ablation and Clustering Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the recently proposed explainable acoustic neural embedding~(XANE) system that models the background acoustics of a speech signal in a non-intrusive manner. The XANE embeddings are used to estimate specific parameters related to the background acoustic properties of the signal which allows the embeddings to be explainable in terms of those parameters. We perform ablation studies on the XANE system and show that estimating all acoustic parameters jointly has an overall positive effect. Furthermore, we illustrate the value of XANE embeddings by performing clustering experiments on unseen test data and show that the proposed embeddings achieve a mean F1 score of 92\% for three different tasks, outperforming significantly the WavLM based signal embeddings and are complimentary to speaker embeddings.</description>

      <title>Learn and Don't Forget: Adding a New Language to ASR Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation ASR models often support many languages, e.g. 100 languages in Whisper. However, there has been limited work on integrating an additional, typically low-resource, language, while maintaining performance on the original language set. Fine-tuning, while simple, may degrade the accuracy of the original set. We compare three approaches that exploit adaptation parameters: soft language code tuning, train only the language code; soft prompt tuning, train prepended tokens; and LoRA where a small set of additional parameters are optimised. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) offers an alternative compromise with the potential to maintain performance in specific target languages. Results show that direct fine-tuning yields the best performance for the new language but degrades existing language capabilities. EWC can address this issue for specific languages. If only adaptation parameters are used, the language capabilities are maintained but at the cost of performance in the new language.</description>

      <title>Gaunt coefficients for complex and real spherical harmonics with applications to spherical array processing and Ambisonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustical signal processing of directional representations of sound fields, including source, receiver, and scatterer transfer functions, are often expressed and modeled in the spherical harmonic domain (SHD). Certain such modeling operations, or applications of those models, involve multiplications of those directional quantities, which can also be expressed conveniently in the SHD through coupling coefficients known as Gaunt coefficients. Since the definition and notation of Gaunt coefficients varies across acoustical publications, this work defines them based on established conventions of complex and real spherical harmonics (SHs) along with a convenient matrix form for spherical multiplication of directionally band-limited spherical functions. Additionally, the report provides a derivation of the Gaunt coefficients for real SHs, which has been missing from the literature and can be used directly in spatial audio frameworks such as Ambisonics. Matlab code is provided that can compute all coefficients up to user specified SH orders. Finally, a number of relevant acoustical processing examples from the literature are presented, following the matrix formalism of coefficients introduced in the report.</description>

      <title>Listen and Speak Fairly: A Study on Semantic Gender Bias in Speech Integrated Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Integrated Large Language Models (SILLMs) combine large language models with speech perception to perform diverse tasks, such as emotion recognition to speaker verification, demonstrating universal audio understanding capability. However, these models may amplify biases present in training data, potentially leading to biased access to information for marginalized groups. This work introduces a curated spoken bias evaluation toolkit and corresponding dataset. We evaluate gender bias in SILLMs across four semantic-related tasks: speech-to-text translation (STT), spoken coreference resolution (SCR), spoken sentence continuation (SSC), and spoken question answering (SQA). Our analysis reveals that bias levels are language-dependent and vary with different evaluation methods. Our findings emphasize the necessity of employing multiple approaches to comprehensively assess biases in SILLMs, providing insights for developing fairer SILLM systems.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning with Pseudo Multi-Label Birdcall Classification for DS@GT BirdCLEF 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present working notes for the DS@GT team on transfer learning with pseudo multi-label birdcall classification for the BirdCLEF 2024 competition, focused on identifying Indian bird species in recorded soundscapes. Our approach utilizes production-grade models such as the Google Bird Vocalization Classifier, BirdNET, and EnCodec to address representation and labeling challenges in the competition. We explore the distributional shift between this year's edition of unlabeled soundscapes representative of the hidden test set and propose a pseudo multi-label classification strategy to leverage the unlabeled data. Our highest post-competition public leaderboard score is 0.63 using BirdNET embeddings with Bird Vocalization pseudo-labels. Our code is available at https://github.com/dsgt-kaggle-clef/birdclef-2024</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Speaker Features for On-the-Fly Dysarthric and Elderly Speaker Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of data-intensive automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies to dysarthric and elderly adult speech is confronted by their mismatch against healthy and nonaged voices, data scarcity and large speaker-level variability. To this end, this paper proposes two novel data-efficient methods to learn homogeneous dysarthric and elderly speaker-level features for rapid, on-the-fly test-time adaptation of DNN/TDNN and Conformer ASR models. These include: 1) speaker-level variance-regularized spectral basis embedding (VR-SBE) features that exploit a special regularization term to enforce homogeneity of speaker features in adaptation; and 2) feature-based learning hidden unit contributions (f-LHUC) transforms that are conditioned on VR-SBE features. Experiments are conducted on four tasks across two languages: the English UASpeech and TORGO dysarthric speech datasets, the English DementiaBank Pitt and Cantonese JCCOCC MoCA elderly speech corpora. The proposed on-the-fly speaker adaptation techniques consistently outperform baseline iVector and xVector adaptation by statistically significant word or character error rate reductions up to 5.32% absolute (18.57% relative) and batch-mode LHUC speaker adaptation by 2.24% absolute (9.20% relative), while operating with real-time factors speeding up to 33.6 times against xVectors during adaptation. The efficacy of the proposed adaptation techniques is demonstrated in a comparison against current ASR technologies including SSL pre-trained systems on UASpeech, where our best system produces a state-of-the-art WER of 23.33%. Analyses show VR-SBE features and f-LHUC transforms are insensitive to speaker-level data quantity in testtime adaptation. T-SNE visualization reveals they have stronger speaker-level homogeneity than baseline iVectors, xVectors and batch-mode LHUC transforms.</description>

      <title>Improving Speech Enhancement by Integrating Inter-Channel and Band Features with Dual-branch Conformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent speech enhancement methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer have been demonstrated to efficaciously capture time-frequency (T-F) information on spectrogram. However, the correlation of each channels of speech features is failed to explore. Theoretically, each channel map of speech features obtained by different convolution kernels contains information with different scales demonstrating strong correlations. To fill this gap, we propose a novel dual-branch architecture named channel-aware dual-branch conformer (CADB-Conformer), which effectively explores the long range time and frequency correlations among different channels, respectively, to extract channel relation aware time-frequency information. Ablation studies conducted on DNS-Challenge 2020 dataset demonstrate the importance of channel feature leveraging while showing the significance of channel relation aware T-F information for speech enhancement. Extensive experiments also show that the proposed model achieves superior performance than recent methods with an attractive computational costs.</description>

      <title>RespEar: Earable-Based Robust Respiratory Rate Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Respiratory rate (RR) monitoring is integral to understanding physical and mental health and tracking fitness. Existing studies have demonstrated the feasibility of RR monitoring under specific user conditions (e.g., while remaining still, or while breathing heavily). Yet, performing accurate, continuous and non-obtrusive RR monitoring across diverse daily routines and activities remains challenging. In this work, we present RespEar, an earable-based system for robust RR monitoring. By leveraging the unique properties of in-ear microphones in earbuds, RespEar enables the use of Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) and Locomotor Respiratory Coupling (LRC), physiological couplings between cardiovascular activity, gait and respiration, to indirectly determine RR. This effectively addresses the challenges posed by the almost imperceptible breathing signals under daily activities. We further propose a suite of meticulously crafted signal processing schemes to improve RR estimation accuracy and robustness. With data collected from 18 subjects over 8 activities, RespEar measures RR with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.48 breaths per minutes (BPM) and a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 9.12% in sedentary conditions, and a MAE of 2.28 BPM and a MAPE of 11.04% in active conditions, respectively, which is unprecedented for a method capable of generalizing across conditions with a single modality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-language models (ALMs) process sounds to provide a linguistic description of sound-producing events and scenes. Recent advances in computing power and dataset creation have led to significant progress in this domain. This paper surveys existing datasets used for training audio-language models, emphasizing the recent trend towards using large, diverse datasets to enhance model performance. Key sources of these datasets include the Freesound platform and AudioSet that have contributed to the field's rapid growth. Although prior surveys primarily address techniques and training details, this survey categorizes and evaluates a wide array of datasets, addressing their origins, characteristics, and use cases. It also performs a data leak analysis to ensure dataset integrity and mitigate bias between datasets. This survey was conducted by analyzing research papers up to and including December 2023, and does not contain any papers after that period.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Multimodal Medical Image Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical doctors rely on images of the human anatomy, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to localize regions of interest in the patient during diagnosis and treatment. Despite advances in medical imaging technology, the information conveyance remains unimodal. This visual representation fails to capture the complexity of the real, multisensory interaction with human tissue. However, perceiving multimodal information about the patient's anatomy and disease in real-time is critical for the success of medical procedures and patient outcome. We introduce a Multimodal Medical Image Interaction (MMII) framework to allow medical experts a dynamic, audiovisual interaction with human tissue in three-dimensional space. In a virtual reality environment, the user receives physically informed audiovisual feedback to improve the spatial perception of anatomical structures. MMII uses a model-based sonification approach to generate sounds derived from the geometry and physical properties of tissue, thereby eliminating the need for hand-crafted sound design. Two user studies involving 34 general and nine clinical experts were conducted to evaluate the proposed interaction framework's learnability, usability, and accuracy. Our results showed excellent learnability of audiovisual correspondence as the rate of correct associations significantly improved (p &lt; 0.001) over the course of the study. MMII resulted in superior brain tumor localization accuracy (p &lt; 0.05) compared to conventional medical image interaction. Our findings substantiate the potential of this novel framework to enhance interaction with medical images, for example, during surgical procedures where immediate and precise feedback is needed.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification for Speaker Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, automatic speaker verification (ASV) based on deep learning is easily contaminated by adversarial attacks, which is a new type of attack that injects imperceptible perturbations to audio signals so as to make ASV produce wrong decisions. This poses a significant threat to the security and reliability of ASV systems. To address this issue, we propose a Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification (DAP) method that enhances the robustness of ASV systems against such adversarial attacks. Our method leverages a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to effectively purify the adversarial examples and mitigate the impact of perturbations. DAP first introduces controlled noise into adversarial examples, and then performs a reverse denoising process to reconstruct clean audio. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed DAP in enhancing the security of ASV and meanwhile minimizing the distortion of the purified audio signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding degraded speech is demanding, requiring increased listening effort (LE). Evaluating processed and unprocessed speech with respect to LE can objectively indicate if speech enhancement systems benefit listeners. However, existing methods for measuring LE are complex and not widely applicable. In this study, we propose a simple method to evaluate speech intelligibility and LE simultaneously without additional strain on subjects or operators. We assess this method using results from two independent studies in Norway and Denmark, testing 76 (50+26) subjects across 9 (6+3) processing conditions. Despite differences in evaluation setups, subject recruitment, and processing systems, trends are strikingly similar, demonstrating the proposed method's robustness and ease of implementation into existing practices.</description>

      <title>AudioLCM: Text-to-Audio Generation with Latent Consistency Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have propelled them to the forefront of various generative tasks. However, their iterative sampling process poses a significant computational burden, resulting in slow generation speeds and limiting their application in text-to-audio generation deployment. In this work, we introduce AudioLCM, a novel consistency-based model tailored for efficient and high-quality text-to-audio generation. AudioLCM integrates Consistency Models into the generation process, facilitating rapid inference through a mapping from any point at any time step to the trajectory's initial point. To overcome the convergence issue inherent in LDMs with reduced sample iterations, we propose the Guided Latent Consistency Distillation with a multi-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. This innovation shortens the time schedule from thousands to dozens of steps while maintaining sample quality, thereby achieving fast convergence and high-quality generation. Furthermore, to optimize the performance of transformer-based neural network architectures, we integrate the advanced techniques pioneered by LLaMA into the foundational framework of transformers. This architecture supports stable and efficient training, ensuring robust performance in text-to-audio synthesis. Experimental results on text-to-sound generation and text-to-music synthesis tasks demonstrate that AudioLCM needs only 2 iterations to synthesize high-fidelity audios, while it maintains sample quality competitive with state-of-the-art models using hundreds of steps. AudioLCM enables a sampling speed of 333x faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA 4090Ti GPU, making generative models practically applicable to text-to-audio generation deployment. Our extensive preliminary analysis shows that each design in AudioLCM is effective.</description>

      <title>SpatialCodec: Neural Spatial Speech Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of encoding speech captured by a microphone array using deep learning techniques with the aim of preserving and accurately reconstructing crucial spatial cues embedded in multi-channel recordings. We propose a neural spatial audio coding framework that achieves a high compression ratio, leveraging single-channel neural sub-band codec and SpatialCodec. Our approach encompasses two phases: (i) a neural sub-band codec is designed to encode the reference channel with low bit rates, and (ii), a SpatialCodec captures relative spatial information for accurate multi-channel reconstruction at the decoder end. In addition, we also propose novel evaluation metrics to assess the spatial cue preservation: (i) spatial similarity, which calculates cosine similarity on a spatially intuitive beamspace, and (ii), beamformed audio quality. Our system shows superior spatial performance compared with high bitrate baselines and black-box neural architecture. Demos are available at https://xzwy.github.io/SpatialCodecDemo. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/XZWY/SpatialCodec.</description>

      <title>Exploring Sentence Type Effects on the Lombard Effect and Intelligibility Enhancement: A Comparative Study of Natural and Grid Sentences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores how sentence types affect the Lombard effect and intelligibility enhancement, focusing on comparisons between natural and grid sentences. Using the Lombard Chinese-TIMIT (LCT) corpus and the Enhanced MAndarin Lombard Grid (EMALG) corpus, we analyze changes in phonetic and acoustic features across different noise levels. Our results show that grid sentences produce more pronounced Lombard effects than natural sentences. Then, we develop and test a normal-to-Lombard conversion model, trained separately on LCT and EMALG corpora. Through subjective and objective evaluations, natural sentences are superior in maintaining speech quality in intelligibility enhancement. In contrast, grid sentences could provide superior intelligibility due to the more pronounced Lombard effect. This study provides a valuable perspective on enhancing speech communication in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Human Brain Exhibits Distinct Patterns When Listening to Fake Versus Real Audio: Preliminary Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the variations in human brain activity when listening to real and fake audio. Our preliminary results suggest that the representations learned by a state-of-the-art deepfake audio detection algorithm, do not exhibit clear distinct patterns between real and fake audio. In contrast, human brain activity, as measured by EEG, displays distinct patterns when individuals are exposed to fake versus real audio. This preliminary evidence enables future research directions in areas such as deepfake audio detection.</description>

      <title>MusicHiFi: Fast High-Fidelity Stereo Vocoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based audio and music generation models commonly perform generation by constructing an image representation of audio (e.g., a mel-spectrogram) and then convert it to audio using a phase reconstruction model or vocoder. Typical vocoders, however, produce monophonic audio at lower resolutions (e.g., 16-24 kHz), which limits their usefulness. We propose MusicHiFi -- an efficient high-fidelity stereophonic vocoder. Our method employs a cascade of three generative adversarial networks (GANs) that convert low-resolution mel-spectrograms to audio, upsamples to high-resolution audio via bandwidth extension, and upmixes to stereophonic audio. Compared to past work, we propose 1) a unified GAN-based generator and discriminator architecture and training procedure for each stage of our cascade, 2) a new fast, near downsampling-compatible bandwidth extension module, and 3) a new fast downmix-compatible mono-to-stereo upmixer that ensures the preservation of monophonic content in the output. We evaluate our approach using objective and subjective listening tests and find our approach yields comparable or better audio quality, better spatialization control, and significantly faster inference speed compared to past work.

      <title>Prompt-Singer: Controllable Singing-Voice-Synthesis with Natural Language Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent singing-voice-synthesis (SVS) methods have achieved remarkable audio quality and naturalness, yet they lack the capability to control the style attributes of the synthesized singing explicitly. We propose Prompt-Singer, the first SVS method that enables attribute controlling on singer gender, vocal range and volume with natural language. We adopt a model architecture based on a decoder-only transformer with a multi-scale hierarchy, and design a range-melody decoupled pitch representation that enables text-conditioned vocal range control while keeping melodic accuracy. Furthermore, we explore various experiment settings, including different types of text representations, text encoder fine-tuning, and introducing speech data to alleviate data scarcity, aiming to facilitate further research. Experiments show that our model achieves favorable controlling ability and audio quality. Audio samples are available at http://prompt-singer.github.io .</description>

      <title>Frieren: Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation with Rectified Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize content-matching audio from silent video, and it remains challenging to build V2A models with high generation quality, efficiency, and visual-audio temporal synchrony. We propose Frieren, a V2A model based on rectified flow matching. Frieren regresses the conditional transport vector field from noise to spectrogram latent with straight paths and conducts sampling by solving ODE, outperforming autoregressive and score-based models in terms of audio quality. By employing a non-autoregressive vector field estimator based on a feed-forward transformer and channel-level cross-modal feature fusion with strong temporal alignment, our model generates audio that is highly synchronized with the input video. Furthermore, through reflow and one-step distillation with guided vector field, our model can generate decent audio in a few, or even only one sampling step. Experiments indicate that Frieren achieves state-of-the-art performance in both generation quality and temporal alignment on VGGSound, with alignment accuracy reaching 97.22%, and 6.2% improvement in inception score over the strong diffusion-based baseline. Audio samples are available at http://frieren-v2a.github.io .</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Speech-Based Suicide Risk Detection Using Whisper and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early detection of suicide risk is important since it enables the intervention to prevent potential suicide attempts. This paper studies the automatic detection of suicide risk based on spontaneous speech from adolescents, and collects a Mandarin dataset with 15 hours of suicide speech from more than a thousand adolescents aged from ten to eighteen for our experiments. To leverage the diverse acoustic and linguistic features embedded in spontaneous speech, both the Whisper speech model and textual large language models (LLMs) are used for suicide risk detection. Both all-parameter finetuning and parameter-efficient finetuning approaches are used to adapt the pre-trained models for suicide risk detection, and multiple audio-text fusion approaches are evaluated to combine the representations of Whisper and the LLM. The proposed system achieves a detection accuracy of 0.807 and an F1-score of 0.846 on the test set with 119 subjects, indicating promising potential for real suicide risk detection applications.</description>

      <title>Do Prompts Really Prompt? Exploring the Prompt Understanding Capability of Whisper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research explores how the information of prompts interacts with the high-performing speech recognition model, Whisper. We compare its performances when prompted by prompts with correct information and those corrupted with incorrect information. Our results unexpectedly show that Whisper may not understand the textual prompts in a human-expected way. Additionally, we find that performance improvement is not guaranteed even with stronger adherence to the topic information in textual prompts. It is also noted that English prompts generally outperform Mandarin ones on datasets of both languages, likely due to differences in training data distributions for these languages despite the mismatch with pre-training scenarios. Conversely, we discover that Whisper exhibits awareness of misleading information in language tokens by ignoring incorrect language tokens and focusing on the correct ones. In sum, We raise insightful questions about Whisper's prompt understanding and reveal its counter-intuitive behaviors. We encourage further studies.</description>

      <title>Improving Text-To-Audio Models with Synthetic Captions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an open challenge to obtain high quality training data, especially captions, for text-to-audio models. Although prior methods have leveraged \textit{text-only language models} to augment and improve captions, such methods have limitations related to scale and coherence between audio and captions. In this work, we propose an audio captioning pipeline that uses an \textit{audio language model} to synthesize accurate and diverse captions for audio at scale. We leverage this pipeline to produce a dataset of synthetic captions for AudioSet, named \texttt{AF-AudioSet}, and then evaluate the benefit of pre-training text-to-audio models on these synthetic captions. Through systematic evaluations on AudioCaps and MusicCaps, we find leveraging our pipeline and synthetic captions leads to significant improvements on audio generation quality, achieving a new \textit{state-of-the-art}.</description>

      <title>Constant Directivity Loudspeaker Beamforming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loudspeaker array beamforming is a common signal processing technique for acoustic directivity control and robust audio reproduction. Unlike their microphone counterpart, loudspeaker constraints are often heterogeneous due to arrayed transducers with varying operating ranges in frequency, acoustic-electrical sensitivity, efficiency, and directivity. This work proposes a frequency-regularization method for generalized Rayleigh quotient directivity specifications and two novel beamformer designs that optimize for maximum efficiency constant directivity (MECD) and maximum sensitivity constant directivity (MSCD). We derive fast converging and analytic solutions from their quadratic equality constrained quadratic program formulations. Experiments optimize generalized directivity index constrained beamformer designs for a full-band heterogeneous array.</description>

      <title>FunAudioLLM: Voice Understanding and Generation Foundation Models for Natural Interaction Between Humans and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report introduces FunAudioLLM, a model family designed to enhance natural voice interactions between humans and large language models (LLMs). At its core are two innovative models: SenseVoice, which handles multilingual speech recognition, emotion recognition, and audio event detection; and CosyVoice, which facilitates natural speech generation with control over multiple languages, timbre, speaking style, and speaker identity. SenseVoice-Small delivers exceptionally low-latency ASR for 5 languages, and SenseVoice-Large supports high-precision ASR for over 50 languages, while CosyVoice excels in multi-lingual voice generation, zero-shot in-context learning, cross-lingual voice cloning, and instruction-following capabilities. The models related to SenseVoice and CosyVoice have been open-sourced on Modelscope and Huggingface, along with the corresponding training, inference, and fine-tuning codes released on GitHub. By integrating these models with LLMs, FunAudioLLM enables applications such as speech-to-speech translation, emotional voice chat, interactive podcasts, and expressive audiobook narration, thereby pushing the boundaries of voice interaction technology. Demos are available at https://fun-audio-llm.github.io, and the code can be accessed at https://github.com/FunAudioLLM.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Speech Encoders for Low-Resource SLU and ASR in Tunisian Dialect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech encoders pretrained through self-supervised learning (SSL) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various downstream tasks, including Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). For instance, fine-tuning SSL models for such tasks has shown significant potential, leading to improvements in the SOTA performance across challenging datasets. In contrast to existing research, this paper contributes by comparing the effectiveness of SSL approaches in the context of (i) the low-resource spoken Tunisian Arabic dialect and (ii) its combination with a low-resource SLU and ASR scenario, where only a few semantic annotations are available for fine-tuning. We conduct experiments using many SSL speech encoders on the TARIC-SLU dataset. We use speech encoders that were pre-trained on either monolingual or multilingual speech data. Some of them have also been refined without in-domain nor Tunisian data through multimodal supervised teacher-student paradigm. This study yields numerous significant findings that we are discussing in this paper.</description>

      <title>CosyVoice: A Scalable Multilingual Zero-shot Text-to-speech Synthesizer based on Supervised Semantic Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a trend that large language model (LLM) based text-to-speech (TTS) emerges into the mainstream due to their high naturalness and zero-shot capacity. In this paradigm, speech signals are discretized into token sequences, which are modeled by an LLM with text as prompts and reconstructed by a token-based vocoder to waveforms. Obviously, speech tokens play a critical role in LLM-based TTS models. Current speech tokens are learned in an unsupervised manner, which lacks explicit semantic information and alignment to the text. In this paper, we propose to represent speech with supervised semantic tokens, which are derived from a multilingual speech recognition model by inserting vector quantization into the encoder. Based on the tokens, we further propose a scalable zero-shot TTS synthesizer, CosyVoice, which consists of an LLM for text-to-token generation and a conditional flow matching model for token-to-speech synthesis. Experimental results show that supervised semantic tokens significantly outperform existing unsupervised tokens in terms of content consistency and speaker similarity for zero-shot voice cloning. Moreover, we find that utilizing large-scale data further improves the synthesis performance, indicating the scalable capacity of CosyVoice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to involve supervised speech tokens into TTS models.</description>
