      <title>Artificial Intelligence-based Analysis of Change in Public Finance between US and International Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public finances are one of the fundamental mechanisms of economic governance that refer to the financial activities and decisions made by government entities to fund public services, projects, and operations through assets. In today's globalized landscape, even subtle shifts in one nation's public debt landscape can have significant impacts on that of international finances, necessitating a nuanced understanding of the correlations between international and national markets to help investors make informed investment decisions. Therefore, by leveraging the capabilities of artificial intelligence, this study utilizes neural networks to depict the correlations between US and International Public Finances and predict the changes in international public finances based on the changes in US public finances. With the neural network model achieving a commendable Mean Squared Error (MSE) value of 2.79, it is able to affirm a discernible correlation and also plot the effect of US market volatility on international markets. To further test the accuracy and significance of the model, an economic analysis was conducted that aimed to correlate the changes seen by the results of the model with historical stock market changes. This model demonstrates significant potential for investors to predict changes in international public finances based on signals from US markets, marking a significant stride in comprehending the intricacies of global public finances and the role of artificial intelligence in decoding its multifaceted patterns for practical forecasting.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Learning Patterns in Financial Time-Series for Trend-Following Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting models for systematic trading strategies do not adapt quickly when financial market conditions rapidly change, as was seen in the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, causing many forecasting models to take loss-making positions. To deal with such situations, we propose a novel time-series trend-following forecaster that can quickly adapt to new market conditions, referred to as regimes. We leverage recent developments from the deep learning community and use few-shot learning. We propose the Cross Attentive Time-Series Trend Network -- X-Trend -- which takes positions attending over a context set of financial time-series regimes. X-Trend transfers trends from similar patterns in the context set to make forecasts, then subsequently takes positions for a new distinct target regime. By quickly adapting to new financial regimes, X-Trend increases Sharpe ratio by 18.9% over a neural forecaster and 10-fold over a conventional Time-series Momentum strategy during the turbulent market period from 2018 to 2023. Our strategy recovers twice as quickly from the COVID-19 drawdown compared to the neural-forecaster. X-Trend can also take zero-shot positions on novel unseen financial assets obtaining a 5-fold Sharpe ratio increase versus a neural time-series trend forecaster over the same period. Furthermore, the cross-attention mechanism allows us to interpret the relationship between forecasts and patterns in the context set.</description>
