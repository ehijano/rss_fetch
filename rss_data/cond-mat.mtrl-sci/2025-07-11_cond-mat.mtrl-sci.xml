      <title>3D Atomic-Scale Metrology of Strain Relaxation and Roughness in Gate-All-Around (GAA) Transistors via Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve transistor density and electronic performance, next-generation semiconductor devices are adopting three-dimensional architectures and feature sizes down to the few-nm regime, which require atomic-scale metrology to identify and resolve performance-limiting fabrication challenges. X-ray methods deliver three-dimensional imaging of integrated circuits but lack the spatial resolution to characterize atomic-scale features, while conventional electron microscopy offers atomic-scale imaging but limited depth information. We demonstrate how multislice electron ptychography (MEP), a computational electron microscopy technique with sub-\r{A}ngstr\"om lateral and nanometer-scale depth resolution, enables 3D imaging of buried features in devices. By performing MEP on prototype gate-all-around transistors we uncover and quantify distortions and defects at the interface of the 3D gate oxide wrapped around the channel. We find that the silicon in the 5-nm-thick channel gradually relaxes away from the interfaces, leaving only 60% of the atoms in a bulk-like structure. Quantifying the interface roughness, which was not previously possible for such small 3D structures but strongly impacts carrier mobility, we find that the top and bottom interfaces show different atomic-scale roughness profiles, reflecting their different processing conditions. By measuring 3D interface roughness simultaneously with strain relaxation and atomic-scale defects, from a single MEP dataset, we provide direct experimental values of these performance-limiting parameters needed for modeling and early fabrication optimization.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions for Bimodal Distributions under Stochastic Plasma Irradiation in Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A persistent paradox complicates the study of plasma-irradiated thin films, where bimodal grain distributions and ambiguous scaling laws, roughly shifting between $\Phi^{-1/2}$ and $\Phi^{-1}$, or a general inverse dependence on plasma flux, are empirical yet remain theoretically unreconciled. Existing models fail to unify noise-driven evolution, defect saturation kinetics, and nucleation-loss balance within a single, self-consistent formalism. This work resolves these discrepancies by developing the first exact analytical theory for this system. We derive the closed-form steady-state grain area distribution, $P_{ss}(A)$, establish the precise dimensionless threshold for bimodality onset at $\Pi_c = 4/(3\sqrt{3})$, and demonstrate that defect saturation physics mandate a universal $\langle A \rangle \propto \kappa^2 \Phi^{-1} e^{+2E_b/k_B T_s}$ scaling law. The framework reveals how competition between stochastic impingement and deterministic growth triggers microstructure fragmentation, resolving long-standing ambiguities in irradiation-induced surface evolution and providing a predictive foundation for materials processing.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of the first-order phase transition character and Enhancement of the Electrocaloric Effect by NBT substitution in BaTiO$_3$ ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrocaloric properties of BaTiO$_3$-based lead-free ferroelectric materials have been widely investigated. One approach to achieving a large electrocaloric response is to exploit the substantial polarization change associated with the first-order phase transition at the Curie temperature. Following this strategy, we investigated the electrocaloric response of (1$-x$)BaTiO$_3$-$x$Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$ (BT-NBT) ceramics for x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30. In this BT-rich region of the solid solution, it is established that increasing the NBT content enhances the tetragonality of BaTiO$_3$. We show that this increase in tetragonality helps maintain the first-order nature of the phase transition and enables a correspondingly large electrocaloric response, despite the simultaneous enhancement of relaxor ferroelectric character with NBT substitution. A significantly large effective electrocaloric temperature change ($\Delta T_{\mathrm{eff}}$) of ~1.65 K was obtained for the x = 0.20 composition under an applied field of 40 kV/cm using direct electrocaloric measurements, in reasonable agreement with the indirect results.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Prediction Enabled by Automatic Dataset Building and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New discoveries in chemistry and materials science, with increasingly expanding volume of requisite knowledge and experimental workload, provide unique opportunities for machine learning (ML) to take critical roles in accelerating research efficiency. Here, we demonstrate (1) the use of large language models (LLMs) for automated literature reviews, and (2) the training of an ML model to predict chemical knowledge (thermodynamic parameters). Our LLM-based literature review tool (LMExt) successfully extracted chemical information and beyond into a machine-readable structure, including stability constants for metal cation-ligand interactions, thermodynamic properties, and other broader data types (medical research papers, and financial reports), effectively overcoming the challenges inherent in each domain. Using the autonomous acquisition of thermodynamic data, an ML model was trained using the CatBoost algorithm for accurately predicting thermodynamic parameters (e.g., enthalpy of formation) of minerals. This work highlights the transformative potential of integrated ML approaches to reshape chemistry and materials science research.</description>

      <title>High thermal conductivity dominated by thermal phonons with mean free paths exceeding hundred nanometer in three-dimensional covalent organic framework derivatives: a molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of fundamental interest owing to exceptional heat conduction properties. Recent studies have suggested that their thermal conductivities can be enhanced by multiple factors such as pore size, mass density, and degree of chain order. However, microscopic processes that govern heat conduction properties have been explored in only a limited number of COFs. Here, we report thermal transport properties of 3D COF derivatives using molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we have studied six different COF-102 derivatives with different organic linkers and topologies. Among the derivatives studied, we found that COF-102 derivatives with high mass density can exhibit thermal conductivity as high as ~ 27 W/mK, owing to suppressed chain rotation that leads to thermal phonons scattered by anharmonicity. Our results show that the observed orders of magnitude of increase in the thermal conductivity are primarily attributed to low frequency phonon modes that support hundreds of nanometer scale mean free path, which predominantly carry heat. Our study provides a theoretical framework that elucidates the structure-property relationship governing heat conduction in COFs, offering design strategies for thermal management applications.</description>

      <title>Promising ferroelectric metal EuAuBi with switchable giant shift current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of metallicity and ferroelectricity in ferroelectric (FE) metals defies conventional wisdom and enables novel functionalities in electronic and optoelectronic systems. However, intrinsic FE metals remain extremely rare and challenging. Here, using first-principles calculations, we identify that a huge spontaneous polarization of 16.6-20.2 $\mu\text{C}/\text{cm}^2$, a moderate switching barrier of 68.5 meV/f.u., and a low carrier concentration of $ \sim 2.5 \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ coexist in topological semimetal EuAuBi. Further electron-phonon coupling calculations reveal that the metallic carriers interact weakly with the FE phonon mode, consistent with the decoupled electron mechanism. Moreover, EuAuBi exhibits a pronounced bulk photovoltaic effect characterized by a giant polarization-dependent shift current with the magnitude of conductivity up to 370 $\mu\text{A}/\text{V}^2$. Thus, a feasible FE metal verification setup is proposed based on the shift current measurement. These results not only demonstrate that EuAuBi is a promising FE metal, but also propose a practical route for FE metals identification, which could promote the FE metals study greatly.</description>

      <title>Large unconventional anomalous Hall effect far above room temperature in epitaxial Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncoplanar spin textures usually exhibit a finite scalar spin chirality (SSC) that can generate effective magnetic fields and lead to additional contributions to the Hall effect, namely topological or unconventional anomalous Hall effect (UAHE). Unlike topological spin textures (e.g., magnetic skyrmions), materials that exhibit fluctuation-driven SSC and UAHE are rare. So far, their realization has been limited to either low temperatures or high magnetic fields, both of which are unfavorable for practical applications. Identifying new materials that exhibit UAHE in a low magnetic field at room temperature is therefore essential. Here, we report the discovery of a large UAHE far above room temperature in epitaxial Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films, where the fluctuation-driven SSC stems from the field-induced transverse-conical-spiral phase. Considering their epitaxial nature and the large UAHE stabilized at room temperature in a low magnetic field, Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films represent an exciting, albeit rare, case of a promising candidate material for spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Common topological origin of longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance in Fe3GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we reveal the coexistence and correlation of a topological cusp anomaly in the planar Hall signal and a spin-flip scattering dominated positive longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) across the entire temperature range below the Curie point in Fe3GeTe2. This correlation dies out exponentially as the magnetic field is directed away from the ab-plane, resulting in unusually sharp polar angle dependence of longitudinal MR and the Hall response.</description>

      <title>In-situ SHG microscopy investigation of the domain-wall-conductivity enhancement procedure in lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conductive domain walls (CDWs) in the uniaxial ferroelectric lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) have attracted a lot of interest as potential elements in 2D nanoelectronics, due to their orders-of-magnitude larger electronic AC and DC conductivities as compared to the host material. On the way towards generating standardized CDWs into z-cut bulk LN crystals with controllable geometry and electrical properties, we have encountered setbacks recently: Although the first preparation step, i.e., the established UV-light-assisted liquid-electrode poling, reliably creates fully penetrating hexagonal domains with the DWs being aligned almost parallel to the polarization axis, the second step in the DW 'conductivity-enhancement' process through post-growth voltage ramping, resulted in randomly-shaped DWs as reflected in their different current-voltage (I-V) characteristics even after having applied the same process parameters. To clarify this phenomenon, we present here an \textit{in-situ} and time-resolved second-harmonic-generation (SHG) microscopy investigation of DW samples of different sizes, monitoring the DW evolution during that critical voltage ramping, which allowed us to reconstruct the 3D DW shapes both prior to and after the enhancement process. As a result, we are able to map the temporal changes of the local DW inclination angle $\alpha$, and to quantify the DW velocity. As a consequence, we need to re-assess and re-think the origin of the DW conductivity (DWC) in LN: The hitherto assumed simple connection between $\alpha$ and the DWC can not be generalized, since point defects accumulating along DWs act as extra sources for charge carrier trapping/release, significantly contributing to the DW current.</description>

Abstract: Multiferroics exhibit significant potential for low-power spintronic devices due to magnetoelectric coupling. Here, we discuss an emerging class of altermagnetic multiferroics, a system demonstrating distinct advantages including zero net magnetization (eliminating stray fields), momentum-dependent spin splitting (enabling electric-field control of spin currents), and intrinsic strong magnetoelectric coupling originating from spin-space symmetry.</description>

      <title>Strain-Stabilized Interfacial Polarization Tunes Work Function Over 1 eV in RuO2/TiO2 Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial polarization-charge accumulation at the heterointerface-is a well-established tool in semiconductors, but its influence in metals remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that interfacial polarization can robustly modulate surface work function in metallic rutile RuO2 layers in epitaxial RuO2/TiO2 heterostructures grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. Using multislice electron ptychography, we directly visualize polar displacements of transition metal ions relative to oxygen octahedra near the interface, despite the conductive nature of RuO2. This interfacial polarization enables over 1 eV modulation of the RuO2 work function, controlled by small thickness variation (2-4 nm) as measured by Kelvin probe probe microscopy, with a critical thickness of 4 nm - corresponding to the transition from fully strained to relaxed film. These results establish interfacial polarization as a powerful route to control electronic properties in metals and have implications for designing tunable electronic, catalytic, and quantum devices through interfacial control in polar metallic systems.</description>

      <title>First-principles analysis of the effect of magnetic states on the oxygen vacancy formation energy in doped La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$ perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen vacancies are critical for determining the electrochemical performance of fast oxygen ion conductors. The perovskite La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$, known for its excellent mixed ionic-electronic conduction, has attracted significant attention due to its favorable vacancy characteristics. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate the impact of 3$d$ transition-metal doping on the oxygen vacancy formation energies in the perovskite. Two magnetic states, namely the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states, are considered in our models to capture the influence of magnetic effects on oxygen vacancy energetics. Our results reveal that the oxygen vacancy formation energies are strongly dependent on both the dopant species and the magnetic state. Notably, the magnetic states alter the vacancy formation energy in a dopant-specific manner due to double exchange interactions, indicating that relying solely on the ferromagnetic ground state may result in misleading trends in doping behavior. These findings emphasise the importance of accounting for magnetic effects when investigating oxygen vacancy properties in perovskite oxides.</description>

      <title>Strain-tunable type-II to type-III &amp; Gimbal nodal line transition in Imm2-phase of Cu$_2$SnS$_3$: An ab-initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) represent an intriguing quantum phase, opening new avenues in materials science for practical applications such as anisotropic transport devices, high-mobility conductors, unconventional thermoelectrics, and nonlinear optical devices. Recently, Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ has been theoretically proposed as a type-II NLSM, with its Fermi surface containing only one nodal ring. Here, we demonstrate how uniaxial, equi-biaxial, and equi-triaxial strains affect the nodal line state of the $Imm2$-phase of Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ by using state-of-the-art ab-initio calculations. Under the application of uniaxial compressive strain (UCS) along the a-direction, the plane of the nodal line evolves from the $k_x$-$k_z$ to $k_y$-$k_z$ for 6\%$\leq$UCS$\leq$8\%. In contrast, under uniaxial tensile strain (UTS), the nodal line remains in the ($k_x$-$k_z$) plane across the entire studied range of UTS. Interestingly, on the application of equi-biaxial tensile strain (EBTS) along a-b (a-c) directions, it hosts only one nodal ring below 8\% ($&lt;$6\%), which further evolves into three (seven) nodal-ring for EBTS of 8\% (6\%$\leq$EBTS$\leq$8\%). Upon the application of EBTS along a-c directions, we found two sets of three mutually orthogonal, intersecting nodal loops (topological gimbals). Apart from this, under the application of equi-biaxial compressive strain (EBCS) along the a-b (a-c) directions, it exhibits only one nodal ring up to 8\% (7\%). Beyond this, the nodal line completely vanishes and does not reappear at higher values of EBCS. Under equi-triaxial tensile strain (ETTS), Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ exhibits only one nodal-ring $&lt;$6\%, which subsequently transforms into five nodal-ring for 6\%$\leq$ETTS$\leq$8\%. However, under the application of equi-triaxial compressive strain (ETCS), as in EBCS, only one nodal line exists up to 6\% ETCS.</description>

      <title>Temporal modulation of second harmonic generation in ferroelectrics by a pulsed electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the relationship between electric polarization modulation $\Delta P$ in ferroelectrics induced by a low-frequency pulsed electric field and the corresponding second harmonic intensity modulation $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Using nonlinear response theory, we derive their time-domain expressions linear in the pulse amplitude, revealing that not only the electric field but also its time derivative contributes to $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Furthermore, even when the time-derivative component is negligible, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can be in antiphase with the pulsed field and thus with $\Delta P$. These theoretical predictions are further supported by real-time simulations of a model for electronic ferroelectrics. Our results demonstrate that the commonly assumed relation $\Delta P \propto \Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can break down under certain conditions, reflecting the complex-valued and frequency-dependent nature of nonlinear dynamical susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Superlubricity of Borophene: Tribological Properties in Comparison to hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tribological performance of 2D materials makes them good candidates toward a reduction of friction at the macroscale. Superlubricity has been observed for graphene, MoS\textsubscript{2} and MXenes and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is used to reduce or tune friction, but other materials are investigated as potential candidates for low-lubricity applications. Specifically, borophene is predicted to have ultra-low friction. Here, we experimentally investigate frictional properties of borophene and use a borophene-hBN lateral heterostructure to directly compare the tribological properties of the two complementary 2D materials. In particular, we investigate the friction between a sliding tip and (i) the weakly corrugated $\mathcal{X}_6$-borophene layer on Ir(111) or (ii) the hBN/Ir(111) superlattice structures with a strongly corrugated moir\'e reconstruction. Our experimental study performed in ultra-high vacuum at room temperature combined with a Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model calculation confirms the superlubricity predicted for borophene, while hBN, which exhibits a higher friction, is nevertheless confirmed as a low friction material. Ab initio calculations show that the lower friction of $\mathcal{X}_6$-borophene with respect to hBN can be rationalized by weaker tip/surface interactions. In addition, we assess structural and electrical properties of borophene and hBN by using scanning probe techniques and compare their dissipation under the oscillating tip to investigate the possible path of energy dissipation occurring during friction. Our study demonstrates the low frictional properties of borophene and the potential of lateral heterostructure investigations to directly compare the properties of these 2D materials.</description>

      <title>In situ impedance spectroscopy tests of Li$_{4-x}$Ge$_{1-x}$P$_x$O$_4$ as potential solid state electrolyte for Micro Li ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries employing solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are emerging as a safer and more compact alternative to conventional batteries using liquid electrolytes, especially for miniaturized energy storage systems. However, the industry-standard SSE, LiPON, imposes limitations due to its incompatibility with high-temperature processing. In this study, we investigate Li$_{4-x}$Ge$_{1-x}$P$_x$O$_4$ (LGPO), a LISICON-type oxide, as a promising alternative thin-film SSE. LGPO thin films are fabricated using pulsed laser deposition under four distinct deposition conditions, with in situ impedance spectroscopy enabling precise conductivity measurements without ambient exposure. We systematically correlate deposition temperature, background pressure, chemical composition, crystallinity, and morphology with ionic transport properties. Polycrystalline LGPO films grown at high temperature (535 $^\circ$C) and low oxygen pressure (0.01 mbar) exhibited the highest room-temperature ionic conductivity ($\sim 1.2 \times 10^{-5}$ S cm$^{-1}$), exceeding that of LiPON by an order of magnitude, with an activation energy of 0.46 eV. In contrast, amorphous films show significantly lower conductivity ($\sim 5.2 \times 10^{-8}$ S cm$^{-1}$) and higher activation energy (0.72 eV). The results reveal that crystallinity, chemical composition, and grain boundary density critically affect ion transport, highlighting the importance of microstructural control. This work establishes LGPO as a viable, high-performance oxide SSE compatible with high-temperature processing for next-generation microbattery architectures.</description>

      <title>Muonium as a probe of point defects in type-Ib diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muonium (Mu), a bound state of a positively charged muon and an electron, can diffuse through crystal lattices and interact with defect centers in insulators and semiconductors. We demonstrate that this Mu's diffusive property can be used to probe defects in a diamond crystal lattice; specifically, substitutional nitrogen atoms (N$_\text{s}^0$) and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in type-Ib diamond. Upon interaction with these defects, Mu can exchange its electron's spin or change its charge state, which result in muon spin relaxation. However, muons in diamond (and semiconductors in general) can be in a few distinctive muonium states, with each state contributing to the muon signal. In addition, these states can undergo site and charge exchange interaction, forming a dynamic network. Hence, to study the Mu interaction with point defects, the muon data have to be deconvoluted to isolate signals from the diffusing species. To achieve this goal, we have modeled the Mu state exchange dynamics and numerically simulated the time evolution of muon spin polarization by the density matrix method. With a global curve fit to a set of longitudinal field scan data, one can extract the Mu transition rates that involve interaction with the defect centers. The diffusing tetrahedral interstitial Mu was found to interact with the paramagnetic N$_\text{s}^0$ center via electron spin exchange. In contrast, they are converted to form a diamagnetic center upon interaction with the negatively charged NV center.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Empirical Descriptor for Open Circuit Voltage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered transition metal oxides (TMO) are widely used as cathode materials in Na/Li batteries. The open-circuit voltage (OCV), which determines the energy density (together with capacity), is among the key physical and chemical factors influencing the performance of cathodes. The shape of the voltage profile is also influenced by the formation energy of intermediate phases during cycling. From a theoretical perspective, the formation energy (and voltage) are defined as internal energy differences between phases. Therefore, an accurate prediction of internal energy is crucial for the calculation of OCV. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that decomposes the internal energy of a given TMO into distinct contributions with clear physical significance. Specifically, we break down the energy into parameters that can be more easily calculated (compared to DFT) and obtained from experimental databases. From these parameters, we define a potential term that can be calculated for different compositions, and can be used for calculation of voltage profile</description>

      <title>Reversible local strain engineering of $\mathrm{WS}_2$ using a micro-mechanical spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local strain engineering is a promising technique to tune the properties of two-dimensional materials at the nanoscale. However, many existing methods are static and limit the systematic exploration of strain-dependent material behavior. Here, we demonstrate dynamic and reversible control of local strain distributions in suspended trilayer tungsten disulfide ($\mathrm{WS}_2$) via nanoindentation using a micro-mechanical spring patterned with nanoscale probes. Micro-photoluminescence measurements reveal that indentation using a ring-shaped probe induces a nearly uniform biaxial strain distribution accompanied by a reversible redshift of the neutral exciton peak, consistent with simulated strain magnitudes. We further show that the in-plane strain distribution is spatially programmable by engineering the probe geometry and present designs for inducing point-like, uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial strain distributions. The presented platform enables substrate-free, repeatable local strain engineering in suspended 2D materials and provides a versatile tool for streamlining the investigation of strain-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Fundamental of CO2 Adsorption and Diffusion in Sub-nanoporous Materials: Application to CALF-20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical approach for predicting thermodynamics and kinetics of guest molecules in nanoporous materials. This statistical mechanical-based method requires a minimal set of physical parameters that may originate from experiments or numerical simulations. We applied it to CO2 molecules in the recently highlighted CALF-20 metal-organic framework for adsorption and molecular self-diffusion at different temperatures. All the physical parameters of the model are extracted from one CO$_2$ isotherm analyzed by the adsorption energy distribution method. The model is then used to approximate isotherms at different temperatures, Henry's constant, saturation density, as well as enthalpies of adsorption at infinite dilution. We then express molecular kinetics through the transition state theory allowing to predict molecular diffusion in part from the prior knowledge of thermodynamics, and further compared self-diffusion coefficients to one from molecular dynamics used as a numerical experiment. The approach proposed allows to express molecular adsorption and diffusion based on a fitting procedure allowing to get physical parameters with a view on thermodynamics and kinetics mechanisms at play in the system.</description>

      <title>Modulation of PEDOT properties via cobalt ferrite nanoparticles: morphology, conjugation length, doping level, structure, and electrical conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite materials based on Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and CoFe$_2$O$_4$ magnetic nanoparticles (NP) were synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization with varying monomer and surfactant (DBSA) concentrations, and were compared to PEDOT samples synthesized without NP. Electrical conductivity measurements were performed, which revealed that the composites are more conductive than the pure PEDOT samples, with this effect depending on EDOT and DBSA contents. Characterizations by SEM and TEM microscopies, UV-Vis, FTIR and Raman spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction and dynamic light scattering were carried out in order to associate the morphology and structure of these materials to their electrical conductivity, and to explain how EDOT and DBSA concentrations, and also the presence of NP, affects those properties. It was found that the NP play a significant role in the polymerization of EDOT, influencing the formation and arrangement of polymer chains, as well as their conjugation length, oxidation state, and resonant structures. These effects are also dependent on the DBSA content. To describe the conductivity of the composites, a two-phase model based on general effective media theory was introduced. The analysis revealed that, at low reactant concentrations, the NP increase the conductivity of the adjacent PEDOT by over two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Phase Stability and Transformations in Lead Mixed Halide Perovskites from Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites (APbX$_3$) offer tunable optoelectronic properties but feature an intricate phase-stability landscape. Here we employ on-the-fly data collection and an equivariant message-passing neural-network potential to perform large-scale molecular dynamics of three prototypical perovskite systems: CsPbX$_3$, MAPbX$_3$, and FAPbX$_3$. Integrating these simulations with the PDynA analysis toolkit, we resolve both equilibrium phase diagrams and dynamic structural evolution under varying temperature and halide-mixing conditions. Our findings reveal that the A-site cation strongly modulates octahedral tilt modes and phase pathways: MA$^+$ effectively "forbids" the beta-to-gamma transition in MAPbX$_3$ by requiring extensive molecular rearrangements and crystal rotation, whereas the debated low-temperature phase in FAPbX$_3$ is best represented as an Im$\bar{3}$ cubic phase with $a^+a^+a^+$ tilts. Additionally, small changes in halide composition and arrangement $\unicode{x2013}$ from uniform mixing to partial segregation $\unicode{x2013}$ alter tilt correlations. Segregated domains can even foster anomalous tilting modes that impede uniform phase transformations. These results highlight the multi-scale interplay between cation environment and halide distribution, offering a rational basis for tuning perovskite architectures toward improved phase stability.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Materials for Light Dark Matter Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of several unconventional materials as detectors for dark matter with mass beneath the MeV scale. These include the transition-metal dichalcogenide TiSe$_2$ hosting a low-energy plasmon in the charge-density-wave phase, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ containing a low-energy acoustic demon mode, and hole-doped diamond with tunable optical and acoustic plasmon frequencies. We perform first-principles density functional theory computations of their loss functions at non-vanishing momenta and establish their reach into light dark matter parameter space. We show that due to intense low-energy plasmon modes -- of different microscopic origin in each -- the reach of detectors based on these materials could surpass existing proposals by several orders of magnitude for both dark matter scattering and absorption on electrons. The anisotropic response of these materials, which enables directional detection, renders them exceptionally strong detector candidates, motivating the design and fabrication of future devices.</description>

      <title>Origin of insulating-like behavior of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ under pressure: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental study on Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ superconductors has revealed an unexpected quantum phase transition from superconducting state to insulatinglike state under pressure [Zhou et al., Nat. Phys. 18, 406 (2022)]. To better understand the physical origin of this pressure-induced phenomenon, here we have studied the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of undoped and O-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi2212) under pressures based on density-functional theory calculations. We first identified the crystal structure of undoped Bi2212 with the armchair distortions in the BiO layers and reproduced the insulating feature of the parent compound. Then we added an extra O atom to the parent compound to simulate the hole-doping effect and found that the structure with O dopant located in the van der Waals (vdW) gap is energetically the most stable. Further calculations on O-doped (0.125 holes/Cu) Bi2212 revealed that the pressure can induce charge redistributions between CuO$_2$ planes and BiO layers; specifically, Cu-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals gain electrons and Cu atoms rather than O atoms dominate around the Fermi level under high pressure. Along with the increasing pressure, the density of states at the Fermi level first reaches the maximum at $\sim$ 10 GPa and then shows a valley near the Fermi level above 20 GPa, which may be responsible for the insulatinglike state observed in recent experiments. We suggest that the competition among several factors, such as the increase of electrons in the CuO$_2$ plane, the variation of in-plane hopping due to the shortened Cu-O distance, and the enhanced Coulomb repulsion among the Cu-3$d$ electrons, could lead to the exotic transition under pressure. Our work provides an explanation of the high-pressure behaviors of Bi2212, which may facilitate a comprehensive understanding of cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Not even metastable: Cubic double-diamond in diblock copolymer melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of continuous transformations between two canonical, cubic network phases of block copolymer melts: double-gyroid, an equilibrium morphology for many systems; and double-diamond, often thought to be a close competitor. We use a strong-segregation approach to compute the free energy of double network morphologies as a function of two structural parameters that convert between two limiting cubic cases; a tetragonal stretch of the unit cell in combination with fusion of pairs of trihedal gyroid nodes into tetrahedral diamond nodes. For the simplest case of conformationally symmetric diblock melts, we find that cubic double-diamond sits at an unstable saddle point that is continuously deformable into the lower free energy gyroid, as well as a second metastable, tetragonal network composed by trihedral nodes. We confirm the broad instability of double-diamond at finite segregation using self-consistent field studies and further show that it derives directly from the entropic free energy cost of chain packing in the tubular domains of tetrahedral nodes. Correspondingly, we demonstrate two factors that quench the entropic cost of packing in the tubular domain -- homopolymer blending and elastic asymmetry between the blocks -- promoting double-diamond to a metastable state by way of free energy barrier that separates it from double-gyroid.</description>

      <title>Observation of superconductivity-induced leading-edge gap in Sr-doped $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bulk $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ has ignited significant interest in nickelate superconductors. Unlike cuprates, where superconductivity predominantly originates from the $\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, nickelates exhibit additional complexities involving contributions from the $\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$ orbital, prompting fundamental questions about their pairing mechanisms. Despite recent progress in stabilizing superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films at ambient pressure, direct spectroscopic evidence of the superconducting gap opening remains elusive. Here, we present an in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of Sr-doped superconducting $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films. Fermi surface mapping reveals Ni-$\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-derived $\alpha$ and $\beta$ pockets, with orbital fillings of 0.11$\pm$0.02 electrons and 0.66$\pm$0.03 holes per Ni, respectively, resulting in a total of 0.45$\pm$0.04 electrons for each Ni. These bands exhibit moderate electron correlations, characterized by a band renormalization factor of 3-4. Notably, both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands exhibit leading-edge shifts across the superconducting transition, with gap magnitude of ~1-2 meV at Fermi momenta along the Brillouin zone diagonal and slightly away from the zone diagonal, deviating from the conventional $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap structure. Additionally, the Ni-$\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$-derived $\gamma$ band lies ~75 meV below the Fermi level, indicating a $\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-dominated fermiology in this compound.</description>

However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models, general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process. While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Resilient cluster Mott states in layered Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ against pressure-induced symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, by combining density-functional theory (DFT) with dynamical mean-field calculations (DMFT), we compare the crystal and electronic structures of the prototype cluster Mott insulator Nb$_{3}$Cl$_8$ at ambient and high-pressure. We explain the finite but significantly reduced charge gap experimentally observed at $P=9.7$ GPa. We reveal a local symmetry breaking of the Nb$_{3}$ trimer under pressure, reducing its symmetry from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{s}$. This leads to a strong bandwidth enhancement and a lift of band degeneracy. Crucially, despite the significant change of band details, the cluster Mott insulating state is robust against local symmetry breaking. We show that the experimental observed gap under pressure is still a cluster Mott gap and its reduced value stems from both increased bandwidth and reduced Coulomb interactions under pressure. Our study provides the first systematic theoretical elucidation of how pressure-induced symmetry breaking dictates the cluster Mott state, establishing a robust foundation for understanding the intricate relationship between symmetry, local/non-local correlations, and emergent quantum states in correlated cluster compounds.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Dependent Adhesion in Transparent, Monodomain Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastomeric pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) form adhesive bonds under light pressure. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are exciting PSA candidates as they can impart both anisotropy and temperature-dependence to adhesion, but the full potential of their anisotropic adhesion is unexplored. Here, identical side-chain LCEs, produced as transparent isotropic or nematic films are investigated; the latter aligned in homeotropic or planar geometries. Their room-temperature adhesion, determined through a 90-degree peel test, is consistent with theoretical predictions and strongest in a planar geometry (peeled parallel to the director) with adhesive force per unit length of 0.67 Nmm-1. In contrast, adhesion of the planar perpendicular, isotropic and homeotropic films is 62.5%, 38.5% and 23.0% lower, respectively. The surface contribution to adhesion is identical for all films, confirming that the variation in adhesion is determined solely by the bulk LCE alignment controlled during film preparation. A temperature-dependent adhesion factor is determined from 0 Celsius to 80 Celsius using dynamic mechanical analysis, and found to be in excellent agreement with the peel data at room temperature. Molecular relaxations active above the glass transition temperature are dominant in determining LCE adhesion. The results show that side-chain LCEs can function as transparent, tunable, broad-temperature smart PSAs</description>

      <title>Pressure induced ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition in transition metal chalcogenide Cr$_{3}$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have carried out a detailed high-pressure investigation on the strongly correlated transition metal chalcogenide $Cr_{3}Te_4$ using Raman spectroscopy and XRD, which is ferromagnetic and metallic at ambient conditions. We find that the monoclinic structure remains stable up to 30 GPa, the highest pressure studied. The Cr-Te bond length and octahedral volume decrease drastically up to 7.6 GPa pressure. The $A_{1g}$ Raman mode shows a red shift up to 7.6 GPa, and the $E_g$ Raman mode shows a sudden drop around the same pressure. Further low-temperature Raman spectroscopic investigation shows that the Raman modes soften at the ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition. This suggests a change in the magnetic ordering at high pressure. Our Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations reveal the change in magnetic ground state from ferromagnetic state to antiferromagnetic state above 7.6 GPa pressure, corroborating our experimental result.</description>

      <title>Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs or medium range crystalline order (MRCO). In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse-graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale $L_{max}$ that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse-grained over $L_{max}$ exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in MRCO-free models like KALJ by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.</description>

Abstract: We review the linear response theory in the horizontal quantum liquids framework spanning from Coulomb liquids to Atomic gases. There are several well known references about this subject, like the onset of the Kramers-Kronig relations and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. For the Coulomb systems we show the connection between the linear response function and the dielectric function which settles a parallelism between statistical mechanics and electrostatic properties. For (very degenerate, dilute, trapped, two dimensional) Atomic (Bose) gases we will prove, in full generality, how the response properties of the gas depend from the frequency of the harmonic trap.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Predictions with Foundation Atomistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00755v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in machine learning have led to the development of foundation models for atomistic materials chemistry, enabling quantum-accurate descriptions of interatomic forces across chemically diverse compounds at reduced computational cost. Hitherto, the accuracy and utility of these models have been assessed relying on descriptors based on formation energies or idealized harmonic atomic vibrations. Yet, the rigorous and physically interpretable quantification of their capability to describe both realistic anharmonic atomic dynamics and technologically relevant observables remains a pressing problem. Here, we address this problem, leveraging the Wigner formulation of heat transport and the Gr\"uneisen approach to thermal expansion to connect the atomic-physics awareness of foundation models to their utility in predicting experimentally observable thermomechanical properties, presenting standards and fine-tuning protocols needed to achieve first-principles accuracy. We apply our framework to a database of 103 solids with diverse compositions and structures, demonstrating that it overcomes the major bottlenecks of current methods for designing heat-management materials -- high cost, limited transferability, or lack of physics awareness -- and its potential to discover materials for next-gen technologies ranging from thermal insulation to neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic phonon self-energy due to electrons with finite linewidths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of the non-adiabatic phonon self-energy arising from coupling to electrons with finite linewidths using the spectral representation of Green's functions. Our formalism naturally includes the contribution from the intra-band electronic transitions (as well as the inter-band ones) at all electron wavevectors to the phonon linewidths, which is forbidden for zone-center optical phonons if infinitesimal electron linewidths are used. As a proof of principle, we use the theory to calculate the linewidth of the double-degenerate, zone-center optical $E_{\rm 2g}$ phonons of graphene as a function of the chemical potential. The calculated phonon linewidths obtained with finite electron linewidths differ significantly from those obtained with infinitesimal electron linewidths even at low temperatures. Intra-band electronic transitions play an important role in making this difference. Moreover, only the results accounting for the finite electron linewidths are in quantitative agreement with the available experimental data. The presented formalism is suitable for first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Bio-Derived Graphite from Pterocarpus marsupium Leaves for rGO-MoO$_3$ Nanocomposites with Enhanced Photocatalytic Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a sustainable approach to synthesize bio-graphite from Pterocarpus marsupium (Indian Kino) leaves without using chemical catalysts, activating agents, or organic solvents. The resulting bio-graphite was used to produce reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a modified Hummers method. The bio-graphite derived rGO was further incorporated with orthorhombic structured MoO$_3$ at different percentages (1, 3, and 6 wt.%) using ultrasonication. Structural, morphological, and functional characterizations were conducted using XRD, FESEM, FTIR, and UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy, revealing a bandgap of 2.82 eV for the rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ composite. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated via methylene blue degradation under natural sunlight. The rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ nanocomposite showed superior performance, achieving 90% degradation in 150 minutes when compared to 65% by pure MoO$_3$. The Scavenger tests confirmed superoxide radicals $(\cdot O_2^-)$ as the main reactive species. This work highlights the potential of bio-graphite derived rGO-MoO$_3$ nanocomposites as efficient, eco-friendly photocatalysts for wastewater treatment.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of charge states at the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle in a liquid crystal</title>

Abstract: The liquid crystal with suspended ferroelectric nanoparticles is an interesting object for fundamental research of the long-range dipole-dipole interactions; as well as it is promising for optical, optoelectronic and electrochemical applications. Such suspensions can serve as basic elements for advanced nonvolatile memory cells and energy storage devices. The work studies the cells filled with a nematic liquid crystal 5CB and the cells containing 5CB with 0.5 wt.% and 1 wt.% of BaTiO3 nanoparticles with an average size of 24 nm. We analyzed the time dependences of the current flowing through the cells at constant applied voltage and the voltage dynamics in the no-load mode. The time dependences of the current and voltage show a slowing down decay rate. For the cells with BaTiO3 nanoparticles, the decrease in the decay time is characteristic. A possible physical reason for the retarding decay time rate is the indirect effect of screening charges, which cover ferroelectric nanoparticles, and slow ionic transport in the liquid crystal. To explain the dynamics of current and voltage, the finite element modeling of the polarization distribution, domain structure dynamics, and charge state of nanoparticles in a liquid crystal is performed using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach. Theoretical results confirmed the leading role of screening charges, because the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle adsorbs an ionic-electronic charge that partially screens its spontaneous polarization in single-domain and/or poly-domain states. When an electric field is applied to the liquid crystal with nanoparticles, it can release part of the screening charge (mainly due to the change in the polarization of the nanoparticle), which will lead to a decrease in decay time rate of the current and voltage dependences.</description>

      <title>Testing the spin-bath view of self-attention: A Hamiltonian analysis of GPT-2 Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians, we obtain analytic \textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p&lt;10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. In this work, we utilize the context-field lens, which provides physics-grounded interpretability and motivates the development of novel generative models bridging theoretical condensed matter physics and artificial intelligence.</description>

Abstract: Topological magnon bands enable uni-directional edge transport without backscattering, enhancing the robustness of magnonic circuits and providing a novel platform for exploring quantum transport phenomena. Magnetic skyrmion lattices, in particular, host a manifold of topological magnon bands with multipole character and non-reciprocal dispersions. These modes have been explored already in the short and long wavelength limit, but previously employed techniques were unable to access intermediate wavelengths comparable to inter-skyrmion distances. Here, we report the detection of such magnons with wavevectors $|{\bf q}|\simeq 48$ rad $\mu$m$^{-1}$ in the metastable skyrmion lattice phase of the bulk chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ using Brillouin light scattering microscopy. Thanks to its high sensitivity and broad bandwidth various multipole excitation modes could be resolved over a wide magnetic field regime. Besides the known counterclockwise, breathing and clockwise modes with dipole character, quantitative comparison of frequencies and spectral weights to theoretical predictions enabled the additional identification of a quadrupole mode and, possibly, a sextupole mode. Our work highlights the potential of skyrmionic phases for the design of magnonic devices exploiting topological magnon states at GHz frequencies.</description>

      <title>Fermi-surface diagnosis for topological superconductivity with $s$-wave-like pairing symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical prediction of topological superconductivity is key to their discovery. Recently, it is proved that in 199 out of 230 space groups, topological superconductivity coexists with an $s$-wave-like pairing symmetry, raising the hope of finding more candidates for this exotic phase. However, a comprehensive and efficient method for diagnosing topological superconductivity in realistic materials remains elusive. Here, we derive Fermi-surface formulas for gapped and gapless topological phases of time-reversal symmetric superconductors with $s$-wave-like pairing symmetries in all layer and space groups, applicable to thin-film and bulk materials. Our diagnosis uses only the sign of the pairing and the Fermi velocity at several Fermi points, and yields complete (partial) diagnosis for gapped topological superconductivity in 159 (40) out of the 199 space groups. This provides a fundamental basis for the first-principles prediction of new topological superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elusive presence of an anomalously increasing screening length at high ionic concentrations hampers a complete picture of interactions in electrolytes. Theories which extend the diluted Debye-Huckel framework to higher concentrations predict, in addition to the expected decreasing Debye length, an increasing significant scale of the order of at most a few ionic diameters. More recent surface force balance experiments with different materials succeeded in measuring increasing length scales which, however, turn out to extend over tenths or even hundreds of ionic diameters. While simulation work has managed to characterize the former, the latter still avoid detection, generating doubts about its true origin. Here we provide a step forward in the clarification of such a conundrum. We have studied by extensive Molecular Dynamics simulation the properties of a generic model of electrolyte, lithium tetrafluoroborate dissolved in ethylene-carbonate, in a vast range of salt concentrations continuously joining the Debye non-interacting limit to the opposite over-charged solvent-in-salt states. On one side, we have accurately determined the macroscopic concentration-induced structural, dielectric and transport modifications, on the other we have quantified the resulting nano-scale ions organization. Based only on the simulation data, without resorting to any uncontrolled hypothesis or phenomenological parameter, we identify a convincing candidate for the measured anomalously increasing length, whose origin has been possibly misinterpreted.</description>

      <title>Measuring vacancy-type defect density in monolayer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are being widely researched for their interesting electronic properties. Their optoelectronic, mechanical and thermal properties can be finely modulated using a variety of methods, including strain, passivation, doping, and tuning of defect density. However, measuring defect densities, such as those associated with vacancy-type point defects, is inherently very difficult in atomically thin materials. Here we show that helium atom micro-diffraction can be used to measure defect density in ~15x20$\mu$m monolayer MoS$_2$, a prototypical 2D semiconductor, quickly and easily compared to standard methods. We present a simple analytic model, the lattice gas equation, that fully captures the relationship between atomic Bragg diffraction intensity and defect density. The model, combined with ab initio scattering calculations, shows that our technique can immediately be applied to a wide range of 2D materials, independent of sample chemistry or structure. Additionally, favourable signal scaling with lateral resolution makes wafer-scale characterisation immediately possible.</description>

      <title>Coulomb interactions in systems of generalized semi-Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions have strong effects in systems with flat bands. We examine the role of Coulomb interactions in two dimensional chiral anisotropic quasiparticles that disperse linearly in one direction and have relatively flat bands near the neutrality point in the other direction, dispersing with an arbitrary positive even power law $2n\geq2$. As in the conventional semi-Dirac case $(n=1$), we show using renormalization group that strong logarithmic divergences in the self-energy of generalized semi-Dirac fermions resum and lead to a restoration of linearity in the spectrum for arbitrary $n$ over a sizable energy window in the perturbative regime. We discuss those results in light of previous non-perturbative large $N_{f}$ results and address the implications for physical observables.</description>

      <title>Ab initio screening for BCS-type superconductivity in ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we applied ab initio $T_\mathrm{c}$ calculations to compounds with the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type structure to search for BCS superconductor candidates. From the 1883 compounds registered in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, we excluded those whose chemical compositions would inhibit the emergence of BCS-type superconductivity by giving rise to magnetism or heavy-fermionic behavior. We then focused on 66 compounds confirmed to be dynamically stable through phonon calculations. Among these, for the 24 systems with experimentally reported $T_\mathrm{c}$ values, we verified that the ab initio $T_\mathrm{c}$ calculations exhibit excellent predictive reliability. For the remaining 42 compounds lacking experimental $T_\mathrm{c}$ values, our predictions identified several new BCS-type superconductor candidates, including SrPb$_2$Al$_2$ $\left(T_c^\mathrm{calc}=2.2\,\mathrm{K}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Microscopic lattice model for quartic semi-Dirac fermions in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a lattice model for the realization of exotic quartic semi-Dirac fermions, i.e. quasiparticles exhibiting a dispersion with quartic momentum dependence in a given direction, and a linear dependence in the perpendicular direction. A tight binding model is employed, allowing for hopping between up to fourth nearest neighbors and anisotropic hopping parameters. In addition, we introduce short range electron-electron interactions which are necessary to stabilize the quartic semi-Dirac phase. Without interactions, or in the presence of long range correlations, the lattice is unstable towards formation of either anisotropic Dirac cones, or simple (quadratic) semi-Dirac phase.</description>
