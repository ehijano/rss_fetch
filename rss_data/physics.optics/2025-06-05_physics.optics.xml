      <title>Guided modes of helical waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies guided transverse scalar modes propagating through helically coiled waveguides. Modeling the modes as solutions of the Helmholtz equation within the three-dimensional (3D) waveguide geometry, a propagation ansatz transforms the mode-finding problem into a 3D quadratic eigenproblem. Through an untwisting map, the problem is shown to be equivalent to a 3D quadratic eigenproblem on a straightened configuration. Next, exploiting the constant torsion and curvature of the Frenet frame of a circular helix, the 3D eigenproblem is further reduced to a two-dimensional (2D) eigenproblem on the waveguide cross section. All three eigenproblems are numerically treated. As expected, significant computational savings are realized in the 2D model. A few nontrivial numerical techniques are needed to make the computation of modes within the 3D geometry feasible. They are presented along with a procedure to effectively filter out unwanted non-propagating eigenfunctions. Computational results show that the geometric effect of coiling is to shift the localization of guided modes away from the coiling center. The variations in modes as coiling pitch is changed are reported considering the example of a coiled optical fiber.</description>

      <title>Structural Vibration Monitoring with Diffractive Optical Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is vital for maintaining the safety and longevity of civil infrastructure, yet current solutions remain constrained by cost, power consumption, scalability, and the complexity of data processing. Here, we present a diffractive vibration monitoring system, integrating a jointly optimized diffractive layer with a shallow neural network-based backend to remotely extract 3D structural vibration spectra, offering a low-power, cost-effective and scalable solution. This architecture eliminates the need for dense sensor arrays or extensive data acquisition; instead, it uses a spatially-optimized passive diffractive layer that encodes 3D structural displacements into modulated light, captured by a minimal number of detectors and decoded in real-time by shallow and low-power neural networks to reconstruct the 3D displacement spectra of structures. The diffractive system's efficacy was demonstrated both numerically and experimentally using millimeter-wave illumination on a laboratory-scale building model with a programmable shake table. Our system achieves more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over conventional optics or separately trained modules, establishing a foundation for high-throughput 3D monitoring of structures. Beyond SHM, the 3D vibration monitoring capabilities of this cost-effective and data-efficient framework establish a new computational sensing modality with potential applications in disaster resilience, aerospace diagnostics, and autonomous navigation, where energy efficiency, low latency, and high-throughput are critical.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Ultrafast Lattice Modulation with Hard X-ray Free Electron Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling microscopic dynamics across spatial and temporal scales has driven major progress in science and technology over the past several decades. While ultrafast laser-based techniques have enabled probing nanoscale dynamics at their intrinsic temporal scales down to femto- and attoseconds, the long wavelengths of optical lasers have prevented the interrogation and manipulation of such dynamics with nanoscale spatial specificity. With advances in hard X-ray free electron lasers (FELs), significant progress has been made developing X-ray transient grating (XTG) spectroscopy, aiming at the coherent control of elementary excitations with nanoscale X-ray standing waves. So far, XTGs have been probed only at optical wavelengths, thus intrinsically limiting the achievable periodicities to several hundreds of nm. By achieving sub-femtosecond synchronization of two hard X-ray pulses at a controlled crossing angle, we demonstrate the generation of an XTG with spatial periods of 10 nm. The XTG excitation drives a thermal grating that drives coherent monochromatic longitudinal acoustic phonons in the cubic perovskite, SrTiO3 (STO). With a third X-ray pulse with the same photon energy, time-and-momentum resolved measurement of the XTG-induced scattering intensity modulation provides evidence of ballistic thermal transport at nanometer scale in STO. These results highlight the great potential of XTG for studying high-wave-vector excitations and nanoscale transport in condensed matter, and establish XTG as a powerful platform for the coherent control and study of nanoscale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional reconstruction of THz near-fields from a LiNbO$_3$ optical rectification source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03460v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) generation by optical rectification in LiNbO$_3$ (LN) is a widely used technique for generating intense THz radiation. The spatiotemporal characterization of THz pulses from these sources is currently limited to far-field methods. While simulations of tilted pulse front THz generation have been published, little work has been done to measure the near-field properties of the THz source. A better understanding of the THz near-field properties will improve optimization of THz generation efficiency, transport, and coupling. We demonstrate a technique for quantitative spatiotemporal characterization of single-cycle strong-field THz pulses with 2D near-field electro-optic imaging. We have reconstructed the full temporal 3D THz near-field and shown how the phase front can be tailored by controlling the incident pump pulse.</description>

      <title>Atomic and Molecular Waveform Processing with Attosecond Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing the temporal resolution in computations, signal generation and modulation, and measurements is of paramount importance for pushing the boundaries of science and technology. Optical resonators have recently demonstrated the ability to perform computational operations at frequencies beyond the gigahertz range, surpassing the speed of conventional electronic devices. However, increasing the resonator length extends the operation time but decreases the temporal resolution, with current state-of-the-art systems achieving only picosecond resolution. Here we show that atoms and molecules belong to the class of widely-used passive resonators that operate without gain, such as subwavelength particles, electric circuits, and slabs, but with long operation times and, importantly, attosecond resolution. Our analysis reveals that when resonantly exciting atoms and molecules, the resulting scattered field is the integral of the incoming field envelope, with improvement factors in temporal resolution of a million and trillion compared with optical resonators and electronic devices, respectively. We demonstrate our results theoretically for atoms and compare it with the standard slab resonator. Remarkably, our approach applies to all transition types including electronic, vibrational, rotational, and spin, with the same temporal resolution preserved across all frequencies. Our research paves the way for a new generation of devices operating on attosecond timescales and opens new avenues in fields such as computation, ultrafast phenomena, high-rate data transmission, encryption, and quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Time-Domain Excitation of Complex Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive resonators-systems that exhibit loss but no gain-are foundational elements across nearly every domain of physics and many types of of systems such as subwavelength particles, dielectric slabs, electric circuits, biological structures, and droplets. While their spectral properties are well characterized, their time-domain behavior under complex-frequency excitation remains largely unexplored, particularly near exceptional points where resonant modes coalesce. Here, we derive a closed-form time-domain response for passive resonators driven at complex resonance frequencies, uncovering a regime of real-frequency-like evolution at $t\ll1/\Gamma$ where they approximately function as active resonators. This framework unifies resonator behavior across disparate systems and accurately describes phenomena involving modal degeneracies and non-Hermitian effects. We verify this universality through analytical treatment of subwavelength particles and experimental demonstrations in passive electric circuits, showing excellent agreement with theory and enhanced power delivery efficiency. These results reveal a previously hidden structure in resonator dynamics and open new directions for time-domain control across across a variety of fields, including nanophotonics and circuit engineering.</description>

      <title>Brillouin lasers in Bragg grating microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chip-scale coherent light sources are required in applications spanning metrology and sensing to telecommunications. Brillouin lasers (BLs) offer a route to ultra-coherent optical sources in compact microresonators with free spectral range (FSR) matched to the Brillouin frequency shift (BFS). However, BFS - FSR matching typically facilitates cascaded Brillouin scattering, constraining achievable BL output power and coherence. Here, we demonstrate inhibition of cascading in a planar-integrated chalcogenide microresonator by exploiting the photonic bandgap (PBG) associated with a post-fabrication inscribed, reconfigurable intracavity Bragg grating. The PBG inhibits energy transfer within the target Brillouin scattering pathway, such as from pump to first-order Stokes wave. As a quantitative measure of Brillouin scattering inhibition, we report at least six-fold increase in threshold for onset of BL oscillation, which is ultimately limited by thermorefraction. For on-chip pump power of 399 mW, sufficient for a tenth-order Brillouin cascade, complete inhibition was achieved. Our work positions Bragg grating microresonators as an enabling platform for high performance on-chip BL sources, with reconfigurable modes of operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient coupling of light from an optical cavity to a single-mode fiber is required in a range of quantum technologies. In this work we consider the coupling of a high-finesse macroscopic Fabry-P\'erot (FP) cavity to a single-mode fiber using a metalens. We perform sensitivity analysis with respect to longitudinal and transverse misalignment errors. We then detail a fiber-coupled cavity at 1650 nm using a monolithic cryo-compatible assembly incorporating a metalens.</description>

      <title>Spatio-spectral light-by-light moulding in multimode fibre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling complex light waves to achieve desired behaviours or characteristics on demand presents a significant challenge. This task becomes even more complicated when manipulating speckled light beams owing to their inherently fuzzy intensity and phase structures. Here, we demonstrate that a weak speckled second-harmonic signal in a multimode graded-index fibre can be manipulated via its conservative interaction with a high-power co-propagating fundamental pump wave. Specifically, the spatial quality of the signal can be either enhanced or degraded by varying the pump's power or its modal power distribution. The underlying physical mechanism is the optically induced mode conversion, whose phase-matching can be controlled by the mode power distribution of the pump beam. This phenomenon enables new possibilities for manipulating complex light via material nonlinearities in multimode guiding structures. A striking example of this novel light-by-light control is the experimentally observed enhancement or partial suppression of the visible Raman Stokes cascade regulated by the second harmonic beam, while modulated by the mode power distribution of the fundamental beam.</description>

      <title>Fast Non-Line-of-Sight Transient Data Simulation and an Open Benchmark Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging reconstructs the shape and depth of hidden objects from picosecond-resolved transient signals, offering potential applications in autonomous driving, security, and medical diagnostics. However, current NLOS experiments rely on expensive hardware and complex system alignment, limiting their scalability. This manuscript presents a simplified simulation method that generates NLOS transient data by modeling light-intensity transport rather than performing conventional path tracing, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. All scene elements, including the relay surface, hidden target, stand-off distance, detector time resolution, and acquisition window are fully parameterized, allowing for rapid configuration of test scenarios. Reconstructions based on the simulated data accurately recover hidden geometries, validating the effectiveness of the approach. The proposed tool reduces the entry barrier for NLOS research and supports the optimization of system design.</description>

      <title>Electrically-induced resonance shifts of whispering gallery resonators made of barium magnesium fluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium magnesium fluoride (BMF) is a ferroelectric crystal with a transparency range far beyond the one of other optical materials. In particular, its low loss in the deep ultraviolet makes this material an unique candidate for frequency conversion in this spectral range. Due to its relatively weak second-order nonlinearity, a resonant configuration such as an optical whispering gallery would be beneficial. We show that femtosecond-laser based material processing enables the reliable fabrication of BMF whispering gallery resonators with quality factors beyond $10^7$. Their resonance frequencies can be shifted linearly by applying electric fields between the $+c$ and $-c$ faces of the crystal. The slope of the shift is $-0.8$~MHz/(V/mm). It seems that the origin of this shift is piezoelectricity, while the electro-optic effect is negligible. Our results pave the way for millimeter-sized frequency converters in the deep ultraviolet. Furthermore, they indicate that a careful determination of fundamental material properties is still necessary.</description>

      <title>Topological Jackiw-Rebbi States in Photonic Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phenomena, first studied in solid state physics, have seen increased interest for applications in nanophotonics owing to highly controllable light confinement with inherent robustness to defects. Photonic crystals can be designed to host topologically protected interface states for directional light transport, localization and robust lasing via tuning of the bulk topological invariant. At the same time, van der Waals (vdW) materials, in both their monolayer and quasi-bulk forms, are emerging as exciting additions to the field of nanophotonics, with a range of unique optoelectronic properties and intrinsic adherence to any type of host material, allowing fabrication of complex multi-layer structures. We present here a 1D topological photonic platform made from stacked nanostructured and planar layers of quasi-bulk WS$_2$ to achieve Jackiw-Rebbi (JR) interface states between two topologically distinct gratings in the near-infrared range around 750 nm. Such states are measured in the far-field with angle-resolved reflectance contrast measurements, exhibiting linewidth of 10 meV and highly directional emission with an angular bandwidth of 8.0$^\circ$. Subsequent local mapping of the structure via sub-wavelength resolution scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) reveals strong spatial confinement of the JR state to the grating interface region. Finally, we couple in the JR state the photoluminescence of monolayer WSe$_2$ incorporated in a five-layer vdW grating heterostructure, giving rise to directional enhancement of the excitonic emission of up to 22 times that of uncoupled monolayer, thus demonstrating the potential of the topological interface states for highly directional light emission in addition to light scattering.</description>

      <title>2D Topological Edge States in Periodic Space-Time Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological edge states in systems of two (or more) dimensions offer scattering-free transport, exhibiting robustness to inhomogeneities and disorder. In a different domain, time-modulated systems, such as photonic time crystals (PTCs), offer non-resonant amplification drawing energy from the modulation. Combining these concepts, we explore topological systems that vary periodically in both time and space, manifesting the best of both worlds. We present topological phases and topological edge states in photonic space-time crystals - materials in which the refractive index varies periodically in both space and time, displaying bandgaps in both frequency and momentum. The topological nature of this system leads to topological invariants that govern the phase between refracted and reflected waves generated from both the spatial and the temporal interfaces. The 2D nature of this system leads to propagating edge states, and a unique edge state that grows exponentially in power whilst following the space-time edge.</description>

      <title>Collaborative On-Sensor Array Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern nanofabrication techniques have enabled us to manipulate the wavefront of light with sub-wavelength-scale structures, offering the potential to replace bulky refractive surfaces in conventional optics with ultrathin metasurfaces. In theory, arrays of nanoposts provide unprecedented control over manipulating the wavefront in terms of phase, polarization, and amplitude at the nanometer resolution. A line of recent work successfully investigates flat computational cameras that replace compound lenses with a single metalens or an array of metasurfaces a few millimeters from the sensor. However, due to the inherent wavelength dependence of metalenses, in practice, these cameras do not match their refractive counterparts in image quality for broadband imaging, and may even suffer from hallucinations when relying on generative reconstruction methods.
  In this work, we investigate a collaborative array of metasurface elements that are jointly learned to perform broadband imaging. To this end, we learn a nanophotonics array with 100-million nanoposts that is end-to-end jointly optimized over the full visible spectrum--a design task that existing inverse design methods or learning approaches cannot support due to memory and compute limitations. We introduce a distributed meta-optics learning method to tackle this challenge. This allows us to optimize a large parameter array along with a learned meta-atom proxy and a non-generative reconstruction method that is parallax-aware and noise-aware. The proposed camera performs favorably in simulation and in all experimental tests irrespective of the scene illumination spectrum.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot, Single-Mask X-ray Dark-field and Phase Contrast Imaging</title>

Abstract: X-ray imaging, traditionally relying on attenuation contrast, struggles to differentiate materials with similar attenuation coefficients like soft tissues. X-ray phase contrast imaging (XPCI) and dark-field (DF) imaging provide enhanced contrast by detecting phase shifts and ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS). However, they typically require complex and costly setups, along with multiple exposures to retrieve various contrast features. In this study, we introduce a novel single-mask X-ray imaging system design that simultaneously captures attenuation, differential phase contrast (DPC), and dark-field images in a single exposure. Most importantly, our proposed system design requires just a single mask alignment with relatively low-resolution detectors. Using our novel light transport models derived for these specific system designs, we show intuitive understanding of contrast formation and retrieval method of different contrast features. Our approach eliminates the need for highly coherent X-ray sources, ultra-high-resolution detectors, spectral detectors or intricate gratings. We propose three variations of the single-mask setup, each optimized for different contrast types, offering flexibility and efficiency in a variety of applications. The versatility of this single-mask approach along with the use of befitting light transport models holds promise for broader use in clinical diagnostics and industrial inspection, making advanced X-ray imaging more accessible and cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Selective Addressing of Coupled Qubits via Complex Frequency Zero Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise, individual control over qubits within scalable quantum processors is critically hampered by parasitic couplings and spectral crowding, leading to detrimental crosstalk. While optimal absorption strategies based on time-reversal symmetry have shown promise for single emitters, their applicability is limited in realistic multi-qubit systems where realistic losses break time-reversal symmetry. This work introduces a robust approach using complex frequency (CF) pulses specifically tailored to the complex reflection zeros of the complete, coupled, and explicitly lossy qubit-waveguide system. This method circumvents the limitations of idealized time-reversal arguments by directly engaging with the dissipative system's true response characteristics. We first develop a theoretical framework for a system of three coupled two-level emitters, employing Heisenberg equations to derive the system's response and design appropriate CF pulses that inherently account for the system's dissipative nature. The efficacy and practicality of this approach are then validated through comprehensive transient simulations for a realistic model of three Josephson junction-based transmon qubits, explicitly including intrinsic qubit losses. Our results demonstrate that CF pulses can selectively excite a target qubit with significantly suppressed crosstalk to neighboring qubits, markedly outperforming conventional Gaussian pulses of comparable energy.</description>

      <title>Genetic Algorithm-Based Inverse Design of Guided Wave Planar Terahertz Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based inverse design framework for synthesizing high-performance planar terahertz (THz) filters integrated with coplanar striplines (CPSs). The method efficiently explores high-dimensional design spaces to generate filter geometries matching user-defined S-parameter magnitude and phase responses, while enforcing structural connectivity for compatibility with terahertz system-on-chip (TSoC) platforms. To accelerate optimization, filter performance is evaluated using the ABCD matrix method, providing a significant computational advantage over full-wave simulations. Final validation is performed through finite element method (FEM) simulations. As a proof of concept, we design band-stop filters with center frequencies of 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 THz, each with a 150 GHz target bandwidth, and demonstrate tunable rejection depths within a constant physical footprint. Optimization is guided by minimizing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between simulated and target S-parameters.</description>

      <title>Interference-enhanced light-matter interaction of an optically levitated dielectric particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing light-matter interaction is a central subject in quantum science. In this work, we investigate an interference-based approach to amplify the effect of a weak optical field on a nanoscale particle levitated in an optical tweezer. By interfering the weak signal field with the strong trapping field, we achieve a significant enhancement of the optical force caused by the weak field, compared to the force in the absence of interference. This enhanced interaction enables us to detect the weak field through monitoring the motion of the particle, with sensitivity down to 79 pW/Hz. We discuss the potential of this approach for realizing an ultrasensitive, nondestructive light field detector and for exploring optomechanical interactions at the single-photon level.</description>

      <title>Permutationally-Invariant N-body gates via Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Widely used in atomic and superconducting qubit systems, the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian is a simple, yet powerful model for a two-level system interacting with a quantum harmonic oscillator. In this paper, we focus on a system of n qubits, identically coupled to a single oscillator via JC interaction, also known as the Tavis-Cummings (TC) Hamiltonian. We show that all permutationally-invariant unitaries on an arbitrary number of qubits can be realized using this permutationally-invariant Hamiltonian, which couples the qubits to an oscillator initialized in its vacuum state, together with global uniform x and z fields on all qubits. This includes useful gates, such as controlled-Z gate with an arbitrary number of control qubits. As a corollary, we find that all permutationally invariant states -- including useful entangled states such as GHZ and Dicke states -- can be prepared using this interaction and global fields. We also characterize unitaries that can be realized on the joint Hilbert space of the qubits and oscillator with the TC interaction and global z field, and develop new methods for preparing the state of the oscillator in an arbitrary initial state. We present various examples of explicit circuits for the case of n=2 qubits. In particular, we develop new methods for implementing controlled-Z, SWAP, iSWAP, and $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$ gates using only the TC interaction and a global z field. Our work also reveals an accidental symmetry in the TC Hamiltonian and shows that it can be explained using Schwinger's oscillator model of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Novel Passive Double-Sensitivity Optical Gyroscope Based on Non-Reciprocal Polarization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel interferometric fiber optic gyroscope (IFOG) architecture, the Double-Sensitive Non-Reciprocal Polarization Phase Shifter IFOG (DS-NRPPS-IFOG), which introduces for the first time a fully passive phase biasing scheme capable of simultaneous operation at two quadrature points $\pi/2$ and $3\pi/2$. Building upon prior passive biasing techniques, this design uses a Non-Reciprocal Polarization-Dependent Phase Shifter (NRPPS) combined with a double-pass sensing coil arrangement to achieve both passive $\pi/2$ phase modulation and enhanced measurement sensitivity. The system utilizes polarization manipulation and a quarter-wave retarder to create a double-sensitive response while eliminating the need for active modulators. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements, with Angular Random Walk (ARW) values up to 50x lower than those of conventional DS-IFOG systems, depending on fiber length. Moreover, the architecture enables continuous rotation measurements and offers spontaneous noise suppression by leveraging dual quadrature detection. These findings mark a major advancement toward low-power, highly stable, and compact passive optical gyroscopes for precision navigation applications.</description>

      <title>High-pressure Induced Phase Transition and Laser Characterization Response of MAPbBr$_3$ Thin Films</title>

Abstract: The high-pressure behavior of 3D metal halide chalcogenides (MHPs) has been widely studied. In the field of high-pressure technology, the studies on 3D MHPs have focused on the structural and optical properties, where the optical properties are mainly investigated on the photoluminescence behavior, while the laser properties of the materials have not been studied yet. In this paper, MAPbBr$_3$-MAAc films with ionic liquid methylammonium acetate (MAAc) as solvent and conventional MAPbBr$_3$-DMF:DMSO films with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvents were prepared using solvent engineering method. In-situ pressurization testing of both materials using a small-cavity hydrostatic high-pressure device (DAC) was used to investigate the high-pressure optical behavior of the MAPbBr$_3$ films, especially the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties, which, combined with high-pressure in-situ Raman, revealed that the changes in the optical properties of the films under pressure are due to the changes in the crystal structure of the materials. This paper also emphasizes that the optical properties and phase structure stability of MAPbBr$_3$-MAAc films are superior to those of MAPbBr$_3$-DMF:DMSO films under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the resonant spin response of a stirred polariton condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the enhancement of the spin coherence time (T2) by almost an order-of-magnitude in exciton-polariton condensates through driven spin precession resonance. Using a rotating optical trap formed by a bichromatic laser excitation, we synchronize the trap stirring frequency with the condensate intrinsic Larmor precession, achieving an order of magnitude increase in spin coherence. By tuning the optical trap profile via excitation lasers intensity, we precisely control the resonance width. Here we present a theoretical model that explains our experimental findings in terms of the mutual synchronization of the condensate circular polarization components. Our findings underpin the potential of polariton condensates for spinoptronic devices and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Interplay between ultrafast electronic and librational dynamics in liquid nitrobenzene probed with two-color four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental and theoretical study of the interplay between ultrafast electron dynamics and librational dynamics in liquid nitrobenzene. A femtosecond ultraviolet pulse and two femtosecond near infrared pulses interact with nitrobenzene molecules, generating a four-wave mixing nonlinear signal that is measured in the Optical Kerr Effect geometry. The near infrared nonlinear signal is measured to be non-zero only at negative time delays, corresponding to the near infrared pulses arriving earlier than the ultraviolet pulse. We perform time-dependent Quantum Master Equation calculations, which include a classical libration model, to simulate the experiment. The simulations support the conclusion that the near infrared pulses launch librational motion, while simultaneously creating electronic coherences that result in a libration-modulated electronic nonlinear response. Furthermore, we conclude that the measured nonlinear optical signal corresponds to a non-parametric process that leaves the molecules in an excited electronic state. This work provides new insight into ultrafast nonlinear optical interactions in liquids and is an important step towards probing ultrafast electronic coherences in large molecules in the liquid phase.</description>

Abstract: We present a seeded topology optimization methodology for integrated photonic devices fabricated on foundry platforms that yields improved performance compared to traditional topology optimization. We employ blurring filters and a DRC correction algorithm to more readily meet design rule checks, resulting in devices with fewer artifacts and improved correlation between simulation and measurements. We apply this process to an ultra-compact TE modal multiplexer, a TE mode converter, a polarization rotator, and a high-contrast grating reflector. The measured insertion loss of the TE mode converter was reduced from 1.37 dB to 0.64 dB through this optimization strategy. This approach enables a two-step inverse design process, merging of physics-informed design strategies with inverse design, and ensures strict compliance with foundry constraints throughout optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave scattering plays a central role for the modeling of complex wave propagation across all corners of science and engineering applications, including electromagnetic, acoustics, seismic and scattering physics. Wave control using time interfaces, where the properties of the medium through with the wave travels rapidly change in time, has opened further opportunities to control wave propagation in both space and time. For acoustic waves, studies on time modulated media have not been reported. In this context, full numerical solution of the wave equation using time interfaces is key to fully understand their potential. When applying time interfaces, the underlying physics of acoustic wave propagation and scattering and their similar roles on time and space, are still being explored. In this work, we introduce a mathematical formulation of the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equations for acoustic wave scattering when time interfaces are induced via a change of the velocity of the medium. We demonstrate that space-time duality for acoustic wave propagation with time interfaces and derive the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equations for wave scattering in time-dependent media, multiple scattering theory, Kirchhoff Helmholtz integrals, Green's functions, reciprocity theorems. We experimentally verify our theoretical derivation by studying and measuring the acoustic wave scattering in strongly scattering media. We illustrate the proposed framework and present results of acoustic wave scattering without prior knowledge of the background wave-fields. This improves the understanding of the generation and wave scattering and opens previously inaccessible research directions, potentially facilitating practical applications for acoustic, geophysical and optical imaging.</description>

Abstract: Achieving quantum-limited motional control of optically trapped particles beyond the sub-micrometer scale is an outstanding problem in levitated optomechanics. A key obstacle is solving the light scattering problem and identifying particle geometries that allow stable trapping and efficient motional detection of their center of mass and rotational motion in three dimensions. Here, we present a computational framework that combines an efficient electromagnetic scattering solver with the adjoint method to inversely design printable microparticles tailored for levitated optomechanics. Our method allows identifying optimized geometries, characterized by enhanced optical trapping and detection efficiencies compared to conventional microspheres. This improves the feasibility of quantum-limited motional control of all translational and rotational degrees of freedom in a standard standing-wave optical trap.</description>

      <title>Abelian Spectral Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of non-Hermitian physics has enriched the plethora of topological phases to include phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. Despite being among the most well-studied uniquely non-Hermitian features, the topological properties of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s) at which also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce, were only recently revealed in terms of topological resultant winding numbers and concomitant Abelian doubling theorems. Nevertheless, a more mathematically fundamental description of EP$n$s and their topological nature has remained an open question. To fill this void, in this article, we revisit the topological classification of EP$n$s in generic systems and systems with local symmetries, generalize it in terms of more mathematically tractable (local) similarity relations, and extend it to include all such similarities as well as non-local symmetries. Through the resultant vector, whose components are given in terms of the resultants between the corresponding characteristic polynomial and its derivatives, the topological nature of the resultant winding number is understood in several ways: in terms of i) the tenfold classification of (Hermitian) topological matter, ii) the framework of Mayer--Vietoris sequence, and iii) the classification of vector bundles. The classification scheme further predicts the existence of topological bulk Fermi arcs protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant, induced by non-local symmetries, dubbed $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Fermi arcs. Our work reveals the mathematical foundations on which the topological nature of EP$n$s resides, enriches the theoretical understanding of non-Hermitian spectral features, and will therefore find great use in modern experiments within both classical and quantum physics.</description>
