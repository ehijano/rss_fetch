      <title>Enantioselective radical reactions can be induced by electron spin polarization: A quantum mechanism for Nature's emergent homochirality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecules that constitute life on Earth are chiral, but the precise mechanism by which homochirality emerged remains a mystery. In this work it is demonstrated that reactions of radical pairs, where one of the radical electron spins is polarised, can be enantioselective. This phenomenon arises from transient coherent quantum dynamics of the radical pair electron spins, which is known to occur even in warm and noisy condensed phase environments, where energetic perturbations much smaller than thermal energy can have large effects on reactivity. A quantitative theory is presented based on the molecular theory of chirality induced spin selectivity (CISS), where electron exchange interactions and chirality-dependent spin-orbit coupling effects control enantioselectivity. This theory provides useful bounds on the maximum enantiomeric excess for these reactions, which are found to be consistent with previous experiments. The enantioseletive radical pair mechanism presented here provides an alternative mechanistic basis to a recent proposal that spin-polarised photoelectrons from magnetite provided the initial chiral symmetry breaking necessary for the inception of homochirality in Nature, as well as suggests a new strategy for asymmetric synthesis using spin-polarised electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA function is deeply intertwined with its conformational dynamics. In this review, we survey recent advances in the use of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to characterize RNA dynamics in diverse contexts, including isolated molecules and complexes with ions, small molecules, or proteins. We highlight how enhanced sampling techniques and integrative approaches can improve both the precision and accuracy of the resulting structural ensembles. Finally, we examine the emerging role of artificial intelligence in accelerating progress in RNA modeling and simulation.</description>

      <title>Parametrized Quantum Circuit Learning for Quantum Chemical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of quantum machine learning (QML), parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) -- constructed using a combination of fixed and tunable quantum gates -- provide a promising hybrid framework for tackling complex machine learning problems. Despite numerous proposed applications, there remains limited exploration of datasets relevant to quantum chemistry. In this study, we investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach. We construct a comprehensive set of 168 PQCs by combining 14 data encoding strategies with 12 variational ans{\"a}tze, and evaluate their performance on circuits with 5 and 16 qubits. Our initial analysis examines the impact of circuit structure on model performance using state-vector simulations. We then explore how circuit depth and training set size influence model performance. Finally, we assess the performance of the best-performing PQCs on current quantum hardware, using both noisy simulations ("fake" backends) and real quantum devices. Our findings underscore the challenges of applying PQCs to chemically relevant problems that are straightforward for classical machine learning methods but remain non-trivial for quantum approaches.</description>

      <title>Extending Nonlocal Kinetic Energy Density Functionals to Isolated Systems via a Density-Functional-Dependent Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wang-Teter-like nonlocal kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) in the framework of orbital-free density functional theory, while successful in some bulk systems, exhibits a critical Blanc-Cances instability [J. Chem. Phys. 122, 214106 (2005)] when applied to isolated systems, where the total energy becomes unbounded from below. We trace this instability to the use of an ill-defined average charge density, which causes the functional to simultaneously violate the scaling law and the positivity of the Pauli energy. By rigorously constructing a density-functional-dependent kernel, we resolve these pathologies while preserving the formal exactness of the original framework. By systematically benchmarking single-atom systems of 56 elements, we find the resulting KEDF retains computational efficiency while achieving an order-of-magnitude accuracy enhancement over the WT KEDF. In addition, the new KEDF preserves WT's superior accuracy in bulk metals, outperforming the semilocal functionals in both regimes.</description>

      <title>Coarse Graining Photo-Isomerization Reactions: Thermodynamic Consistency and Implications for Molecular Ratchets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate thermodynamically consistent coarse-graining procedures for molecular systems undergoing thermally and photo-induced transitions: starting from elementary vibronic transitions, we derive effective photo-isomerization reactions interconverting ground-state species. Crucially, the local detailed balance condition, that constrains reaction kinetics to thermodynamics, remains satisfied throughout the coarse-graining procedures. It applies to the effective photo-isomerization reactions just as it does to the elementary vibronic transitions. We then demonstrate that autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets operate via the same fundamental mechanism as chemically driven ones. Because the local detailed balance remains satisfied, autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets, like chemically driven ones, operate exclusively through an information ratchet mechanism. This reveals new key principles for their design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Local persistence exponent and its log-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the local persistence exponent of the survival probability of a particle diffusing near an absorbing self-similar boundary. We show by extensive Monte Carlo simulations that the local persistence exponent exhibits log-periodic oscillations over a broad range of timescales. We determine the period and mean value of these oscillations in a family of Koch snowflakes of different fractal dimensions. The effect of the starting point and its local environment on this behavior is analyzed in depth by a simple yet intuitive model. This analysis uncovers how spatial self-similarity of the boundary affects the diffusive dynamics and its temporal characteristics in complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this educational paper, we will discuss calculations on the hydrogen molecule both on classical and quantum computers. In the former case, we will discuss the calculation of molecular integrals that can then be used to calculate potential energy curves at the Hartree--Fock level and to correct them by obtaining the exact results for all states in the minimal basis. Some aspects of spin-symmetry will also be discussed. In the case of quantum computing, we will start out from the second-quantized Hamiltonian and qubit mappings. Using quantum phase estimation, we then provide the circuits for two different algorithms: Trotteization and qubitization. Finally, the significance of quantum error correction will be briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Convergence and Properties of Intrinsic Bond Orbitals in Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18212v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the construction and spatial properties of localized Wannier orbitals in large supercells of insulating solids using plane waves as the underlying basis. The Pipek-Mezey (PM) functional in combination with intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs) as projectors is employed, resulting in so-called intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs). Independent of the bonding type and band gap, a correlation between orbital spreads and geometric properties is observed. As a result, comparable sparsity patterns of the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix are found across all considered bulk 3D materials, exhibiting covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, and ionic bonds. Recognizing the considerable computational effort required to construct localized Wannier orbitals for large periodic simulation cells, we address the performance and scaling of different solvers for the localization problem. This includes the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), Conjugate-Gradient (CG), Steepest Ascent (SA) as well as the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) method. Each algorithm performs a Riemannian optimization under unitary matrix constraint, efficiently reaching the optimum in the "curved parameter space" on geodesics. We hereby complement the quantum chemistry and materials science literature with an introduction to this topic along with key references. The solvers have been implemented both within the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) and as a standalone open-source software package. Furthermore, we observe that the construction of Wannier orbitals for supercells of metal oxides presents a significant challenge, requiring approximately one order of magnitude more iteration steps than other systems studied.</description>

      <title>Towards a multi-dimensional picture of nucleation: The example of liquid condensation through theory and rare event sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While very popular for its ability to provide an elegant conceptual framework, classical nucleation theory (CNT) often fails at quantitatively reproducing most of the experimental and numerical observations of first order transitions. In this paper, we extend CNT by explicitly incorporating the multi-dimensional aspect of nucleation. Focusing on the liquid condensation of a Lennard-Jones gas, we used state of the art rare event sampling simulations to precisely characterize the nucleation event emphasizing the specific features of the critical cluster. Our numerical results indicate a simultaneous growth and densification in liquid condensation. We then exploit these insights to develop a 2-variable nucleation theory. Our model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties. Furthermore, our model provides a qualitatively more accurate representation of nucleation near the spinodal regime. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework highlights the limitations of CNT and more recent theories while offering a robust foundation for its refinement.</description>

      <title>Computing Hydrogen Tunneling Splittings with Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Multireference Configuration Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen tunneling is an important process that impacts reaction rates and molecular spectra. Describing and understanding this process requires a quantum mechanical treatment of the transferring hydrogen. The nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) approach treats specified nuclei quantum mechanically on the same level as electrons and has recently been implemented at the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) wavefunction level. The NEO-MRCI method includes both the static correlation necessary to describe hydrogen tunneling and the electron-proton dynamic correlation required for computing quantitatively accurate nuclear-electronic vibronic states. Herein, the NEO-MRCI method is used to compute the nuclear-electronic wavefunctions and corresponding vibronic energies for four hydrogen tunneling systems at fixed geometries for a range of donor-acceptor distances. Comparison of the NEO-MRCI results to numerically exact grid-based calculations shows that the NEO-MRCI method can be used to obtain accurate hydrogen and deuterium tunneling splittings at fixed geometries. Thus, this work presents an important component for studying hydrogen tunneling systems.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetry rules of response properties in certain chemical spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic boron nitride-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. The rules predict the electric response properties more accurately than the magnetizabilities. The electric response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power.</description>
