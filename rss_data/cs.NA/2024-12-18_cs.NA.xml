      <title>On the stability of IMEX BDF methods for DDEs and PDDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the stability of IMEX-BDF methods for delay differential equations (DDEs) is studied based on the test equation $y'(t)=-A y(t) + B y(t-\tau)$, where $\tau$ is a constant delay, $A$ is a positive definite matrix, but $B$ might be any matrix. First, it is analyzed the case where both matrices diagonalize simultaneously, but the paper focus in the case where the matrices $A$ and $B$ are not simultaneosly diagonalizable. The concept of field of values is used to prove a sufficient condition for unconditional stability of these methods and another condition which also guarantees their stability, but according to the step size.
  Several numerical examples in which the theory discussed here is applied to DDEs, but also parabolic problems given by partial delay differential equations with a diffusion term and a delayed term are presented.</description>

      <title>Numerical Solution Partial Differential Equations using the Discrete Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explain how to use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). We start by defining appropriate discrete domains in coordinate and frequency domains. Then describe the main limitation of the method arising from the Sampling Theorem, which defines the critical Nyquist frequency and the aliasing effect. We then define the Fourier Transform (FT) and the FFT in a way that can be implemented in one and more dimensions. Finally, we show how to apply the FFT in the solution of PDEs related to problems involving two spatial dimensions, specifically the Poisson equation, the diffusion equation and the wave equation for elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic cases respectively.</description>

      <title>Median Filters for Anisotropic Wetting / Dewetting Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new level set methods for multiphase, anisotropic (weighted) motion by mean curvature of networks, focusing on wetting-dewetting problems where one out of three phases is stationary -- a good testbed for checking whether complicated junction conditions are correctly enforced. The new schemes are vectorial median filters: The level set values at the next time step are determined by a sorting procedure performed on the most recent level set values. Detailed numerical convergence studies are presented, showing that the correct angle conditions at triple junctions (which include torque terms due to anisotropy) are indeed indirectly and automatically attained. Other standard benefits of level set methods, such as subgrid accuracy on uniform grids via interpolation and seamless treatment of topological changes, remain intact.</description>

      <title>An accurate SUPG-stabilized continuous Galerkin discretization for anisotropic heat flux in magnetic confinement fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel spatial discretization for the anisotropic heat conduction equation, aimed at improved accuracy at the high levels of anisotropy seen in a magnetized plasma, for example, for magnetic confinement fusion. The new discretization is based on a mixed formulation, introducing a form of the directional derivative along the magnetic field as an auxiliary variable and discretizing both the temperature and auxiliary fields in a continuous Galerkin (CG) space. Both the temperature and auxiliary variable equations are stabilized using the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method, ensuring a better representation of the directional derivatives and therefore an overall more accurate solution. This approach can be seen as the CG-based version of our previous work (Wimmer, Southworth, Gregory, Tang, 2024), where we considered a mixed discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spatial discretization including DG-upwind stabilization. We prove consistency of the novel discretization, and demonstrate its improved accuracy over existing CG-based methods in test cases relevant to magnetic confinement fusion. This includes a long-run tokamak equilibrium sustainment scenario, demonstrating a 35% and 32% spurious heat loss for existing primal and mixed CG-based formulations versus 4% for our novel SUPG-stabilized discretization.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of efficient multigrid solvers for high-order local discontinuous Galerkin methods: Poisson, elliptic interface, and multiphase Stokes problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design and investigate a variety of multigrid solvers for high-order local discontinuous Galerkin methods applied to elliptic interface and multiphase Stokes problems. Using the template of a standard multigrid V-cycle, we consider a variety of element-wise block smoothers, including Jacobi, multi-coloured Gauss-Seidel, processor-block Gauss-Seidel, and with special interest, smoothers based on sparse approximate inverse (SAI) methods. In particular, we develop SAI methods that: (i) balance the smoothing of velocity and pressure variables in Stokes problems; and (ii) robustly handles high-contrast viscosity coefficients in multiphase problems. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional test cases, including Poisson, elliptic interface, steady-state Stokes, and unsteady Stokes problems, we examine a multitude of multigrid smoother and solver combinations. In every case, there is at least one approach that matches the performance of classical geometric multigrid algorithms, e.g., 4 to 8 iterations to reduce the residual by 10 orders of magnitude. We also discuss their relative merits with regard to simplicity, robustness, computational cost, and parallelisation.</description>

      <title>Improving Numerical Error Bounds Near Sharp Interface Limit for Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of geometric surface evolutions, stochastic reaction-diffusion equation provides a powerful tool for capturing and simulating complex dynamics. A critical challenge in this area is developing numerical approximations that exhibit error bounds with polynomial dependence on $\vv^{-1}$, where the small parameter $\vv&gt;0$ represents the diffuse interface thickness. The existence of such bounds for fully discrete approximations of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations remains unclear in the literature. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging the asymptotic log-Harnack inequality to overcome the exponential growth of $\vv^{-1}$. Furthermore, we establish the numerical weak error bounds under the truncated Wasserstein distance for the spectral Galerkin method and a fully discrete tamed Euler scheme, with explicit polynomial dependence on $\vv^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>SOR-like iteration and FPI are consistent when they are equipped with certain optimal iterative parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two common methods for solving absolute value equations (AVE) are SOR-like iteration method and fixed point iteration (FPI) method. In this paper, novel convergence analysis, which result wider convergence range, of the SOR-like iteration and the FPI are given. Based on the new analysis, a new optimal iterative parameter with a analytical form is obtained for the SOR-like iteration. In addition, an optimal iterative parameter with a analytical form is also obtained for FPI. Surprisingly, the SOR-like iteration and the FPI are the same whenever they are equipped with our optimal iterative parameters. As a by product, we give two new constructive proof for a well known sufficient condition such that AVE has a unique solution for any right hand side. Numerical results demonstrate our claims.</description>

      <title>A 3D-1D Virtual Element Method for Modeling Root Water Uptake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimization-based strategy is proposed for coupling three-dimensional and one-dimensional problems (3D-1D coupling) in the context of soil-root interaction simulations. This strategy, originally designed to tackle generic 3D-1D coupled problems with discontinuous solutions, is here extended to the case of non-linear problems and applied, for the first time, along with a virtual element discretization of the 3D soil sample. This further enhances the capability of the method to handle geometrical complexities, allowing to easily mesh domains characterized, for instance, by the presence of stones and other impervious obstacles of arbitrary shape. A discrete-hybrid tip-tracking strategy is adopted to model both the root growth and the evolution in time of the water flux, the pressure head and the water content, both in the roots and in the surrounding soil sample. By choosing proper rules for the generation of branches, realistic root-network configurations are obtained. Several numerical examples are proposed, proving both the accuracy of the adopted method and its applicability in realistic and large scale simulations.</description>

Abstract: We propose a practical tool for evaluating and comparing the accuracy of FDMs for the Helmholtz equation. The tool based on Fourier analysis makes it easy to find wavenumber explicit order of convergence, and can be used for rigorous proof. It fills in the gap between the dispersion analysis and the actual error with source term.</description>

      <title>An Entropy Stable High-Order Discontinuous Galerkin Method on Cut Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order entropy stable summation-by-parts (SBP) schemes are a class of robust and accurate numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation laws that are numerically stable at arbitrary order without the need for artificial stabilization. While SBP schemes are well-established on simplicial and tensor-product elements, they have not been extended to cut meshes. Cut meshes provide a convenient and efficient means of mesh generation for domains with embedded boundaries but can be difficult to use due to their arbitrarily shaped cut elements. Using the skew-hybridized SBP formulation of Chan ["Skew-symmetric entropy stable...", JSC, 2019], we present a high-order accurate, entropy stable scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws on cut meshes. The formulation requires positive/non-negative weight quadrature rules on cut elements, which we construct via explicit parameterizations, subtriangulations, and Caratheodory pruning. We numerically verify the accuracy and stability of our method using the shallow water and compressible Euler equations and note promising results for the use of state redistribution with entropy stable methods.</description>

      <title>A numerical algorithm for computing the zeros of parabolic cylinder functions in the complex plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical algorithm (implemented in Matlab) for computing the zeros of the parabolic cylinder function $U(a,z)$ in domains of the complex plane is presented. The algorithm uses accurate approximations to the first zero plus a highly efficient method based on a fourth-order fixed point method with the parabolic cylinder functions computed by Taylor series and carefully selected steps, to compute the rest of the zeros. For $|a|$ small, the asymptotic approximations are complemented with a few fixed point iterations requiring the evaluation of $U(a,z)$ and $U'(a,z)$ in the region where the complex zeros are located. Liouville-Green expansions are derived to enhance the performance of a computational scheme to evaluate $U(a,z)$ and $U'(a,z)$ in that region. Several tests show the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical algorithm.</description>

      <title>A finite volume scheme for the local sensing chemotaxis model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we design, analyze and simulate a finite volume scheme for a cross-diffusion system which models chemotaxis with local sensing. This system has the same gradient flow structure as the celebrated minimal Keller-Segel system, but unlike the latter, its solutions are known to exist globally in 2D. The long-time behavior of solutions is only partially understood which motivates numerical exploration with a reliable numerical method. We propose a linearly implicit, two-point flux finite volume approximation of the system. We show that the scheme preserves, at the discrete level, the main features of the continuous system, namely mass, non-negativity of solution, entropy, and duality estimates. These properties allow us to prove the well-posedness, unconditional stability and convergence of the scheme. We also show rigorously that the scheme possesses an asymptotic preserving (AP) property in the quasi-stationary limit. We complement our analysis with thorough numerical experiments investigating convergence and AP properties of the scheme as well as its reliability with respect to stability properties of steady solutions.</description>

      <title>Fully stochastic trust-region methods with Barzilai-Borwein steplengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate stochastic gradient methods and stochastic counterparts of the Barzilai-Borwein steplengths and their application to finite-sum minimization problems. Our proposal is based on the Trust-Region-ish (TRish) framework introduced in [F. E. Curtis, K. Scheinberg, R. Shi, A stochastic trust region algorithm based on careful step normalization, Informs Journal on Optimization, 1, 2019]. The new framework, named TRishBB, aims at enhancing the performance of TRish and at reducing the computational cost of the second-order TRish variant. We propose three different methods belonging to the TRishBB framework and present the convergence analysis for possibly nonconvex objective functions, considering biased and unbiased gradient approximations. Our analysis requires neither diminishing step-sizes nor full gradient evaluation. The numerical experiments in machine learning applications demonstrate the effectiveness of applying the Barzilai-Borwein steplength with stochastic gradients and show improved testing accuracy compared to the TRish method.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical splines-based $h$-adaptive isogeometric solver for all-electron Kohn--Sham equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel $h$-adaptive isogeometric solver utilizing high-order hierarchical splines is proposed to solve the all-electron Kohn--Sham equation. In virtue of the smooth nature of Kohn--Sham wavefunctions across the domain, except at the nuclear positions, high-order globally regular basis functions such as B-splines are well suited for achieving high accuracy. To further handle the singularities in the external potential at the nuclear positions, an $h$-adaptive framework based on the hierarchical splines is presented with a specially designed residual-type error indicator, allowing for different resolutions on the domain. The generalized eigenvalue problem raising from the discretized Kohn--Sham equation is effectively solved by the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method with an elliptic preconditioner, and it is found that the eigensolver's convergence is independent of the spline basis order. A series of numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the $h$-adaptive framework, with a notable experiment that the numerical accuracy $10^{-3} \mathrm{~Hartree/particle}$ in the all-electron simulation of a methane molecule is achieved using only $6355$ degrees of freedom, demonstrating the competitiveness of our solver for the all-electron Kohn--Sham equation.</description>

      <title>Certified Model Predictive Control for Switched Evolution Equations using Model Order Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model predictive control (MPC) framework for linear switched evolution equations arising from a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE). First-order optimality conditions for the resulting finite-horizon optimal control problems are derived. The analysis allows for the incorporation of convex control constraints and sparse regularization. Then, to mitigate the computational burden of the MPC procedure, we employ Galerkin reduced-order modeling (ROM) techniques to obtain a low-dimensional surrogate for the state-adjoint systems. We derive recursive a-posteriori estimates for the ROM feedback law and the ROM-MPC closed-loop state and show that the ROM-MPC trajectory evolves within a neighborhood of the true MPC trajectory, whose size can be explicitly computed and is controlled by the quality of the ROM. Such estimates are then used to formulate two ROM-MPC algorithms with closed-loop certification.</description>

      <title>Exact simulation of the first-passage time of SDEs to time-dependent thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first-passage time (FPT) is a fundamental concept in stochastic processes, representing the time it takes for a process to reach a specified threshold for the first time. Often, considering a time-dependent threshold is essential for accurately modeling stochastic processes, as it provides a more accurate and adaptable framework. In this paper, we extend an existing Exact simulation method developed for constant thresholds to handle time-dependent thresholds. Our proposed approach utilizes the FPT of Brownian motion and accepts it for the FPT of a given process with some probability, which is determined using Girsanov's transformation. This method eliminates the need to simulate entire paths over specific time intervals, avoids time-discretization errors, and directly simulates the first-passage time. We present results demonstrating the method's effectiveness, including the extension to time-dependent thresholds, an analysis of its time complexity, comparisons with existing methods through numerical examples, and its application to predicting spike times in a neuron.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript studies the numerical solution of the time-fractional Burgers-Huxley equation in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The analytical solution of the equation is obtained in terms of a convergent series with easily computable components. It is observed that the approximate solution uniformly converges to the exact solution for the aforementioned equation. Also, the convergence of the proposed method is investigated. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the presented method. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method is powerful and effective with a small computational overhead.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for multiscale spectral generalized FEMs and low-rank approximations to multiscale PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an abstract framework for the design, implementation, and analysis of the multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM), a particular numerical multiscale method originally proposed in [I. Babuska and R. Lipton, Multiscale Model.\;\,Simul., 9 (2011), pp.~373--406]. MS-GFEM is a partition of unity method employing optimal local approximation spaces constructed from local spectral problems. We establish a general local approximation theory demonstrating exponential convergence with respect to local degrees of freedom under certain assumptions, with explicit dependence on key problem parameters. Our framework applies to a broad class of multiscale PDEs with $L^{\infty}$-coefficients in both continuous and discrete, finite element settings, including highly indefinite problems (convection-dominated diffusion, as well as the high-frequency Helmholtz, Maxwell and elastic wave equations with impedance boundary conditions), and higher-order problems. Notably, we prove a local convergence rate of $O(e^{-cn^{1/d}})$ for MS-GFEM for all these problems, improving upon the $O(e^{-cn^{1/(d+1)}})$ rate shown by Babuska and Lipton.
  Moreover, based on the abstract local approximation theory for MS-GFEM, we establish a unified framework for showing low-rank approximations to multiscale PDEs. This framework applies to the aforementioned problems, proving that the associated Green's functions admit an $O(|\log\epsilon|^{d})$-term separable approximation on well-separated domains with error $\epsilon&gt;0$. Our analysis improves and generalizes the result in [M. Bebendorf and W. Hackbusch, Numerische Mathematik, 95 (2003), pp.~1-28] where an $O(|\log\epsilon|^{d+1})$-term separable approximation was proved for Poisson-type problems.</description>

      <title>An adaptive hierarchical ensemble Kalman filter with reduced basis models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of model order reduction techniques in combination with ensemble-based methods for estimating the state of systems described by nonlinear partial differential equations has been of great interest in recent years in the data assimilation community. Methods such as the multi-fidelity ensemble Kalman filter (MF-EnKF) and the multi-level ensemble Kalman filter (ML-EnKF) are recognized as state-of-the-art techniques. However, in many cases, the construction of low-fidelity models in an offline stage, before solving the data assimilation problem, prevents them from being both accurate and computationally efficient. In our work, we investigate the use of adaptive reduced basis techniques in which the approximation space is modified online based on the information that is extracted from a limited number of full order solutions and that is carried by the past models. This allows to simultaneously ensure good accuracy and low cost for the employed models and thus improve the performance of the multi-fidelity and multi-level methods.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties relative to continuous scale space for hybrid discretizations of Gaussian derivative operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05095v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of properties of two hybrid discretization methods for Gaussian derivatives, based on convolutions with either the normalized sampled Gaussian kernel or the integrated Gaussian kernel followed by central differences. The motivation for studying these discretization methods is that in situations when multiple spatial derivatives of different order are needed at the same scale level, they can be computed significantly more efficiently compared to more direct derivative approximations based on explicit convolutions with either sampled Gaussian kernels or integrated Gaussian kernels.
  While these computational benefits do also hold for the genuinely discrete approach for computing discrete analogues of Gaussian derivatives, based on convolution with the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel followed by central differences, the underlying mathematical primitives for the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, in terms of modified Bessel functions of integer order, may not be available in certain frameworks for image processing, such as when performing deep learning based on scale-parameterized filters in terms of Gaussian derivatives, with learning of the scale levels.
  In this paper, we present a characterization of the properties of these hybrid discretization methods, in terms of quantitative performance measures concerning the amount of spatial smoothing that they imply, as well as the relative consistency of scale estimates obtained from scale-invariant feature detectors with automatic scale selection, with an emphasis on the behaviour for very small values of the scale parameter, which may differ significantly from corresponding results obtained from the fully continuous scale-space theory, as well as between different types of discretization methods.</description>

      <title>Full error analysis of the random deep splitting method for nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a randomized extension of the deep splitting algorithm introduced in [Beck, Becker, Cheridito, Jentzen, and Neufeld (2021)] using random neural networks suitable to approximately solve both high-dimensional nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs with jumps having (possibly) infinite activity. We provide a full error analysis of our so-called random deep splitting method. In particular, we prove that our random deep splitting method converges to the (unique viscosity) solution of the nonlinear PDE or PIDE under consideration. Moreover, we empirically analyze our random deep splitting method by considering several numerical examples including both nonlinear PDEs and nonlinear PIDEs relevant in the context of pricing of financial derivatives under default risk. In particular, we empirically demonstrate in all examples that our random deep splitting method can approximately solve nonlinear PDEs and PIDEs in 10'000 dimensions within seconds.</description>

      <title>Shear-flexible geometrically exact beam element based on finite differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proposed two-dimensional geometrically exact beam element extends our previous work by including the effects of shear distortion, and also of distributed forces and moments acting along the beam. The general flexibility-based formulation exploits the kinematic equations combined with the inverted sectional equations and the integrated form of equilibrium equations. The resulting set of three first-order differential equations is discretized by finite differences and the boundary value problem is converted into an initial value problem using the shooting method. Due to the special structure of the governing equations, the scheme remains explicit even though the first derivatives are approximated by central differences, leading to high accuracy. The main advantage of the adopted approach is that the error can be efficiently reduced by refining the computational grid used for finite differences at the element level while keeping the number of global degrees of freedom low. The efficiency is also increased by dealing directly with the global centerline coordinates and sectional inclination with respect to global axes as the primary unknowns at the element level, thereby avoiding transformations between local and global coordinates. Two formulations of the sectional equations, referred to as the Reissner and Ziegler models, are presented and compared. In particular, stability of an axially loaded beam/column is investigated and the connections to the Haringx and Engesser stability theories are discussed. Both approaches are tested in a series of numerical examples, which illustrate (i) high accuracy with quadratic convergence when the spatial discretization is refined, (ii) easy modeling of variable stiffness along the element (such as rigid joint offsets), (iii) efficient and accurate characterization of the buckling and post-buckling behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When dealing with a large number of points was required, the traditional uniform sampling approach for approximating integrals using the Monte Carlo method becomes inefficient. In this work, we leverage the good lattice point sets from number-theoretic methods for sampling purposes and develop a deep learning framework that integrates the good lattice point sets with Physics-Informed Neural Networks. This framework is designed to address low-regularity and high-dimensional problems. Furthermore, rigorous mathematical proofs are provided for our algorithm, demonstrating its validity. Lastly, in the experimental section, we employ numerical experiments involving the Poisson equation with low regularity, the two-dimensional inverse Helmholtz equation, and high-dimensional linear and nonlinear problems to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm from a numerical perspective.</description>

      <title>A robust time-split linearized explicit/implicit technique for two-dimensional hydrodynamic model: an application to floods in Cameroon far north region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with a time-split explicit/implicit approach for solving a two-dimensional hydrodynamic flow model with appropriate initial and boundary conditions. The time-split technique is employed to upwind the convection term and to treat the friction slope so that the numerical oscillations and stability are well controlled. A suitable time step restriction for stability and convergence accurate of the new algorithm is established using the $L^{\infty}(0,T; L^{2})$-norm. Under a time step requirement, some numerical examples confirm the theoretical studies and suggest that the proposed computational technique is spatial fourth-order accurate and temporal second-order convergent. An application to floods observed in Cameroon far north region is considered and discussed.</description>

      <title>Sparse Signature Coefficient Recovery via Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Central to rough path theory is the signature transform of a path, an infinite series of tensors given by the iterated integrals of the underlying path. The signature poses an effective way to capture sequentially ordered information, thanks both to its rich analytic and algebraic properties as well as its universality when used as a basis to approximate functions on path space. Whilst a truncated version of the signature can be efficiently computed using Chen's identity, there is a lack of efficient methods for computing a sparse collection of iterated integrals contained in high levels of the signature. We address this problem by leveraging signature kernels, defined as the inner product of two signatures, and computable efficiently by means of PDE-based methods. By forming a filter in signature space with which to take kernels, one can effectively isolate specific groups of signature coefficients and, in particular, a singular coefficient at any depth of the transform. We show that such a filter can be expressed as a linear combination of suitable signature transforms and demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of our approach. To conclude, we give an example use case for sparse collections of signature coefficients based on the construction of N-step Euler schemes for sparse CDEs.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse scattering problem for Maxwell's equations. We first show that a bianisotropic scatterer can be uniquely determined from multi-static far-field data through the factorization analysis of the far-field operator. Next, we investigate a modified version of the orthogonality sampling method for the numerical reconstruction of the scatterer. Finally, we apply this sampling method to invert unprocessed 3D experimental data obtained from the Fresnel Institute. Numerical examples with synthetic scattering data for bianisotropic targets are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Approximation Power of Deep Neural Networks: an explanatory mathematical survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey provides an in-depth and explanatory review of the approximation properties of deep neural networks, with a focus on feed-forward and residual architectures. The primary objective is to examine how effectively neural networks approximate target functions and to identify conditions under which they outperform traditional approximation methods. Key topics include the nonlinear, compositional structure of deep networks and the formalization of neural network tasks as optimization problems in regression and classification settings. The survey also addresses the training process, emphasizing the role of stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation in solving these optimization problems, and highlights practical considerations such as activation functions, overfitting, and regularization techniques. Additionally, the survey explores the density of neural networks in the space of continuous functions, comparing the approximation capabilities of deep ReLU networks with those of other approximation methods. It discusses recent theoretical advancements in understanding the expressiveness and limitations of these networks. A detailed error-complexity analysis is also presented, focusing on error rates and computational complexity for neural networks with ReLU and Fourier-type activation functions in the context of bounded target functions with minimal regularity assumptions. Alongside recent known results, the survey introduces new findings, offering a valuable resource for understanding the theoretical foundations of neural network approximation. Concluding remarks and further reading suggestions are provided.</description>
