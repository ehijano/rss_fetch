      <title>NO LESS: Novel Opportunities for Light Exotic Searches at the SPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A powerful way to test models with feebly interacting particles in the MeV to GeV mass range is through proton beam-dump experiments. In this paper, we compare the current sensitivity of CERN's NA62 experiment running in beam-dump mode with that of a hypothetical experiment using the same detectors in a future CERN ECN3 beam-dump facility. When optimising such an experiment, the geometric setup is particularly relevant for the specific new-physics scenario under study, since different production mechanisms can generate different angular distributions of new particles. We show that even the most minimalistic reconfiguration of the existing NA62 experiment's detectors can already provide a very competitive sensitivity and collect data immediately after the beam is available.</description>

      <title>EveNet: A Foundation Model for Particle Collision Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning is transforming data analysis in high-energy physics, computational challenges limit its potential. We address these challenges in the context of collider physics by introducing EveNet, an event-level foundation model pretrained on 500 million simulated collision events using a hybrid objective of self-supervised learning and physics-informed supervision. By leveraging a shared particle-cloud representation, EveNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse tasks, including searches for heavy resonances and exotic Higgs decays, and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in low-statistics regimes. Crucially, we validate the transferability of the model to experimental data by rediscovering the $\Upsilon$ meson in CMS Open Data and show its capacity for precision physics through the robust extraction of quantum correlation observables stable against systematic uncertainties. These results indicate that EveNet can successfully encode the fundamental physical structure of particle interactions, which offers a unified and resource-efficient framework to accelerate discovery at current and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Application Characteristics for GPU Portability Layer Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GPUs have become the dominant source of computing power for high performance computing and are increasingly being used across the High Energy Physics computing landscape for a wide variety of tasks. Though NVIDIA is currently the main provider of GPUs, AMD and Intel are rapidly increasing their market share. As a result, programming using a vendor-specific language such as CUDA can significantly reduce deployment choices. There are a number of portability layers such as Kokkos, Alpaka, SYCL, OpenMP and std::par that permit execution on a broad range of GPU and CPU architectures, significantly increasing the flexibility of application programmers. However, each of these portability layers has its own characteristics, performing better at some tasks and worse at others, or placing limitations on aspects of the application. In this presentation, we report on a study of application and kernel characteristics that can influence the choice of a portability layer and show how each layer handles these characteristics. We have analyzed representative heterogeneous applications from CMS (patatrack and p2r), DUNE (Wire-Cell Toolkit), and ATLAS (FastCaloSim) to identify key application characteristics that have different behaviors for the various portability technologies. Using these results, developers can make more informed decisions on which GPU portability technology is best suited to their application.</description>

      <title>Strategy and performance of the CMS long-lived particle trigger program in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the physics program of the CMS experiment during the CERN LHC Run 3, which started in 2022, the long-lived particle triggers have been improved and extended to expand the scope of the corresponding searches. These dedicated triggers and their performance are described in this paper, using several theoretical benchmark models that extend the standard model of particle physics. The results are based on proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS detector during 2022$-$2024 at a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 123 fb$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Search for the pair production of long-lived supersymmetric partners of the tau lepton in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge-mediated supersymmetry-breaking models provide a strong motivation to search for a supersymmetric partner of the tau lepton (stau) with a macroscopic lifetime. Long-lived stau decays produce tau leptons that are displaced from the primary proton-proton interaction vertex, leading to an unconventional signature. This paper presents a search for the direct production of long-lived staus decaying within the CMS tracker volume in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, performed for the first time with an identification algorithm based on a graph neural network dedicated to displaced tau leptons. The data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$, was recorded with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC between 2016 and 2018. This search excludes, at 95% confidence level, stau masses, $m_\tilde{\tau}$, in the 126$-$260 (906$-$425) GeV range for a proper decay length of 50 mm in the maximally mixed (mass-degenerate) scenario, while for $m_\tilde{\tau} $ = 200 GeV, stau proper decay lengths are excluded in the range 21$-$94 (6$-$333) mm. These results improve the exclusion limits compared to previous searches, and extend the parameter space explored in the context of supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Water Cherenkov Detectors in Precision Agriculture: A Novel Approach for High-Resolution Soil Moisture Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs), traditionally employed in cosmic-ray detection, are repurposed here for precision soil moisture monitoring using cosmic-ray neutron sensing. This approach offers advantages over conventional neutron probes, including enhanced sensitivity to low moisture levels and the ability to cover larger soil volumes without subsurface intrusion. This study evaluates the feasibility of WCDs for agricultural neutron hydrometry, addressing challenges such as background suppression and data interpretation in heterogeneous soils. We present experimental results from controlled wet and dry soil-condition emulations, alongside Monte Carlo simulations using Geant4 with an atmospheric neutron spectrum to correlate signal variation with soil-moisture differences. By bridging particle physics and agronomy, WCDs could advance soil moisture monitoring, offering a non-invasive, scalable, and accurate alternative for optimizing agricultural water use. Preliminary findings suggest a transformative potential for sustainable farming, though further research is needed to enhance cost-efficiency and adaptability to diverse soil types.</description>

      <title>Any Light Particle Searches with ALPS II: first science campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From February to May of 2024 the Any Light Particle Search II (ALPS II) conducted its first science campaign using the `light-shining-through-a-wall' technique to search for pseudo-Goldstone bosons that lie beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and which are inaccessible by accelerator-based experiments. The experimental setup consists of two strings of superconducting dipole magnets, each more than 100 m long, that are separated by a wall. Laser light is directed through the first magnet string and a heterodyne detection system is used to measure the electromagnetic power that traverses a wall via the conversion to and then from a bosonic field. After the wall, a high-finesse optical cavity resonantly enhances the signal power. Two searches were carried out, one with the laser polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field direction and another with its polarization state aligned parallel to the magnetic field. No evidence for the existence of new bosons was found. In its first science campaign, ALPS II reached photon-boson conversion probability sensitivities of a few $10^{-13}$. The ongoing upgrade of the optical system aims to increase this sensitivity by about four orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Charged Higgs Pairs at the LHC: A NLO Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14587v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged Higgs-boson pair production at hadron colliders yields information about the trilinear couplings involving charged Higgs fields in extensions of the Standard Model (SM). We consider the type-I two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) extension and obtain next-to-leading order QCD predictions for the charged-Higgs pair production ($H^+H^-$ production). All production modes, i.e. Drell--Yan-like production, gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion are included in the analysis. We determine uncertainties originating from the scale dependence, the parton-density functions and strong coupling $\alpha_s$ at the LHC. We observe that the QCD corrections lead to a significant reduction of the relative scale dependences. These improved predictions will allow for a quantitative interpretation of experimental measurements, in case that charged Higgs states will be observed.</description>

Abstract: The development of lightweight flex PCBs and nanowire-based thermal interfaces for low-mass, high-performance detector modules are presented. A novel manufacturing approach targeting flex circuits with double-sided pad access, assembled using ACF and gold studs.

      <title>Fermionic Dark Matter and New Scalar Production in $e^+e^- \to H^+H^-$ at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the pair production process $e^+e^- \to H^+H^-$ in the framework of the scotogenic model. The production mechanism receives contributions at tree level from photon and $Z$-boson exchange, as well as from $t$-channel exchange of the new singlet right-handed fermions $N_{1,2,3}$. where neutrino masses are generated radiatively and one of the singlet right-handed fermions serves as a viable dark matter candidate. We evaluate the individual contributions of these diagrams and compute the total production cross section after imposing all relevant theoretical and experimental constraints on the model parameters, including those associated with dark matter relic abundance and direct detection limits. Our results demonstrate that the dominant contribution to the cross section originates from the exchange of the singlet fermions $N_{1,2,3}$, particularly from the dark matter component of the spectrum. In addition, we examine the dependence of the cross section on the center-of-mass energy for several benchmark scenarios in the allowed parameter space. These predictions can be probed at future high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders, providing a sensitive test of the scotogenic framework and the role of fermionic dark matter, as well as enabling more stringent constraints on the model parameters.</description>

      <title>JetFormer: A Scalable and Efficient Transformer for Jet Tagging from Offline Analysis to FPGA Triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JetFormer, a versatile and scalable encoder-only Transformer architecture for particle jet tagging at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Unlike prior approaches that are often tailored to specific deployment regimes, JetFormer is designed to operate effectively across the full spectrum of jet tagging scenarios, from high-accuracy offline analysis to ultra-low-latency online triggering. The model processes variable-length sets of particle features without relying on input of explicit pairwise interactions, yet achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. On the large-scale JetClass dataset, a large-scale JetFormer matches the accuracy of the interaction-rich ParT model (within 0.7%) while using 37.4% fewer FLOPs, demonstrating its computational efficiency and strong generalization. On benchmark HLS4ML 150P datasets, JetFormer consistently outperforms existing models such as MLPs, Deep Sets, and Interaction Networks by 3-4% in accuracy. To bridge the gap to hardware deployment, we further introduce a hardware-aware optimization pipeline based on multi-objective hyperparameter search, yielding compact variants like JetFormer-tiny suitable for FPGA-based trigger systems with sub-microsecond latency requirements. Through structured pruning and quantization, we show that JetFormer can be aggressively compressed with minimal accuracy loss. By unifying high-performance modeling and deployability within a single architectural framework, JetFormer provides a practical pathway for deploying Transformer-based jet taggers in both offline and online environments at the LHC. Code is available at https://github.com/walkieq/JetFormer.</description>

      <title>Gluon Generalized TMD signatures at the EIC from exclusive heavy (axial-)vector meson production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potential experimental signatures of gluon generalized transverse momentum-dependent distributions (GTMDs) are proposed via exclusive heavy (axial-)vector meson production in lepton-proton collisions. Within the framework of collinear twist-3 factorization, we show that specific azimuthal-angle-dependent observables can provide sensitivity to the gluon GTMDs $F_{1,4}^g$ and $G_{1,1}^g$, which are related to partonic orbital angular momentum and spin-orbit correlations, respectively. These functions represent a unique sector of nucleon structure with no counterparts in the generalized parton distribution or transverse-momentum-dependent frameworks. We show that interference between different virtual-photon polarizations leads to distinct azimuthal modulations, including the polarization-independent $\cos 2\phi$ and polarization-dependent $\sin 2\phi$ terms, with $\phi$ defined as the angle between the lepton scattering plane and the hadron production plane. These observables provide signatures of the elusive gluon GTMDs $F_{1,4}^g$ and $G_{1,1}^g$, opening a new channel to access the spin structure of the nucleon at the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Full event interpretation with machine-learning-based particle-flow reconstruction in the CMS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle-flow (PF) algorithm constructs a global description of each particle collision by producing a comprehensive list of final-state particles, and is central to event reconstruction in the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The existing PF implementation relies on physics-motivated heuristics and assumptions that can be replaced by machine-learning (ML) models trained directly on simulated data and naturally suited to modern graphics processing units (GPUs). A state-of-the-art ML-based PF (MLPF) reconstruction algorithm, implemented within the CMS software framework, is presented. The MLPF algorithm performs a learnable full-event reconstruction on GPUs, generalizes across detector conditions and collision energies, and replaces multiple modular reconstruction steps with a single unified model. Physics performance comparable to standard PF reconstruction is achieved in both simulation and data, with improved jet energy resolution and inference time. In simulated top quark-antiquark events under LHC Run-3 (2023$-$2024) conditions, the jet energy resolution improves by 10$-$20% for jets with transverse momentum between 30$-$100 GeV. Inference time is evaluated using simulated multijet events, with a median of 20 ms per event on an Nvidia L4 GPU, compared to approximately 110 ms for the standard CMS PF reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Production of high-spin $\omega_J/\rho_J$ ($J=3,4,5$) mesons in $\pi^{-}p$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation of the production of high-spin $\omega_J$ and $\rho_J$ mesons ($J=3,4,5$) in $\pi^{-}p$ reactions using an effective Lagrangian approach. By constructing the relevant $t$-channel processes and calibrating the model with a single adjustable parameter fitted to existing data, we successfully reproduce the measured total and differential cross sections for the $J=3$ states $\omega_3(1670)$ and $\rho_3(1690)$. Within the same framework, we predict the production cross sections for the higher-spin partners $\omega_4(2250)$, $\rho_4(2230)$, $\omega_5(2250)$, and $\rho_5(2350)$. Our results show that these states exhibit measurable cross sections with characteristically forward-peaked angular distributions, underscoring their strong potential for observation in future $\pi p$ meson-beam experiments.</description>

      <title>Tensor form factors of decuplet hyperons in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor form factors encode essential information about the internal spin structure and tensor dynamics of baryons. In this work, we investigate the tensor form factors of the baryon hyperons $\Omega^-$, $\Sigma^{*+}$, and $\Xi^{*-}$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. For the $\Sigma^{*+}$ and $\Xi^{*-}$ baryons, both isosinglet and isovector tensor currents are considered, allowing us to disentangle flavor-dependent tensor contributions. The complete set of tensor form factors is numerically evaluated in the momentum transfer region $0&lt;Q^2&lt;10~\text{GeV}^2$. In addition, the quark tensor charges of the considered hyperons are extracted in the forward limit. The results provide new non-perturbative insight into the tensor structure and spin content of spin-$3/2$ baryons and offer valuable theoretical input for future phenomenological analyses and experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Lattice determination of the neutrino background for $J/\psi \rightarrow \gamma + \textrm{invisible}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching for dark matter is a primary goal of modern astronomy and particle physics. Invisible decays of heavy quarkonia are particularly promising for probing light dark matter, attracting broad interest due to their unique sensitivity. Experiments searching for radiative invisible decays of the $J/\psi$ have steadily improved upper limits, and upcoming facilities will push sensitivity further -- making the precise determination and subtraction of the neutrino background indispensable. Here, we present the first lattice QCD calculation of the Standard Model decay $J/\psi \to \gamma\nu\bar{\nu}$, an irreducible background to $J/\psi \to \gamma + \textrm{invisible}$. Our result for the branching fraction is $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi \to \gamma\nu\bar{\nu})=1.00(9)(7)\times 10^{-10}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is our systematic estimate. This work advances lattice-based determinations of neutrino backgrounds to quarkonium invisible decays, delivering an ab initio benchmark for $J/\psi \to \gamma + \textrm{invisible}$. Our approach generalizes to other quarkonium channels (e.g., $\Upsilon/\phi \to \gamma+\textrm{invisible}$) and provides critical theoretical support for dark matter searches at colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A production of a pair of tau leptons in PbPb collisions at the FCC-hh collider is examined. The 95\% C.L. exclusion limits, as well as 3$\sigma$ and 5$\sigma$ sensitivity limits on the anomaly magnetic moment of the tau lepton $a_\tau$ and its electric dipole moment $d_\tau$ are obtained. A comparison with bounds on $a_\tau$ and $d_\tau$ for other future colliders are given.</description>

      <title>Tensor-polarized parton distribution functions for spin-1 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-1 hadrons contain different aspects of spin physics from the ones of the spin-1/2 nucleon because of the existence of tensor-polarized structure functions. In the charged-lepton deep inelastic scattering from a spin-1 hadron or nucleus, such as the deuteron, there are leading-twist structure functions $b_1$ and $b_2$. In addition, there exists a gluon transversity which does not exist in the spin-1/2 nucleon. In the deuteron, these observables could probe interesting dynamical aspects beyond a simple bound system of a proton and a neutron. In addition, there are recent theoretical studies on higher-twist distributions. Tensor-polarized deuteron experiments are now under preparation at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, so that the topic of polarized deuteron is expected to become one of exciting fields in hadron physics. This paper is a brief overview on the tensor-polarized parton distribution functions, including transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions and fragmentation functions up to twist 4.</description>

      <title>Electric and magnetic timelike form factors of hyperons at large transfer momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been considerable progress in the study of the electromagnetic form factors of baryons in the timelike region, through electron-positron scattering reactions ($e^+ e^- \to B \bar B$), in the last two decades. Timelike experiments reveal information about the distribution of charge and magnetism inside the hyperons that cannot be obtained in spacelike experiments (electron scattering on baryons). Motivated by the novel data, we extend to the timelike region, without any further parameter fitting, a covariant quark model developed for the spacelike region that takes into account the meson cloud excitations of the baryon cores. We use the formalism to calculate the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin 1/2 baryons in the large square transfer momentum $q^2$ region. Our calculations are compared with the available data from CLEO and BESIII above $q^2=10$ GeV$^2$. We conclude that our predictions for the effective form factors (combination between $G_E$ and $G_M$) are in good agreement with the $q^2 &gt; 15$ GeV$^2$ data for $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^+$, $\Sigma^0$, $\Xi^-$ and $\Xi^0$. Upcoming data for $\Sigma^-$ can be used to further test our predictions. We also compare our model calculations with the available data for ratio $|G_E/G_M|$. We conclude that the present $q^2$ data range is not large enough to test our calculations, but that a more definitive test can be performed by upcoming data above $q^2=20$ GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Nuclear effects on longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio in the deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear modifications of the nucleon's structure function $F_2^N$ have been investigated mainly since the discovery of the EMC nuclear effect in 1983, and there were many experimental measurements from the deuteron to a heavy nucleus. Now, the details of the modifications of $F_2^N$ are known from small $x$ to large $x$. On the other hand, it is taken as granted that a nuclear modification does not exist for the longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$. However, such a nuclear modification does exist theoretically. A nucleon in a nucleus moves in any space direction, which is not necessary the longitudinal direction along the virtual-photon momentum in charged-lepton scattering. Because of this transverse Fermi motion, the longitudinal and transverse structure functions mix with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse-momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this paper, the nuclear modifications are shown numerically for the deuteron by using a standard convolution description. The magnitude of the modifications is of the order of a few percent in the deuteron; however, they should be large in large nuclei. In handling high-energy nuclear data, such nuclear modifications need to be taken into account for a precise determination of physical quantities. Now, the longitudinal-transverse structure-function ratio and tensor-polarized experiments are under preparation for the deuteron at JLab. We hope that such effects will be confirmed experimentally for not only for the deuteron but also for larger nuclei.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of the $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory in a momentum-space Daubechies wavelet basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory to investigate nonperturbative dynamics within the Hamiltonian framework. In particular, we employ Daubechies wavelets in momentum space, whose basis functions are labeled by resolution and translation indices, providing a natural nonperturbative truncation of both infrared and ultraviolet truncation of quantum field theories. As an application, we compute the energy spectra of a free scalar field theory and the interacting $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory. This approach successfully reproduces the well-known strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2 &gt; 0$ regime. We find that the extracted critical coupling systematically converges toward its established value as the momentum resolution is increased, demonstrating the effectiveness of the wavelet-based Hamiltonian formulation for nonperturbative field-theoretic calculations.</description>

Abstract: The precision of the neutrino oscillation parameters measurements has improved and will continue to improve as the next-generation experiments become online. Beyond the more precise measurements of the mixing angles and phases used to parametrize the lepton mixing matrix, tests of its unitarity are of great interest. This paper studies how the amplitudes of the oscillation patterns can be used and combined to construct leptonic unitarity triangles.</description>

      <title>Transforming jet flavour tagging at ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jet flavour tagging enables the identification of jets originating from heavy-flavour quarks in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, playing a critical role in its physics programmes. This paper presents GN2, a transformer-based flavour tagging algorithm deployed by the ATLAS Collaboration that represents a different methodology compared to previous approaches. Designed to classify jets based on the flavour of their constituent particles, GN2 processes low-level tracking information in an end-to-end architecture and incorporates physics-informed auxiliary training objectives to enhance both interpretability and performance. Its performance is validated in both simulation and collision data. The measured c-jet (light-jet) rejection in data is improved by a factor of 3.5 (1.8) for a 70% b-jet tagging efficiency, compared to the previous algorithm. GN2 provides substantial benefits for physics analyses involving heavy-flavour jets, such as measurements of Higgs boson pair production and the couplings of bottom and charm quarks to the Higgs boson, and demonstrates the impact of advanced machine learning methods in experimental particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using $(1.0087\pm0.0044)\times10^{10}$ $J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring, the reactions $\Sigma^{+}n\rightarrow\Lambda p$ and $\Sigma^{+}n\rightarrow\Sigma^{0}p$ are studied, where the $\Sigma^{+}$ baryon is produced in the process $J/\psi\rightarrow\Sigma^{+}\bar{\Sigma}^-$ and the neutron is a component of the $^9\rm{Be}$, $^{12}\rm{C}$ and $^{197}\rm{Au}$ nuclei in the beam pipe. Clear signals of these two reactions are observed for the first time. Their cross sections are measured to be $\sigma(\Sigma^{+}+{^9\rm{Be}}\rightarrow\Lambda+p+X)=(45.2\pm12.1_{\rm{stat}}\pm7.2_{\rm{sys}})$ mb and $\sigma(\Sigma^{+}+{^9\rm{Be}}\rightarrow\Sigma^{0}+p+X)=(29.8\pm9.7_{\rm{stat}}\pm6.9_{\rm{sys}})$ mb for a $\Sigma^{+}$ average momentum of $0.992$ GeV/$c$, within a range of $\pm0.015$ GeV/$c$, where $X$ represents the residual nucleus. This is the first study of $\Sigma^{+}$-nucleon scattering at an electron-positron collider.</description>

      <title>Energy Independence of the Collins Asymmetry in $p^{\uparrow}p$ Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The STAR experiment reports new, high-precision measurements of the transverse single-spin asymmetries for $\pi^{\pm}$ within jets, namely the Collins asymmetries, from transversely polarized ${p^{\uparrow}p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV. The energy-scaled distribution of jet transverse momentum, $x_{\mathrm{T}} = 2p_{\mathrm{T,jet}}/\sqrt s$, shows a remarkable consistency for Collins asymmetries of $\pi^{\pm}$ in jets between $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV and 510 GeV. This indicates that the Collins asymmetries are nearly energy independent with, at most, a very weak scale dependence in $p^{\uparrow}p$ collisions. These results extend to high-momentum scales ($Q^2 \leq 3400$ GeV$^2$) and enable unique tests of evolution and universality in the transverse-momentum-dependent formalism, thus providing important constraints for the Collins fragmentation functions.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of the vertex detector and measurement of Higgs decays to second-generation quarks at the CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04191v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vertex detector is crucial for precision measurements of the Higgs boson at the electron-positron Higgs factory. Benchmarked with $H \to c\bar{c}$ and $H \to s\bar{s}$ measurements in the $\nu\bar{\nu}H$ channel, we perform an optimisation study on the inner radius and spatial resolution of the vertex detector using the Jet Origin Identification (JOI) framework, which determines the parton flavor of jets using advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm.
  We observe that, compared to the reference detector configuration, halving the inner radius and spatial resolution improves the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter resolution approximately by a factor of two, while increasing the accuracy and significance of the $H \to c\bar{c}/s\bar{s}$ measurement by 4\% and 8\%, respectively. Conversely, doubling these parameters results in comparable degradation, with variations in the inner radius being the dominant factor. Our results provide guidance for detector design and highlight promising prospects for identifying the $H \to s\bar{s}$ decay mode at future Higgs factories.</description>

      <title>First exclusive reconstruction of the B$^{*+}$, B$^{*0}$, and B$^{*0}_\text{s}$ mesons and precise measurement of their masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in 2016$-$2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$, the first full reconstruction of the three vector B meson states, B$^{*+}$, B$^{*0}$, and B$^{*0}_\text{s}$, is performed. The mass differences between the excited mesons and their corresponding ground states are measured to be $m(\text{B}^{*+}) - m(\text{B}^+)$ = 45.277 $\pm$ 0.039 $\pm$ 0.027 MeV, $m(\text{B}^{*0}) - m(\text{B}^0)$ = 45.471 $\pm$ 0.056 $\pm$ 0.028 MeV, and $m(\text{B}^{*0}_\text{s}) - m(\text{B}_\text{s})$ = 49.407 $\pm$ 0.132 $\pm$ 0.041 MeV, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. These results improve on the precision of previous measurements by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>First observation of $CP$ violation and measurement of polarization in $B^+\to\rho(770)^0 K^*(892)^+$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An amplitude analysis of the $B^+\to(\pi^+\pi^-)(K^0_{\mathrm{S}}\pi^+)$ decay is performed in the mass regions $0.30 &lt; m_{\pi^+\pi^-} &lt; 1.10\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ and $0.75 &lt; m_{K^0_{\mathrm{S}}\pi^+} &lt; 1.20\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, using $pp$ collision data recorded with the LHCb detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The polarization fractions and $CP$ asymmetries for $B^+\to\rho(770)^0K^*(892)^+$ decays are measured. Violation of the $CP$ symmetry in the decay $B^+\to\rho(770)^0K^*(892)^+$ is observed for the first time, with a significance exceeding nine standard deviations. The $CP$ asymmetry is measured to be ${\cal A}_{CP} = 0.507 \pm 0.062\ \text{(stat)} \pm 0.024\ \text{(syst)}$ and the $CP$-averaged longitudinal polarization fraction of $f_L = 0.720 \pm 0.028\ \text{(stat)} \pm 0.009\ \text{(syst)}$. The measurements help to shed light on the polarization puzzle of $B$ mesons decaying to two vector mesons.</description>

      <title>Reducing Simulation Dependence in Neutrino Telescopes with Masked Point Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques in neutrino physics have traditionally relied on simulated data, which provides access to ground-truth labels. However, the accuracy of these simulations and the discrepancies between simulated and real data remain significant concerns, particularly for large-scale neutrino telescopes that operate in complex natural media. In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reducing dependence on labeled datasets. Here, we present the first self-supervised training pipeline for neutrino telescopes, leveraging point cloud transformers and masked autoencoders. By shifting the majority of training to real data, this approach minimizes reliance on simulations, thereby mitigating associated systematic uncertainties. This represents a fundamental departure from previous machine learning applications in neutrino telescopes, paving the way for substantial improvements in event reconstruction and classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Belle and Belle II experiments have collected an 1.6 ab$^{-1}$ sample of $e^+e^-$ collision data at center-of-mass energies near the $\Upsilon(nS)$ resonances. In particular, the Belle II experiment collected a 19.2 fb$^{-1}$ sample of data at center-of-mass energies near the $\Upsilon(10753)$ resonance. We study the following processes: $e^+e^-\to \Upsilon(nS)\eta$, $e^+e^-\to \gamma X_b(\chi_{bJ}\pi^+\pi^-)$, and $e^{+}e^{-}\to\chi_{bJ}(1P) \gamma$. These results provide additional information about the nature of the $\Upsilon(10753)$ resonance and nearby structures. In addition, we measure the $B^{0}$ and $B^+$ meson mass difference, and $\sigma\left(e^+ e^-\to J/\psi p\bar{p}\right)$ over a range of center-of-mass energies accessed via initial-state radiation.</description>

      <title>Triple-gauge couplings in LHC diboson production: a SMEFT view from every angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores fully leptonic WZ and WW production at the LHC within the SMEFT framework at NLO in QCD, focusing on both CP-even and CP-odd triple-gauge-coupling dimension-six operators. We investigate the off-shell processes, contrasting our findings in inclusive setups with those in the presence of realistic fiducial selections. Alongside the conventional kinematic observables, we examine polarisation-sensitive observables and angular coefficients. Moreover, we assess potential SMEFT effects on asymmetry observables. Through a sensitivity analysis, we identify critical LHC observables that are particularly sensitive to SMEFT-induced modifications, thereby shedding light on potential avenues for new-physics searches in diboson production at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Timelike electromagnetic form factors of hyperons at large $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last few years there has been considerable progress in the study of the electromagnetic form factors of baryons in the timelike region, through electron-positron scattering, with increasing squared transfer momentum $q^2$. The modulus of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors has been measured for nucleons, hyperons and other baryons at BaBar, CLEO, Belle and BESIII. The novel measurements motivated the extension of a covariant quark model, developed to the spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$), to the timelike region, without any further parameter fitting. The extension is based on asymptotic relations derived from analyticity and unitarity, valid for the large-$q^2$ region. We use the model to make predictions for the effective form factor $|G|$ (combination of $G_E$ and $G_M$) and the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$ for spin 1/2 hyperons at large $q^2$ (above 10 GeV$^2$). Our calculations are in good agreement with the data from CLEO and BESIII for $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^+$ and $\Xi^-$ above $q^2=15$ GeV$^2$. Upcoming data for $\Sigma^0$, $\Sigma^-$ and $\Xi^-$ at large $q^2$ may be used to further test our predictions. We also compare our model calculations with the scarce available data for $|G_E/G_M|$. We conclude that the present $q^2$ range is not large enough to test our calculations, but that a more definitive test can be made by experiments above $q^2=20$ GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Log Gaussian Cox Process Background Modeling in High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background modeling is one of the most critical components in high energy physics data analyses, and for smooth backgrounds it is often performed by fitting using an analytic functional form. In this paper a novel method based on Log Gaussian Cox Processes (LGCP) is introduced to model smooth backgrounds while making minimal assumptions on the underlying shape. In LGCP, samples are assumed to be drawn from a non-homogeneous Poisson process, with an intensity function drawn from a Gaussian process. Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used for optimizing the hyper parameters and drawing the final fit for the background estimate from the posterior. Synthetic experiments comparing background modeling from functional forms and the LGCP are used to compare the different methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the QCD sum rule method to study the semileptonic weak decay of the single bottom baryon $\Omega_{b}^{*}$ with spin $\frac{3}{2}$ into the single charmed baryon $\Omega_{c}^{*}$ with spin $\frac{3}{2}$, corresponding to a $\frac{3}{2}\rightarrow\frac{3}{2}$ weak transition. A three-point correlation function is calculated in both the physical and theoretical sides to derive the sum rules for the form factors of the transition. The analysis incorporates both the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions up to mass dimension six. After determining the working regions of the auxiliary parameters and performing numerical calculations of the sum rules of the form factors, we extract the $q^2$-dependent fit functions for the form factors. The obtained fit functions are then applied to compute the decay widths of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*} \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ transition in all lepton channels. Our results, when compared with the future experimental data, can test the Standard Model predictions and probe potential deviations from the theoretical expectations in the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*} \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ weak decay.</description>

      <title>Smallness of neutrino masses and leptogenesis in 331 composite Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider 331 composite Higgs model (CHM3) in which the Lagrangian of the strongly coupled sector is invariant with respect to global SU(3)_C \times SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry that can originate from SU(6) subgroup of E_6 and contains the gauge group of the standard model (SM) as a subgroup. The breakdown of the approximate SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry down to SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y subgroup around the scale f\sim 10 TeV results in a set of pseudo--Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that, in particular, involves Higgs doublet. The generation of the masses of the SM fermions in the CHM3 is discussed. We argue that approximate U(1)_L and discrete Z_2 symmetries may give rise to tiny masses of the left--handed neutrinos and several composite fermions with masses 1-2 TeV. The lepton and baryon asymmetries can be generated within the CHM3 via the out--of equilibrium decays of extra Majorana particle into the Higgs doublet and these composite fermions.</description>

      <title>Design and development of optical modules for the BUTTON-30 detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BUTTON-30 is a neutrino detector demonstrator located in the STFC Boulby underground facility in the north-east of England. The main goal of the project is to deploy and test the performance of the gadolinium-loaded water-based liquid scintillator for neutrino detection in an underground environment. This will pave the way for a future large-volume neutrino observatory that can also perform remote monitoring of nuclear reactors for nonproliferation. This paper describes the design and construction of the watertight optical modules of the experiment.</description>

      <title>Accessing baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes in $e^{\pm} \gamma \to e^{\pm} B \bar{B} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\gamma^* \gamma \to B \bar{B}$ is the golden process to access chiral-even di-baryon generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) as deeply virtual Compton scattering has proven to be for the generalized parton distributions. In the framework of colinear QCD factorization where the leading twist amplitude is the convolution of GDAs and a perturbatively calculable coefficient function, we study the scattering amplitude for the baryonic channels where $B$ is a spin $1/2$ baryon such as the nucleon or hyperon $\Lambda, \Sigma$. Taking into account the interfering QED amplitude, we calculate the cross section of the $e^\pm \gamma \to e^\pm B \bar B$ process that can be experimentally studied in $e^- e^+$ as well as in electron-ion facilities. We explore both the final state polarization summed case and the polarization dependent effects. Numerical estimates are presented for $e^- \gamma \to e^- p \bar{p}$, using motivated models for GDAs. Our results show that a first extraction of baryon-antibaryon GDAs from experimental measurements is feasible at Belle II.</description>

      <title>How to pick the best anomaly detector?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection has the potential to discover new physics in unexplored regions of the data. However, choosing the best anomaly detector for a given data set in a model-agnostic way is an important challenge which has hitherto largely been neglected. In this paper, we introduce the data-driven ARGOS metric, which has a sound theoretical foundation and is empirically shown to robustly select the most sensitive anomaly detection model given the data. Focusing on weakly-supervised, classifier-based anomaly detection methods, we show that the ARGOS metric outperforms other model selection metrics previously used in the literature, in particular the binary cross-entropy loss. We explore several realistic applications, including hyperparameter tuning as well as architecture and feature selection, and in all cases we demonstrate that ARGOS is robust to the noisy conditions of anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting charged long-lived BSM particles at MoEDAL-MAPP experiment: A mini-review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for physics beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider is expanding to include unconventional signatures such as long-lived particles. This mini-review assesses the prospects for detecting electrically charged long-lived particles using the MoEDAL-MAPP experiment. We synthesize findings from recent studies that evaluate sensitivity to supersymmetric models, radiative neutrino mass scenarios, and generic multiply charged objects. A key component of this review is the comparative analysis of MoEDAL's reach against the general-purpose ATLAS and CMS experiments. We conclude that while MoEDAL is constrained by lower integrated luminosity, its passive, background-free detection methodology offers a unique advantage. Specifically, the experiment provides complementarity to the major detectors, particularly for signals involving slow-moving particles and stable states with intermediate electric charges.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modeling of Cherenkov emission from particle showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subatomic particles can interact with target nuclei in matter or decay in flight, and an individual high-energy particle can induce a particle shower composed of numerous, lower-energy secondaries. These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice, and extensible to other, similar media. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Complete NLO BFKL impact factors for quarkonium hadroproduction in NRQCD: the case of ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first complete next-to-leading-order calculation of the impact factors for hadroproduction of the ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ NRQCD states within the BFKL formalism. We complete the recent virtual-correction computation presented in JHEP 12 (2024) 129 by that of the real-emission contributions. We observe the cancellation of the soft divergences between these real- and virtual-emission contributions and we note that the surviving collinear singularities are compatible with factorisation up to one loop for a novel class of processes where BFKL resummation can be applied. Our work indeed represents the first complete NLO quarkonium impact factor in the BFKL framework and paves the way to first next-to-leading-logarithmic-precision studies for hadroproduction of forward-backward quarkonium associated production at hadron colliders.</description>
