      <title>Third-order Pertubative OTOC of Harmonic Oscillator with Quartic Interaction and Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the third order out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) of a simple harmonic oscillator with extra quartic interaction by the second quantization method. We obtain the analytic relations of spectrum, Fock space states and matrix elements of coordinate which are then used to numerically calculate the OTOC. We see that OTOC saturates to a constant value at later times, i.e. $C_T(\infty)\to 2\langle x^2\rangle_T\langle p^2\rangle_T$, which associates with quantum chaotic behavior in systems that exhibit chaos. We analyze early-time property of $C_T$ and see that the exponential growth, which diagnoses the chaos, is shown in the third-order perturbation.</description>

      <title>State preparation of lattice field theories using quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the application of quantum optimal control (QOC) techniques to state preparation of lattice field theories on quantum computers. As a first example, we focus on the Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions. We demonstrate that QOC can significantly speed up the ground state preparation compared to gate-based methods, even for models with long-range interactions. Using classical simulations, we explore the dependence on the inter-qubit coupling strength and the device connectivity, and we study the optimization in the presence of noise. While our simulations indicate potential speedups, the results strongly depend on the device specifications. In addition, we perform exploratory studies on the preparation of thermal states. Our results motivate further studies of QOC techniques in the context of quantum simulations for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Realizing Symmetric, Asymmetric, and Antisymmetric Projectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum computing, knowing the symmetries a given system or state obeys or disobeys is often useful. For example, Hamiltonian symmetries may limit allowed state transitions or simplify learning parameters in machine learning applications, and certain asymmetric quantum states are known to be resourceful in various applications. Symmetry testing algorithms provide a means to identify and quantify these properties with respect to a representation of a group. In this paper, we present a collection of quantum algorithms that realize projections onto the symmetric subspace, as well as the asymmetric subspace, of quantum systems. We describe how this can be modified to realize an antisymmetric projection as well, and we show how projectors can be combined in a systematic way to effectively measure various projections in a single quantum circuit. Using these constructions, we demonstrate applications such as testing for Werner-state symmetry and estimating Schmidt ranks of bipartite states, supported by experimental data from IBM Quantum systems. This work underscores the pivotal role of symmetry in simplifying quantum calculations and advancing quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement, Quantum Teleportation, Multilinear Polynomials and Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that quantum entanglement states are associated with multilinear polynomials that cannot be factored. Notice that, since multilinear polynomials have a geometric representation, we can propose a similar geometric representation for entanglement states. In particular, we show that the Bell's states are associated with non-factorable real multilinear polynomial, which can be represented geometrically by three-dimensional surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a quantum circuit can be seen as a geometric transformations of plane geometry. Notice that this phenomenon is analogous to gravity, where matter curves space-time. In addition, we show an analogy between quantum teleportation and operations involving multilinear polynomials.</description>

      <title>Regular language quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce regular language states, a family of quantum many-body states. They are built from a special class of formal languages, called regular, which has been thoroughly studied in the field of computer science. They can be understood as the superposition of all the words in a regular language and encompass physically relevant states such as the GHZ-, W- or Dicke-states. By leveraging the theory of regular languages, we develop a theoretical framework to describe them. First, we express them in terms of matrix product states, providing efficient criteria to recognize them. We then develop a canonical form which allows us to formulate a fundamental theorem for the equivalence of regular language states, including under local unitary operations. We also exploit the theory of tensor networks to find an efficient criterion to determine when regular languages are shift-invariant.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Representation-Theoretic Multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kostka, Littlewood-Richardson, Plethysm and Kronecker coefficients are multiplicities of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group in restrictions and products of irreps. They play an important role in representation theory and are notoriously hard to compute. We give quantum algorithms that efficiently compute these coefficients whenever the ratio of dimensions of the representations is polynomial. Using that the Kostka numbers admit combinatorial interpretation, we show that there is an efficient classical algorithm for polynomially-bounded Kostka numbers and conjecture existence of a similar algorithm for the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. We argue why the same classical algorithm does not straightforwardly work for the Plethysm and Kronecker coefficients, give evidence on how our quantum algorithm may avoid some hardness obstructions in their computation, and conjecture that the problem could lead to superpolynomial quantum speedups on some inputs. We finally use Frobenius reciprocity to derive another quantum algorithm that estimates these coefficients using induction and has a different cost-to-input dependence.</description>

      <title>Discretized Quantum Exhaustive Search for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers promise a great computational advantage over classical computers, yet currently available quantum devices have only a limited amount of qubits and a high level of noise, limiting the size of problems that can be solved accurately with those devices. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a leading strategy to address these limitations by optimizing cost functions based on measurement results of shallow-depth circuits. However, the optimization process usually suffers from severe trainability issues as a result of the exponentially large search space, mainly local minima and barren plateaus. Here we propose a novel method that can improve variational quantum algorithms -- ``discretized quantum exhaustive search''. On classical computers, exhaustive search, also named brute force, solves small-size NP complete and NP hard problems. Exhaustive search and efficient partial exhaustive search help designing heuristics and exact algorithms for solving larger-size problems by finding easy subcases or good approximations. We adopt this method to the quantum domain, by relying on mutually unbiased bases for the $2^n$-dimensional Hilbert space. We define a discretized quantum exhaustive search that works well for small size problems. We provide an example of an efficient partial discretized quantum exhaustive search for larger-size problems, in order to extend classical tools to the quantum computing domain, for near future and far future goals. Our method enables obtaining intuition on NP-complete and NP-hard problems as well as on Quantum Merlin Arthur (QMA)-complete and QMA-hard problems. We demonstrate our ideas in many simple cases, providing the energy landscape for various problems and presenting two types of energy curves via VQAs.</description>

      <title>Investigating and Mitigating Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Circuits: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, variational quantum circuits (VQCs) have been widely explored to advance quantum circuits against classic models on various domains, such as quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning. Similar to classic machine-learning models, VQCs can be optimized through gradient-based approaches. However, the gradient variance of VQCs may dramatically vanish as the number of qubits or layers increases. This issue, a.k.a. Barren Plateaus (BPs), seriously hinders the scaling of VQCs on large datasets. To mitigate the exponential gradient vanishing, extensive efforts have been devoted to tackling this issue through diverse strategies. In this survey, we conduct a systematic literature review of recent works from both investigation and mitigation perspectives. Besides, we propose a new taxonomy to categorize most existing mitigation strategies. At last, we provide insightful discussion for future directions of BPs.</description>

      <title>The signaling dimension of two-dimensional and polytopic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signaling dimension of any given physical system represents its classical simulation cost, that is, the minimum dimension of a classical system capable of reproducing all the input/output correlations of the given system. The signaling dimension landscape is vastly unexplored; the only non-trivial systems whose signaling dimension is known -- other than quantum systems -- are the octahedron and the composition of two squares.
  Building on previous results by Matsumoto, Kimura, and Frenkel, our first result consists of deriving bounds on the signaling dimension of any system as a function of its Minkowski measure of asymmetry. We use such bounds to prove that the signaling dimension of any two-dimensional system (i.e. with two-dimensional set of admissible states, such as polygons and the real qubit) is two if and only if such a set is centrally symmetric, and three otherwise, thus conclusively settling the problem of the signaling dimension for such systems.
  Guided by the relevance of symmetries in the two dimensional case, we propose a branch and bound division-free algorithm for the exact computation of the symmetries of any given polytope, in polynomial time in the number of vertices and in factorial time in the dimension of the space. Our second result then consist of providing an algorithm for the exact computation of the signaling dimension of any given system, that outperforms previous proposals by exploiting the aforementioned bounds to improve its pruning techniques and incorporating as a subroutine the aforementioned symmetries-finding algorithm. We apply our algorithm to compute the exact value of the signaling dimension for all rational Platonic, Archimedean, and Catalan solids, and for the class of hyper-octahedral systems up to dimension five.</description>

      <title>Photon-resolved Floquet theory I: Full-Counting statistics of the driving field in Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet theory and other established semiclassical approaches are widely used methods to predict the state of externally-driven quantum systems, yet, they do not allow to predict the state of the photonic driving field. To overcome this shortcoming, the photon-resolved Floquet theory (PRFT) has been developed recently [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013116], which deploys concepts from full-counting statistics to predict the statistics of the photon flux between several coherent driving modes. In this paper, we study in detail the scaling properties of the PRFT in the semiclassical regime. We find that there is an ambiguity in the definition of the moment-generating function, such that different versions of the moment-generating function produce the same photonic probability distribution in the semiclassical limit, and generate the same leading-order terms of the moments and cumulants. Using this ambiguity, we establish a simple expression for the Kraus operators, which describe the decoherence dynamics of the driven quantum system appearing as a consequence of the light-matter interaction. The PRFT will pave the way for improved quantum sensing methods, e.g., for spectroscopic quantum sensing protocols, reflectometry in semiconductor nanostructures and other applications, where the detailed knowledge of the photonic probability distribution is necessary.</description>

      <title>Entangling power, gate typicality and Measurement-induced Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When subject to a non-local unitary evolution, qubits in a quantum circuit become increasingly entangled. Conversely, measurements applied to individual qubits lead to their disentanglement from the collective system. The extent of entanglement reduction depends on the frequency of local projective measurements. A delicate balance emerges between unitary evolution, which enhances entanglement, and measurements which diminish it. In the thermodynamic limit, there is a phase transition from volume law entanglement to area law entanglement at a critical value of measurement frequency. This phenomenon, occurring in hybrid quantum circuits with both unitary gates and measurements, is termed as measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We study the behavior of MIPT in circuits comprising of two qubit unitary gates parameterized by Cartan decomposition. We show that the entangling power and gate typicality of the two-qubit local unitaries employed in the circuit can be used to explain the behavior of global bipartite entanglement the circuit can sustain. When the two qubit gate throughout the circuit is the identity and measurements are the sole driver of the entanglement behavior, we obtain analytical estimate for the entanglement entropy that shows remarkable agreement with numerical simulations. We also find that the entangling power and gate typicality enable the classification of the two-qubit unitaries by different universality classes of phase transitions that can occur in the hybrid circuit. For all unitaries in a particular universality class, the transition from volume to area law of entanglement occurs with same exponent that characterizes the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Scalable circuit depth reduction in feedback-based quantum optimization with a quadratic approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are one of the areas where near-term noisy quantum computers may have practical advantage against classical computers. Recently a novel feedback-based quantum optimization algorithm has been proposed by Magann \textit{et al}. The method explicitly determines quantum circuit parameters by feeding back measurement results thus avoids classical parameter optimization that is known to cause significant trouble in quantum approximate optimization algorithm, the well-studied near-term algorithm. Meanwhile, a significant drawback of the feedback-based quantum optimization is that it requires deep circuits, rendering the method unsuitable to noisy quantum devices. In this study we propose a new feedback law for parameter determination by introducing the second-order approximation with respect to time interval, a hyperparameter in the feedback-based quantum optimization. This allows one to take larger time interval, leading to acceleration of convergence to solutions. In numerical simulations on the maximum cut problem we demonstrate that our proposal significantly reduces circuit depth, with its linear scaling with the problem size smaller by more than an order of magnitude. We expect that the new feedback law proposed in this work may pave the way for feedback-based quantum optimization with near-term noisy quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Simulating open-system molecular dynamics on analog quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions of molecules with their environment influence the course and outcome of almost all chemical reactions. However, classical computers struggle to accurately simulate complicated molecule-environment interactions because of the steep growth of computational resources with both molecule size and environment complexity. Therefore, many quantum-chemical simulations are restricted to isolated molecules, whose dynamics can dramatically differ from what happens in an environment. Here, we show that analog quantum simulators can simulate open molecular systems by using the native dissipation of the simulator and injecting additional controllable dissipation. By exploiting the native dissipation to simulate the molecular dissipation -- rather than seeing it as a limitation -- our approach enables longer simulations of open systems than are possible for closed systems. In particular, we show that trapped-ion simulators using a mixed qudit-boson (MQB) encoding could simulate molecules in a wide range of condensed phases by implementing widely used dissipative processes within the Lindblad formalism, including pure dephasing and both electronic and vibrational relaxation. The MQB open-system simulations require significantly fewer additional quantum resources compared to both classical and digital quantum approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum state preparation and readout with modulated electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive study of the capabilities of modulated electron wavefunctions for the preparation and readout of the quantum state of the quantum emitters (QEs) they interact with. First, we consider perfectly periodic electron combs, which do not produce QE-electron entanglement, preserving the purity of the QE while inducing Rabi-like dynamics in it. We extend our findings to realistic, non-ideally modulated electron wavepackets, showing that the phenomenology persists, and exploring their use to prepare the emitter in a desired quantum state. Thus, we establish the balance that electron comb size, emitter radiative decay, and electron-emitter coupling strength must fulfil in order to implement our ideas in experimentally feasible platforms. Finally, moving into the limit of small electron combs, we reveal that these wavefunctions allow for quantum state tomography of their target, providing access not only to the populations, but also the coherences of the QE density matrix. We believe that our theoretical results showcase modulated free-electrons as very promising tools for quantum technologies based on light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Pseudomode treatment of strong-coupling quantum thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The treatment of quantum thermodynamic systems beyond weak coupling is of increasing relevance, yet extremely challenging. The evaluation of thermodynamic quantities in strong-coupling regimes requires a nonperturbative knowledge of the bath dynamics, which in turn relies on heavy numerical simulations. To tame these difficulties, considering thermal bosonic baths linearly coupled to the open system, we derive expressions for heat, work, and average system-bath interaction energy that only involve the autocorrelation function of the bath and two-time expectation values of system operators. We then exploit the pseudomode approach, which replaces the physical continuous bosonic bath with a small finite number of damped, possibly interacting, modes, to numerically evaluate these relevant thermodynamic quantities. We show in particular that this method allows for an efficient numerical evaluation of thermodynamic quantities in terms of one-time expectation values of the open system and the pseudomodes. We apply this framework to the investigation of two paradigmatic situations. In the first instance, we study the entropy production for a two-level system coupled to an ohmic bath, simulated via interacting pseudomodes, allowing for the presence of time-dependent driving. Secondly, we consider a quantum thermal machine composed of a two-level system interacting with two thermal baths at different temperatures, showing that an appropriate sinusoidal modulation of the coupling with the cold bath only is enough to obtain work extraction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a mechanical oscillator coupled to a two-level system driven by a blue-detuned coherent source in the resolved sideband regime. For weak mechanical damping, we find dynamical instabilities leading to limit cycles. They are signaled by strong fluctuations in the number of emitted photons, with a large Fano factor. The phonon-number fluctuations exhibit a strikingly similar behavior. When the coupling strength becomes comparable to the mechanical frequency, non-classical mechanical states appear. We discuss the relation with cavity optomechanical systems. Candidates for observing these effects include superconducting qubits, NV centers, and single molecules coupled to oscillators.</description>

      <title>Fractals and spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes: a perspective from entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional spin-$s$ ${\rm SU}(2)$ ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, as a paradigmatic example for spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) with type-B Goldstone modes (GMs), is expected to exhibit an abstract fractal underlying the ground state subspace. This intrinsic abstract fractal is here revealed from a systematic investigation into the entanglement entropy for a linear combination of factorized (unentangled) ground states on a fractal decomposable into a set of the Cantor sets. The entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with the block size, with the prefactor being half the fractal dimension of a fractal, as long as the norm for the linear combination scales as the square root of the number of the self-similar building blocks kept at each step $k$ for a fractal, under an assumption that the maximum absolute value of the coefficients in the linear combination is chosen to be around one, and the coefficients in the linear combination are almost constants within the building blocks. Actually, the set of the fractal dimensions for all the Cantor sets forms a {\it dense} subset in the interval $[0,1]$. As a consequence, the ground state subspace is separated into a disjoint union of countably infinitely many regions, each of which is labeled by a decomposable fractal. Hence, the interpretation of the prefactor as half the fractal dimension is valid for any support beyond a fractal, which in turn leads to the identification of the fractal dimension with the number of type-B GMs for the orthonormal basis states. Our argument may be extended to any quantum many-body systems undergoing SSB with type-B GMs.</description>

      <title>Rise of conditionally clean ancillae for optimizing quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue by example that conditionally clean ancillae, recently described by [NZS24], should become a standard tool in the quantum circuit design kit. We use conditionally clean ancillae to reduce the gate counts and depths of several circuit constructions. In particular, we present:
  (a) n-controlled NOT using 2n Toffolis and O(log n) depth given 2 clean ancillae.
  (b) n-qubit incrementer using 3n Toffolis given log*(n) clean ancillae.
  (c) n-qubit quantum-classical comparator using 3n Toffolis given log*(n) clean ancillae.
  (d) unary iteration over [0, N) using 2.5N Toffolis given 2 clean ancillae.
  (e) unary iteration via skew tree over [0, N) using 1.25 N Toffolis given n dirty ancillae.
  We also describe a technique for laddered toggle detection to replace clean ancillae with dirty ancillae in all our constructions with a 2x Toffoli overhead. Our constructions achieve the lowest gate counts to date with sublinear ancilla requirements and should be useful building blocks to optimize circuits in the low-qubit regime of Early Fault Tolerance.</description>

      <title>Data-driven approach to mixed-state multipartite entanglement characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a statistical framework, based on a manifold learning embedding, to extract relevant features of multipartite entanglement structures of mixed quantum states from the measurable correlation data of a quantum computer. We show that the statistics of the measured correlators contains sufficient information to characterise the entanglement, and to quantify the mixedness of the state of the computer's register. The transition to the maximally mixed regime, in the embedding space, displays a sharp boundary between entangled and separable states. Away from this boundary, the multipartite entanglement structure is robust to finite noise.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Advantage with Quantum Randomized Smoothing Applied to Time-Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum machine learning continues to develop at a rapid pace, the importance of ensuring the robustness and efficiency of quantum algorithms cannot be overstated. Our research presents an analysis of quantum randomized smoothing, how data encoding and perturbation modeling approaches can be matched to achieve meaningful robustness certificates. By utilizing an innovative approach integrating Grover's algorithm, a quadratic sampling advantage over classical randomized smoothing is achieved. This strategy necessitates a basis state encoding, thus restricting the space of meaningful perturbations. We show how constrained $k$-distant Hamming weight perturbations are a suitable noise distribution here, and elucidate how they can be constructed on a quantum computer. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated on a time series classification task employing a Bag-of-Words pre-processing solution. The advantage of quadratic sample reduction is recovered especially in the regime with large number of samples. This may allow quantum computers to efficiently scale randomized smoothing to more complex tasks beyond the reach of classical methods.</description>

      <title>Implementing multi-controlled X gates using the quantum Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to solve many complex algorithms in the domains of optimization, arithmetics, structural search, financial risk analysis, machine learning, image processing, and others. Quantum circuits built to implement these algorithms usually require multi-controlled gates as fundamental building blocks, where the multi-controlled Toffoli stands out as the primary example. For implementation in quantum hardware, these gates should be decomposed into many elementary gates, which results in a large depth of the final quantum circuit. However, even moderately deep quantum circuits have low fidelity due to decoherence effects and, thus, may return an almost perfectly uniform distribution of the output results. This paper proposes a different approach for efficient cost multi-controlled gates implementation using the quantum Fourier transform. We show how the depth of the circuit can be significantly reduced using only a few ancilla qubits, making our approach viable for application to noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. This quantum arithmetic-based approach can be efficiently used to implement many complex quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Collective quantum enhancement in critical quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical systems represent a valuable resource in quantum sensing and metrology. Critical quantum sensing (CQS) protocols can be realized using finite-component phase transitions, where criticality is not due to the thermodynamic limit but rather to the rescaling of the system parameters. In particular, the second-order phase transitions of parametric Kerr resonators are of high experimental relevance, as they can be implemented and controlled with various quantum technologies currently available. Here, we show that collective quantum advantage can be achieved with a multipartite critical quantum sensor based on a parametrically coupled Kerr resonators chain in the weak-nonlinearity limit. We derive analytical solutions for the low-energy spectrum of this unconventional quantum many-body system, which is composed of \emph{locally} critical elements. We then assess the performance of an adiabatic CQS protocol, comparing the coupled-resonator chain with an equivalent ensemble of independent critical sensors. We evaluate the scaling of the quantum Fisher information with respect to fundamental resources, and find that the critical chain achieves a quadratic enhancement in the number of resonators. Beyond the advantage found in the case of zero Kerr, we find that there is a collective enhancement even in the scenario of finite Kerr nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of cat-state manifolds using nonlinear reservoir engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel reservoir engineering approach for stabilizing multi-component Schr\"odinger's cat manifolds. The fundamental principle of the method lies in the destructive interference at crossings of gain and loss Hamiltonian terms in the coupling of an oscillator to a zero-temperature auxiliary system, which are nonlinear with respect to the oscillator's energy. The nature of these gain and loss terms is found to determine the rotational symmetry, energy distributions, and degeneracy of the resulting stabilized manifolds. Considering these systems as bosonic error-correction codes, we analyze their properties with respect to a variety of errors, including both autonomous and passive error correction, where we find that our formalism gives straightforward insights into the nature of the correction. We give example implementations using the anharmonic laser-ion coupling of a trapped ion outside the Lamb-Dicke regime as well as nonlinear superconducting circuits. Beyond the dissipative stabilization of standard cat manifolds and novel rotation symmetric codes, we demonstrate that our formalism allows for the stabilization of bosonic codes linked to cat states through unitary transformations, such as quadrature-squeezed cats. Our work establishes a design approach for creating and utilizing codes using nonlinearity, providing access to novel quantum states and processes across a range of physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlations are at the core of the power of quantum information and are necessary to reach a quantum computational advantage. In the context of continuous-variable quantum systems, another necessary ressource for quantum advantages is non-Gaussianity. In this work, we propose a witness, based on previously known relations between metrological power and quantum correlations, to detect a strong form of entanglement that only non-Gaussian states possess and that cannot be undone by passive optical operations, i.e., entanglement in all mode bases. The strength of our witness is two-fold: it only requires measurements in one basis to check entanglement in any arbitrary mode basis; it can be made applicable experimentally using homodyne measurements and without requiring a full tomography of the state.</description>

      <title>ArtA: Automating Design Space Exploration of Spin Qubit Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fast-paced field of quantum computing, identifying the architectural characteristics that will enable quantum processors to achieve high performance across a diverse range of quantum algorithms continues to pose a significant challenge. Given the extensive and costly nature of experimentally testing different designs, this paper introduces the first Design Space Exploration (DSE) for quantum-dot spin-qubit architectures. Utilizing the upgraded SpinQ compilation framework, this study explores a substantial design space comprising 29,312 spin-qubit-based architectures and applies an innovative optimization tool, ArtA (Artificial Architect), to speed up the design space traversal. ArtA can leverage seventeen optimization method configurations, significantly reducing exploration times by up to 99.1% compared to a traditional brute force approach while maintaining the same result quality. After a comprehensive evaluation of best-matching optimization configurations per quantum circuit, ArtA suggests universal architectural features that perform optimally across all examined circuits, emphasizing the importance of maximizing quantum gate parallelization at the expense of more crosstalk interference.</description>

      <title>Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Time evolution and thermality via path integral functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$ perceives the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal state at temperature $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$, as a result of being constrained to a double-coned-shaped region known as a causal diamond. In this paper, we explore the emergence of thermality in causal diamonds due to the role played by the symmetries of conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) as a (0+1)-dimensional conformal field theory, within the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model and generalizations. In this context, the hyperbolic operator $S$ of the SO(2,1) symmetry of CQM is the generator of the time evolution of a diamond observer, and its dynamical behavior leads to the predicted thermal nature. Our approach is based on a comprehensive framework of path-integral representations of the CQM generators in canonical and microcanonical forms, supplemented by semiclassical arguments. The properties of the operator $S$ are studied with emphasis on an operator duality with the corresponding elliptic operator $R$, using a representation in terms of an effective scale-invariant inverse square potential combined with inverted and ordinary harmonic oscillator potentials.</description>

      <title>Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Quantum instability and semiclassical approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal diamonds are known to have thermal behavior that can be probed by finite-lifetime observers equipped with energy-scaled detectors. This thermality can be attributed to the time evolution of observers within the causal diamond, governed by one of the conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) symmetry generators: the noncompact hyperbolic operator $S$. In this paper, we show that the unbounded nature of $S$ endows it with a quantum instability, which is a generalization of a similar property exhibited by the inverted harmonic oscillator potential. Our analysis is semiclassical, including a detailed phase-space study of the classical dynamics of $S$ and its dual operator $R$, and a general semiclassical framework yielding basic instability and thermality properties that play a crucial role in the quantum behavior of the theory. For an observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$, the detected temperature
  $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$ is associated with a Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L = \pi T_D/\hbar$, which is half the upper saturation bound of the information scrambling rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) is propelled by advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML), particularly through quantum neural networks (QNN) built on variational quantum circuits (VQC). These advancements have proven successful in addressing sequential decision-making tasks. However, constructing effective QRL models demands significant expertise due to challenges in designing quantum circuit architectures, including data encoding and parameterized circuits, which profoundly influence model performance. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge with differentiable quantum architecture search (DiffQAS), enabling trainable circuit parameters and structure weights using gradient-based optimization. Furthermore, we enhance training efficiency through asynchronous reinforcement learning (RL) methods facilitating parallel training. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed DiffQAS-QRL approach achieves performance comparable to manually-crafted circuit architectures across considered environments, showcasing stability across diverse scenarios. This methodology offers a pathway for designing QRL models without extensive quantum knowledge, ensuring robust performance and fostering broader application of QRL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a tight inequality to test the dynamical nature of spacetime. A general-relativistic violation of that inequality certifies change of curvature, in the same sense as a quantum-mechanical violation of a Bell inequality certifies a source of entanglement. The inequality arises from a minimal generalization of the Bell setup. It represents a limit on the winning chance of a collaborative multi-agent game played on the M\"obius graph. A long version of this Letter including other games and how these games certify the dynamical character of the celebrated quantum switch is accessible as arXiv:2309.15752 [gr-qc].</description>

Abstract: We construct $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds of the ten-dimensional heterotic string theories appropriate for implementing the stringy replica method for the calculation of quantum entanglement entropy. A novel feature for the heterotic string is that the gauge symmetry must be broken by a Wilson line to ensure modular invariance. We completely classify the patterns of symmetry breaking. We show that the tachyonic contributions in all cases can be analytically continued, with a finite answer in the domain $0&lt;N \leq 1$, relevant for calculating entanglement entropy across the Rindler horizon. We discuss the physical implications of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atoms become strongly interacting when their electrons are excited to loosely bound Rydberg states. We investigate the strongly correlated quantum phases of matter that emerge in two-dimensional atom arrays where three Rydberg levels are used to encode an effective spin-1 degree of freedom. Dipolar exchange between such spin-1 Rydberg atoms naturally yields two distinct models: (i) a two-species hardcore boson model, and (ii) upon tuning near a F\"orster resonance, a dipolar spin-1 XY model. Through extensive, large-scale infinite density matrix renormalization group calculations, we provide a broad roadmap predicting the quantum phases that emerge from these models on a variety of lattice geometries: square, triangular, kagome, and ruby. We identify a wealth of correlated states, including lattice supersolids and simplex phases, all of which can be naturally realized in near-term experiments.</description>

Abstract: Superfluidity describes the ability of quantum matter to flow without friction. Due to its fundamental role in many transport phenomena, it is crucial to understand the robustness of superfluid properties to external perturbations. Here, we theoretically study the effects of speckle disorder on the propagation of sound waves in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. We numerically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the presence of disorder and employ a superfluid hydrodynamic approach to elucidate the role of the compressibility and superfluid fraction on the propagation of sound. A key result is that disorder reduces the superfluid fraction and hence the speed of sound; it also introduces damping and mode coupling. In the limit of weak disorder, the predictions for the speed of sound and its damping rate are well reproduced by a quadratic perturbation theory. The hydrodynamic description is valid over a wide range of parameters, while discrepancies become evident if the disorder becomes too strong, the effect being more significant for disorder applied in only one spatial direction. Our predictions are well within the reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom experiments and carry over to more general disorder potentials.</description>

      <title>Resonances and collisional properties of neutron-rich helium isotopes in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work treats few-body systems consisting of neutrons interacting with a $^{4}{\mathrm{He}}$ nucleus. The adiabatic hyperspherical representation is utilized to solve the $N$-body Schr$\ddot{\mathrm{o}}$dinger equation for the three- and four-body systems, treating both $^{6}{\mathrm{He}}$ and $^{7}{\mathrm{He}}$ nuclei. A simplified central potential model for the $^{4}{\mathrm{He}}-n$ interaction is used in conjunction with a spin-dependent three-body interaction to reproduce $^{6}{\mathrm{He}}$ bound-state and resonance properties as well as properties for the $^{8}{\mathrm{He}}$ nucleus in its ground-state. With this Hamiltonian, the adiabatic hyperspherical representation is used to compute bound and scattering states for both $^{6}{\mathrm{He}}$ and $^{7}{\mathrm{He}}$ nuclei. For the $^{6}{\mathrm{He}}$ system, the electric quadrupole transition between the $0^{+}$ and $2^{+}$ state is investigated. For the $^{7}{\mathrm{He}}$ system, $^{6}{\mathrm{He}}+n$ elastic scattering is investigated along with the four-body recombination process $^{4}{\mathrm{He}}+n+n+n\rightarrow$$^{6}{\mathrm{He}}+n$ and breakup process $^{6}{\mathrm{He}}+n\rightarrow$$^{4}{\mathrm{He}}+n+n+n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum cosmology aims at elucidating the beginning of our Universe. Back in early 80's, Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking put forward the "tunneling from nothing'' and "no boundary'' proposals. Recently there has been renewed interest in this subject from the viewpoint of defining the oscillating path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity using the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Aiming at going beyond the mini-superspace and saddle-point approximations, we perform Monte Carlo calculations using the generalized Lefschetz thimble method to overcome the sign problem. In particular, we confirm that either Vilenkin or Hartle-Hawking saddle point becomes relevant if one uses the Robin boundary condition depending on its parameter. We also clarify some fundamental issues in quantum cosmology, such as an issue related to the integration domain of the lapse function and an issue related to reading off the real geometry from the complex geometry obtained at the saddle point.</description>

Abstract: We study a model of networked atoms or molecules oscillating around their equilibrium positions. The model assumes the harmonic approximation of the interactions. We provide bounds for the total number of phonons, and for the specific heat, in terms of the average Wiener capacity, or resistance, of the network. Thanks to such bounds, we can distinguish qualitatively different behaviours in terms of the network structure alone.</description>

      <title>Experimental Data Confirm Carrier-Cascade Model for Solid-State Conductance across Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finding that electronic conductance across ultra-thin protein films between metallic electrodes remains nearly constant from room temperature to just a few degrees Kelvin has posed a challenge. We show that a model based on a generalized Landauer formula explains the nearly constant conductance and predicts an Arrhenius-like dependence for low temperatures. A critical aspect of the model is that the relevant activation energy for conductance is either the difference between the HOMO and HOMO-1 or the LUMO+1 and LUMO energies instead of the HOMO-LUMO gap of the proteins. Analysis of experimental data confirm the Arrhenius-like law and allows us to extract the activation energies. We then calculate the energy differences with advanced DFT methods for proteins used in the experiments. Our main result is that the experimental and theoretical activation energies for these three different proteins and three differently prepared solid-state junctions match nearly perfectly, implying the mechanism's validity.</description>

Abstract: This paper looks at the intersection of algorithmic information theory and physics, namely quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and black holes. We discuss theorems which characterize the barrier between the quantum world and the classical realm. The notion of a "semi-classical subspace" is introduced. The No Synchronization Law is detailed, which says separate and isolated physical systems evolving over time cannot have thermodynamic algorithmic entropies that are in synch. We look at future work involving the Kolmogorov complexity of black holes.</description>

Abstract: A quantum measurement scheme is suggested in two resonant models of quantum electrodynamics. The first model is the brain, where, for the propagation of its action potentials, the free electron laser-like coherence mechanism recently investigated by the author is comprehensively applied. The second model is an assembly of Preparata et al.'s coherence domains, in which we incorporate the quantum field theory of memory advocated by Umezawa et al. These two models are remarkably analogous.</description>

Abstract: Radhakrishnan et.al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 110401 (2020)] proposed a generalization of quantum discord to multipartite systems, which is consistency with the conventional definition of discord in bipartite systems and derived explicit formulae for any states. These results are significant in capturing quantum correlations for multi-qubit systems. We propose a generalization of geometric measure of multipartite quantum discord in the same manner. We find generic forms of the generalization of geometric measure of quantum discord in a general N-partite quantum state. Further, we obtain computable exact formulas for the generalization of geometric measure of quantum discord in an N-qubit quantum state, which include the results obtained in [arXiv:2104.12344].</description>

      <title>Entropic and operational characterizations of dynamic quantum resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.06906v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new methods for characterizing general closed and convex quantum resource theories, including dynamic ones, based on entropic concepts and operational tasks. We propose a resource-theoretic generalization of the quantum conditional min-entropy, termed the free conditional min-entropy (FCME), in the sense that it quantifies an observer's ``subjective'' degree of uncertainty about a quantum system given that the observer's information processing is limited to free operations of the resource theory. This generalized concept gives rise to a complete set of entropic conditions for free convertibility between quantum states or channels in any closed and convex quantum resource theory. It also provides an information-theoretic interpretation for the resource global robustness of a state or a channel in terms of a mutual-information-like quantity derived from the FCME. Apart from this entropic approach, we also characterize dynamic resources by analyzing their performance in operational tasks. Based on such tasks, we construct operationally meaningful and complete sets of resource monotones, which enable faithful tests of free convertibility between quantum channels. Finally, we show that every well-defined robustness-based measure of a channel can be interpreted as an operational advantage of the channel over free channels in a communication task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider classical shadows of fermion wavefunctions with $\eta$ particles occupying $n$ modes. We prove that all $k$-Reduced Density Matrices (RDMs) may be simultaneously estimated to an average variance of $\epsilon^{2}$ using at most $\binom{\eta}{k}\big(1-\frac{\eta-k}{n}\big)^{k}\frac{1+n}{1+n-k}/\epsilon^{2}$ measurements in random single-particle bases that conserve particle number, and provide an estimator for any $k$-RDM with $\mathcal{O}(k^2\eta)$ classical complexity. Our sample complexity is a super-exponential improvement over the $\mathcal{O}(\binom{n}{k}\frac{\sqrt{k}}{\epsilon^{2}})$ scaling of prior approaches as $n$ can be arbitrarily larger than $\eta$, which is common in natural problems. Our method, in the worst-case of half-filling, still provides a factor of $4^{k}$ advantage in sample complexity, and also estimates all $\eta$-reduced density matrices, applicable to estimating overlaps with all single Slater determinants, with at most $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}})$ samples, which is additionally independent of $\eta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate two practical mitigation methods to attenuate the cosmic muon flux, compatible with experiments involving superconducting qubits: shallow underground sites and specific device orientation. Using a specifically-built cosmic muon detector, we identify underground sites, widely present in urban environments, where significant attenuation of cosmic muon flux, up to a factor 35 for 100-meter depths, can be attained. Furthermore, we employ two germanium wafers in an above-ground laboratory, each equipped with a particle sensor, to show how the orientation of the chip with respect to the sky affects the amount and type of energy deposited on the substrate by ionizing radiation. We observe that the horizontal detector sees more counts at lower energy, while the vertical one is impacted by more particles at higher energy. The methods here described proposed ways to directly understand and reduce the effects of cosmic rays on qubits by attenuating the source of this type of decoherence, complementing existing on-chip mitigation strategies. We expect that both on-chip and off-chip methods combined will become ubiquitous in quantum technologies based on superconducting qubit circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12323v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising algorithms to achieve quantum advantages in the NISQ era. One important challenge in implementing such algorithms is to construct an effective parameterized quantum circuit (also called an ansatz). In this work, we propose a single entanglement connection architecture (SECA) for a bipartite hardware efficient ansatz (HEA) by balancing its expressibility, entangling capability, and trainability. Numerical simulations with a one-dimensional Heisenberg model and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) issues were conducted. Our results indicate the superiority of SECA over the common full entanglement connection architecture (FECA) in terms of computational performance. Furthermore, combining SECA with gate-cutting technology to construct distributed quantum computation (DQC) can efficiently expand the size of NISQ devices under low overhead. We also demonstrated the effectiveness and scalability of the DQC scheme. Our study is a useful indication for understanding the characteristics associated with an effective training circuit.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a continuous function given quantum access to a stochastic gradient oracle. We provide two new methods for the special case of minimizing a Lipschitz convex function. Each method obtains a dimension versus accuracy trade-off which is provably unachievable classically and we prove that one method is asymptotically optimal in low-dimensional settings. Additionally, we provide quantum algorithms for computing a critical point of a smooth non-convex function at rates not known to be achievable classically. To obtain these results we build upon the quantum multivariate mean estimation result of Cornelissen et al. 2022 and provide a general quantum-variance reduction technique of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum broadcasting is central to quantum information processing and characterizes the correlations within quantum states. Nonetheless, traditional quantum broadcasting encounters inherent limitations dictated by the principles of quantum mechanics. In a previous study, Parzygnat et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 110203 (2024)] introduced a canonical broadcasting quantum map that goes beyond the quantum no-broadcasting theorem through a virtual process. In this work, we generalize the concept of virtual broadcasting to unilocal broadcasting by incorporating a reference system and introduce protocols that can be approximated using physical operations with minimal cost. First, we propose a universal unilocal protocol enabling multiple parties to share the correlations of a target bipartite state, which is encoded in the expectation value for any observable. Second, we formalize the simulation cost of a virtual quantum broadcasting protocol into a semidefinite programming problem. Notably, we propose a specific protocol with optimal simulation cost for the 2-broadcasting scenario, revealing an explicit relationship between simulation cost and the quantum system's dimension. Moreover, we establish upper and lower bounds on the simulation cost of the virtual $n$-broadcasting protocol and demonstrate the convergence of the lower bound to the upper bound as the quantum system's dimension increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider quantum computer architectures where interactions are mediated between hot qubits that are not in their mechanical ground state. Such situations occur, e.g., when not cooling ideally, or when moving ions or atoms around. We introduce quantum gates between logically encoded systems that consist of multiple physical ones and show how the encoding can be used to make these gates resilient against such imperfections. We demonstrate that, in this way, one can improve gate fidelities by enlarging the logical system, and counteract the effect of unknown positions or position fluctuations of involved particles. We consider both a classical treatment of positions in terms of probability distributions, as well a quantum treatment using mechanical eigenmodes. We analyze different settings including a cool logical system mediating interactions between two hot systems, as well as two logical systems consisting of hot physical systems whose positions fluctuate collectively or individually. In all cases, we demonstrate a significant improvement of gate fidelities, which provides a platform-independent tool to mitigate thermal noise.</description>

Abstract: This paper improves and demonstrates the usefulness of the first quantized plane-wave algorithms for the quantum simulation of electronic structure, developed by Babbush et al. and Su et al. We describe the first quantum algorithm for first quantized simulation that accurately includes pseudopotentials. We focus on the Goedecker-Tetter-Hutter (GTH) pseudopotential, which is among the most accurate and widely used norm-conserving pseudopotentials enabling the removal of core electrons from the simulation. The resultant screened nuclear potential regularizes cusps in the electronic wavefunction so that orders of magnitude fewer plane waves are required for a chemically accurate basis. Despite the complicated form of the GTH pseudopotential, we are able to block encode the associated operator without significantly increasing the overall cost of quantum simulation. This is surprising since simulating the nuclear potential is much simpler without pseudopotentials, yet is still the bottleneck. We also generalize prior methods to enable the simulation of materials with non-cubic unit cells, which requires nontrivial modifications. Finally, we combine these techniques to estimate the block-encoding costs for commercially relevant instances of heterogeneous catalysis (e.g. carbon monoxide adsorption on transition metals) and compare to the quantum resources needed to simulate materials in second quantization. We conclude that for computational cells with many particles, first quantization often requires meaningfully less spacetime volume.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing a single-magnon state by optimizing magnon blockade</title>

Abstract: A stable and high-quality single-magnon state is desired by the single-magnon source for quantum information application with a macroscopic spin system. We consider a hybrid system where a magnon mode is directly coupled to a nonresonant superconducting qubit via the exchange interaction. The magnon and qubit are under the driving and probing fields with the same frequency, respectively. We find that the single-magnon probability $P_1$ can be maximized when the product of the magnon-driving field detuning and the qubit-probing field detuning is equivalent to the square of the magnon-qubit coupling strength, $\Delta_q\Delta_m=J^2$. Then, the double-magnon probability $P_2$ can be minimized by tuning the ratio of the probing intensity to the driving intensity and the relative phase between the two fields. Under these optimized conditions with accessible strong driving intensity and low decay rate, strong magnon blockade gives rise to a stable single-magnon state with a high quality. It features a large brightness (the single-magnon probability) $P_1\approx0.40$ and a high purity (the equal-time second-order correlation function) $g^{(2)}(0)\sim10^{-5}$. The two indicators as a whole prevail over the existing results for photon, phonon, and magnon modes with respect to a stable single-quantum state. The optimized conditions with a scalable modification $\Delta_q\Delta_m\approx NJ^2$ apply to the situation when one focus on only one of the $N$ magnon modes that are simultaneously coupled to a common qubit.</description>

      <title>Quantum communication on the bosonic loss-dephasing channel</title>

Abstract: Quantum optical systems are typically affected by two types of noise: photon loss and dephasing. Despite extensive research on each noise process individually, a comprehensive understanding of their combined effect is still lacking. A crucial problem lies in determining the values of loss and dephasing for which the resulting loss-dephasing channel is anti-degradable, implying the absence of codes capable of correcting its effect or, alternatively, capable of enabling quantum communication. A conjecture in [Quantum 6, 821 (2022)] suggested that the bosonic loss-dephasing channel is anti-degradable if and only if the loss is above $50\%$. In this paper we refute this conjecture, specifically proving that for any value of the loss, if the dephasing is above a critical value, then the bosonic loss-dephasing channel is anti-degradable. While our result identifies a large parameter region where quantum communication is not possible, we also prove that if two-way classical communication is available, then quantum communication -- and thus quantum key distribution -- is always achievable, even for high values of loss and dephasing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective Rydberg excitations provide promising applications ranging from quantum information processing, and quantum computing to ultra-sensitive electrometry. However, their short lifetime is an immense obstacle in real-life scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods of prolonging the lifetime were mainly implemented for ground-state quantum memories and would require a redesign to effectively work on different atomic transitions. We propose a protocol for extending the Rydberg excitation lifetime, which in principle can freeze the spin-wave and completely cancel the effects of thermal dephasing. The protocol employs off-resonant ac-Stark lattice modulation of spin waves by interfering two laser beams on the atomic medium. Our implementation showed that the excitation lifetime can be extended by an order of magnitude, paving the way towards more complex protocols for collective Rydberg excitations.</description>

Abstract: Landauer's principle sets a fundamental limit on the heat dissipated when one classical bit of information is erased from a memory, therefore establishing a direct link between information theory and thermodynamics. However, with the advent of quantum technologies, the question of whether there is a strategy to overcome the principle naturally emerges. In this work, we present a quantum channel that erases any qubit state with unit probability, and is capable of operating beyond Landauer's limit. The method, which requires an ancilla qubit to interact with the memory, is based only on CNOT gates. The violation of the Landauer bound is verified when the reservoir temperature is above a given limit temperature, which can be well below room temperature.</description>

      <title>Utilizing small quantum computers for machine learning and ground state energy approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuit partitioning (QCP) is a hybrid quantum-classical approach that aims to simulate large quantum systems on smaller quantum computers. A quantum computation is divided into smaller subsystems and results of measurements on these subsystems are combined using classical processing. In this paper, we propose a QCP strategy to measure an observable on a large quantum system by utilizing several quantum systems of smaller size. The method can be applied to both machine learning and variational ground state energy approximation, and we show that the required calculations and the variance of the gradients can be tailored to scale efficiently with the total number of qubits. Thus it can be utilized to mitigate the well-known problem of barren plateaus. Additionally, the method can be realized by performing simple measurements of Pauli-strings on the separate subsystems, and the gradients can be estimated with common methods such as the parameter-shift rule. We demonstrate the method by approximating the ground state energy of the 1D transverse-field Ising model with periodic boundary conditions, and by classifying handwritten digits. For the ground state energy approximation, we achieved a relative error within the order of 0.1% for all the tested systems sizes. When applied to the classification between the digits 3 and 6, we were able to generalize to out-of-sample data with 100% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Integrability and Exactly Solvable Dynamics in an Infinite-Range Many-Body Floquet Spin System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work Sharma and Bhosale [Phys. Rev. B, 109, 014412 (2024)], $N$-spin Floquet model having infinite range Ising interaction was introduced. In this paper, we generalized the strength of interaction to $J$, such that $J=1$ case reduces to the aforementioned work. We show that for $J=1/2$ the model still exhibits integrability for an even number of qubits only. We analytically solve the cases of $6$, $8$, $10$, and $12$ qubits, finding its eigensystem, dynamics of entanglement for various initial states, and the unitary evolution operator. These quantities exhibit the signature of quantum integrability (QI). For the general case of even-$N &gt; 12$ qubits, we conjuncture the presence of QI using the numerical evidences such as spectrum degeneracy, and the exact periodic nature of both the entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator. We numerically show the absence of QI for odd $N$ by observing a violation of the signatures of QI. We analytically and numerically find that the maximum value of time-evolved concurrence ($C_{\mbox{max}}$) decreases with $N$, indicating the multipartite nature of entanglement. Possible experiments to verify our results are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate optimized quantum state preparation for quantum metrology applications in noisy environments. Using the QFI-Opt package, we simulate a low-depth variational quantum circuit (VQC) composed of a sequence of global rotations and entangling operations applied to a chain of qubits that are subject to dephasing noise. The parameters controlling the VQC are numerically optimized to maximize the quantum Fisher information, which characterizes the ultimate metrological sensitivity of a quantum state with respect to a global rotation. We find that regardless of the details of the entangling operation implemented in the VQC, the optimal quantum states can be broadly classified into a trio of qualitative regimes--cat-like, squeezed-like, and product states--associated with different dephasing rates. Our findings are relevant for designing optimal state-preparation strategies for next-generation quantum sensors exploiting entanglement, such as time and frequency standards and magnetometers, aimed at achieving state-of-the-art performance in the presence of noise and decoherence.</description>

      <title>Quantum key distribution rates from non-symmetric conic optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing key rates in quantum key distribution (QKD) numerically is essential to unlock more powerful protocols, that use more sophisticated measurement bases or quantum systems of higher dimension. It is a difficult optimization problem, that depends on minimizing a convex non-linear function: the (quantum) relative entropy. Standard conic optimization techniques have for a long time been unable to handle the relative entropy cone, as it is a non-symmetric cone, and the standard algorithms can only handle symmetric ones. Recently, however, a practical algorithm has been discovered for optimizing over non-symmetric cones, including the relative entropy. Here we adapt this algorithm to the problem of computation of key rates, obtaining an efficient technique for lower bounding them. In comparison to previous techniques it has the advantages of flexibility, ease of use, and above all performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the decoherence of a two-level quantum system coupled to noisy environments exhibiting linear and quadratic fluctuations within the framework of a stochastic Liouville equation. It is shown that the intrinsic energy levels of the quantum system renormalize under either the linear or quadratic influence of the environmental noise. In the case of quadratic dependence, the renormalization of the energy levels of the system emerges even if the environmental noise exhibits stationary statistical properties. This is in contrast to the case under linear influence, where the intrinsic energy levels of the system renormalize only if the environmental noise displays nonstationary statistics. We derive the analytical expressions of the decoherence function in the cases where the fluctuation of the frequency difference depends linearly and quadratically on the nonstationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise (OUN) and random telegraph noise (RTN) processes, respectively. In the case of the linear dependence of the OUN, the environmental nonstationary statistical property can enhance the dynamical decoherence. However, the nonstationary statistics of the environmental noise can suppress the quantum decoherence in this case under the quadratic influence of the OUN. In the presence of the RTN, the quadratic influence of the environmental noise does not give rise to decoherence but only causes a determinate frequency renormalization in dynamical evolution. The environmental nonstationary statistical property can suppress the quantum decoherence of the case under the linear influence of the RTN.</description>

      <title>Ambiguous Resonances in Multipulse Quantum Sensing with Nitrogen Vacancy Centers</title>

Abstract: Dynamical decoupling multipulse sequences can be applied to solid state spins for sensing weak oscillating fields from nearby single nuclear spins. By periodically reversing the probing system's evolution, other noises are counteracted and filtered out over the total evolution. However, the technique is subject to intricate interactions resulting in additional resonant responses, which can be misinterpreted with the actual signal intended to be measured. We experimentally characterized three of these effects present in single nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, where we also developed a numerical simulations model without rotating wave approximations, showing robust correlation to the experimental data. Regarding centers with the $^{15}$N nitrogen isotope, we observed that a small misalignment in the bias magnetic field causes the precession of the nitrogen nuclear spin to be sensed by the electronic spin of the center. Another studied case of ambiguous resonances comes from the coupling with lattice $^{13}$C nuclei, where we reconstructed the interaction Hamiltonian based on echo modulation frequencies and used this Hamiltonian to simulate multipulse sequences. Finally, we also measured and simulated the effects from the free evolution of the quantum system during finite pulse durations. Due to the large data volume and the strong dependency of these ambiguous resonances with specific experimental parameters, we provide a simulations dataset with a user-friendly graphical interface, where users can compare simulations with their own experimental data for spectral disambiguation. Although focused with nitrogen vacancy centers and dynamical decoupling sequences, these results and the developed model can potentially be applied to other solid state spins and quantum sensing techniques.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems using 2-qubit Yang-Baxter gates offer a benchmark for quantum hardware. This can be extended to the higher dimensional case with $n$-qubit generalisations of Yang-Baxter gates called $n$-simplex operators. Such multi-qubit gates potentially lead to shallower and more efficient quantum circuits as well. Finding them amounts to identifying unitary solutions of the $n$-simplex equations, the building blocks of higher dimensional integrable systems. These are a set of highly non-linear and over determined system of equations making it notoriously hard to solve even when the local Hilbert spaces are spanned by qubits. We systematically overcome this for higher simplex operators constructed using two methods: from Clifford algebras and by lifting Yang-Baxter operators. The $n=3$ or the tetrahedron case is analyzed in detail. For the qubit case our methods produce 13 inequivalent families of unitary tetrahedron operators. 12 of these families are obtained by appending the 5 unitary families of 4 by 4 constant Yang-Baxter operators of Dye-Hietarinta, with a single qubit operator. As applications, universal sets of single, two and three qubit gates are realized using such unitary tetrahedron operators. The ideas presented in this work can be naturally extended to the higher simplex cases.</description>

Abstract: Grover's algorithm solves the unstructured search problem. Grover's algorithm can find the target item with certainty only if searching one out of four. Grover's algorithm can be deterministic if the phase of the oracle or the diffusion operator is delicately designed. The precision of the phases could be a problem. We propose a near-deterministic quantum search algorithm without the phase control. Our algorithm has the same oracle and diffusion operators as Grover's algorithm. One additional component is the rescaled diffusion operator. It acts partially on the database. We show how to improve the success probability of Grover's algorithm by the partial diffusion operator in two different ways. The possible cost is one or two more queries to the oracle. We also design the deterministic search algorithm when searching one out of eight, sixteen, and thirty-two.</description>

Abstract: A recent surge of research in many-body quantum entanglement has uncovered intriguing properties of quantum many-body systems. A prime example is the modular commutator, which can extract a topological invariant from a single wave function. Here, we unveil novel geometric properties of many-body entanglement via a modular commutator of two-dimensional gapped quantum many-body systems. We obtain the geometric additivity of a modular commutator, indicating that modular commutator for a multipartite system may be an integer multiple of the one for tripartite systems. Using our additivity formula, we also derive a curious identity for the modular commutators involving disconnected intervals in a certain class of conformal field theories. We further illustrate this geometric additivity for both bulk and edge subsystems using numerical calculations of the Haldane and $\pi$-flux models.</description>

Abstract: Entangled quantum states are essential ingredients for many quantum technologies, but they must be validated before they are used. As a full characterization is prohibitively resource-intensive, recent work has focused on developing methods to efficiently extract a few parameters of interest, in a so-called verification framework. Most existing approaches are based on preparing an ensemble of nominally identical and independent (IID) quantum states, and then measuring each copy of the ensemble. However, this leaves no states left for the intended quantum tasks and the IID assumptions do not always hold experimentally. To overcome these challenges, we experimentally implement quantum state certification (QSC), which measures only a subset of the ensemble, certifying the fidelity of the remaining states. We use active optical switches to randomly sample from sources of two-photon Bell states and three-photon GHZ states, reporting statistically-sound fidelities in real time without destroying the entire ensemble. Additionally, our QSC protocol removes the assumption that the states are identical, is device-independent, and can achieve close $N^{-1}$ scaling, in the number of states measured $N$. Altogether, these benefits make our QSC protocol suitable for benchmarking large-scale quantum computing devices and deployed quantum communication setups relying on entanglement in both standard and adversarial situations.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing information in a multiparty system is crucial but cumbersome. We extend the notion of conditional mutual information to multiparty systems and introduce a family of genuinely multiparty quantum mutual information. The two versions of multiparty quantum mutual information known in the literature are part of this family. We also conjecture them to qualify for secrecy monotones useful in quantum cryptography. We give interpretations and discuss their properties and some unresolved issues.</description>

Abstract: We couple to group field theory (GFT) a scalar field that encodes the entanglement between manifold sites. The scalar field provides a relational clock that enables the derivation of the Hamiltonian of the system from the GFT action. Inspecting the Hamiltonian, we show that a theory of emergent gravity arises, and that this can be recast according to the Ashtekar's formulation of general relativity. The evolution of the GFT observables is regulated by the Shroedinger equation generated by the Hamiltonian. This is achieved by imposing a renormalization group (RG) flow that corresponds to a simplified Ricci flow. As a consequence of the quantization procedure, the Hamiltonian is recovered to be non-Hermitian, and can be related to the complex action formalism, in which the initial conditions and the related future evolution of the systems are dictated by the imaginary part of the action.</description>

      <title>Prolonging a discrete time crystal by quantum-classical feedback</title>

Abstract: Nonequilibrium phases of quantum matter featuring time crystalline eigenstate order have been realized recently on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. While ideal quantum time crystals exhibit collective subharmonic oscillations and spatiotemporal long-range order persisting for infinite times, the decoherence time of current NISQ devices sets a natural limit to the survival of these phases, restricting their observation to a shallow quantum circuit. Here we propose a time-periodic scheme that leverages quantum-classical feedback protocols in subregions of the system to enhance a time crystal signal significantly exceeding the decoherence time of the device. As a case of study, we demonstrate the survival of the many-body localized discrete time crystal phase in the one-dimensional periodically kicked Ising model, accounting for decoherence of the system with an environment. Based on classical simulation of quantum circuit realizations we find that this approach is suitable for implementation on existing quantum hardware and presents a prospective path to simulate complex quantum many-body dynamics that transcend the low depth limit of current digital quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Generative Learning of Continuous Data by Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20498</link>

Abstract: Beyond their origin in modeling many-body quantum systems, tensor networks have emerged as a promising class of models for solving machine learning problems, notably in unsupervised generative learning. While possessing many desirable features arising from their quantum-inspired nature, tensor network generative models have previously been largely restricted to binary or categorical data, limiting their utility in real-world modeling problems. We overcome this by introducing a new family of tensor network generative models for continuous data, which are capable of learning from distributions containing continuous random variables. We develop our method in the setting of matrix product states, first deriving a universal expressivity theorem proving the ability of this model family to approximate any reasonably smooth probability density function with arbitrary precision. We then benchmark the performance of this model on several synthetic and real-world datasets, finding that the model learns and generalizes well on distributions of continuous and discrete variables. We develop methods for modeling different data domains, and introduce a trainable compression layer which is found to increase model performance given limited memory or computational resources. Overall, our methods give important theoretical and empirical evidence of the efficacy of quantum-inspired methods for the rapidly growing field of generative learning.</description>

      <title>Background independent tensor networks</title>

Abstract: Conventional holographic tensor networks can be described as toy holographic maps constructed from many small linear maps acting in a spatially local way, all connected together with ``background entanglement'', i.e. links of a fixed state, often the maximally entangled state. However, these constructions fall short of modeling real holographic maps. One reason is that their ``areas'' are trivial, taking the same value for all states, unlike in gravity where the geometry is dynamical. Recently, new constructions have ameliorated this issue by adding degrees of freedom that ``live on the links''. This makes areas non-trivial, equal to the background entanglement piece plus a new positive piece that depends on the state of the link degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, this still has the downside that there is background entanglement, and hence it only models relatively limited code subspaces in which every area has a definite minimum value given by the background entanglement. In this note, we simply point out that a version of these constructions goes one step further: they can be background independent, with no background entanglement in the holographic map. This is advantageous because it allows tensor networks to model holographic maps for larger code subspaces. In addition to pointing this out, we address some subtleties involved in making it work and point out a nice connection it offers to recent discussions of random CFT data.</description>

      <title>A study of the spin 1 Unruh-De Witt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A study of the spin 1 Unruh-De Witt detectors interacting with a relativistic scalar quantum field is presented. After tracing out the field modes, the resulting density matrix for a bipartite qutrit system is employed to investigate the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. Unlike the case of spin $1/2$, for which the effects of the quantum field result in a decreasing of the size of violation, in the case of spin $1$ both decreasing and increasing of the violation may occur. This effect is ascribed to the fact that Tsirelson's bound is not saturated in the case of qutrits.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic tachyons: a new representation of the Galilei group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An algebraic characterization of the contractions of the Poincar\'e group permits a proper construction of a non-relativistic limit of its tachyonic representation. We arrive at a consistent, nonstandard representation of the Galilei group which was disregarded long ago by supposedly unphysical properties. The corresponding quantum (and classical) theory shares with the relativistic one their fundamentals, and serves as a toy model to better comprehend the unusual behavior of the tachyonic representation. For instance, we see that evolution takes place in a spatial coordinate rather than time, as for relativistic tachyons, but the modulus of the three-momentum is the same for all Galilean observers, leading to a new dispersion relation for a Galilean system. Furthermore, the tachyonic objects described by the new representation cannot be regarded as localizable in the standard sense.</description>
