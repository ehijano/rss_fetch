      <title>Hierarchical Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Time-Resolved NMR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metabolic monitoring and reaction rate estimation using hyperpolarized NMR technology requires accurate quantitative analysis of multidimensional data scenarios. Currently, this analysis is often performed in a two-stage procedure, which is prone to errors in uncertainty propagation and estimation. We propose an approach derived from a Bayesian hierarchical model that intrinsically propagates uncertainties and operates on the full data to maximize the precision at minimal uncertainty. In an analytic treatment, we reduce the estimation procedure to a least-squares optimization problem which can be understood as an extension of the Variable Projection (VarPro) approach for data scenarios with two predictors. We investigate the method's efficacy in two experiments with hyperpolarized metabolites recorded with conventional high-field NMR devices and a micronscale NMR setup using Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond for detection, respectively. In both examples, the new approach improves estimates compared to Fourier methods and proves operational advantages over a two-stage procedure employing VarPro. While the approach presented is motivated by NMR analysis, it is straightforwardly applicable to further estimation scenarios with similar data structure, such as time-resolved photospectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Fusing Structural Phenotypes with Functional Data for Early Prediction of Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with &gt;5 reliable VF tests over &gt;5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum, with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline &lt;-2.0% per year; slow progression &gt;-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers. Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299 patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG. Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive, highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease progression.</description>

      <title>Can synthetic data reproduce real-world findings in epidemiology? A replication study using tree-based generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence for synthetic data generation holds substantial potential to address practical challenges in epidemiology. However, many current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands, and complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced both quality and stability of the results.</description>

      <title>An MRI Atlas of the Human Fetal Brain: Reference and Segmentation Tools for Fetal Brain MRI Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of in-utero brain development is essential for understanding typical and atypical neurodevelopment. Building upon previous efforts to construct spatiotemporal fetal brain MRI atlases, we present the CRL-2025 fetal brain atlas, which is a spatiotemporal (4D) atlas of the developing fetal brain between 21 and 37 gestational weeks. This atlas is constructed from carefully processed MRI scans of 160 fetuses with typically-developing brains using a diffeomorphic deformable registration framework integrated with kernel regression on age. CRL-2025 uniquely includes detailed tissue segmentations, transient white matter compartments, and parcellation into 126 anatomical regions. This atlas offers significantly enhanced anatomical details over the CRL-2017 atlas, and is released along with the CRL diffusion MRI atlas with its newly created tissue segmentation and labels as well as deep learning-based multiclass segmentation models for fine-grained fetal brain MRI segmentation. The CRL-2025 atlas and its associated tools provide a robust and scalable platform for fetal brain MRI segmentation, groupwise analysis, and early neurodevelopmental research, and these materials are publicly released to support the broader research community.</description>

      <title>A cell-level model to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of neurodegenerative disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in modeling neurodegenerative diseases is connecting cellular-level mechanisms to tissue-level pathology, in particular to determine whether pathology is driven primarily by cell-autonomous triggers or by propagation from cells that are already in a pathological, runaway aggregation state. To bridge this gap, we here develop a bottom-up physical model that explicitly incorporates these two fundamental cell-level drivers of protein aggregation dynamics. We show that our model naturally explains the characteristic long, slow development of pathology followed by a rapid acceleration, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the model reveals the existence of a critical switch point at which the system's dynamics transition from being dominated by slow, spontaneous formation of diseased cells to being driven by fast propagation. This framework provides a robust physical foundation for interpreting pathological data and offers a method to predict which class of therapeutic strategies is best matched to the underlying drivers of a specific disease.</description>

      <title>Equi-mRNA: Protein Translation Equivariant Encoding for mRNA Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing importance of mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology highlights the need for models that capture the latent structure of synonymous codon (different triplets encoding the same amino acid) usage, which subtly modulates translation efficiency and gene expression. While recent efforts incorporate codon-level inductive biases through auxiliary objectives, they often fall short of explicitly modeling the structured relationships that arise from the genetic code's inherent symmetries. We introduce Equi-mRNA, the first codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that explicitly encodes synonymous codon symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix (SO(2)). By combining group-theoretic priors with an auxiliary equivariance loss and symmetry-aware pooling, Equi-mRNA learns biologically grounded representations that outperform vanilla baselines across multiple axes. On downstream property-prediction tasks including expression, stability, and riboswitch switching Equi-mRNA delivers up to approximately 10% improvements in accuracy. In sequence generation, it produces mRNA constructs that are up to approximately 4x more realistic under Frechet BioDistance metrics and approximately 28% better preserve functional properties compared to vanilla baseline. Interpretability analyses further reveal that learned codon-rotation distributions recapitulate known GC-content biases and tRNA abundance patterns, offering novel insights into codon usage. Equi-mRNA establishes a new biologically principled paradigm for mRNA modeling, with significant implications for the design of next-generation therapeutics.</description>

      <title>TOM: An Open-Source Tongue Segmentation Method with Multi-Teacher Distillation and Task-Specific Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tongue imaging serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The quality of tongue surface segmentation significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by 96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool (available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available tongue image segmentation tool.</description>

      <title>Kinetic-Diffusion-Rotation Algorithm for Dose Estimation in Electron Beam Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods are state-of-the-art when it comes to dosimetric computations in radiotherapy. However, the execution time of these methods suffers in high-collisional regimes. We address this problem by introducing a kinetic-diffusion particle tracing scheme. This algorithm, first proposed in the context of neutral transport in fusion energy, relies on explicit simulation of the kinetic motion in low-collisional regimes and dynamically switches to motion based on a random walk in high-collisional regimes. The random walk motion maintains the first two moments (mean and variance) of the kinetic motion. We derive an analytic formula for the mean kinetic motion and discuss the addition of a multiple scattering distribution to the algorithm. In contrast to neutral transport, the radiation transfer setting does not readily admit to an analytical expression for the variance of the kinetic motion, and we therefore resort to the use of a lookup table. We test the algorithm for dosimetric computations in radiation therapy on a 2D CT scan of a lung patient. Using a simple particle model, our Python implementation of the algorithm is nearly 33 times faster than an equivalent kinetic simulation at the cost of a small modeling error.</description>

      <title>Generation of structure-guided pMHC-I libraries using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized vaccines and T-cell immunotherapies depend critically on identifying peptide-MHC class I (pMHC-I) interactions capable of eliciting potent immune responses. However, current benchmarks and models inherit biases present in mass-spectrometry and binding-assay datasets, limiting discovery of novel peptide ligands. To address this issue, we introduce a structure-guided benchmark of pMHC-I peptides designed using diffusion models conditioned on crystal structure interaction distances. Spanning twenty high-priority HLA alleles, this benchmark is independent of previously characterized peptides yet reproduces canonical anchor residue preferences, indicating structural generalization without experimental dataset bias. Using this resource, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art sequence-based predictors perform poorly at recognizing the binding potential of these structurally stable designs, indicating allele-specific limitations invisible in conventional evaluations. Our geometry-aware design pipeline yields peptides with high predicted structural integrity and higher residue diversity than existing datasets, representing a key resource for unbiased model training and evaluation. Our code, and data are available at: https://github.com/sermare/struct-mhc-dev.</description>

      <title>CRISPR-GPT for Agentic Automation of Gene-editing Experiments</title>

Abstract: The introduction of genome engineering technology has transformed biomedical research, making it possible to make precise changes to genetic information. However, creating an efficient gene-editing system requires a deep understanding of CRISPR technology, and the complex experimental systems under investigation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, they often lack specific knowledge and struggle to accurately solve biological design problems. In this work, we introduce CRISPR-GPT, an LLM agent augmented with domain knowledge and external tools to automate and enhance the design process of CRISPR-based gene-editing experiments. CRISPR-GPT leverages the reasoning ability of LLMs to facilitate the process of selecting CRISPR systems, designing guide RNAs, recommending cellular delivery methods, drafting protocols, and designing validation experiments to confirm editing outcomes. We showcase the potential of CRISPR-GPT for assisting non-expert researchers with gene-editing experiments from scratch and validate the agent's effectiveness in a real-world use case. Furthermore, we explore the ethical and regulatory considerations associated with automated gene-editing design, highlighting the need for responsible and transparent use of these tools. Our work aims to bridge the gap between beginner biological researchers and CRISPR genome engineering techniques, and demonstrate the potential of LLM agents in facilitating complex biological discovery tasks.

Abstract: In the past few decades, the life sciences have experienced an unprecedented accumulation of data, ranging from genomic sequences and proteomic profiles to heavy-content imaging, clinical assays, and commercial biological products for research. Traditional static databases have been invaluable in providing standardized and structured information. However, they fall short when it comes to facilitating exploratory data interrogation, real-time query, multidimensional comparison and dynamic visualization. Integrated data-driven research environments aiming at supporting user-driven data queries and visualization offer promising new avenues for making the best use of the vast and heterogeneous data streams collected in biological research. This perspective article discusses the potential of interactive and integrated frameworks, highlighting the importance of implementing this model in biotechnology research, while going through the state-of-the-art in database design, technical choices behind modern data management systems, and emerging needs in multidisciplinary research. Special attention is given to data interrogation strategies, user interface design, and comparative analysis capabilities, along with challenges such as data standardization and scalability in data-heavy applications. Conceptual features for developing interactive data environments along diverse life science domains are then presented in the user case of cell line selection for in vitro research to bridge the gap between research data generation, actionable biological insight, experimental design, and clinical relevance.</description>

      <title>Negative feedback and oscillations in a model for mRNA translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ribosome flow model (RFM) is a phenomenological model for the unidirectional flow of particles along a 1D chain of $n$ sites. The RFM has been extensively used to study the dynamics of ribosome flow along a single mRNA molecule during translation. In this case, the particles model ribosomes and each site corresponds to a consecutive group of codons. Networks of interconnected RFMs have been used to model and analyze large-scale translation in the cell and, in particular, the effects of competition for shared resources. Here, we analyze the RFM with a negative feedback connection from the protein production rate to the initiation rate. This models, for example, the production of proteins that inhibit the translation of their own mRNA. Using tools from the theory of 2-cooperative dynamical systems, we provide a simple condition guaranteeing that the closed-loop system admits at least one non-trivial periodic solution. When this condition holds, we also explicitly characterize a large set of initial conditions such that any solution emanating from this set converges to a non-trivial periodic solution. Such a solution corresponds to a periodic pattern of ribosome densities along the mRNA, and to a periodic pattern of protein production.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Random Walks in Biomolecular Networks</title>

Abstract: Biomolecular networks, such as protein-protein interactions, gene-gene associations, and cell-cell interactions, offer valuable insights into the complex organization of biological systems. These networks are key to understanding cellular functions, disease mechanisms, and identifying therapeutic targets. However, their analysis is challenged by the high dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity of multi-omics data. Random walk algorithms are widely used to propagate information through disease modules, helping to identify disease-associated genes and uncover relevant biological pathways. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classical random walks and explore the potential of quantum random walks (QRWs) for biomolecular network analysis. We evaluate QRWs in two network-based applications. First, in a gene-gene interaction network associated with asthma, autism, and schizophrenia, QRWs more accurately rank disease-associated genes compared to classical methods. Second, in a structured multi-partite cell-cell interaction network derived from mouse brown adipose tissue, QRWs identify key driver genes in malignant cells that are overlooked by classical random walks. Our findings suggest that quantum random walks offer a promising alternative to classical approaches, with improved sensitivity to network structure and better performance in identifying biologically relevant features. This highlights their potential in advancing network medicine and systems biology.</description>

Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) slides. Existing methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts, HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by 5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model weights and inference code at https://github.com/owkin/histoplus/.</description>
