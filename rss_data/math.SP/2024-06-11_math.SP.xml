      <title>Anderson localization for CMV matrices with Verblunsky coefficients defined by the hyperbolic toral automorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the large deviation estimates and Anderson localization for CMV matrices on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}_+)$ with Verblunsky coefficients defined dynamically by the hyperbolic toral automorphism. Part of positivity results on the Lyapunov exponents of Chulaevsky-Spencer and Anderson localization results of Bourgain-Schlag on Schr\"{o}dinger operators with strongly mixing potentials are extended to CMV matrices.</description>

      <title>Discrete vs. continuous in the semiclassical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the bottom of the spectrum of discrete and continuous Schr\"odinger operators with periodic potentials with barriers at the boundaries of their fundamental domains. Our results show that these energy levels coincide in the semiclassical limit and we provide an explicit rate of convergence. We demonstrate the optimality of our results by using Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions for potentials exhibiting non-degenerate wells, and by numerical experiments for more general potentials. We also investigate the dependence of the spectrum of the discrete semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator on the semiclassical parameter $h$ and show that it can be discontinuous.</description>

      <title>Counting eigenvalues below the lowest Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the magnetic Laplacian on a bounded planar domain, imposing Neumann boundary conditions produces eigenvalues below the lowest Landau level. If the domain has two boundary components and one imposes a Neumann condition on one component and a Dirichlet condition on the other, one gets fewer such eigenvalues than when imposing Neumann boundary conditions on the two components. We quantify this observation for two models: the strip and the annulus. In both models one can separate variables and deal with a family of fiber operators, thereby reducing the problem to counting band functions, the eigenvalues of the fiber operators.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of the Kramers-Fokker-Planck operator with a long-range potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study real resonances and embedded eigenvalues of the Kramers--Fokker--Planck operator with a long-range potential. We prove that thresholds are only possible accumulation points of eigenvalues and that the limiting absorption principle holds true for energies outside an exceptional set. We also prove that the eigenfunctions associated with discrete eigenvalues decay exponentially and those associated with embedded non-threshold ones decay polynomially.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Moment Method for Regular Graphs I: Kesten-McKay and Semicircle distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the Chebyshev moment method to study the spectrum of regular graphs, motivated by the work of Serr\'e. By this method, we give an elementary proof of the weak convergence to the Kesten-McKay distribution for the normalized spectral measures of random $N$-lifts in probability as $N$ tends to infinity. For a sequence of random $(q_n+1)$-regular graphs $G_n$ with $n$ vertices, we show that if $q_n=n^{o(1)}$ and $q_n$ tends to infinity, then the normalized spectral measure converges in Wasserstein $p$-distance $W_{p}$ to the semicircle distribution for any $p \in [1,\infty)$ almost surely. This strengthens the result of Dumitriu and Pal.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the moduli of eigenvalues of rational matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rational matrix is a matrix-valued function $R(\lambda): \mathbb{C} \rightarrow M_p$ such that $R(\lambda) = \begin{bmatrix} r_{ij}(\lambda) \end{bmatrix}_{p\times p}$, where $r_{ij}(\lambda)$ are scalar complex rational functions in $\lambda$ for $i,j=1,2,\ldots,p$. The aim of this paper is to obtain bounds on the moduli of eigenvalues of rational matrices in terms of the moduli of their poles. To a given rational matrix $R(\lambda)$ we associate a block matrix $\mathcal{C}_R$ whose blocks consist of the coefficient matrices of $R(\lambda)$, as well as a scalar real rational function $q(x)$ whose coefficients consist of the norm of the coefficient matrices of $R(\lambda)$. We prove that a zero of $q(x)$ which is greater than the moduli of all the poles of $R(\lambda)$ will be an upper bound on the moduli of eigenvalues of $R(\lambda)$. Moreover, by using a block matrix associated with $q(x)$, we establish bounds on the zeros of $q(x)$, which in turn yields bounds on the moduli of eigenvalues of $R(\lambda)$.</description>

      <title>On Spectral Inclusion Sets and Computing the Spectra and Pseudospectra of Bounded Linear Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we derive novel families of inclusion sets for the spectrum and pseudospectrum of large classes of bounded linear operators, and establish convergence of particular sequences of these inclusion sets to the spectrum or pseudospectrum, as appropriate. Our results apply, in particular, to bounded linear operators on a separable Hilbert space that, with respect to some orthonormal basis, have a representation as a bi-infinite matrix that is banded or band-dominated. More generally, our results apply in cases where the matrix entries themselves are bounded linear operators on some Banach space. In the scalar matrix entry case we show that our methods, given the input information we assume, lead to a sequence of approximations to the spectrum, each element of which can be computed in finitely many arithmetic operations, so that, with our assumed inputs, the problem of determining the spectrum of a band-dominated operator has solvability complexity index one, in the sense of Ben-Artzi et al. (C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. I 353 (2015), 931-936). As a concrete and substantial application, we apply our methods to the determination of the spectra of non-self-adjoint bi-infinite tridiagonal matrices that are pseudoergodic in the sense of Davies (Commun. Math. Phys. 216 (2001) 687-704).</description>

      <title>Stability criteria for positive semigroups on ordered Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider generators of positive $C_0$-semigroups and, more generally, resolvent positive operators $A$ on ordered Banach spaces and seek for conditions ensuring the negativity of their spectral bound $s(A)$. Our main result characterizes $s(A) &lt; 0$ in terms of so-called \emph{small-gain conditions} that describe the behaviour of $Ax$ for positive vectors $x$. This is new even in case that the underlying space is an $L^p$-space or a space of continuous functions.
  We also demonstrate that it becomes considerably easier to characterize the property $s(A) &lt; 0$ if the cone of the underlying Banach space has non-empty interior or if the essential spectral bound of $A$ is negative. To treat the latter case, we discuss a counterpart of a Krein-Rutman theorem for resolvent positive operators. When $A$ is the generator of a positive $C_0$-semigroup, our results can be interpreted as stability results for the semigroup, and as such, they complement similar results recently proved for the discrete-time case.
  In the same vein, we prove a Collatz--Wielandt type formula and a logarithmic formula for the spectral bound of generators of positive semigroups.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of eventually positive semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positive $C_0$-semigroups that occur in concrete applications are, more often than not, irreducible. Therefore a deep and extensive theory of irreducibility has been developed that includes characterizations, perturbation analysis, and spectral results. Many arguments from this theory, however, break down if the semigroup is only eventually positive - a property that has recently been shown to occur in numerous concrete evolution equations.
  In this article, we develop new tools that also work for the eventually positive case. The lack of positivity for small times makes it necessary to consider ideals that might only be invariant for large times. In contrast to their classical counterparts - the invariant ideals - such eventually invariant ideals require more involved methods from the theory of operator ranges.
  Using those methods we are able to characterize (an appropriate adaptation of) irreducibility by means of linear functionals, derive a perturbation result, prove a number of spectral theorems, and analyze the interaction of irreducibility with analyticity, all in the eventually positive case. By a number of examples, we illustrate what kind of behaviour can and cannot be expected in this setting.</description>

      <title>Two-sided Lieb-Thirring bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove upper and lower bounds for the number of eigenvalues of semi-bounded Schr\"odinger operators in all spatial dimensions. As a corollary, we obtain two-sided estimates for the sum of the negative eigenvalues of atomic Hamiltonians with Kato potentials. Instead of being in terms of the potential itself, as in the usual Lieb-Thirring result, the bounds are in terms of the landscape function, also known as the torsion function, which is a solution of $(-\Delta + V +M)u_M =1$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$; here $M\in\mathbb{R}$ is chosen so that the operator is positive. We further prove that the infimum of $(u_M^{-1} - M)$ is a lower bound for the ground state energy $E_0$ and derive a simple iteration scheme converging to $E_0$.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Paszkiewicz's conjecture about a product of positive contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Paszkiewicz conjecture about a product of positive contractions asserts that given a decreasing sequence $T_1\ge T_2\ge \dots$ of positive contractions on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, the product $S_n=T_n\dots T_1$ converges strongly. Recently, the first named author verified the conjecture for certain classes of sequences. In this paper, we prove the Paszkiewicz conjecture in full generality. Moreover, we show that in some cases, a generalized version of the Paszkiewicz conjecture also holds.</description>
