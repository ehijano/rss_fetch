      <title>Refinement of Uncertainty Relations in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty relation of three quantities in quantum mechanics is estimated in terms of commutators. The Pauli matrices are used to find a contribution of third-order commutators. The resulting inequality refines the Heisenberg indeterminacy for two non-conjugate operators when their commutator is not a c-number. The inequality is applied to operators of the kinetic energy and coordinate of one-dimensional system. In addition, uncertainty of the angular momentum components is considered.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Trading: A Game-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum games, like quantum algorithms, exploit quantum entanglement to establish strong correlations between strategic player actions. This paper introduces quantum game-theoretic models applied to trading and demonstrates their implementation on an ion-trap quantum computer. The results showcase a quantum advantage, previously known only theoretically, realized as higher-paying market Nash equilibria. This advantage could help uncover alpha in trading strategies, defined as excess returns compared to established benchmarks. These findings suggest that quantum computing could significantly influence the development of financial strategies.</description>

      <title>Learning Orthogonal Random Unitary Channels with Contracted Quantum Approaches and Simplex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random (mixed) unitary channels describe an important subset of quantum channels, which are commonly used in quantum information, noise modeling, and quantum error mitigation. Despite their usefulness, there is substantial complexity in characterizing or identifying generic random unitary channels. We present a procedure for learning a class of random unitary channels on orthogonal unitary bases on a quantum computer utilizing Pauli learning and a contracted quantum learning procedure. Our approach involves a multi-objective, Pauli- and unitary-based minimization, and allows for learning locally equivalent channels. We demonstrate our approach for varying degrees of noise and investigate the scalability of these approaches, particularly with sparse noise models.</description>

      <title>Efficient compilation of quantum circuits using multi-qubit gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum processors grow in scale and reliability, the need for efficient quantum gate decomposition of circuits to a set of specific available gates, becomes ever more critical. The decomposition of a particular algorithm into a sequence of these available gates is not unique. Thus, the fidelity of an algorithm's implementation can be increased by choosing an optimized decomposition. This is true both for noisy intermediate-scale quantum platforms as well as for implementation of quantum error correction schemes. Here we present a compilation scheme which implements a general-circuit decomposition to a sequence of Ising-type, long-range, multi-qubit entangling gates, that are separated by layers of single qubit rotations. We use trapped ions as an example in which multi-qubit gates naturally arise, yet any system that has connectivity beyond nearest-neighbors may gain from our approach. We evaluate our methods using the quantum volume test over $N$ qubits. In this context, our method replaces $3N^2/2$ two-qubit gates with $2N+1$ multi-qubit gates. Furthermore, our method minimizes the magnitude of the entanglement phases, which typically enables an improved implementation fidelity, by using weaker driving fields or faster realizations. We numerically test our compilation and show that, compared to conventional realizations with sequential two-qubit gates, our compilations improves the logarithm of quantum volume by $20\%$ to $25\%$.</description>

      <title>Unorthodox parallelization for Bayesian quantum state estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) allows for the reconstruction of quantum states through measurements and some inference technique under the assumption of repeated state preparations. Bayesian inference provides a promising platform to achieve both efficient QST and accurate uncertainty quantification, yet is generally plagued by the computational limitations associated with long Markov chains. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian QST approach that leverages modern distributed parallel computer architectures to efficiently sample a $D$-dimensional Hilbert space. Using a parallelized preconditioned Crank--Nicholson Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, we demonstrate our approach on simulated data and experimental results from IBM Quantum systems up to four qubits, showing significant speedups through parallelization. Although highly unorthodox in pooling independent Markov chains, our method proves remarkably practical, with validation ex post facto via diagnostics like the intrachain autocorrelation time. We conclude by discussing scalability to higher-dimensional systems, offering a path toward efficient and accurate Bayesian characterization of large quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed color centers in a silicon photonic cavity array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement distribution is central to the modular scaling of quantum processors and establishing quantum networks. Color centers with telecom-band transitions and long spin coherence times are suitable candidates for long-distance entanglement distribution. However, high-bandwidth memory-enhanced quantum communication is limited by high-yield, scalable creation of efficient spin-photon interfaces. Here, we develop a silicon photonics platform consisting of arrays of bus-coupled cavities. The coupling to a common bus waveguide enables simultaneous access to individually addressable cavity-enhanced T center arrays. We demonstrate frequency-multiplexed operation of two T centers in separate photonic crystal cavities. In addition, we investigate the cavity enhancement of a T center through hybridized modes formed between physically distant cavities. Our results show that bus-coupled arrays of cavity-enhanced color centers could enable efficient on-chip and long-distance entanglement distribution.</description>

      <title>Computing entanglement costs of non-local operations on the basis of algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to realize distributed quantum computations and quantify entanglement, it is crucial to minimize the entanglement consumption of implementing non-local operations by using local operations and classical communications (LOCC) channels. Although this optimization is generally NP-hard even if we relax the condition of LOCC channels to separable ones, many methodologies have been developed. However, each has only succeeded in determining the entanglement cost for specific cases.
  As a main mathematical result, we introduce a concept based on algebraic geometry to simplify the algebraic constraints in the optimization. This concept makes it possible to generalize previous studies in a unified way. Moreover, via the generalization, we solve an open problem posed by Yu et al. about the entanglement cost for local state discrimination. In addition to its versatility for analysis, this concept enables us to strengthen the DPS (Doherty, Parrilo, and Spedalieri) hierarchy and compute the entanglement cost approximately. By running the algorithm based on our improved DPS hierarchy, we numerically obtain the trade-off between the (one-shot) entanglement cost and the success probability for implementing various non-local quantum operations under separable channels, such as entanglement distillation and local implementation of non-local unitary channels, measurements, and state verification.</description>

      <title>Time dispersion in bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics time is generally treated as a parameter rather than an observable. For instance wave functions are treated as extending in space, but not in time. But from relativity we expect time and space should be treated on the same basis. What are the effects if time is an observable? Are these effects observable with current technology?
  In earlier work we showed we should see effects in various high energy scattering processes. We here extend that work to include bound states. The critical advantage of working with bound states is that the predictions are significantly more definite, taking the predictions from testable to falsifiable.
  We estimate the time dispersion for hydrogen as $.177$ attoseconds, possibly below the current threshold for detection. But the time dispersion should scale as the $3/2$ power of the principle quantum number $n$. Rydberg atoms can have $n$ of order $100$, implying a boost by a factor of $1000$. This takes the the time dispersion to $177$ attoseconds, well within reach of current technology.
  There are a wide variety of experimental targets: any time-dependent processes should show effects. Falsification will be technically challenging (due to the short time scales) but immediate and unambiguous. Confirmation would have significant implications for attosecond physics, quantum computing and communications, quantum gravity, and the measurement problem. And would suggest practical uses in these areas as well as circuit design, high speed biochemistry, cryptography, fusion research, and any area involving change at attosecond time scales.</description>

      <title>The Trade-off in Quantum Metrology: Excessive Precision Compromise Accuracy even with Unlimited Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision and accuracy, as two crucial criteria for quantum metrology, have previously lacked rigorous definitions and distinctions. In this paper, we provide a unified definition of precision and accuracy from the perspective of distinguishing neighboring quantum states. Using the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound as a lower bound for precision, we find that the corresponding accuracy will fall short of expectations, because the bias of the parameter estimation cannot be ignored. Given that probability estimation is unbiased, defining precision from the perspective of probability distributions provides a more comprehensive approach. This leads to a correction of the traditional precision lower bound by a factor of 2. The trade-off between precision and accuracy shows that precision can be further improved by sacrificing accuracy, while it should be restricted by inherent precision limit. The inherent precision limit, determined by the number of sampling, can reach the Heisenberg scaling even without entanglement resources, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly reduced accuracy. We show that accuracy may actually decrease with increasing sampling when one pursues excessive precision, which indicates the trade-off should be considered even with unlimited resources.</description>

      <title>Transition from non-ergodic to ergodic dynamics in an autonomous discrete time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an autonomous system of two coupled single-mode cavities, one of which interacts with a multimode resonator. We demonstrate that for small coupling strengths between single-mode cavities, the Loschmidt echo oscillates periodically in time and spontaneous breaking of time translation symmetry takes place. The Loschmidt echo behavior is an indication of the non-ergodic nature of the system when its evolution is time-reversible. In this regime, the system retains a memory of the initial state under the action of small perturbations. This behavior reveals the presence of a time crystalline order in the autonomous system. An increase in the coupling strength leads to a transition from periodic oscillations to an exponential decay in time of the Loschmidt echo. This corresponds to the transition from non-ergodic to ergodic behavior in the system. We demonstrate that the transition from non-ergodic to ergodic system's behavior can also be observed when changing the number of degrees of freedom in the resonator, which is achieved by changing its length.</description>

      <title>The quantromon: A qubit-resonator system with orthogonal qubit and readout modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of a superconducting qubit is implemented by coupling it to a resonator. The common choice is transverse coupling, which, in the dispersive approximation, introduces an interaction term which enables the measurement. This cross-Kerr term provides a qubit-state dependent dispersive shift in the resonator frequency with the device parameters chosen carefully to get sufficient signal while minimizing Purcell decay of the qubit. We introduce a two-mode circuit, nicknamed quantromon, with two orthogonal modes implementing a qubit and a resonator. Unlike before, where the coupling term emerges as a perturbative expansion, the quantromon has intrinsic cross-Kerr coupling by design. Our experiments implemented in a hybrid 2D-3D cQED architecture demonstrate some unique features of the quantromon like weak dependence of the dispersive shift on the qubit-resonator detuning and intrinsic Purcell protection. In a tunable qubit-frequency device, we show that the dispersive shift ($2\chi/2\pi$) changes by only $0.8$ MHz while the qubit-resonator detuning ($\Delta/2\pi$) is varied between $0.398$ GHz - $3.288$ GHz. We also demonstrate Purcell protection in a second device where we tune the orthogonality between the two modes. Finally, we demonstrate a single-shot readout fidelity of $98.3\%$ without using a parametric amplifier which is comparable to the state-of-the-art and suggests a potential simplification of the measurement circuitry for scaling up quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Detecting quantum steering in networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks promise an unprecedented leap in semi-device-independent communication and security by capitalizing on quantum steering. However, current methods for assessing quantum network steering are constrained to specific cases. In this work, we introduce the network-Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt-like inequality for investigating network steering independent of entanglement source characteristics. We employ this inequality to detect full network steering in both single-node and multinode repeater networks and assess the tolerance of various noise models. Under a specific noise model, our method is used to compute the bound of semi-device-independent communication distance. Through case studies, we also demonstrate that our method, as a semi-device-independent entanglement witness, is more suitable for settings requiring Bell measurements compared to network Bell inequality. These findings open new avenues for broader ways to detect quantum steering independent of entanglement sources.</description>

      <title>System-environmental entanglement in critical spin systems under $ZZ$-decoherence and its relation to strong and weak symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum many-body system exhibits nontrivial behavior under decoherence. In particular, system-environmental entanglement is one of quantities to characterize mixed state properties under decoherence. In this study, we investigate the behavior of the system-environmental entanglement for critical spin chains under nearest-neighbor $ZZ$ -decoherence. We numerically find that the system-environmental entanglement exhibits a specific scaling law including a system-independent universal term ("$g$-function"). For the critical XXZ model, transition to strong-to-weak spontaneously symmetry breaking mixed state takes place. In that case, the $g$-function changes its value at decoherent transition point and gets double the value of system under single-site $Z$-decoherence, which was recently studied by conformal field theory. By studying Shannon entropy, we clarify origin of this $g$-function behavior.</description>

      <title>What are the bearers of hidden states? On an important ambiguity in the formulation of Bell's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell's conclusion from his famous inequality was that any hidden variable theory that satisfies Local Causality is incompatible with the predictions of Quantum Mechanics (QM) for Bell's Experiment. However, Local Causality does not appear in the derivation of Bell's inequality. Instead, two other assumptions are used, namely Factorizability and Settings Independence. Therefore, in order to establish Bell's conclusion, we need to relate these two assumptions to Local Causality. The prospects for doing so turn out to depend on the assumed location of the hidden states that appear in Bell's inequality. In this paper, I consider the following two views on such states: (1) that they are states of the two-particle system at the moment of preparation, and (2) that they are states of thick slices of the past light cones of measurements. I argue that straightforward attempts to establish Bell's conclusion fail in both approaches. Then, I consider three refined attempts, which I also criticise, and I propose a new way of establishing Bell's conclusion that combines intuitions underlying several previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Study the charging performance of frequency modulated quantum batteries inside a dissipative cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the charging dynamics of a frequency-modulated quantum battery (QB) placed within a dissipative cavity environment. Our study focuses on the interaction of such a battery under both weak and strong coupling regimes, employing a model in which the quantum battery and charger are represented as frequency-modulated qubits indirectly coupled through a zero-temperature environment. It is demonstrated that both the modulation frequency and amplitude are crucial for optimizing the charging process and the ergotropy of the quantum battery. Specifically, high-amplitude, low-frequency modulation significantly enhances charging performance and work extraction in the strong coupling regime. As an intriguing result, it is deduced that modulation at very low frequencies leads to the emergence of energy storage and work extraction in the weak coupling regime. Such a result can never be achieved without modulation in the weak coupling regime. These results highlight the importance of adjusting modulation parameters to optimize the performance of quantum batteries for real-world applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-informed Construction of Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a promising tool for simulating ground states of quantum many-body systems on noisy quantum computers. Its effectiveness relies heavily on the ansatz, which must be both hardware-efficient for implementation on noisy hardware and problem-specific to avoid local minima and convergence problems. In this article, we explore entanglement-informed ansatz schemes that naturally emerge from specific models, aiming to balance accuracy with minimal use of two-qubit entangling gates, allowing for efficient use of techniques such as quantum circuit cutting. We focus on three models of quasi-1D Hamiltonians: (i) systems with impurities acting as entanglement barriers, (ii) systems with competing long-range and short-range interactions transitioning from a long-range singlet to a quantum critical state, and (iii) random quantum critical systems. For the first model, we observe a plateau in the ansatz accuracy, controlled by the number of entangling gates between subsystems. This behavior is explained by iterative capture of eigenvalues in the entanglement spectrum. In the second model, combining long-range and short-range entanglement schemes yields the best overall accuracy, leading to global convergence in the entanglement spectrum. For the third model, we use an renormalization group approach to build the short- and long-range entanglement structure of the ansatz. Our comprehensive analysis provides a new perspective on the design of ans\"atze based on the expected entanglement structure of the approximated state.</description>

      <title>Fabry-P\'{e}rot etalon walk-off loss in ring cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabry-P\'erot etalons are widely used for laser frequency control. Inserting them in laser cavities imparts unavoidable walk-off loss and reduces the output power. Here, we treat the technology-relevant case of the walk-off loss of an etalon in a unidirectional ring cavity, which is a standard design of single-frequency lasers. We provide the theory background by discussing the analytic limits. The loss can be efficiently minimized by realignment, or by proper matching of the etalon's surface reflectivity with its refractive index. We numerically calculate the loss in the region uncovered by the analytic limits. We discuss practical laser design considerations, and we perform a tilt-tuning experiment in a single-frequency, solid-state laser setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to generate quantum emitters with reproducible properties in solid-state matrices is crucial for quantum technologies. Here, we show that a high density of close-to-identical single-photon emitters can be created in commercial hexagonal boron nitride using annealing under oxygen atmosphere. This simple procedure yields a uniform in-plane distribution of color centers consistently emitting around 539.4 nm, with a wavelength spread smaller than 1 nm. We present an extensive characterization of their photophysical properties, showing that the emitters are bright and stable, and exhibit narrow lines at low temperatures with minimal spectral diffusion. These characteristics make this family of quantum emitters highly appealing for applications to quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Electric Resonance for Spatially-Resolved Spin Control via Pulsed Optical Excitation in the UV-Visible Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear electric resonance (NER) spectroscopy is currently experiencing a revival as a tool for nuclear spin-based quantum computing. Compared to magnetic or electric fields, local electron density fluctuations caused by changes in the atomic environment provide a much higher spatial resolution for the addressing of nuclear spins in qubit registers or within a single molecule. In this article, we investigate the possibility of coherent spin control in atoms or molecules via nuclear quadrupole resonance from first principles. An abstract, time-dependent description is provided which entails and reflects on commonly applied approximations. This formalism is then used to propose a new method we refer to as `optical' nuclear electric resonance (ONER). It employs pulsed optical excitations in the UV-visible light spectrum to modulate the electric field gradient at the position of a specific nucleus of interest by periodic changes of the surrounding electron density. Possible realizations and limitations of ONER for atomically resolved spin manipulation are discussed and tested on $^9$Be as an atomic benchmark system via electronic structure theory.</description>

      <title>Optimum Efficiency of an Asymmetric Quantum Harmonic Otto Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quantum Otto engine operating with a time-dependent harmonic oscillator as its working material. We consider asymmetry between the two adiabatic processes of the Otto cycle, based on which we explore sudden expansion and sudden compression cases. We find the optimal performance of this asymmetric Otto engine under the Omega function, which represents the balance between the utilized energy and the dissipated energy of an engine. We analyze that for sudden compression stroke, the efficiency approaches unity, while it is only one-half for sudden expansion stroke. Additionally, we notice that the efficiency at the maximum Omega function consistently exceeds the maximum work efficiency in both cases. Further, we present a comparative analysis of symmetric and asymmetric Otto engines for the well-known Omega function. Then, we move our study to calculate the fractional loss of work for both the aforementioned cases. Finally, we find results for the ratio of maximum work and work under maximum Omega function. We show that the work at maximum Omega function produces 98.19\% of maximum work for both sudden compression and sudden expansion strokes.</description>

      <title>Measurement induced phase transition in a quantum Ising model by periodic measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions are often studied in random quantum circuits, with local measurements performed with a certain probability. We present here a model where a global measurement is performed with certainty at every time-step of the measurement protocol. Each time step, therefore, consists of evolution under the transverse Ising Hamiltonian for a time $\tau$, followed by a measurement that provides a ``yes/no'' answer to the question, ``Are all spins up?''. The survival probability after $n$ time-steps is defined as the probability that the answer is ``no'' in all the $n$ time-steps. For various $\tau$ values, we compute the survival probability, entanglement in bipartition, and the generalized geometric measure, a genuine multiparty entanglement, for a chain of size $L \sim 26$, and identify a transition at $\tau_c \sim 0.2$ for field strength $h=1/2$. We then analytically derive a recursion relation that enables us to calculate the survival probability for system sizes up to 1000, which provides evidence of a scaling $\tau_c \sim 1/\sqrt{L}$. The transition at finite \(\tau_c\) for \(L \sim 28\) seems therefore to recede to \(\tau_c = 0\) in the thermodynamic limit. Additionally, at large time-steps, survival probability decays logarithmically only when the ground state of the Hamiltonian is paramagnetic. Such decay is not present when the ground state is ferromagnetic.</description>

      <title>Exponential advantage in continuous-variable quantum state learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the task of learning quantum states in bosonic continuous-variable (CV) systems. We present a concrete experimentally feasible protocol that utilizes entangled measurements and reflected states to enable efficient learning of the characteristic function of CV quantum states with a sample complexity independent of the number of modes $n$. We then prove that any general adaptive learning scheme without entangled measurements requires a sample complexity that is exponential in $n$ to accomplish the same task, demonstrating an exponential advantage provided by entangled measurements. Remarkably, we also prove that any general adaptive entanglement-assisted scheme also requires an exponential sample complexity if access to reflected states is prohibited. Hence, we establish a rigorous exponential advantage from entangled measurements and access to reflected states in learning CV quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model predicts a quadratic mass scaling of its effects but a linear scaling might be more natural according to some Poissonian spontaneous collapse models. Here, we first generalize the CSL master equation so that its mass dependence is a generic function of the mass and show that two key properties, namely compoundation invariance and the decoupling of center-of-mass motion from internal motion, remain valid. Then, by focusing on mass dependence as a power of the mass, we derive approximate formulas for the dynamics of single particles, rigid bodies, and radiation emission. Finally, we explore how the existing lower and upper bounds for the standard CSL translate to this generalized version, finding that a higher mass dependence is unlikely, while a lower one significantly broadens the range of allowed parameters.</description>

      <title>Entropic witness for quantum memory in open system dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of open quantum system are often modeled by non-Markovian processes that account for memory effects arising from interactions with the environment. It is well-known that the memory provided by the environment can be classical or quantum in nature. Remarkably, the quantumness of the memory can be witnessed locally by measurements on the open system alone, without requiring access to the environment. However, existing witnesses are computationally challenging for systems beyond qubits. In this work, we present a tractable criterion for quantum memory based on the von Neumann entropy, which is easily computable for systems of any dimension. Using this witness, we investigate the nature of memory in a class of physically motivated finite-dimensional qudit dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that this criterion is also suitable for detecting quantum memory in continuous-variable systems. As an illustrative example, we analyze non-Markovian Gaussian dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Enhanced Optimization of Noise-Resilient Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a powerful class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms designed to approximate the ground state of a quantum system described by its Hamiltonian. VQEs hold promise for various applications, including lattice field theory. However, the inherent noise of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices poses a significant challenge for running VQEs as these algorithms are particularly susceptible to noise, e.g., measurement shot noise and hardware noise.
  In a recent work, it was proposed to enhance the classical optimization of VQEs with Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Bayesian Optimization, as these machine-learning techniques are well-suited for handling noisy data. In these proceedings, we provide additional insights into this new algorithm and present further numerical experiments. In particular, we examine the impact of hardware noise and error mitigation on the algorithm's performance. We validate the algorithm using classical simulations of quantum hardware, including hardware noise benchmarks, which have not been considered in previous works. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that GP-enhanced algorithms can outperform state-of-the-art baselines, laying the foundation for future research on deploying these techniques to real quantum hardware and lattice field theory setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating robust quantum operations is a major challenge in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era. Recently, the importance of noise-resilient control methods has become more pronounced in the field. Ordinarily, noisy quantum systems are described by the Lindblad equation. However, minimizing noise susceptibility using this equation has proven challenging because of its irreversibility. In this study, we propose a new method for creating robust pulses based on the stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger equation. This equation describes individual noise realizations under any colored noise process, contrary to the Lindblad equation, which describes mean system behavior under white noise. Using stochastic optimal control techniques, our method, Fidelity-Enhanced Variational Quantum Optimal Control (F-VQOC), is able to construct higher fidelity paths than its non-stochastic counterpart (VQOC). By accounting for both environmental noise sources as well as noise sources inherent to the control system, highly significant increases in fidelity are noted for both single and multiqubit state preparations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ultimate quantum limits to the achievable uncertainty in the estimation of the transition frequency between two atomic levels. We focus on Rabi, Ramsey, and coherent population trapping (CPT) techniques, which are widely employed in experiments. We prove that in the Rabi and Ramsey schemes measuring the atomic population allows one to reach the minimum uncertainty, but, for the CPT setup, a measurement involving the coherences between the levels results in a further improvement of the estimation. As a figure of merit, we consider the Fisher information of the population measurement and compare its value to the quantum Fisher information, corresponding to the maximum precision, optimized over all the possible feasible measurements.</description>

      <title>Winning Rates of $(n,k)$ Quantum Coset Monogamy Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the $(n,k)$ Coset Monogamy Game, in which two players must extract complementary information of unequal size ($k$ bits vs. $n-k$ bits) from a random coset state without communicating. The complementary information takes the form of random Pauli-X and Pauli-Z errors on subspace states. Our game generalizes those considered in previous works that deal with the case of equal information size $(k=\frac{n}{2})$. We prove a convex upper bound of the information-theoretic winning rate of the $(n,k)$ Coset Monogamy Game in terms of the subspace rate $R=\frac{k}{n}\in [0,1]$. This bound improves upon previous results for the case of $R=\frac{1}{2}$. We also prove the achievability of an optimal winning probability upper bound for the class of unentangled strategies of the $(n,k)$ Coset Monogamy Game.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit for exponentiation of Hamiltonians: an algorithmic description based on tensor products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponentiation of Hamiltonians refers to a mathematical operation to a Hamiltonian operator, typically in the form e^(-i.t.H), where H is the Hamiltonian and t is a time parameter. This operation is fundamental in quantum mechanics, particularly to evolve quantum systems over time according to the Schrodinger equation.
  In quantum algorithms, such as Adiabatic methods and QAOA, exponentiation enables efficient simulation of a system dynamics.
  It involves constructing quantum circuits that approximate this exponential operation. When H=\sum_(p=1)^n H_p , each H_p is defined using the Pauli operator basis, which includes the well-known X, Y, Z and Id gates, i.e., H_p=U_1\otimes U_2\otimes \otimes U_n and U_k\in{Id,X,Y,Z}. In this article, we explore the exponentiation of H_p, specifically e^(-i.t.U_1 \otimes U_2\otimes \otimes U_n ), by introducing an algorithmic approach. We demonstrate a straightforward and efficient method to construct compact circuits that are easy to implement.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the nonequilibrium fluctuational forces and torques acting on a body either in motion or at rest relative to another body or the thermal vacuum blackbody radiation. For a moving body, a retarding force emerges, called quantum or Casimir friction, which in vacuum was first predicted by Einstein and Hopf in 1907. Moreover, if a stationary body is not in thermal equilibrium with the blackbody vacuum, a self-propulsive force or torque can appear, resulting in a potentially observable linear or angular terminal velocity, even after thermalization.</description>

      <title>Readout-induced leakage of the fluxonium qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersive readout is widely used to perform high-fidelity measurement of superconducting qubits. Much work has been focused on the qubit readout fidelity, which depends on the achievable signal-to-noise ratio and the qubit relaxation time. As groups have pushed to increase readout fidelity by increasing readout photon number, dispersive readout has been shown to strongly affect the post-measurement qubit state. Such effects hinder the effectiveness of quantum error correction, which requires measurements that both have high readout fidelity and are quantum non-demolition (QND). Here, we experimentally investigate non-QND effects in the fluxonium. We map out the state evolution of fluxonium qubits in the presence of resonator photons and observe that these photons induce transitions in the fluxonium both within and outside the qubit subspace. We numerically model our system and find that coupling the fluxonium-resonator system to an external spurious mode is necessary to explain observed non-QND effects.</description>

      <title>A trilinear quantum dot architecture for semiconductor spin qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits hold significant potential for scaling to millions of qubits for practical quantum computing applications, as their structure highly resembles the structure of conventional transistors. Since classical semiconductor manufacturing technology has reached an unprecedented level of maturity, reliably mass-producing CMOS chips with hundreds of billions of components, conventional wisdom dictates that leveraging CMOS technologies for quantum dot qubits can result in upscaled quantum processors with thousands or even millions of interconnected qubits. However, the interconnect requirements for quantum circuits are very different from those for classical circuits, where for each qubit individual control and readout wiring could be needed. Although significant developments have been demonstrated on small scale systems, qubit numbers remain limited, to a large extent due to the lack of scalable qubit interconnect schemes. Here, we present a trilinear quantum dot array that is simple in physical layout while allowing individual wiring to each quantum dot. By means of electron shuttling, the trilinear architecture provides qubit connectivity that is equivalent to or even surpasses that of 2D square lattice. Assuming the current qubit fidelities of small-scale devices can be extrapolated to large-scale arrays, medium-length shuttling arrays on the order of tens of microns would allow million-scale qubit systems, while maintaining manageable overheads. We also present a scalable control scheme, where the qubit chip is 3D-integrated with a low-power switch-based cryoCMOS circuit for parallel qubit operation with limited control inputs. As our trilinear quantum dot array is fully compatible with existing semiconductor technologies, this qubit architecture represents one possible framework for future research and development of large-scale spin qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Superconducting Qubit Performance: A Theoretical Framework for Design, Analysis, and Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a qubit architecture is one of the most critical challenges in achieving scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computing as the performance of a quantum computer is heavily dependent on the coherence times, connectivity and low noise environments. Superconducting qubits have emerged as a frontrunner among many competing technologies, primarily because of their speed of operations, relatively well-developed and offer a promising path toward scalability. Here, we address the challenges of optimizing superconducting qubit hardware through the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework that spans the entire process - from design to the calibration of hardware through quantum gate execution. We develop this framework in four key steps: circuit design, electromagnetic analysis, spectral analysis, and pulse sequencing with calibration. We first refine the qubit's core components - such as capacitance, Josephson junctions, and resonators - to set the foundation for strong performance. The electromagnetic analysis, using the Lumped Oscillator model, allows us to map out the capacitance matrix, ensuring that we minimize spectral dispersion while maximizing coherence times. Following this, we conduct spectral analysis to fine-tune the qubit's frequency spectrum and coherence properties, ensuring that the qubit parameters are optimized. Finally, we focus on pulse sequencing, including pulse-width optimization, DRAG optimization, and randomized benchmarking, to achieve high gate fidelity. We applied this framework to both Transmon and Fluxonium qubits, obtaining results that closely match those found in experimental studies. This work provides a detailed and practical approach to the design, optimization, and calibration of superconducting qubits, contributing to the broader effort to develop scalable quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Ordered Phases using Machine Learning and Classical Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying phase transitions is a fundamental and complex challenge in condensed matter physics. This work proposes a framework for identifying quantum phase transitions by combining classical shadows with unsupervised machine learning. We use the axial next-nearest neighbor Ising model as our benchmark and extend the analysis to the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a two-leg ladder. Even with few qubits, we can effectively distinguish between the different phases of the Hamiltonian models. Moreover, given that we only rely on two-point correlator functions, the classical shadows protocol enables the cost of the analysis to scale logarithmically with the number of qubits, making our approach a scalable and efficient way to study phase transitions in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Anti-scarring from eigenstate stacking in a chaotic spinor condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early-time dynamics of many-body quantum chaotic systems is typically considered non-universal due to the divergence from the predictions of random matrix theory. The eigenstate stacking theorem, on the other hand, asserts uniformity in a phase space for the cumulative probability density of eigenstates that fall within a sufficiently large energy window, opening a route to universality in early times. This fact must hold even in many-body systems. Here, we study a chaotic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, whose quantum scar dynamics has recently been observed in the laboratory. Quantum scars, living densely near an unstable periodic orbit, must be compensated by anti-scarred states populating sparsely there by the virtue of stacking theorem. We find that such anti-scarring is present in this many-particle system by extending the applicability of stacking theorem. Our work uncovers how the quantum scarring of some eigenstates affects the rest of the chaotic and thermal spectrum in quantum systems with many particles.</description>

      <title>A classical model for semiclassical state-counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the type II von Neumann algebras that appear in semiclassical gravity, all states have infinite entropy, but entropy differences are uniquely defined. Akers and I have shown that the entropy difference of microcanonical states has a relative state-counting interpretation in terms of the additional (finite) number of degrees of freedom that are needed to represent the "larger-entropy" state supposing that one already has a representation of the "smaller-entropy" state, and supposing that one is restricted to act with gauge-invariant operators. This short paper explains some of the curious features of relative state-counting by analogy to the classical limit of quantum statistical mechanics. In this analogy the preferred family of renormalized traces becomes the preferred family of symplectic measures on phase space; the trace-index of infinite-dimensional subspaces becomes the ratio of phase space volumes; and the restriction that one must act with gauge-invariant operators becomes the restriction that one must act with symplectomorphisms. Because in the phase-space analogy one has exact control over the quantum deformation away from the classical theory, one can see precisely how the relevant aspects of the classical structure are inherited from the quantum theory -- though even in this simple setting, it is a nontrivial technical task to show how classical symplectomorphisms emerge from the underlying quantum theory in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit.</description>

      <title>Nesting is not Contracting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The default way of proving holographic entropy inequalities is the contraction method. It divides Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surfaces on the `greater than' side of the inequality into segments, then glues the segments into candidate RT surfaces for terms on the `less than' side. Here we discuss how proofs by contraction are constrained and informed by entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) -- the property that enlarging a boundary region can only enlarge its entanglement wedge. We propose that: (i) all proofs by contraction necessarily involve candidate RT surfaces, which violate EWN; (ii) violations of EWN in contraction proofs of maximally tight inequalities occur commonly and -- where this can be quantified -- with maximal density near boundary conditions; (iii) the non-uniqueness of proofs by contraction reflects inequivalent ways of violating EWN. As evidence and illustration, we study the recently discovered infinite families of holographic entropy inequalities, which are associated with tessellations of the torus and the projective plane. We explain the logic, which underlies their proofs by contraction. We find that all salient aspects of the requisite contraction maps are dictated by EWN while all their variable aspects set the scheme for how to violate EWN. We comment on whether the tension between EWN and contraction maps might help in characterizing maximally tight holographic entropy inequalities.</description>

      <title>End-to-end physics-based modeling of laser-activated color centers in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers are among the most promising candidates for quantum information processing. Central requirements for their practical applications include controlled and efficient local activation in nanophotonic devices and identical spectral features. However, producing color centers in a controlled and reliable way is inherently challenging due to the lack of comprehensive theoretical insights into their formation and the difficulty of streamlining the generation process for rapid in-situ optimization. We address these challenges by developing an end-to-end first-principles model that captures the underlying formation process of color centers. Emitters are activated through laser annealing, which allows for in-situ creation and the possibility of model-based control. Notably, our model enables the estimation of the emitters' inhomogeneous broadening down to 16 GHz in bare silicon, which translates into the creation of emitters with highly similar spectral properties. Finally, we address the challenge of in-situ deterministic activation of color centers in nanophotonic devices by going beyond bare silicon and demonstrating successful laser writing in photonic crystal optical cavities. These results lay the foundation for deterministic and large-scale integration of color centers within quantum photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Emergent multifractality in power-law decaying eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality is of significant interest with potential applications in various fields of quantum physics. Most of the previous studies concentrated on fine-tuned quantum models to realize multifractality which is generally believed to be a critical phenomenon and fragile to random perturbations. In this work, we propose a set of generic principles based on the power-law decay of the eigenstates which allow us to distinguish a fractal phase from a genuine multifractal phase. We demonstrate the above principles in a 1d tight-binding model with inhomogeneous nearest-neighbor hopping that can be mapped to the standard quantum harmonic oscillator via energy-coordinate duality. We analytically calculate the fractal dimensions and the spectrum of fractal dimensions which are in agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space, where optimization is extremely slow with state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo methods. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3\% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5\% for much harder planted-solution instances, all in less than one hour per instance. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $&lt;$1\% and approximation ratios of about 72-88\%. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</description>

      <title>Spectral tuning and nanoscale localization of single color centers in silicon via controllable strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a `digital twin' physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.</description>

      <title>Singularity and universality from von Neumann to R\'enyi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The R\'enyi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as $n \to 1$ is often believed to give rise to the celebrated von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, this process for the colored Motzkin spin chain exhibits a singularity that yields different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies, respectively. It can be understood by the exponential increasing desity of states in its entanglement spectrum. We have also employed disorder operators under various symmetries to study such a system. The analytical and numerical results reveal that the scaling of disorder operators is also $\log{l}$ in the leading term, the same as the R\'enyi entanglement entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ $l$ is a universal constant, both in R\'enyi entropies and disorder operators, which could be used to identify the constraint physics of Motzkin walks.</description>

      <title>Bounding multifractality by observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractal dimensions have been used as a quantitative measure for structure of eigenstates of quantum many-body systems, useful for comparison to random matrix theory predictions or to distinguish many-body localized systems from chaotic ones. For chaotic systems at midspectrum the states are expected to be ``ergodic'', infinite temperature states with all fractal dimensions approaching 1 in the thermodynamic limit. However, when moving away from midspectrum, the states develop structure, as they are expected to follow the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, with few-body observables predicted by a finite-temperature ensemble. We discuss how this structure of the observables can be used to bound the fractal dimensions from above, thus explaining their typical arc-shape over the energy spectrum. We then consider how such upper bounds act as a proxy for the fractal dimension over the many-body localization transition, thus formally connecting the single-particle and Fock space pictures discussed in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale objects moving relative to a thermal radiation bath experience a drag force due to the imbalance in their interaction with the blue- and redshifted components of the electromagnetic field. Here, we show that, in addition to this drag force, moving nanostructures with an anisotropic optical response experience a lateral force and a torque that substantially modify their trajectory. These phenomena emerge from the additional coupling between the electromagnetic field components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the trajectory, enabled by the anisotropic response of the nanostructure. This work unveils the intricate dynamics of anisotropic nanostructures moving in a thermal radiation bath.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theories: a variational approach to $\mathbb{D}_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of a resource-efficient formulation of non-Abelian LGTs by focusing on the difficulty of simulating fermionic degrees of freedom and the Hilbert space redundancy. First, we show a procedure that removes the matter and improves the efficiency of the hardware resources. We demonstrate it for the simplest non-Abelian group addressable with this procedure, $\mathbb{D}_8$, both in the cases of one (1D) and two (2D) spatial dimensions. Then, with the objective of running a variational quantum simulation on real quantum hardware, we map the $\mathbb{D}_8$ lattice gauge theory onto qudit systems with local interactions. We propose a variational scheme for the qudit system with a local Hamiltonian, which can be implemented on a universal qudit quantum device as the one developed in $\href{https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-022-01658-0}{[Nat. Phys. 18, 1053 (2022)]}$. Our results show the effectiveness of the matter-removing procedure, solving the redundancy problem and reducing the amount of quantum resources. This can serve as a way of simulating lattice gauge theories in high spatial dimensions, with non-Abelian gauge groups, and including dynamical fermions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Estimation of the Stokes Vector Rotation for a General Polarimetric Transformation</title>

Abstract: Classical polarimetry is a well-established discipline with diverse applications across different branches of science. The burgeoning interest in leveraging quantum resources to achieve highly sensitive measurements has spurred researchers to elucidate the behavior of polarized light within a quantum mechanical framework, thereby fostering the development of a quantum theory of polarimetry. In this work, drawing inspiration from polarimetric investigations in biological tissues, we investigate the precision limits of polarization rotation angle estimation about a known rotation axis, in a quantum polarimetric process, comprising three distinct quantum channels. The rotation angle to be estimated is induced by the retarder channel on the Stokes vector of the probe state. The diattenuator and depolarizer channels, acting on the probe state, can be thought of as effective noise processes. We explore the precision constraints inherent in quantum polarimetry by evaluating the quantum Fisher information for probe states of significance in quantum metrology, namely NOON, Kings of Quantumness, and Coherent states. The effects of the noise channels as well as their ordering is analyzed on the estimation error of the rotation angle to characterize practical and optimal quantum probe states for quantum polarimetry. Furthermore, we propose an experimental framework tailored for NOON state quantum polarimetry, aiming to bridge theoretical insights with empirical validation.</description>

      <title>Minimising surface-code failures using a color-code decoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of practical, high-performance decoding algorithms reduces the resource cost of fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we propose a decoder for the surface code that finds low-weight correction operators for errors produced by the depolarising noise model. The decoder is obtained by mapping the syndrome of the surface code onto that of the color code, thereby allowing us to adopt more sophisticated color-code decoding algorithms. Analytical arguments and exhaustive testing show that the resulting decoder can find a least-weight correction for all weight $d/2$ depolarising errors for even code distance $d$. This improves the logical error rate by an exponential factor $O(2^{d/2})$ compared with decoders that treat bit-flip and dephasing errors separately. We demonstrate this improvement with analytical arguments and supporting numerical simulations at low error rates. Of independent interest, we also demonstrate an exponential improvement in logical error rate for our decoder used to correct independent and identically distributed bit-flip errors affecting the color code compared with more conventional color-code decoding algorithms.</description>

      <title>Computing the gradients with respect to all parameters of a quantum neural network using a single circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding gradients is a crucial step in training machine learning models. For quantum neural networks, computing gradients using the parameter-shift rule requires evaluating the cost function twice for each adjustable parameter in the network. When the total number of parameters is large, the quantum circuit must be repeatedly adjusted and executed, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel approach that computes all gradients using only a single circuit, significantly reducing both the circuit depth and the number of classical registers required. We experimentally validate our approach on both quantum simulators and IBM's real quantum hardware, demonstrating that our method significantly reduces circuit compilation time compared to the conventional approach, resulting in a substantial speedup in total runtime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate many-body dynamics where the evolution is governed by unitary circuits through the lens of `Krylov complexity', a recently proposed measure of complexity and quantum chaos. We extend the formalism of Krylov complexity to unitary circuit dynamics and focus on Floquet circuits arising as the Trotter decomposition of Hamiltonian dynamics. For short Trotter steps the results from Hamiltonian dynamics are recovered, whereas a large Trotter step results in different universal behavior characterized by the existence of local maximally ergodic operators: operators with vanishing autocorrelation functions, as exemplified in dual-unitary circuits. These operators exhibit maximal complexity growth, act as a memoryless bath for the dynamics, and can be directly probed in current quantum computing setups. These two regimes are separated by a crossover in chaotic systems. Conversely, we find that free integrable systems exhibit a nonanalytic transition between these different regimes, where maximally ergodic operators appear at a critical Trotter step.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the time evolution of quantum entanglement in presence of non-collapsing interactions. In particular, the entanglement between the products of a muon decay in a magnetic field is revisited. It results from angular momentum conservation and leads to an anomaly in the measured muon g factor in precise agreement with that reported by the Brookhaven and Fermilab experiments.</description>

Abstract: Trotterization in quantum mechanics is an important theoretical concept in handling the exponential of noncommutative operators. In this communication, we give a mathematical formulation of the Trotter Product Formula, and apply it to basic examples in which the utility of Trotterization is evident. Originally, this article was completed in December 2020 as a report under the mentorship of Esteban C\'ardenas for the University of Texas at Austin Mathematics Directed Reading Program (DRP). However, the relevance of Trotterization in reducing quantum circuit complexity has warranted the release of a revised and more formal version of the original. Thus, we present a mathematical perspective on Trotterization, including a detailed sketch of a formal proof of the Trotter Product Formula.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds for antidistinguishability and circulant sets of pure quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of pure quantum states is said to be antidistinguishable if upon sampling one at random, there exists a measurement to perfectly determine some state that was not sampled. We show that antidistinguishability of a set of $n$ pure states is equivalent to a property of its Gram matrix called $(n-1)$-incoherence, thus establishing a connection with quantum resource theories that lets us apply a wide variety of new tools to antidistinguishability. As a particular application of our result, we present an explicit formula (not involving any semidefinite programming) that determines whether or not a set with a circulant Gram matrix is antidistinguishable. We also show that if all inner products are smaller than $\sqrt{(n-2)/(2n-2)}$ then the set must be antidistinguishable, and we show that this bound is tight when $n \leq 4$. We also give a simpler proof that if all the inner products are strictly larger than $(n-2)/(n-1)$, then the set cannot be antidistinguishable, and we show that this bound is tight for all $n$.</description>

      <title>Measurement incompatibility at all remote parties do not always permit Bell nonlocality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two important ingredients necessary for obtaining Bell nonlocal correlations between two spatially separated parties are an entangled state shared between them and an incompatible set of measurements employed by each of them. We focus on the relation of Bell nonlocality with incompatibility of the set of measurements employed by both the parties, in the two-input and two-output scenario. We first observe that Bell nonlocality can always be established when both parties employ any set of incompatible projective measurements. On the other hand, going beyond projective measurements, we present a class of incompatible positive operator-valued measures, employed by both the observers, which can never activate Bell nonlocality. Furthermore, we find a sufficient criterion for achieving Bell nonlocal correlations given a fixed amount of pure two-qubit entanglement and a fixed amount of incompatibility of projective measurements applied by either both parties or a single party.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality enhanced precision in quantum polarimetry via entangled photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonlocal quantum approach is presented to polarimetry, leveraging the phenomenon of entanglement in photon pairs to enhance the precision in sample property determination. By employing two distinct channels, one containing the sample of interest and the other serving as a reference, the conditions are explored under which the inherent correlation between entangled photons can increase measurement sensitivity. Specifically, we calculate the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and compare the accuracy and sensitivity for the cases of single sample channel versus two channel quantum state tomography measurements. The theoretical results are verified by experimental analysis. The theoretical and experimental framework demonstrates that the nonlocal strategy enables enhanced precision and accuracy in extracting information about sample characteristics more than the local measurements. Depending on the chosen estimators and noise channels present, theoretical and experimental results show that noise-induced bias decreases the precision for the estimated parameter. Such a quantum-enhanced nonlocal polarimetry holds promise for advancing diverse fields including material science, biomedical imaging, and remote sensing, via high-precision measurements through quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Efficient learning of quantum states prepared with few fermionic non-Gaussian gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimental realization of increasingly complex quantum states underscores the pressing need for new methods of state learning and verification. In one such framework, quantum state tomography, the aim is to learn the full quantum state from data obtained by measurements. Without prior assumptions on the state, this task is prohibitively hard. Here, we present an efficient algorithm for learning states on $n$ fermion modes prepared by any number of Gaussian and at most $t$ non-Gaussian gates. By Jordan-Wigner mapping, this also includes $n$-qubit states prepared by nearest-neighbour matchgate circuits with at most $t$ SWAP-gates. Our algorithm is based exclusively on single-copy measurements and produces a classical representation of a state, guaranteed to be close in trace distance to the target state. The sample and time complexity of our algorithm is $\mathrm{poly}(n,2^t)$; thus if $t=O(\log(n))$, it is efficient. We also show that, if $t$ scales slightly more than logarithmically, any learning algorithm to solve the same task must be inefficient, under common cryptographic assumptions. We also provide an efficient property testing algorithm that, given access to copies of a state, determines whether such a state is far or close to the set of states for which our learning algorithm works. In addition to the outputs of quantum circuits, our tomography algorithm is efficient for some physical target states, such as those arising in time dynamics and low-energy physics of impurity models. Beyond tomography, our work sheds light on the structure of states prepared with few non-Gaussian gates and offers an improved upper bound on their circuit complexity, enabling an efficient circuit compilation method.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) harnesses quantum systems to tackle intricate computational problems with exceptional efficiency and minimized energy usage. This paper presents a QRC framework that utilizes a minimalistic quantum reservoir, consisting of only a few two-level atoms within an optical cavity. The system is inherently scalable, as newly added atoms automatically couple with the existing ones through the shared cavity field. We demonstrate that the quantum reservoir outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks, namely the prediction of time-series data using the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results show significant performance improvements with an increasing number of atoms, facilitated by non-destructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques. These findings confirm the potential of QRC as a practical and efficient solution to addressing complex computational challenges in quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Deviations from random matrix entanglement statistics for kicked quantum chaotic spin-$1/2$ chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly expected that for quantum chaotic many body systems, the statistical properties approach those of random matrices when increasing the system size. We demonstrate for various kicked spin-1/2 chain models that the average eigenstate entanglement indeed approaches the random matrix result. However, the distribution of the eigenstate entanglement differs significantly. While for autonomous systems such deviations are expected, they are surprising for the more scrambling kicked systems. Similar deviations occur in a tensor-product random matrix model with all-to-all interactions. Therefore, we attribute the origin of the deviations for the kicked spin-chain models to the tensor-product structure of the Hilbert spaces. As a consequence, this would mean that such many body systems cannot be described by the standard random matrix ensembles.</description>

      <title>TCL6 and Beyond: Late-Time Resummations, Asymptotic Inflation and Time Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article examines late-time resummations of perturbative master equations, and finds asymptotic inflation in quantum dynamics generators when environmental correlations decay algebraically with time. We utilize the time-convolutionless master equation (TCL), which we compute perturbatively as TCL2$n$, where 2$n$ is the order in the expansion in time-ordered cumulants. We introduce Hadamarded time-ordered cumulants and classify them by their late-time growth. In the unbiased spin boson model (SBM), we find a maximum order of the expansion $n_{\text{max}}=\lceil s+1\rceil $ above which the dynamics has {\it no} Markovian limit, resulting in the precision limit of the reduced states of $O(\lambda^{2\lceil s\rceil})$. $s$ is the exponent in the power law of the spectral density versus frequency at zero frequency and $\lambda$ is the dimensionless weak-coupling constant. We perform resummation of the leading cumulants in TCL2$n$, resulting in a new master equation with renormalized Bohr frequencies (rTCL). The frequency shifts include the imaginary decoherence rates and nonlocal spectral overlaps (F\"orsters resonances). The inflation rate in the unbiased SBM is temperature independent and equal to the decoherence rate $\nu_2$, leading to the time limit for the validity of master equations of $t_L\approx (s+1)/\nu_2$. rTCL can be regularized by analytic continuation, resulting in a highly accurate Markovian approximation respecting the precision limit. Only if the environmental correlations decay exponentially with time, the resummation generator have a Markovian limit below a threshold $\lambda$, in both biased and unbiased SBM.</description>

      <title>Cheaper and more noise-resilient quantum state preparation using eigenvector continuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subspace methods are powerful, noise-resilient methods that can effectively prepare ground states on quantum computers. The challenge is to get a subspace with a small condition number that spans the states of interest using minimal quantum resources. In this work, we will use eigenvector continuation (EC) to build a subspace from the low-lying states of a set of Hamiltonians. The basis vectors are prepared using truncated versions of standard state preparation methods such as imaginary time evolution (ITE)\an{,} adiabatic state preparation (ASP)\an{, and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)}. By using these truncated methods combined with eigenvector continuation, we can directly improve upon them, obtaining more accurate ground state energies at a reduced cost. We use several spin systems to demonstrate convergence even when methods like ITE and ASP fail, such as ASP in the presence of level crossings and ITE with vanishing energy gaps. We also showcase the noise resilience of this approach beyond the gains already made by having shallower quantum circuits.

      <title>Quantum fingerprints of self-organization in spin chains coupled to a Kuramoto model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet theory is a widely used framework to describe the dynamics of periodically-driven quantum systems. The usual set up to describe such kind of systems is to consider the effect of an external control with a definite period in time that can act either globally or locally on the system of interest. However, besides the periodicity, there is no classical correlation or other well defined structures in the drive. In this work, we consider drives that exhibit self-organization phenomena reaching periodic steady states with emergent symmetries. To substantiate our results, we consider two examples of a one-dimensional quantum spin chains in a transverse field coupled to a classical Kuramoto model. In the case of all-to-tall coupling, the Kuramoto model drives the Ising chain into a time-periodic steady state with an emergent translational symmetry. For a Kuramoto model in a Zig-zag lattice, the XX spin chain is trimerized and the dynamics exhibit topological behavior that can be exploited to perform topological pumping. Our results can be experimentally implemented in near-term quantum devices in digital and analog platforms.</description>

      <title>Pauli Decomposition via the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decomposition of a square matrix into a sum of Pauli strings is a classical pre-processing step required to realize many quantum algorithms. Such a decomposition requires significant computational resources for large matrices. We present an exact and explicit formula for the Pauli string coefficients which inspires an efficient algorithm to compute them. More specifically, we show that up to a permutation of the matrix elements, the decomposition coefficients are related to the original matrix by a multiplication of a generalised Hadamard matrix. This allows one to use the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform and calculate all Pauli decomposition coefficients in $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ time and using $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional memory, for an $N\times N$ matrix. A numerical implementation of our equation outperforms currently available solutions.</description>

Abstract: In previous work we have proposed a construction of quantum-like bits that could endow a large synchronizing classical system, for example of oscillators, with quantum-like function that is not compromised by decoherence. In the present paper we investigate further this platform of quantum-like states. Firstly, we discuss a general protocol on how to construct classical synchronizing networks that allow for emergent states. We then study how gates can be implemented on those states. This suggests the possibility of quantum-like information processing on a special class of many-body classical systems. Finally, we show that our approach allows for non-Kolmogorov interference, a feature that separates our model from a classical probabilistic system. This paper aims to explore the mathematical structure of quantum-like resources distilled from classical synchronizing systems, and shows how arbitrary gates can be implemented by manipulating many-body correlations.</description>

      <title>Effects of phase-gradient on the nonadiabatic dynamics and photon-phonon conversion in one-dimensional array of optomechanical cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manipulation of photonic and phononic coupling in the coupled resonators plays a crucial role in nonreciprocal devices and quantum transduction. In this work, we theoretically investigated how the phase of a driving laser introduces the phase-dependent coupling between photonic and phononic modes and affects the nonadiabatic dynamics of the eigenmodes and photon-phonon conversion in an array of coupled optomechanical cavities. We analyze the band structure of eigenmodes and show that the quick transfer of population between the eigenmodes takes place at the minimum energy gap, which can also be controlled via phase of the driving laser. We further show that the eigenmodes constitute the superposition of photonic and phononic modes, resulting from the optomechanical coupling between these modes. Moreover, the phase also enables the switching of the relative weights of photons and phonons in the eigenmodes. Finally, we investigate the effects of phase on the coherent conversion of photon-phonon in a finite-size array.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for the Advection-Diffusion Equation by Direct Block Encoding of the Time-Marching Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum algorithm for simulating multidimensional scalar transport problems using a time-marching strategy is presented. A direct unitary block encoding of the explicit time-marching operator is constructed, resulting in the intrinsic success probability of the squared solution norm without the need for amplitude amplification, thereby retaining a linear dependence on the simulation time. The algorithm separates the explicit time-marching operator into an advection-like component and a corrective shift operator. The advection-like component is mapped to a Hamiltonian simulation and combined with the shift operator through the linear combination of unitaries algorithm. State-vector simulations of a scalar transported in a steady two-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex support the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: The Dzyaloshinskii-Lifshitz-Pitaevskii (DLP) theory of Casimir forces predicts a repulsion between two material surfaces separated by a third medium with an intermediate dielectric function. This DLP repulsion paradigm constitutes an important example with many applications. We show here that it is broken when the surfaces interact across salted water due to the nonlocal response of the ions in solution. We consider the interaction between silica and gold and show that the zero-frequency contribution, which is the only one affected by the nonlocal response, is dominant for distances in the range near $100\,{\rm nm}$ and beyond. As a result, the total Casimir force between gold and silica surfaces in salted water is always attractive in spite of the DLP repulsion paradigm.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Errors in Analog Quantum Simulation by Hamiltonian Reshaping or Hamiltonian Rescaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating quantum many-body systems is crucial for advancing physics but poses substantial challenges for classical computers. Quantum simulations overcome these limitations, with analog simulators offering unique advantages over digital methods, such as lower systematic errors and reduced circuit depth, making them efficient for studying complex quantum phenomena. However, unlike their digital counterparts, analog quantum simulations face significant limitations due to the absence of effective error mitigation techniques. This work introduces two novel error mitigation strategies -- Hamiltonian reshaping and Hamiltonian rescaling -- in analog quantum simulation for tasks like eigen-energy evaluation. Hamiltonian reshaping uses random unitary transformations to generate new Hamiltonians with identical eigenvalues but varied eigenstates, allowing error reduction through averaging. Hamiltonian rescaling mitigates errors by comparing eigenvalue estimates from energy-scaled Hamiltonians. Numerical calculations validate both methods, demonstrating their significant practical effectiveness in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Token Obfuscation via Superposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances, traditional cryptographic security measures, including token obfuscation, face increasing vulnerability to quantum attacks. This paper presents a quantum-enhanced approach to token obfuscation that leverages quantum superposition and multi-basis verification to establish a resilient defense against such threats. In this method, tokens are encoded in superposition states, ensuring probabilistic concealment until measured, significantly increasing the computational difficulty of unauthorized reconstruction. A quantum decay protocol and a refresh mechanism are introduced to dynamically manage the token lifecycle, mitigating risks associated with prolonged token exposure and replay attacks. Experimental validation confirms the robustness of this approach, demonstrating an entropy quality score of 0.9996, a 0% success rate across five adversarial attack models, and an estimated false positive rate of 67%, highlighting the system's strict security constraints. These results validate the feasibility of quantum-based token obfuscation as a post-quantum cryptographic framework. By integrating dynamic token evolution, entropy-driven state transformations, and multi-basis verification, this approach provides a foundation for future quantum-secure authentication and access control mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Tight Sample Complexity Bounds for Parameter Estimation Under Quantum Differential Privacy for Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This short note provides tight upper and lower bounds for minimal number of samples (copies of quantum states) required to attain a prescribed accuracy (measured by error variance) for scalar parameters using unbiased estimators under quantum local differential privacy for qubits. In the small privacy budget $\epsilon$ regime, i.e., $\epsilon\ll 1$, the sample complexity scales as $\Theta(\epsilon^{-2})$. This bound matches that of classical parameter estimation under differential privacy. The lower bound loosens (converges to zero) in the large privacy budget regime, i.e., $\epsilon\gg 1$, but that case is not particularly interesting as tight bounds for parameter estimation in the noiseless case are widely known. That being said, extensions to systems with higher dimensions and tightening the bounds for the large privacy budget regime are interesting avenues for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling describes the rapid spread of initially localized information across an entire quantum many-body system through entanglement generation. Once scrambled, the original local information becomes encoded globally, inaccessible from any single subsystem. In this work, we introduce a protocol that enables information scrambling into the past, allowing decoding even before the original information is generated. This protocol is achieved by simulating a closed timelike curve (a theoretical construct in which particles can traverse backward in time) using probabilistic methods. Remarkably, we find that stronger scrambling dynamics enhance the fidelity of the decoding process. We further present a quantum circuit design and experimentally implement our protocol on cloud-based Quantinuum and IBM quantum computers. Our approach illuminates a unique quantum task: retrieving information encoded in the future without altering the past.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time dynamics of spin-injected, electrically contacted quantum dots were investigated with a focus on the time evolution of photon statistics. Photon statistics can provide insights into whether the device functions as an effective single-photon emitter or exhibits higher-order emissions. Through these investigations, we found that the shape of the electrical excitation pulse has a direct impact on photon statistics. Specifically, the rising edge of the pulse corresponds to a significantly higher number of higher-order photon states, which decay much faster than single photons associated with the falling edge of the electrical pulse. This relationship implies that the pulse shape can be tailored to optimize the device as either a better single-photon source or a generator of higher-order photon states, with potential applications in creating deterministic higher-order photon Fock states. The ability to easily modify the pulse shape is a unique feature of electrically excited quantum dots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of scalable and robust quantum computing necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the inherent challenges of qubit connectivity, decoherence, and susceptibility to noise and crosstalk. Conventional monochromatic qubit coupling architectures, constrained by nearest-neighbor interactions and limited algorithmic flexibility, exacerbate these issues, hindering the realization of practical large-scale quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a paradigm leveraging a space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurface to enable polychromatic qubit coupling. This metasurface facilitates frequency-selective interactions, transforming nearest-neighbor connectivity into all-to-all qubit interactions, while significantly enhancing coherence, noise robustness, and entanglement fidelity. Our proposed approach capitalizes on the unique capabilities of space-time-modulated Josephson metasurfaces, including dynamic four-dimensional wave manipulation, nonreciprocal state transmission, and state-frequency conversion, to mediate multi-frequency qubit interactions. By isolating qubit couplings into distinct spectral channels, the cryogenic-compatible metasurface mitigates crosstalk and environmental decoherence, extending coherence times and preserving quantum state fidelity. Full-wave simulations and quantum performance analyses demonstrate a significant enhancement in the operational efficiency of a superconducting qubit array, showcasing improved connectivity, robustness, and entanglement stability. This study establishes the potential of space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurfaces as a transformative platform for next-generation quantum computing, addressing critical bottlenecks and paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiative linewidth of a two-level emitter (TLE) ultimately determines the bandwidth it can offer for quantum information processing. However, no prior experiment has so far been performed to examine the effect of driving detuning on indistinguishability of photons scattered off a TLE, a parameter that is crucial for photonic quantum computing. Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference experiments between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. Our results suggest that indistinguishability among photons scattered off a quantum dot is inherently insensitive to the driving laser's detuning, as straightforwardly predicted by the resonance fluorescence model that systematically treats all scattered photons as spontaneous emission.</description>

      <title>Revealing Symmetry-Broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A coherent theory for the superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for charge density of electrons and/or holes as revealed by the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The SODTs act as resistance-free superhighways and are correlated to the Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be represented by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC predicted by DFT. The present work highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are embedded within the bulk materials and are easily destroyed by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (T_C). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk materials, maintaining SODTs' stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher T_C. The present approach is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the presently predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor of YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.</description>

      <title>Rotational Superradiance in a Time-Reversal Symmetry-Broken Quantum Gas inside an Optical Cavity</title>

Abstract: Appearance of quantized vortices in a superfluid and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) stems from their nontrivial response to broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Here we show that breaking of the TRS by, for example, rotation or an external synthetic magnetic field in a transversely-driven BEC coupled to a single mode of an optical cavity modifies drastically Dicke-superradiance and self-ordering phenomena in this system. In particular, photon scattering from the pump laser into the cavity is amplified by the rotational motion of the BEC, leading to so-called 'rotational superradiance' - in a loose analogy to black-hole physics - with distinct critical scaling properties. Another notable finding is that cavity photons mediate long-range, periodic attractive interactions among the vortices, which compete with pair-wise logarithmic repulsive vortex interactions and deform the Abrikosov triangular vortex lattice favoring a stripe-like pattern. Remarkably, the rotation of the BEC and topological properties of the vortex lattice can be monitored nondestructively through the cavity output field.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamical generation of randomness in Brownian systems as a function of the degree of locality of the Hamiltonian. We first express the trace distance to a unitary design for these systems in terms of an effective equilibrium thermal partition function, and provide a set of conditions that guarantee a linear time to design. We relate the trace distance to design to spectral properties of the time-evolution operator. We apply these considerations to the Brownian $p$-SYK model as a function of the degree of locality $p$. We show that the time to design is linear, with a slope proportional to $1/p$. We corroborate that when $p$ is of order the system size this reproduces the behavior of a completely non-local Brownian model of random matrices. For the random matrix model, we reinterpret these results from the point of view of classical Brownian motion in the unitary manifold. Therefore, we find that the generation of randomness typically persists for exponentially long times in the system size, even for systems governed by highly non-local time-dependent Hamiltonians. We conjecture this to be a general property: there is no efficient way to generate approximate Haar random unitaries dynamically, unless a large degree of fine-tuning is present in the ensemble of time-dependent Hamiltonians. We contrast the slow generation of randomness to the growth of quantum complexity of the time-evolution operator. Using known bounds on circuit complexity for unitary designs, we obtain a lower bound determining that complexity grows at least linearly in time for Brownian systems. We argue that these bounds on circuit complexity are far from tight and that complexity grows at a much faster rate, at least for non-local systems.</description>

      <title>Signatures of gravitational wave memory in the radiative process of entangled quantum probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we examine entangled quantum probes in geodesic trajectories in a flat background with a gravitational wave (GW) burst. In particular, these quantum probes are prepared initially either in the symmetric or anti-symmetric Bell's states, and we study the radiative process as the GW burst passes. We split a generic GW burst into two profiles with and without memory. GW burst with (without) memory profiles have different (similar) asymptotic strains between early and late times. We observe that for eternal switching, there is a finite change in the collective atomic transition rate due to the memory part of the GW burst, while the contribution from the without memory counterpart vanishes. We also consider finite Gaussian switching and observe characteristic differences in the radiative process between the GW backgrounds with and without memory. Notably, if the Gaussian switching is peaked much later compared to the passing of GW, only the memory part contributes to the radiative process. Thus, although examined in a simplified set-up, our findings suggest the potential to distinguish bursts with and without GW memory based on the radiative process of entangled detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As of now, the phenomenological classical Landau-Lifshitz (LL) damping of magnetic order is not conceptually linked to the quantum theory of dissipation of the Lindbladian formalism which is unsatisfactory for the booming research on magnetic dynamics. Here, it is shown that LL dynamics can be systematically derived from Lindbladian dynamics in a local mean-field theory for weak external fields. The derivation also extends the LL dynamics beyond the orientation $\vec{m}/|\vec{m}|$ to the length $|\vec{m}|$ of the magnetization. A key assumption is that the Lindbladian dissipation adapts to the non-equilibrium $H(t)$ instantaneously to lower its expectation value.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks enable the calculation of turbulence probability distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a "tensor network" (TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.</description>

      <title>Photon counting statistics in Gaussian bosonic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statistics of transmitted photons in microwave cavities play a foundational role in microwave quantum optics and its technological applications. By utilizing quantum mechanical phase-space methods, we here develop a general theory of the photon counting statistics in Gaussian bosonic networks consisting of driven cavities with beamsplitter interactions and two-mode-squeezing. The dynamics of the network can be captured by a Lyapunov equation for the covariance matrix of the cavity fields, which generalizes to a Riccati equation, when counting fields are included. By solving the Riccati equation, we obtain the statistics of emitted and absorbed photons as well as the time-dependent correlations encoded in waiting time distributions and second-order coherence functions. To illustrate our theoretical framework, we first apply it to a simple linear network consisting of two coupled cavities, for which we evaluate the photon cross-correlations and discuss connections between the photon emission statistics and the entanglement between the cavities. We then consider a bosonic circulator consisting of three coupled cavities, for which we investigate how a synthetic flux may affect the direction of the photon flow, similarly to recent experiments. Our general framework paves the way for systematic investigations of the photon counting statistics in Gaussian bosonic networks.</description>

      <title>Exploring van der Waals cuprate superconductors using a hybrid microwave circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of two-dimensional van der Waals materials is a frontier of condensed matter physics and quantum devices. However, characterizing such materials remains challenging due to the limitations of bulk material techniques, necessitating the development of specialized methods. In this study, we investigate the superconducting properties of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x flakes by integrating them with a hybrid superconducting microwave resonator. The hybrid resonator is significantly modified by the interaction with the flake while maintaining a high quality factor. We also observe a significant upshift of the resonator frequency with increasing temperature, as well as a positive nonlinearity. These effects originate from a presently unknown microscopic mechanism within the flake, and can be modeled as a two-level system bath interacting with the resonant mode. Our findings open a path for high quality hybrid circuits with van der Waals flakes for exploring novel materials and developing new devices for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Insights from the exact analytical solution of periodically driven transverse field Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact analytical expression at stroboscopic intervals for the time-dependent wave function of a class of integrable quantum many-body systems, driven by the periodic delta-kick protocol. To investigate long-time dynamics, we use the wave function to obtain an exact analytical expression for the expectation values of the defect density, magnetization, residual energy, fidelity, and the correlation function after the $n$th drive cycle. Periodically driven integrable closed quantum systems absorb energy, and the long-time universal dynamics are described by the periodic generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We demonstrate that the expectation values of all observables are divided into two parts: one highly oscillatory term that depends on the drive cycle n, and the rest of the terms are independent of it. Typically, the $n$-independent part constitutes the saturation at large n and periodic GGE. The contribution from the highly oscillatory term vanishes in large $n$. We also generalize our formalism to include square pulse and sinusoidal driving protocols.</description>

      <title>Winding Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their ubiquity, a systematic classification of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s), remains a significant unsolved problem. In this article, we characterize the Abelian eigenvalue topology of generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s for arbitrary $n$. The former and the latter emerge in a $(2n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-dimensional parameter space, respectively. By introducing topological invariants called resultant winding numbers, we elucidate that these EP$n$s are stable due to topology of a map from a base space (momentum or parameter space) to a sphere defined by resultants. In a $D$-dimensional parameter space ($D\geq c$), the resultant winding number topologically characterize a $(D-c)$-dimensional manifold of generic [symmetry-protected] EP$n$s whose codimension is $c=2n-2$ [$c=n-1$]. Our framework implies fundamental doubling theorems for both generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s in $n$-band models.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible operators in one, two, and three dimensions via gauging spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatially modulated symmetries have emerged since the discovery of fractons, which characterize unconventional topological phases with mobility-constrained quasiparticle excitations. On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones. Our work provides a unified and systematic analytical framework for constructing exotic duality defects by gauging relevant symmetries.</description>

Abstract: $\mathbb{Z}_3$ lattice gauge theory is the simplest discrete gauge theory with three-quark bound states, i.e., baryons. Since it has a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, it can be used for testing quantum simulation of lattice gauge theory at nonzero baryon density. We discuss global and local gauge symmetries and their importance in quantum simulation. We perform quantum emulator calculation and demonstrate how to study the ground state property of baryonic matter.</description>

      <title>Almost Strong Zero Modes at Finite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.
  However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The FL*-FL quantum phase transition, and the influence of spatial disorder, is described by an analysis inspired by the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This theory successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations.
  The crossovers connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions are also discussed.</description>
