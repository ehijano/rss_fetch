      <title>Higher Representations and Quark Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a (de)confined phase in QFT is well-defined in the presence of $1$-form symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, in scenarios where such symmetries are absent, confinement is not a well-defined phase property. In this work, we propose that, when restricting to a specific submanifold of the parameter space - namely at zero temperature and fixed quark mass - the confined and color-superconducting (CSC) phases of scalar QCD can be distinguished through the different organization of their spectra, as seen from the perspective of the baryon symmetry. The analysis is performed in terms of an appropriate higher-categorical representation theory, recently developed for generalized symmetries. Consistent with expectations, we find that the confined phase permits only particles with integer baryon charges, while the CSC phase is characterized by the coexistence of bare quarks and vortices, exhibiting a non-trivial Aharonov-Bohm effect between these excitations.</description>

      <title>Remarks on brane-antibrane inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an accessible review to the eta problem in brane-antibrane inflation and a recently proposed solution. The description of the antibrane by means of nonlinearly realized supersymmetry suggests a simple stabilization mechanism for the volume mode, based on the most general Kahler and superpotentials compatible with the symmetries of the problem. This work is a contribution to the proceedings of the second general meeting of the COST Action CA21106 (Cosmic WISPers) and is based on arXiv:2410.00097 .</description>

      <title>Pseudo-real quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of pseudo-reality for complex numbers. We show that this concept, applied to quantum fields, provides a unifying framework for two distinct approaches to pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories. The first approach stems from analytically continuing Hermitian theories into the complex plane, while the second is based on constructing them from first principles. The pseudo-reality condition for bosonic fields resolves a long-standing problem with the formulation of gauge theories involving pseudo-Hermitian currents, sheds new light on the resolution of the so-called Hermiticity Puzzle, and leads to a consistent minimal coupling of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories to gravity. These results contribute significantly to the ongoing development of the first-principles construction of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories, including their formulation in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Effective $AdS_3/CFT_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [2109.00065], it was pointed out that superstring theory on $AdS_3$ with $(NS,NS)$ $B$-field background and $R_{AdS}/l_s=\sqrt k&lt;1$ is dual to a symmetric product CFT deformed by an operator in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ twisted sector. We generalize the analysis of [2109.00065] to $k&gt;1$, and show that the resulting picture matches that discussed in the bosonic case in [2110.07535]. We argue that in the critical case, $k=1$ [0503121], the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ twisted deformation remains non-trivial. This resolves some confusions in the literature.</description>

      <title>Acceleration temperature for quantum fields without event horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate unitarily inequivalent representations of the algebra of operators in quantum field theory. In those cases that exist a Fock representation of the commutation relations, we have a unique no-quanta state. We examine more closely the operational definition of a measuring device which detect a quantum of an Hermitian scalar field. The Unruh-DeWitt and Glauber model of quanta detectors are discussed. In Minkowski spacetime, the transition probability per unit proper time of both detectors is studied in two different non-inertial frames of reference. The first one, a detector with a constant proper acceleration, travelling in a stationary worldline, i.e., an hyperbolic motion, interacting with the field prepared in the Poincar\'e invariant Fock vacuum state. Next, we studied the Unruh-DeWitt detector at rest in a non-uniformly accelerated frame, with a time dependent acceleration. We evaluate the positive frequency Wightman function for the non-uniformly accelerated frame in a finite time interval and obtain the same two-point correlation function of a system in equilibrium with a thermal bath. Therefore the non-uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with the field in the Poincar\'e invariant Fock vacuum state measures a thermal state. This result shows that the existence of an acceleration temperature without the presence of an event horizon.</description>

      <title>Reassessing aspects of the photon's LQG-modified dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our present contribution sets out to investigate a scenario based on the effects of the Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) on the electromagnetic sector of the Standard Model of Fundamental Interactions and Particle Physics (SM). Starting then from a post-Maxwellian version of Electromagnetism that includes LQG effects, we work out and discuss the influence of LQG parameters on classical quantities, such as the components of the stress-tensor. Furthermore, we inspect the propagation of electromagnetic waves and study optical properties of the QED vacuum in this scenario. Among these, we contemplate the combined effect between the LQG parameters and a homogeneous background magnetic field on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, considering in detail issues like group velocities and refractive indices of the QED vacuum. Finally, with the help of the LQG-extended photonic dispersion relations previously analyzed, we re-discuss the kinematics of the Compton effect and conclude that there emerges an interesting nonlinear profile in the wavelengths of both the incoming and the deflected photons.</description>

      <title>Comments on Minitwistors and the Celestial Supersphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuing our program of deriving aspects of celestial holography from string theory, we extend the Roiban-Spradlin-Volovich-Witten (RSVW) formalism to celestial amplitudes. We reformulate the tree-level maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) celestial leaf amplitudes for gluons in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory and for gravitons in $\mathcal{N}=8$ Supergravity in terms of minitwistor wavefunctions. These are defined as representatives of cohomology classes on the minitwistor space $\mathbf{MT}$, associated to the three-dimensional Euclidean anti-de Sitter space. In this framework, celestial leaf amplitudes are expressed as integrals over the moduli space of minitwistor lines. We construct a minitwistor generating functional for MHV leaf amplitudes using the Quillen determinant line bundle, extending the approach originally developed by Boels, Mason and Skinner. Building on this formalism, we propose supersymmetric celestial conformal field theories (CFTs) as $\sigma$-models, where the worldsheet is given by the celestial supersphere $\mathbf{CP}^{1|2}$, and the target space is the minitwistor superspace $\mathbf{MT}^{2|\mathcal{N}}$. We demonstrate that the semiclassical effective action of these $\sigma$-models reproduces the MHV gluonic and gravitational leaf amplitudes in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory and $\mathcal{N}=8$ Supergravity. This construction provides a concrete realisation of the supersymmetric celestial CFT framework recently introduced by Tropper (2024).</description>

      <title>Double-Scaled SYK, QCD, and the Flat Space Limit of de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surprising connection exists between double-scaled SYK at infinite temperature, and large N QCD. The large N expansions of the two theories have the same form; the 't Hooft limit of QCD parallels the fixed p limit of SYK (for a theory with p-fermion interactions), and the limit of fixed gauge coupling g -- the flat space limit in AdS/CFT -- parallels the double-scaled limit of SYK. From the holographic perspective fixed g is the far more interesting limit of gauge theory, but very little is known about it. DSSYK allows us to explore it in a more tractable example. The connection is illustrated by perturbative and non-perturbative DSSYK calculations, and comparing the results with known properties of Yang Mills theory. The correspondence is largely independent of the conjectured duality between DSSYK and de Sitter space, but may have a good deal to tell us about it.</description>

      <title>Two-loop four-point amplitudes on the Coulomb branch of ${\mathcal{N}}=4$ super Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore scattering amplitudes on the Coulomb branch of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We introduce a particular pattern of scalar vacuum expectation values that allow us to define amplitudes with a different mass pattern compared to what was studied previously. This is motivated by an extension of the Amplituhedron that leads to infrared-finite four-particle amplitudes involving massive particles. We work out the Feynman rules on the Coulomb branch and use them, together with generalized unitarity techniques, to perform consistency checks on the Amplituhedron expectations for the one- and two-loop integrands for the four-particle amplitude. We present details of the computation of the required two-loop four-point integrals via a four-dimensional version of the differential equations method. Finally, we study the Regge limit of the four-point amplitude, including the first power suppressed terms. We find that when organized in terms of a suitable expansion parameter, the subleading power term exponentiates, with the exponent matching the anomalous dimension of a cusped Wilson line with a local operator insertion. The latter is known from integrability, which leads to a prediction at higher loop orders in the Regge limit.</description>

      <title>Geometry and symmetries of Hermitian-Einstein and instanton connection moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of the moduli spaces $\mathscr{M}_{HE}^*(M^{2n})$ of Hermitian-Einstein irreducible connections on a vector bundle $E$ over a K\"ahler with torsion (KT) manifold $M^{2n}$ that admits holomorphic $\hat\nabla$-covariantly constant vector fields, where $\hat\nabla$ is the connection with skew-symmetric torsion $H$. We demonstrate that such vector fields induce an action on $\mathscr{M}_{HE}^*(M^{2n})$ that leaves both the metric and complex structure invariant. Moreover, if an additional condition is satisfied, the induced vector fields are convariantly constant with respect to the connection with skew-symmetric torsion $\hat{\mathcal{ D}}$ on $\mathscr{M}_{HE}^*(M^{2n})$. We demonstrate that in the presence of such vector fields, the geometry of $\mathscr{M}_{HE}^*(M^{2n})$ can be modeled on that of holomorphic toric principal bundles with base space KT manifolds and give some examples.
  We also extend our analysis to the moduli spaces $\mathscr{M}_{asd}^*(M^{4})$ of instanton connections on vector bundles over KT, bi-KT (generalised K\"ahler) and hyper-K\"ahler with torsion (HKT) manifolds $M^4$. We find that the geometry of $\mathscr{M}_{asd}^*(S^3\times S^1)$ can be modeled on that of principal bundles with fibre $S^3\times S^1$ over Quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds with torsion (QKT). In addition motivated by applications to AdS/CFT, we explore the (superconformal) symmetry algebras of two-dimensional sigma models with target spaces such moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>From Weyl Anomaly to Defect Supersymmetric R\'enyi Entropy and Casimir Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a closed-form expression for the contribution of surface defects to the supersymmetric R\'enyi entropy in six-dimensional $(2,0)$ theories. Our results show that this defect contribution is a linear function of $1/n$ and is directly proportional to $2b-d_2$, where $b$ and $d_2$ are the surface defect Weyl anomaly coefficients. We also derive a closed-form expression for the defect contribution to the supersymmetric Casimir energy, which simplifies to $-d_2$ (up to a proportionality constant) in the chiral algebra limit.</description>

      <title>Twistorial chiral algebras in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In four spacetime dimensions, the classically integrable self-dual sectors of gauge theory and gravity have associated chiral algebras, which emerge naturally from their description in twistor space. We show that there are similar chiral algebras associated to integrable sectors of gauge theory and gravity whenever the spacetime dimension is an integer multiple of four. In particular, the hyperk\"ahler sector of gravity and the hyperholomorphic sector of gauge theory in $4m$-dimensions have well-known twistor descriptions giving rise to chiral algebras. Using twistor sigma models to describe these sectors, we demonstrate that the chiral algebras in higher-dimensions also arise as soft symmetry algebras under a certain notion of collinear limit. Interestingly, the chiral algebras and collinear limits in higher-dimensions are defined on the 2-sphere, rather than the full celestial sphere.</description>

      <title>Running EFT-hedron with null constraints at loop level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implications of general properties of quantum field theory, such as causality, unitarity, and locality include constraints on the couplings of the effective field theory (EFT) coefficients. These constraints follow from the connections between the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) theory imposed by dispersion relations for four-particle amplitudes which formally allow us to express EFT couplings through the moments of positive-definite functions (imaginary parts of partial wave amplitudes) forming the EFT-hedron geometry. Previous studies of these positivity bounds were mainly focused on the weakly coupled EFTs, limiting the analysis to tree-level amplitudes of the IR theory. In this work, we extend the scope of positivity bounds including one-loop amplitudes, which is essential especially for the loops of massless particles. Examining a single scalar theory we found that the presence of massless loops cannot be reduced only to the running of EFT couplings because loops modify the crossing symmetry relations (null constraints). Our results demonstrate that while for small coupling constants, the one-loop bounds are in good agreement with the tree-level results, the allowed EFT parameter ranges can be significantly modified if a weak coupling assumption is not additionally imposed. In particular, we found that an upper bound on dimension-8 coupling becomes significantly stronger, and the dimension-12 coupling can be slightly negative which was thought to be forbidden by tree-level positivity bounds.</description>

      <title>Quantal analysis of the effects of coordinate noncommutativity on bi-dimensional harmonic motion under parametric variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Influence of coordinate noncommutativity on 2D quantum oscillatory motion, which undergoes parameter variations, are investigated. We first derive quantum solutions of the system described with time-independent parameters considering the noncommutativity of coordinates as a preliminary step. And then, we extend our study, framed with noncommutative phase-space formalism, to obtain relevant solutions of the system with time-dependent parameters. This system, which we focus on, is nonstationary due to variation of parameters in time. While the left and right circular annihilation and creation operators are utilized in the quantal management of the basic stationary system, the Schr\"odinger equation of the nonstationary system is solved using the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory and the invariant-related unitary transformation procedure. The outcome of our analysis is useful in understanding the effects of noncommutativity from quantum perspectives, especially in conjunction with the impact of parameter variations.</description>

      <title>Massive Helicity-Chirality Spinor Formalism from Massless Amplitudes with On-shell Mass Insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a helicity-chirality spinor formalism to describe scattering amplitudes for particles of any masses and spins. The massive spin-spinors introduced by Arkani-hamed-Huang-Huang have been extended to the spin/helicity-transversality spinors, in which a new quantum number transversality, closely related to chirality, is introduced by extending the Poincare symmetry. The massive helicity-chirality amplitudes can be written by the large and small components of massless spinors $\lambda$ and $\eta$ following the $\lambda \sim \sqrt{E}, \eta \sim \mathbf{m}/\sqrt{E}$ expansion order by order, which formulate the power counting rules of a large energy effective theory. Diagrammatically the mass expansion in amplitudes originates from the on-shell mass insertion: the helicity flip and chirality flip, which completely determines the three-point massive amplitudes. From the chirality-helicity unification at the UV, any massive helicity-chirality amplitude can be one-to-one corresponded to massless helicity amplitudes with (without) additional Higgs insertion. This UV-IR correspondence explains the mass enhancement in the weak decay processes $\pi^+ \to \mu^+ \nu$ and $t \to W^+ b$, and isolates the correct UV of the three-point massive QED $F\bar{F}\gamma$ amplitudes in Arkani-hamed-Huang-Huang formalism. From massless-massive correspondence, the massless on-shell techniques can be utilized to construct higher-point massive amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Page curve in Markovian open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typically, the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem increases until it plateaus at the thermal value. Under some circumstances, however, the intermediate value can dwarf the final value, even if the subsystem starts in a pure state. A famous example in the context of the black hole information paradox is the entropy of the Hawking radiation, where this behaviour is dubbed the Page curve. More generally, this is the case for excited systems weakly coupled to cold reservoirs. Here we study the entropy dynamics for Lindbladian evolution, i.e. open quantum systems in weak contact with Markovian reservoirs. This allows us to study the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the subsystem entropy decrease and link it to Landauer's principle: the entropy decrease must be accompanied by a heat flow out of the system. We give an analytic expression of the entanglement dynamics for a decaying excitation in a two-level system and study it under equilibration of a localised oscillator. In both cases the Page time occurs when half the initial energy has left the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the effect of the bumblebee field on thermodynamic instability in (non)extended phase space, we study the thermodynamic instability for the bumblebee AdS black holes. For this purpose, first, we evaluate the effect of the bumblebee field (or Lorentz-violating parameter) on the event horizon for AdS black holes. Then, in non-extended phase space, we study the effect of the bumblebee field on the heat capacity and the Helmholtz free energy to investigate the local and global thermal stability areas, respectively. Next, we extend our study on the extended phase space by seeking on stable area by using the heat capacity at constant pressure ($C_{P}$). Finally, we evaluate the super-entropy black hole condition and indicate that the bumblebee AdS black holes are super-entropy black holes when $l&gt;0$, which is consistent with the condition $C_{P}&lt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the four-dimensional AdS black hole is crucial within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. In this research, considering the charged scenario, we investigate the four-dimensional stationary and rotating AdS solutions in the framework of the $f(Q)$ gravitational theory. Our emphasis is on the power-law ansatz, which is consistent with observations and is deemed the most viable. Because this solution does not have an uncharged version or relate to general relativity, it falls into a new category, which derives its features from changes in non-metricity and incorporates the Maxwell domain. We analyze the singularities of such a solution, computing all the quantities of different curvature and non-metricity invariants. Our results indicate the presence of a central singularity, albeit with a softer nature compared to standard non-metricity or Einstein general relativity, attributed to the influence of the effect of $f(Q)$. We examine several physical characteristics of black holes from a thermodynamics perspective and demonstrate the existence of an outer event horizon in addition to the inner Cauchy horizons. However, under the conditions of a sufficiently large electric charge, a naked singularity emerges. Finally, we derive a class of rotating black hole in four-dimensional $f(Q)$ gravity that are asymptotically anti-de Sitter charged.</description>

      <title>Observable Signatures of RN Black Holes with Dark Matter Halos via Strong Gravitational Lensing and Constraints from EHT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark matter halos on the gravitational lensing produced by electrically charged, spherically symmetric black holes in the strong-field regime. The study focuses on two dark matter models: the Universal Rotation Curve Model and the cold dark matter model. We derive the coefficients for the strong deflection limit and numerically analyze the deflection angle variations. Graphical representations of the results show that the strong deflection angle, $\alpha_D$ , increases with the charge parameter $Q$ in the presence of a dark matter halo. We explore the astrophysical consequences for the supermassive black holes $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ , comparing the results with standard Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Schwarzschild black holes via strong gravitational lensing observations. Our findings suggest that charged black holes with dark matter halos can be differentiated from standard black holes. We constrain the charge parameter $Q$ using observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. For $M87^*$ , we find $0 \leq |Q| \leq 0.366M$ with the Universal Rotation Curve model and $0 \leq |Q| \leq 0.364M$ with the cold dark matter model. For $SgrA^*$ , the constraints are $0 \leq |Q| \leq 0.586M$ and $0 \leq |Q| \leq 0.584M$, respectively. These results suggest that charged black holes with dark matter halos satisfy the Event Horizon Telescope constraints, offering potential for future identification in observational campaigns.</description>

      <title>Bridging conformal field theory and parton approaches to SU(n)_k chiral spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the SU(n)_k Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. It is unveiled that these wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the SU(3)_k series are derived. The SU(3)_k chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the k = 2 member hosts Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the breaking of dark $SU(2)_d$ symmetry at different temperature scales, occurring after Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking or following QCD symmetry breaking. We focus on assessing the potential of the hidden monopoles generated during this process to serve as dark matter candidate. Additionally, we examine the impact of axion-monopole interactions on the axion mass. When the phase transition occurs at extremely high temperature ($\sim 10^8 \mathrm{GeV}$), the contribution of monopoles to the axion mass through witten effect becomes non-negligible, playing a crucial role in accurately determining the axion relic density. Moreover, the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by dark phase transition and axionic domain wall collapse may offer a potential explanation for the low-frequency gravitational wave signals observed in PTA experiments.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons gravitational term coupled to an isocurvature field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chern-Simons gravitational term during inflation is usually coupled to the inflaton field. The resulting theory suffers from ghost-field formation in the tensor sector, which limits the observational effects of P-violation on cosmological correlators. In this work, we consider the Chern-Simons term coupled to an isocurvature component in a multi-field model of inflation. Since the resulting theory does not affect the quadratic action of tensor perturbations, ghost fields do not appear. This operator provides (P-violating) interactions between the isocurvature perturbation and the curvature and tensor perturbations. We show that combining these couplings with interactions between the curvature and isocurvature components coming from a turning trajectory, the resulting $\langle sst \rangle_{PV}$ non-Gaussianities can reach $f^{sst, PV}_{\rm NL}=B_{PV}^{\zeta\zeta h}(k,k,k)/P^2_{\zeta}(k)\sim \mathcal O(1)$ within the parameter space of the theory. Our result motivates the systematic study of the Chern-Simons gravitational term coupled to isocurvature fields in multi-field models of inflation with couplings between the curvature and isocurvature fields or other mechanisms that transfer effects on the isocurvature field into the curvature field.</description>

      <title>Finite-time Unruh effect: Waiting for the transient effects to fade off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transition probability rate of a Unruh-DeWitt (UD) detector interacting with massless scalar field for a finite duration of proper time, $T$, of the detector. For a UD detector moving at a uniform acceleration, $a$, we explicitly show that the finite-time transition probability rate can be written as a sum of purely thermal terms, and non-thermal transient terms. While the thermal terms are independent of time, $T$, the non-thermal transient terms depend on $(\Delta ET)$, $(aT)$, and $(\Delta E/a)$, where $\Delta E$ is the energy gap of the detector. Particularly, the non-thermal terms are oscillatory with respect to the variable $(\Delta ET)$, so that they may be averaged out to be insignificant in the limit $\Delta ET \gg 1$, irrespective of the values of $(aT)$ and $(\Delta E/a)$. To quantify the contribution of non-thermal transient terms to the transition probability rate of a uniformly accelerating detector, we introduce a parameter, $\varepsilon_{\rm nt}$, called non-thermal parameter. Demanding the contribution of non-thermal terms in the finite-time transition probability rate to be negligibly small, \ie, $\varepsilon_{\rm nt}=\delta\ll1$, we calculate the thermalization time -- the time required for the detector to interact with the field to arrive at the required non-thermality, $\varepsilon_{\rm nt}=\delta$, and the detector to be (almost) thermalized with the Unruh bath in its comoving frame. Specifically, for small accelerations, $a\ll\Delta E$, we find the thermalization time, $\tau_{\rm th}$, to be $\tau_{\rm th} \sim (\Delta E)^{-1} \times {\rm e}^{2\pi|\Delta E|/a}/\delta$; and for large accelerations, $a\gg \Delta E$, we find the thermalization time to be $\tau_{\rm th} \sim (\Delta E)^{-1}/\delta$. We comment on the possibilities of bringing down the exponentially large thermalization time at small accelerations, $a\ll\Delta E$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In physics, Lagrangians provide a systematic way to describe laws governing physical systems. In the context of particle physics, they encode the interactions and behavior of the fundamental building blocks of our universe. By treating Lagrangians as complex, rule-based constructs similar to linguistic expressions, we trained a transformer model -- proven to be effective in natural language tasks -- to predict the Lagrangian corresponding to a given list of particles. We report on the transformer's performance in constructing Lagrangians respecting the Standard Model $\mathrm{SU}(3)\times \mathrm{SU}(2)\times \mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge symmetries. The resulting model is shown to achieve high accuracies (over 90\%) with Lagrangians up to six matter fields, with the capacity to generalize beyond the training distribution, albeit within architectural constraints. We show through an analysis of input embeddings that the model has internalized concepts such as group representations and conjugation operations as it learned to generate Lagrangians. We make the model and training datasets available to the community. An interactive demonstration can be found at: \url{https://huggingface.co/spaces/JoseEliel/generate-lagrangians}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly determines the violation of chiral symmetry when massless fermions are coupled to an abelian gauge field. In its seminal paper, Adler noticed that a modified chiral U(1) symmetry could still be defined, at the expense of being generated by a non-gauge-invariant conserved current. We show this internal U(1) symmetry has the special feature that it transforms the Haag duality violating sectors (or non-local operator classes). This provides a simple unifying perspective on the origin of anomaly quantization, anomaly matching, applicability of Goldstone theorem, and the absence of a Noether current. We comment on recent literature where this symmetry is considered to be either absent or non-invertible. We end by recalling the DHR reconstruction theorem, which states 0-form symmetries cannot be non-invertible for d&gt;2, and argue for a higher-form symmetry reconstruction theorem.</description>

      <title>Defining the type IIB matrix model without breaking Lorentz symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is a promising nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory, which may elucidate the emergence of (3+1)-dimensional space-time. However, the partition function is divergent due to the Lorentz symmetry, which is represented by a noncompact group. This divergence has been regularized conventionally by introducing some infrared cutoff, which breaks the Lorentz symmetry. Here we point out that Lorentz invariant observables become classical as one removes the infrared cutoff and that this "classicalization" is actually an artifact of the Lorentz symmetry breaking cutoff. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a natural way to "gauge-fix" the Lorentz symmetry in a fully nonperturbative manner. This also enables us to perform numerical simulations in such a way that the time-evolution can be extracted directly from the matrix configurations.</description>

      <title>Local Description of Decoherence of Quantum Superpositions by Black Holes and Other Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was previously shown that if an experimenter, Alice, puts a massive or charged body in a quantum spatial superposition, then the presence of a black hole (or more generally any Killing horizon) will eventually decohere the superposition [arXiv:2205.06279, arXiv:2301.00026, arXiv:2311.11461]. This decoherence was identified as resulting from the radiation of soft photons/gravitons through the horizon, thus suggesting that the global structure of the spacetime is essential for describing the decoherence. In this paper, we show that the decoherence can alternatively be described in terms of the local two-point function of the quantum field within Alice's lab, without any direct reference to the horizon. From this point of view, the decoherence of Alice's superposition in the presence of a black hole arises from the extremely low frequency Hawking quanta present in Alice's lab. We explicitly calculate the decoherence occurring in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Unruh vacuum from the local viewpoint. We then use this viewpoint to elucidate (i) the differences in decoherence effects that would occur in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Boulware and Hartle-Hawking vacua; (ii) the difference in decoherence effects that would occur in Minkowski spacetime filled with a thermal bath as compared with Schwarzschild spacetime; (iii) the lack of decoherence in the spacetime of a static star even though the vacuum state outside the star is similar in many respects to the Boulware vacuum around a black hole; and (iv) the requirements on the degrees of freedom of a material body needed to produce a decoherence effect that mimics that of a black hole.</description>

      <title>A non-local way around the no-global-symmetries conjecture in quantum gravity?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The no-global-symmetries conjecture is central to the swampland program that delineates the boundary between effective field theories that can be obtained from a quantum theory of gravity to those that cannot. The conjecture states that virtual black-hole configurations in the path integral generate terms that violate all global symmetries in the effective action for matter. Because of its central role, it is crucial to understand limitations to the validity of this conjecture. In the context of the Lorentzian path integral over spacetime geometries, we explore whether virtual black-hole configurations can be suppressed dynamically. To that end, we work in a spherically symmetric setting and make use of horizon-detecting curvature invariants which vanish on the horizon. By constructing a non-local gravitational action from the inverse of such curvature invariants, we can achieve destructive interference of black-hole configurations in the path integral. Given that non-local gravitational actions appear generically as the result of integrating out matter degrees of freedom from a theory for quantum gravity and matter, our exemplary construction reinforces discussions about the role of non-locality in assessing arguably universal properties of quantum gravity within the framework of path integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes are chaotic quantum systems that are expected to exhibit random matrix statistics in their finite energy spectrum. Lin, Maldacena, Rozenberg and Shan (LMRS) have proposed a related characterization of chaos for the ground states of BPS black holes with finite area horizons. On a separate front, the "fuzzball program" has uncovered large families of horizon-free geometries that account for the entropy of holographic BPS systems, but only in situations with sufficient supersymmetry to exclude finite area horizons. The highly structured, non-random nature of these solutions seems in tension with strong chaos. We verify this intuition by performing analytic and numerical calculations of the LMRS diagnostic in the corresponding boundary quantum system. In particular we examine the 1/2 and 1/4-BPS sectors of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, and the two charge sector of the D1-D5 CFT. We find evidence that these systems are only weakly chaotic, with a Thouless time determining the onset of chaos that grows as a power of $N$. In contrast, finite horizon area BPS black holes should be strongly chaotic, with a Thouless time of order one. In this case, finite energy chaotic states become BPS as $N$ is decreased through the recently discovered "fortuity" mechanism. Hence they can plausibly retain their strongly chaotic character.</description>

      <title>Impact of the phase transition on Quark-Gluon Plasma with an extremely strong magnetic field in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phase transition within an extremely strong magnetic background field, employing a holographic Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) model with a focus on entropy and pressure properties. At relatively modest magnetic field strengths, our study discerns a crossover transition between the normal phase and the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase as the temperature rises. In contrast, under the influence of an extremely strong magnetic field, a first-order phase transition is observed. A critical point is identified at $ (eB_c, T_c) \approx (2.8623 \, \text{GeV}^2, 0.1191 \, \text{GeV}) $, which corresponds to a second-order phase transition. This phase structure is found to be in qualitative agreement with lattice simulation predictions reported in [Phys. Rev. D \textbf{105}, 034511 (2022)]. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the magnetic field on the jet quenching parameter across various phases. At zero magnetic field ($ eB = 0$ ), the normalized jet quenching parameter $ \hat{q} / T^3 $ exhibits a monotonic increase with temperature. However, in the presence of a magnetic background field, the normalized jet quenching parameters not only display directional anisotropy but also experience a universal enhancement, particularly in the vicinity of the critical temperature region. This observation suggests that the jet quenching parameter could potentially act as an indicator of phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locality of bulk operators in AdS imposes stringent constraints on their description in terms of the boundary CFT. These constraints are encoded as sum rules on the bulk-to-boundary expansion coefficients. In this paper, we construct families of sum rules that are (i) complete and (ii) `dual' to sparse CFT spectra. The sum rules trivialise the reconstruction of bulk operators in strongly interacting QFTs in AdS space and allow us to write down explicit, exact, interacting solutions to the locality problem. Technically, we characterise `completeness' of a set of sum rules by constructing Schauder bases for a certain space of real-analytic functions. In turn, this allows us to prove a Paley-Weiner type theorem characterising the space of sum rules. Remarkably, with control over this space, it is possible to write down closed-form `designer sum rules', dual to a chosen spectrum of CFT operators meeting certain criteria. We discuss the consequences of our results for both analytic and numerical bootstrap applications.</description>

Abstract: Not much is known about superstring scattering amplitudes in curved backgrounds. Using the hybrid formalism in $\rm AdS_3 \times S^3$ with pure NS-NS three-form flux, we compute a $\rm PSU(1,1|2)$-covariant three-point amplitude for half-BPS vertex operators inserted on the $\rm AdS_3$ boundary and show that it agrees with the RNS computation. The zero-mode prescription for the fermions in $\rm AdS$ is defined in terms of the "standard" spacetime SUSY generator. It is found that integrating out the fermionic worldsheet fields in the path integral gives rise to the target-space vielbein, which explicitly encodes that the conformal group on the boundary is identified with the symmetry group of the $\rm AdS$ bulk.</description>

Abstract: We study infinite dimensional Lie algebras, whose infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras correspond with the symmetry algebra of $2d$ integrable models. These Lie algebras are defined by the set of infinitesimal, nonlinear, and higher derivative symmetry transformations present in theories with a left(right)-moving or (anti)-holomorphic current. We study a large class of such Lagrangian theories. We study the commuting subalgebras of the $2d$ free massless scalar, and find the symmetries of the known integrable models such as sine-Gordon, Liouville, Bullough-Dodd, and Korteweg-de Vries. Along the way, we find several new sequences of commuting charges, which we conjecture are charges of integrable models which are new deformations of a single scalar. After quantizing, the Lie algebra is deformed, and so are their commuting subalgebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree-level gravitational amplitudes satisfy an infinite hierarchy of soft factorization theorems. The existence of these theorems has been recently linked with the existence of an infinite tower of asymptotic symmetries. In this paper, we analyze the relevance of the soft graviton theorems beyond sub-leading order in the context of classical gravitational scattering in four dimensions. More in detail, we show that the infinite impact parameter limit of the late-time gravitational field emitted during a classical scattering can be derived using these factorization theorems. The classical field obtained in this (infinite impact parameter) regime has an expansion in the frequency of the detector where the modes scale as $\omega^{n}\log{\omega}$ with a vanishing memory.</description>

      <title>Matrix Theory Reloaded: A BPS Road to Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the decoupling limits that lead to matrix theories on D-branes. We highlight the BPS nature of these limits, in which the target space geometry becomes non-Lorentzian and wrapped D-branes experience instantaneous gravitational forces. Applied to curved D-brane geometries, we show that a single BPS decoupling limit induces the bulk near-horizon limit leading to AdS/CFT. By consecutively applying two such limits, we systematically generate further examples of holography, including novel versions with non-Lorentzian bulk geometry. Uplifted to M-theory, we are led to a unified framework where each BPS decoupling limit corresponds to a Discrete Light Cone Quantisation (DLCQ). We conjecture that a DLCQ${}^n$/DLCQ${}^{m}$ correspondence, with $m&gt;n$, captures the notion of holography in string theory. In particular, AdS${}_5$/CFT${}_4$ can be viewed as an example of DLCQ${}^0$/DLCQ${}^{1}$, with the extra DLCQ on the field theory side corresponding to the near-horizon limit in the bulk geometry. We further show that undoing these BPS decoupling limits can be viewed as deformations of matrix theories. We explain how these deformations are related to the $T\bar{T}$ deformation in two dimensions. In the context of holography, this allows us to view the ten-dimensional near-horizon brane geometry as an intrinsic deformation of the flat non-Lorentzian geometry that arises asymptotically. In field theoretic terms, these generalisations lead to $T\bar{T}$-like flow equations for the D$p$-brane DBI action.</description>

Abstract: We implement a bootstrap method that combines Schwinger-Dyson equations, thermal inequalities, and semidefinite relaxations of matrix logarithm in the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, at finite rank N as well as in the large N limit, and determine finite temperature observables that interpolate between available analytic results in the low and high temperature limits respectively. We also obtain bootstrap bounds on thermal phase transition as well as preliminary results in the ungauged two-matrix quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the formalism of $\text{T}\overline{\text{T}}$ deformations for quantum theories that are holographically dual to two-dimensional dilaton-gravity theories with Dirichlet boundary conditions. To better understand the microscopics of de Sitter space, we focus on deformations for which the dual bulk geometry flows from Anti-de Sitter to de Sitter space. We explore two distinct ways to achieve this: either through so-called centaur geometries that interpolate between AdS$_2$ and dS$_2$, or by a spherical dimensional reduction of $\text{T}\overline{\text{T}} + \Lambda_2$ theories that were proposed to give a microscopic interpretation of three-dimensional de Sitter entropy. We derive the microscopic energy spectrum, heat capacities, and deformed Cardy expressions for the thermodynamic entropy in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles for these two setups. In both setups a signature of the change from AdS to dS is that the heat capacity at a fixed deformation parameter of the boundary system changes sign, indicating the existence of a thermodynamically unstable de Sitter patch. Our findings provide important consistency conditions for holographic models of the dS$_2$ static patch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic (holomorphic) Floer homologies of seven, six, and five-manifolds, from the physics of a topologically-twisted 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory on a Spin$(7)$-manifold via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with $G_2$ instanton, Donaldson-Thomas, and Haydys-Witten configurations on the seven, six, and five-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define hyperk\"ahler Floer homologies specified by hypercontact three-manifolds, and symplectic Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. In turn, this will allow us to derive Atiyah-Floer type dualities between the various gauge-theoretic Floer homologies and symplectic intersection Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 8d theory, one can derive novel Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories that categorify Donaldson-Thomas, Haydys-Witten, and Vafa-Witten configurations on six, five, and four-manifolds, respectively -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homologies of six and five-manifolds, and the Floer homology of four-manifolds from [arXiv:2311.18302] -- where an Atiyah-Floer type correspondence for the Donaldson-Thomas case can be established. Last but not least, topological invariance of the theory suggests a relation amongst these Floer homologies and Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories for certain Spin$(7)$-manifolds. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the conjectures by Donaldson-Thomas [2], Donaldson-Segal [3], Cherkis [4], Hohloch-Noetzel-Salamon [5], Salamon [6], Haydys [7], and Bousseau [8], and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the 7D Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) associated to a 6D SCFT from the IIB/F-theory geometric engineering approach. The 6D (2,0) or (1,0) SCFT is constructed from IIB on a non-compact complex surface possibly with 7-branes. We derive the general form of 7D SymTFT actions from the compactification of IIB action on the boundary link of the base manifold of an elliptic Calabi-Yau threefold, for both the cases with or without flavor 7-branes intersecting the boundary link. Along the way we found new terms in the SymTFT action from the worldvolume action of flavor 7-branes involving the flavor center symmetries. We crosscheck the results against those obtained from either holographic constructions or the dual M-theory picture. Our construction potentially leads to a classification of the 7D SymTFTs which parallels the known geometric classification of the 6D SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Double Copy in AdS3 from Minitwistor Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The double copy relates gravitational theories to the square of gauge theories. While it is well understood in flat backgrounds, its precise realisation around curved spacetimes remains an open question. In this paper, we construct a classical double copy for cohomology class representatives in the minitwistor space of hyperbolic spacetimes. We find that the realisation of a physical double copy requires that the masses of the different spinning fields are not equal, contrary to the flat space prescription. This leads to a position-space double copy for bulk-to-boundary propagators. We also show that in coordinate space, this implies the Cotton double copy for waves and warped black holes of Topologically Massive Gravity. We show that these are exact double copy relations by constructing their Kerr-Schild metrics and also analysing the Kerr-Schild double copy. Furthermore, we find that near the boundary the double copy relates the dual CFT currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some aspects of quantum field theory in a general (i.e. non inertial) frame of Minkowski spacetime are studied. Conditions for the presence of horizons as well as for the change in the definition of positive energy solutions are examined. It is found that none of these phenomena is generic. This means that in the general case there is no natural way to define positive frequencies, which is the standard road to define particles. In that sense, (as well as in others) non inertial frames are similar to curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A non-rational Verlinde formula from Virasoro TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Virasoro TQFT to derive an integral identity that we view as a non-rational generalization of the Verlinde formula for the Virasoro algebra with central charge $c\geq 25$. The identity expresses the Virasoro fusion kernel as an integral over a ratio of modular S-kernels on the (punctured) torus. In particular, it shows that the one-point S-kernel diagonalizes the Virasoro $6j$ symbol. After carefully studying the analytic properties of this `Virasoro-Verlinde formula', we present three applications. In boundary Liouville CFT, the formula ensures the open-closed duality of the boundary one-point function on the annulus. In pure 3d gravity, it provides an essential step in computing the partition function on hyperbolic 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle. Lastly, in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, the formula computes a three-boundary torus wormhole, which leads to a prediction for the statistical correlation between the density of states and two OPE coefficients in the dual large-$c$ CFT ensemble. We conclude by discussing the implications of our result for the fusion rules in generic non-rational 2d CFTs.</description>

      <title>A Comment on the Higher-Spin Gauge Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the higher-spin gauge models which are free on-shell and whose cubic vertex is BRST-exact. We show that these are free off-shell as well as on-shell. The key equation for this relates the derivative of the total deformed action $S(g)$ with respect to the deformation parameter $g$ to an $S(g)$-exact term.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</description>

      <title>Five-brane webs, 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories and quantum curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a relation between the brane configurations consisting of D3-branes and 5-brane webs which realize 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons theories and quantum curves by focusing on the $S^{3}$ partition functions. In particular, we conjecture that the Newton polygons of the quantum curves are equal to the toric diagrams which are dual to the 5-brane webs. For brane configurations whose worldvolume theories have Lagrangian descriptions, we show an explicit derivation of the relation by using the supersymmetric localization and the Fermi gas formalism. We also provide some evidence of the conjecture for non-Lagrangian theories. We see that our conjecture gives us new matrix models for 5-brane webs including a $\left(p,q\right)$5-brane with arbitrary $p$. This leads to explicit relations between the brane configurations, the matrix models and genus one quantum curves.</description>

      <title>Novel possible symmetries of $S$-matrix generated by $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie (super)algebras as novel possible generators of symmetries of $S$-matrix. As the results, we demonstrate that a $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded extension of the supersymmetric algebra can be a symmetry of $S$-matrix. Furthermore, it turns out that a $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie algebra appears as internal symmetries. They are natural extensions of Coleman-Mandula theorem and Haag-Lopszanski-Sohnius theorem, which are the no-go theorems for generators of symmetries of $S$-matrix.</description>

      <title>Fermions and Zeta Function on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel fermionic model on the graphs. The Dirac operator of the model consists of deformed incidence matrices on the graph and the partition function is given by the inverse of the graph zeta function. We find that the coefficients of the inverse of the graph zeta function, which is a polynomial of finite degree in the coupling constant, count the number of fermionic cycles on the graph. We also construct the model on grid graphs by using the concept of the covering graph and the Artin-Ihara $L$-function. In connection with this, we show that the fermion doubling is absent, and the overlap fermions can be constructed on a general graph. Furthermore, we relate our model to statistical models by introducing the winding number around cycles, where the distribution of the poles of the graph zeta function (the zeros of the partition function) plays a crucial role. Finally, we formulate gauge theory including fermions on the graph from the viewpoint of the covering graph derived from the gauge group in a unified way.</description>

      <title>Special $N$-dimensional charged anti-de-Sitter black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravitational theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the absence of spherically symmetric black hole solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ because of the constraint derived from its field equations, which yields either $\mathbb{Q}=0 $ or $f_{\mathbb{Q} \mathbb{Q}}=0 $ \cite{Heisenberg:2023lru,Maurya:2023muz}. We are going to introduce a tours solutions for charged anti-de-Sitter black holes in $N$-dimensions within the framework of the quadratic form of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, where the coincident gauge condition is applied \cite{Heisenberg:2023lru}. Here, $f(\mathbb{Q})=\mathbb{Q}+\frac{1}2\alpha \mathbb{Q}^2-2\Lambda$, and the condition $N \geq 4$ is satisfied. These black hole solutions exhibit flat or cylindrical horizons as their distinctive features. An intriguing aspect of these black hole solutions lies in the coexistence of electric monopole and quadrupole components within the potential field, which are indivisible and exhibit interconnected momenta. This sets them apart from the majority of known charged solutions in the linear form of the non-metricity theory and its extensions. Moreover, the curvature singularities in these solutions are less severe compared to those found in known charged black hole solutions within the characteristic can be demonstrated by computing certain invariants of the curvature and non-metricity tensors. Finally, we calculate thermodynamic parameters, including entropy, Hawking temperature, and Gibbs free energy. These thermodynamic computations affirm the stability of our model.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising and 3-state Potts models. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensors with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A compilation of new results on the asymptotic behaviour of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$, and also on the Appell function $F_2$, is presented. As a by-product, we confirm a conjectured limit which appeared recently in the study of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model. We also propose two elementary asymptotic methods and confirm through some illustrative examples that both methods have great potential and can be applied to a large class of problems of asymptotic analysis. Finally, some directions of future research are pointed out in order to suggest ideas for further study.</description>
