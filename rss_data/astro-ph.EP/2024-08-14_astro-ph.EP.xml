      <title>Detecting exoplanet transits with the next generation of X-ray telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting exoplanet transits at X-ray wavelengths would provide a window into the effects of high energy irradiation on the upper atmospheres of planets. However, stars are relatively dim in the X-ray, making exoplanet transit detections difficult with current X-ray telescopes. To date, only one exoplanet (HD~189733~b) has an X-ray transit detection. In this study, we investigate the capability of future X-ray observatories to detect more exoplanet transits, focusing on both the NewAthena-WFI instrument and the proposed Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), which provide more light-collecting power than current instruments. We examined all the transiting exoplanet systems in the NASA Exoplanet Archive and gathered X-ray flux measurements or estimates for each host star. We then predicted the stellar count rates for both AXIS and NewAthena and simulated light curves, using null-hypothesis testing to identify the top 15 transiting planets ranked by potential detection significance. We also evaluate transit detection probabilities when the apparent X-ray radius is enlarged due to atmospheric escape, finding that $\geq 5$ of these planetary systems may be detectable on the $&gt;4\sigma$ level in this scenario. Finally, we note that the assumed host star coronal temperature, which affects the shape of an X-ray transit, can also significantly affect our ability to detect the planet.</description>

      <title>Lessons from Hubble and Spitzer: 1D Self-Consistent Model Grids for 19 Hot Jupiter Emission Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a population-level analysis of the dayside thermal emission spectra of 19 planets observed with Hubble WFC3 and Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 microns, spanning equilibrium temperatures 1200-2700 K and 0.7-10.5 Jupiter masses. We use grids of planet-specific 1D, cloud-free, radiative-convective-thermochemical equilibrium models (1D-RCTE) combined with a Bayesian inference framework to estimate atmospheric metallicity, the carbon-to-oxygen ratio, and day-to-night heat redistribution. In general, we find that the secondary eclipse data cannot reject the physics encapsulated within the 1D-RCTE assumption parameterized with these three variables. We find a large degree of scatter in atmospheric metallicities, with no apparent trend, and carbon-to-oxygen ratios that are mainly consistent with solar or subsolar values but do not exhibit population agreement. Together, these indicate either (1) formation pathways vary over the hot and ultra-hot Jupiter population and/or (2) more accurate composition measurements are needed to identify trends. We also find a broad scatter in derived dayside temperatures that do not demonstrate a trend with equilibrium temperature. Like with composition estimates, this suggests either significant variability in climate drivers over the population and/or more precise dayside temperature measurements are needed to identify a trend. We anticipate that 1D-RCTE models will continue to provide valuable insights into the nature of exoplanet atmospheres in the era of JWST.</description>

      <title>Deepest limits on scattered light emission from the Epsilon Eridani inner debris disk with HST/STIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epsilon Eridani ($\epsilon$ Eri) is one of the first debris disk systems detected by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). However, the system has thus far eluded detection in scattered light with no components having been directly imaged. Its similarity to a relatively young Solar System combined with its proximity makes it an excellent candidate to further our understanding of planetary system evolution. We present a set of coronagraphic images taken using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) coronagraph on the Hubble space telescope at a small inner working angle to detect a predicted warm inner debris disk inside 1". We used three different post-processing approaches; Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Karhunen-Lo`eve Image Processing (KLIP), and Classical reference differential imaging (RDI), to best optimize reference star subtraction, and find that NMF performed the best overall while KLIP produced the absolute best contrast inside 1". We present limits on scattered light from warm dust, with constraints on surface brightness at 6 mJy/as$^2$ at our inner working angle of 0.6". We also place a constraint of 0.5 mJy/as$^2$ outside 1", which gives us an upper limit on the brightness for outer disks and substellar companions. Finally, we calculated an upper limit on the dust albedo at $\omega &lt;$ 0.487.</description>

      <title>Optimizing TESS-related Exoplanet Observation: A Systematic Approach to Scheduling JWST SOSS and BOTS Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a systematic approach to optimize the scheduling of exoplanet observations using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), focusing on targets discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We developed a methodology to refine transit timing predictions for JWST's Cycle 3 Guest Observer program, specifically for the NIRISS/SOSS and NIRSpec/BOTS observation modes. Our process involved data collection from JWST proposal documents, cross-matching with TESS data, and applying the Transit Least Squares (TLS) algorithm for transit detection and characterization. We created comprehensive timelines for instrument usage and individual proposals, providing a visual representation of the observation schedule from July 2024 to September 2025. This approach demonstrates the potential for improved efficiency in JWST time allocation and sets a foundation for future refinements in astronomical observation planning.</description>

      <title>Dwellers in the Deep: Biological Consequences of Dark Oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The striking recent putative detection of "dark oxygen" (dark O$_2$) sources on the abyssal ocean floor in the Pacific at $\sim 4$ km depth raises the intriguing scenario that complex (i.e., animal-like) life could exist in underwater environments sans oxygenic photosynthesis. In this work, we thus explore the possible (astro)biological implications of this discovery. From the available data, we roughly estimate the concentration of dissolved O$_2$ and the corresponding O$_2$ partial pressure, as well as the flux of O$_2$ production, associated with dark oxygen sources. Based on these values, we infer that organisms limited by internal diffusion may reach maximal sizes of $\sim 0.1-1$ mm in habitats with dark O$_2$, while those with circulatory systems might achieve sizes of $\sim 0.1-10$ cm. Optimistically, the estimated dark oxygen flux can potentially support biomass densities up to $\sim 3-30$ g m$^{-2}$, perhaps surpassing typical reported densities at similar depths in global deep-sea surveys. Finally, we outline how oceanic settings with dark O$_2$ may facilitate the origin(s) of life via the emergence of electrotrophy. Our findings indicate that complex life fueled by dark oxygen is plausibly capable of inhabiting submarine environments devoid of photosynthesis on Earth, conceivably extending likewise to extraterrestrial locations such as icy worlds with subsurface oceans (e.g., Enceladus and Europa), which are likely common throughout the Universe.</description>

      <title>Definition of multispectral camera system parameters to model the asteroid 2001 SN263</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2012, Brazil began the studies to send its first deep space exploration mission, ASTER, which would be the first mission to orbit a triple asteroid system, 2001 SN263. We aim to contribute to the ASTER mission by defining the parameters of a multispectral camera system that will be used to study the asteroid system 2001 SN263, through software simulations that should help planning the data collection. We inserted the shape model of the objects in the software POV-Ray and modeled two cameras, a Wide Angle (WAC) and a Narrow Angle (NAC). We inserted the asteroid's parameters and simulated the satellite position. We created various scenes so we could obtain a good view of the asteroid. Alpha is entirely visible only in the WAC images, while the NAC is expected to reveal surface details. Beta seems relatively small in the WAC images, whereas we obtain a broad view from the NAC at 100 km distance. Gamma, smaller than Beta, should provide more detailed images through the NAC, whereas the WAC images should be able to show its inclined orbit around Alpha. To see Gamma behind Alpha in its revolution movement, we would have to elevate the camera's orbit. The method employed to simulate images generated by satellite cameras can be applied to other scenarios where the target requires imaging, extending beyond the field of planetary geology.</description>

      <title>Five new eclipsing binaries with low-mass companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise space-based photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite results in a huge number of exoplanetary candidates. However, the masses of these objects are unknown and must be determined by ground-based spectroscopic follow-up observations, frequently revealing the companions to be low-mass stars rather than exoplanets. We present the first orbital and stellar parameter solutions for five such eclipsing binary-star systems using radial-velocity follow-up measurements together with spectral-energy-distribution solutions. TOI-416 and TOI-1143 are totally eclipsing F+M star systems with well-determined secondary masses, radii, and temperatures. TOI-416 is a circular system with an F6 primary and a secondary with a mass of $M_2={0.131(8)}{M_\odot}$. TOI-1143 consists of an F6 primary with an $M_2={0.142(3)}{M_\odot}$ secondary on an eccentric orbit with a third companion. With respect to the other systems, TOI-1153 shows ellipsoidal variations, TOI-1615 contains a pulsating primary, and TOI-1788 has a spotted primary, while all have moderate mass ratios of 0.2-0.4. However, these systems are in a grazing configuration, which limits their full description. The parameters of TOI-416B and TOI-1143B are suitable for the calibration of the radius-mass relation for dwarf stars.</description>

      <title>The Gaia Ultracool Dwarf Sample -- V: The Ultracool Dwarf Companion catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Ultracool Dwarf Companion Catalogue of 278 multiple systems, 32 of which are newly discovered, each with at least one spectroscopically confirmed Ultracool Dwarf, within a 100 pc volume-limited sample. This catalogue is compiled using the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars for stellar primaries and the Gaia Ultracool Dwarf Sample for low-mass companions and includes 241 doubles, 33 triples, and 4 higher-order systems established from positional, proper motion, and parallax constraints. The catalogue seeks to identify probable benchmark systems within 100 pc to obtain model-independent astrophysical parameters of Ultracool Dwarfs. Chance alignment probabilities are calculated to evaluate the physical nature of each system. Astrometric and photometric data from Gaia Data Release 3 and the Two Micron All Sky Survey are included for all objects. We identify potential unseen companions using a combination of the Renormalised Unit Weight Error, Image Parameter Determination statistics, Non-Single Star solutions, and photometric blending as provided by Gaia, identifying hierarchical Ultracool triple systems. Our catalogue includes 17 White Dwarf - Ultracool Dwarf systems, whose ages are determined using cooling models. We also use the Gaia FLAME results and the BANYAN $\Sigma$ procedures to age 40 and 34 systems respectively, and derive mass estimates from evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>Planet migration in massive circumbinary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most stars are in multiple systems, with the majority of those being binaries. A large number of planets have been confirmed in binary stars and therefore it is important to understand their formation and dynamical evolution. We perform simulations to investigate the migration of wide-orbit giant planets (semi-major axis 100 AU) in massive circumbinary discs (mass 0.1 M$_{\odot}$) that are marginally gravitationally unstable, using the three-dimensional Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic code SEREN. We vary the binary parameters to explore their effect on planet migration. We find that a planet in a massive circumbinary disc initially undergoes a period of rapid inward migration before switching to a slow outward migration, as it does in a circumstellar disc. However, the presence of the binary enhances planet migration and mass growth. We find that a high binary mass ratio (binary with equal mass stars) results in more enhanced outward planet migration. Additionally, larger binary separation and/or higher binary eccentricity results to a faster outward planet migration and stronger planet growth. We conclude that wide-orbit giant planets attain wider final orbits due to migration around binary stars than around single stars.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamic criterion for the formation of Circumplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of circumplanetary disks is central to our understanding of giant planet formation, influencing their growth rate during the post-runaway phase and observability while embedded in protoplanetary disks. We use 3D global multifluid radiation hydrodynamics simulations with the FARGO3D code to define the thermodynamic conditions that enable circumplanetary disk formation around Jovian planets on wide orbits. Our simulations include stellar irradiation, viscous heating, static mesh refinement, and active calculation of opacity based on evolving dust fluids. We find a necessary condition for the formation of circumplanetary disks in terms of a mean cooling time: when the cooling time is at least one order of magnitude shorter than the orbital time scale, the specific angular momentum of the gas is nearly Keplerian at scales of $R_{\rm{Hill}}/3$. We show that the inclusion of multifluid dust dynamics favors rotational support because dust settling produces an anisotropic opacity distribution that favors rapid cooling. In all our models with radiation hydrodynamics, specific angular momentum decreases as time evolves in agreement with the formation of an inner isentropic envelope due to compressional heating. The isentropic envelope can extend up to $R_{\rm{Hill}}/3$ and shows negligible rotational support. Thus, our results imply that young gas giant planets may host spherical isentropic envelopes, rather than circumplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Neglected Silicon Dioxide Polymorphs as Clouds in Substellar Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct mid-infrared signatures of silicate clouds in substellar atmospheres were first detected in Spitzer observations of brown dwarfs, although their existence was previously inferred from near-infrared spectra. With JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) instrument, we can now more deeply probe silicate features from 8 to 10 microns, exploring specific particle composition, size, and structure. Recent characterization efforts have led to the identification in particular of silica (silicon dioxide, SiO$_2$) cloud features in brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. Previous modeling, motivated by chemical equilibrium, has primarily focused on magnesium silicates (forsterite, enstatite), crystalline quartz, and amorphous silica to match observations. Here, we explore the previously neglected possibility that other crystalline structures of silica, i.e. polymorphs, may be more likely to form at the pressure and temperature conditions of substellar upper atmospheres. We evaluate JWST's diagnostic potential for these polymorphs and find that existing published transmission data are only able to conclusively distinguish tridymite, but future higher signal-to-noise transmission observations, directly imaged planet observations, and brown dwarf observations may be able to disentangle all four of the silica polymorphs. We ultimately propose that accounting for the distinct opacities arising from the possible crystalline structure of cloud materials may act as a powerful, observable diagnostic tracer of atmospheric conditions, where particle crystallinity records the history of the atmospheric regions through which clouds formed and evolved. Finally, we highlight that high fidelity, accurate laboratory measurements of silica polymorphs are critically needed to draw meaningful conclusions about the identities and structures of clouds in substellar atmospheres.</description>
