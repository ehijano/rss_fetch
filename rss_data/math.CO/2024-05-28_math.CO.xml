      <title>Some new Bollob\'as-type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of disjoint pairs of finite sets $\mathcal{P}=\{(A_i,B_i)\mid i\in[m]\}$ is called a Bollob\'as system if $A_i\cap B_j\neq\emptyset$ for every $i\neq j$, and a skew Bollob\'as system if $A_i\cap B_j\neq\emptyset$ for every $i&lt;j$. Bollob\'as proved that for a Bollob\'as system, the inequality \begin{equation*} \sum_{i=1}^m\binom{|A_i|+|B_i|}{|A_i|}^{-1}\leq 1 \end{equation*} holds. Heged\"{u}s and Frankl generalized this theorem to skew Bollob\'as systems with the inequality \begin{equation*} \sum_{i=1}^m\binom{|A_i|+|B_i|}{|A_i|}^{-1}\leq 1+n, \end{equation*} provided $A_i,B_i\subseteq [n]$. In this paper, we improve this inequality to \begin{equation*} \sum_{i=1}^m \left((1+|A_i|+|B_i|) \binom{|A_i|+|B_i|}{|A_i|}\right)^{-1} \leq 1 \end{equation*} with probabilistic method. We also generalize this result to partitions of sets on both symmetric and skew cases.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Foundations of Interlocking Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of interlocking assemblies is an emerging field with applications in various disciplines. However, to this day, the mathematical treatment of these assemblies has been sparse. In this work, we develop a comprehensive mathematical theory for interlocking assemblies, providing a precise definition and a method for proving the interlocking property based on infinitesimal motions. We consider assemblies with crystallographic symmetries and verify interlocking properties for such assemblies. Our analysis includes the development of an infinite polytope with crystallographic symmetries to ensure that the interlocking property holds. For a certain block, called the RhomBlock, that can be assembled in numerous ways, characterised by the combinatorial theory of lozenges, we rigorously prove the interlocking property. By conclusively showing that any assembly of the RhomBlock is interlocking, we provide a robust framework for further exploration and application of interlocking assemblies.</description>

      <title>Degrees of P-Grothendieck polynomials and regularity of Pfaffian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a formula for the degrees of Ikeda and Naruse's $P$-Grothendieck polynomials using combinatorics of shifted tableaux. We show this formula can be used in conjunction with results of Hamaker, Marberg, and Pawlowski to obtain an upper bound on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of certain Pfaffian varieties known as vexillary skew-symmetric matrix Schubert varieties. Similar combinatorics additionally yields a new formula for the degree of Grassmannian Grothendieck polynomials and the regularity of Grassmannian matrix Schubert varieties, complementing a 2021 formula of Rajchgot, Ren, Robichaux, St. Dizier, and Weigandt.</description>

      <title>Gap between the number of facets of the two poset polytopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the difference between the number of facets of the order polytope and the chain polytope of a poset. Hibi and Li classified posets where the gap is exactly zero. We describe the bounds on this gap using the new notion of crossing numbers, and then use this result to classify the posets where the gap is exactly one.</description>

      <title>The $e$-positivity of the chromatic symmetric function for twinned paths and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation of twinning a graph at a vertex was introduced by Foley, Ho\`ang, and Merkel (2019), who conjectured that twinning preserves $e$-positivity of the chromatic symmetric function. A counterexample to this conjecture was given by Li, Li, Wang, and Yang (2021). In this paper, we prove that $e$-positivity is preserved by the twinning operation on cycles, by giving an $e$-positive generating function for the chromatic symmetric function, as well as an $e$-positive recurrence. We derive similar $e$-positive generating functions and recurrences for twins of paths. Our methods make use of the important triple deletion formulas of Orellana and Scott (2014), as well as new symmetric function identities.</description>

      <title>A note on the second neighborhood problem for $k$-anti-transitive and $m$-free digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seymour Second Neighborhood Conjecture (SSNC) asserts that every finite oriented graph has a vertex whose second out-neighborhood is at least as large as its first out-neighborhood. Such a vertex is called a Seymour vertex. A digraph $D = (V, E)$ is $k$-anti-transitive if for every pair of vertices $u, v \in V$, the existence of a directed path of length $k$ from $u$ to $v$ implies that $(u, v) \notin E$. An $m$-free digraph is digraph having no directed cycles with length at most $m$. In this paper, we prove that if $D$ is $k$-anti-transitive and $(k-4)$-free digraph, then $D$ has a Seymour vertex. As a consequence, a special case of Caccetta-Haggkvist Conjecture holds on 7-anti-transitive oriented graphs. This work extends recently known results.</description>

      <title>Lyndon pairs and the lexicographically greatest perfect necklace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a finite alphabet. A necklace is a circular word. For positive integers $n$ and~$k$, a necklace is $(n,k)$-perfect if all words of length $n$ occur $k$ times but at positions with different congruence modulo $k$, for any convention of the starting position. We define the notion of a Lyndon pair and we use it to construct the lexicographically greatest $(n,k)$-perfect necklace, for any $n$ and $k$ such that $n$ divides~$k$ or $k$ divides~$n$. Our construction generalizes Fredricksen and Maiorana's construction of the lexicographically greatest de Bruijn sequence of order $n$, based on the concatenation of the Lyndon words whose length divide $n$.</description>

      <title>An optimal chromatic bound for ($P_2+P_3$, gem)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the parameters $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number and the clique number of $G$. A function $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that $f(1) = 1$ and $f(x) \geq x$, for all $x \in \mathbb{N}$ is called a $\chi$-binding function for the given class of graphs $\cal{G}$ if every $G \in \cal{G}$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq f(\omega(G))$, and the \emph{smallest $\chi$-binding function} $f^*$ for $\cal{G}$ is defined as $f^*(x) := \max\{\chi(G)\mid G\in {\cal G} \mbox{ and } \omega(G)=x\}$. In general, the problem of obtaining the smallest $\chi$-binding function for the given class of graphs seems to be extremely hard, and only a few classes of graphs are studied in this direction. In this paper, we study the class of ($P_2+ P_3$, gem)-free graphs, and prove that the function $\phi:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ defined by $\phi(1)=1$, $\phi(2)=4$, $\phi(3)=6$ and $\phi(x)=\left\lceil\frac{1}{4}(5x-1)\right\rceil$, for $x\geq 4$ is the smallest $\chi$-binding function for the class of ($P_2+ P_3$, gem)-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Weak saturation rank: a failure of linear algebraic approach to weak saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $F$ and a positive integer $n$, the weak $F$-saturation number $\mathrm{wsat}(K_n,F)$ is the minimum number of edges in a graph $H$ on $n$ vertices such that the edges missing in $H$ can be added, one at a time, so that every edge creates a copy of $F$. Kalai in 1985 introduced a linear algebraic approach that became one of the most efficient tools to prove lower bounds on weak saturation numbers. If $W$ is a vector space spanned by vectors $w(e)$ assigned to edges $e$ of $K_n$ in such a way that, for every copy $F'\subset K_n$ of $F$, there exist non-zero $\lambda_e$, $e\in E(F')$, satisfying $\sum_{e\in E(F')}\lambda_e w(e)=0$, then $\mathrm{dim}W\leq \mathrm{wsat}(K_n,F)$. In this paper, we prove limitations of this approach: we show infinitely many $F$ such that, for every vector space $W$ as above, $\mathrm{dim}W&lt;\mathrm{wsat}(K_n,F)$. It follows from the fact that the maximum possible dimension of such a vector space equals $a_Fn+O(1)$ for some integer $a_F$. We then suggest a modification of this approach that allows to get tight lower bounds even in the case when $\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathrm{wsat}(K_n,F)/n$ is not integer. Finally, we generalise our results to random graphs, complete multipartite graphs, and hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on the Average Height of Random Binary Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the average height of random trees generated by leaf-centric binary tree sources as introduced by Zhang, Yang and Kieffer. A leaf-centric binary tree source induces for every $n \geq 2$ a probability distribution on the set of binary trees with $n$ leaves. Our results generalize a result by Devroye, according to which the average height of a random binary search tree of size $n$ is in $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$.</description>

      <title>Regular Flips in mptopcom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A triangulation of a point configuration is regular if it can be given by a height function, that is every point gets lifted to a certain height and projecting the lower convex hull gives the triangulation. Checking regularity of a triangulation usually is done by solving a linear program. However when checking many flip-connected triangulations for regularity, one can instead ask which flips preserve regularity. When traversing the flip graph for enumerating all regular triangulations, this allows for vast reduction of the linear programs needing to be solved. At the same time the remaining linear programs will be much smaller.</description>

      <title>On the fibbinary numbers and the Wythoffarray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper defines the set fib of fibbinary numbers and displays its structure in the form of a table of a specialised type, and in array form. It uses the Zeckendorf representation $n \in \mathbf{N}$ to define a bijection $\mathcal{Z}$ between $\mathbf{N}$ and fib. It is proved that the fibbinary array is the image under $\mathcal{Z}$ of the famous Wythoff array. The fibbinary table proves useful pictorial insight into the fractal defined by the Wythoff array. The Wythoff table, obtained as the image under the inverse of $\mathcal{Z}$ of the fibbinary table, leads to a simpler view of the fractal, and may be compared with the (1938) Steinhaus tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove that every twin-free graph on $n$ vertices contains a locating-dominating set of size at most $\lceil\frac{5}{8}n\rceil$. This improves the earlier bound of $\lfloor\frac{2}{3}n\rfloor$ due to Foucaud, Henning, L\"owenstein and Sasse from 2016, and makes some progress towards the well-studied locating-dominating conjecture of Garijo, Gonz\'alez and M\'arquez.</description>

      <title>On the resistance regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a connected graph $G$, its resistance matrix is denoted by $R(G)$. If all the row(column) sums of $R(G)$ are equal, then $G$ is said to be resistance regular. In $[13]$, J. Zhou et al. posed the question regarding the existence of a non-regular resistance regular graph. In this article, we establish that all resistance regular graphs are regular, thus conclusively answering Zhou's question by showing that no non-regular resistance regular graph exists. Also, we compute the resistance energies of some resistance regular graphs. Furthermore, we determine various bounds for the resistance energy and resistance spectral radius of $G.$</description>

      <title>On walk-regular graphs and optimal duals of frames generated by graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erasures are a common problem that arises while signals or data are being transmitted. A profound challenge in frame theory is to find the optimal dual frames ($OD$-frames) to minimize the reconstruction error if erasures occur. In this paper, we study the optimal duals of frames generated by graphs. First, we characterize walk-regular graphs. Then, it is shown that the diagonal entries of the Moore-Penrose inverse of the Laplacian matrix (or adjacency matrix) of a walk-regular graph are equal. Besides, we prove that connected graphs generate full spark frames. Using these results, we establish that the canonical dual frames are the unique $OD$-frames of a frame generated by a walk-regular graph. A sufficient condition under which the canonical dual frame is the unique $OD$-frame is known. Here, we establish that the condition is also necessary if the frame is generated by a connected graph.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A widely open conjecture proposed by Bollob\'as, Erd\H{o}s, and Tuza in the early 1990s states that for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, if the independence number $\alpha(G) = \Omega(n)$, then there is a subset $T \subseteq V(G)$ with $|T| = o(n)$ such that $T$ intersects all maximum independent sets of $G$. In this paper, we prove that this conjecture holds for graphs that do not contain an induced $K_{s,t}$ for fixed $t \ge s$. Our proof leverages the probabilistic method at an appropriate juncture.</description>

      <title>Graph Skeletons and Diminishing Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define coarse skeletons of graphs in terms of two constants. We introduce the notion of coarse bottlenecking in graphs and show how it can guarantee that a skeleton resembles (up to quasi-isometry) the original graph. We show how notions similar to the coarse skeleton have been previously used to classify some coarse families of graphs. We explore the properties of a coarse skeleton and of combinations of skeletons. We show how these tools can be used to simplify the structure of graphs that have an excluded asymptotic minor, reducing it to a skeleton of the original containing at most a 3-fat minor, we give an example to show that a similar result does not hold for 2-fat minors.</description>

Abstract: Consider a tree $T=(V,E)$ with root $\circ$ and edge length function $\ell:E\to\mathbb{R}_+$. The phylogenetic covariance matrix of $T$ is the matrix $C$ with rows and columns indexed by $L$, the leaf set of $T$, with entries $C(i,j):=\sum_{e\in[i\wedge j,o]}\ell(e)$, for each $i,j\in L$. Recent work [15] has shown that the phylogenetic covariance matrix of a large, random binary tree $T$ is significantly sparsified with overwhelmingly high probability under a change-of-basis with respect to the so-called Haar-like wavelets of $T$. This finding notably enables manipulating the spectrum of covariance matrices of large binary trees without the necessity to store them in computer memory but instead performing two post-order traversals of the tree. Building on the methods of [15], this manuscript further advances their sparsification result to encompass the broader class of $k$-regular trees, for any given $k\ge2$. This extension is achieved by refining existing asymptotic formulas for the mean and variance of the internal path length of random $k$-regular trees, utilizing hypergeometric function properties and identities.</description>

      <title>Quantum $K$-theory of Lagrangian Grassmannian via parabolic Peterson isomorphism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Schubert calculus in the torus-equivariant quantum $K$-ring of the Lagrangian Grassmannian $\mathrm{LG}(n)$. Our main tool is the $K$-theoretic Peterson map due to Kato. The map is from the (localized) equivariant $K$-homology ring $K_{*}^{T}(\mathrm{Gr}_{G})$ of the affine Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_{G}$ of the symplectic group $G=\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to the (localized) torus-equivariant quantum $K$-ring $QK_{T}(\mathrm{LG}(n))$. We determine explicitly the kernel of this map.</description>

      <title>Automatic Abelian Complexities of Parikh-Collinear Fixed Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parikh-collinear morphisms have the property that all the Parikh vectors of the images of letters are collinear, i.e., the associated adjacency matrix has rank 1. In the conference DLT-WORDS 2023 we showed that fixed points of Parikh-collinear morphisms are automatic. We also showed that the abelian complexity function of a binary fixed point of such a morphism is automatic under some assumptions. In this note, we fully generalize the latter result. Namely, we show that the abelian complexity function of a fixed point of an arbitrary, possibly erasing, Parikh-collinear morphism is automatic. Furthermore, a deterministic finite automaton with output generating this abelian complexity function is provided by an effective procedure. To that end, we discuss the constant of recognizability of a morphism and the related cutting set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What is the probability that a random walk in the free group ends in a proper power? Or in a primitive element? We present a formula that computes the exponential decay rate of the probability that a random walk on a regular tree ends in a given subset, in terms of the exponential decay rate of the analogous probability of the non-backtracking random walk. This generalizes the well-known cogrowth formula of Grigorchuk, Cohen and Northshield.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every colouring of pairs of reals with finitely-many colours, there is a set homeomorphic to the rationals which takes no more than two colours. This was conjectured by Galvin in 1970, and a colouring of Sierpi{\'n}ski from 1933 witnesses that the number of colours cannot be reduced to one. Previously in 1985 Shelah had shown that a stronger statement is consistent with a forcing construction assuming the existence of large cardinals. Then in 2018 Raghavan and Todor\v{c}evi\'c had proved it assuming the existence of large cardinals. We prove it in $ZFC$. In fact Raghavan and Todor\v{c}evi\'c proved, assuming more large cardinals, a similar result for a large class of topological spaces. We prove this also, again in $ZFC$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new row insertion algorithm on decreasing tableaux and increasing tableaux, generalizing Edelman-Greene (EG) row insertion. Our row insertion algorithm is a nontrivial variation of Hecke column insertion which generalizes EG column insertion. Similar to Hecke column insertion, our row insertion is bijective and respects Hecke equivalence, and therefore recovers the expansions of stable Grothendieck functions into Grassmannian stable Grothendieck functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\it inversion} of a set $X$ of vertices in a digraph $D$ consists of reversing the direction of all arcs of $D\langle X\rangle$. We study $sinv'_k(D)$ (resp. $sinv_k(D)$) which is the minimum number of inversions needed to transform $D$ into a $k$-arc-strong (resp. $k$-strong) digraph and $sinv'_k(n) = \max\{sinv'_k(D) \mid D~\mbox{is a $2k$-edge-connected digraph of order $n$}\}$. We show :
  $(i): \frac{1}{2} \log (n - k+1) \leq sinv'_k(n) \leq \log n + 4k -3$ ;
  $(ii):$ for any fixed positive integers $k$ and $t$, deciding whether a given oriented graph $D$ with $sinv'_k(D)&lt;+\infty$ satisfies $sinv'_k(D) \leq t$ is NP-complete;
  $(iii):$ for any fixed positive integers $k$ and $t$, deciding whether a given oriented graph $D$ with $sinv_k(D)&lt;+\infty$ satisfies $sinv_k(D) \leq t$ is NP-complete;
  $(iv):$ if $T$ is a tournament of order at least $2k+1$, then $sinv'_k(T) \leq sinv_k(T) \leq 2k$, and $sinv'_k(T) \leq \frac{4}{3}k+o(k)$;
  $(v):\frac{1}{2}\log(2k+1) \leq sinv'_k(T) \leq sinv_k(T)$ for some tournament $T$ of order $2k+1$;
  $(vi):$ if $T$ is a tournament of order at least $19k-2$ (resp. $11k-2$), then $sinv'_k(T) \leq sinv_k(T) \leq 1$ (resp. $sinv_k(T) \leq 3$);
  $(vii):$ for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists $C$ such that $sinv'_k(T) \leq sinv_k(T) \leq C$ for every tournament $T$ on at least $2k+1 + \epsilon k$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Degree-$M$ Bethe and Sinkhorn Permanent Based Bounds on the Permanent of a Non-negative Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The permanent of a non-negative square matrix can be well approximated by finding the minimum of the Bethe free energy functions associated with some suitably defined factor graph; the resulting approximation to the permanent is called the Bethe permanent. Vontobel gave a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe permanent via degree-$M$ Bethe permanents, which are based on degree-$M$ covers of the underlying factor graph. In this paper, we prove a degree-$M$-Bethe-permanent-based lower bound on the permanent of a non-negative matrix, which solves a conjecture proposed by Vontobel in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Mar. 2013]. We also prove a degree-$M$-Bethe-permanent-based upper bound on the permanent of a non-negative matrix. In the limit $M \to \infty$, these lower and upper bounds yield known Bethe-permanent-based lower and upper bounds on the permanent of a non-negative matrix. Moreover, we prove similar results for an approximation to the permanent known as the (scaled) Sinkhorn permanent.</description>

      <title>Thresholds for zero-sums with small cross numbers in abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an additive group $\Gamma$ the sequence $S = (g_1, \ldots, g_t)$ of elements of $\Gamma$ is a zero-sum sequence if $g_1 + \cdots + g_t = 0_\Gamma$. The cross number of $S$ is defined to be the sum $\sum_{i=1}^k 1/|g_i|$, where $|g_i|$ denotes the order of $g_i$ in $\Gamma$. Call $S$ good if it contains a zero-sum subsequence with cross number at most 1. In 1993, Geroldinger proved that if $\Gamma$ is abelian then every length $|\Gamma|$ sequence of its elements is good, generalizing a 1989 result of Lemke and Kleitman that had proved an earlier conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Lemke. In 1989 Chung re-proved the Lemke and Kleitman result by applying a theorem of graph pebbling, and in 2005, Elledge and Hurlbert used graph pebbling to re-prove and generalize Geroldinger's result. Here we use probabilistic theorems from graph pebbling to derive a threshold version of Geroldinger's theorem for abelian groups of a certain form. Specifically, we prove that if $p_1, \ldots, p_d$ are (not necessarily distinct) primes and $\Gamma_k$ has the form $\prod_{i=1}^d {\mathbb Z}_{p_i^k}$ then there is a function $\tau=\tau(k)$ (which we specify in Theorem 4) with the following property: if $t-\tau\rightarrow\infty$ as $k\rightarrow\infty$ then the probability that $S$ is good in $\Gamma_k$ tends to 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper lies in the context of the studies of eigenfunctions of graphs having minimum cardinality of support. One of the tools is the weight-distribution bound, a lower bound on the cardinality of support of an eigenfunction of a distance-regular graph corresponding to a non-principal eigenvalue. The tightness of the weight-distribution bound was previously shown in general for the smallest eigenvalue of a Grassmann graph. However, a characterisation of optimal eigenfunctions was not obtained. Motivated by this open problem, we consider the class of strongly regular Grassmann graphs and give the required characterisation in this case. We then show the tightness of the weight-distribution bound for block graphs of affine designs (defined on the lines of an affine space with two lines being adjacent when intersect) and obtain a similar characterisation of optimal eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Maker-Breaker domination game played on corona products of graphs</title>

Abstract: In the Maker-Breaker domination game, Dominator and Staller play on a graph $G$ by taking turns in which each player selects a not yet played vertex of $G$. Dominator's goal is to select all the vertices in a dominating set, while Staller aims to prevent this from happening. In this paper, the game is investigated on corona products of graphs. Its outcome is determined as a function of the outcome of the game on the second factor. Staller-Maker-Breaker domination numbers are determined for arbitrary corona products, while Maker-Breaker domination numbers of corona products are bounded from both sides. All the bounds presented are demonstrated to be sharp. Corona products as well as general graphs with small (Staller-)Maker-Breaker domination numbers are described.</description>

      <title>Fractal dimensions for Iterated Graph Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01987v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon [1], this study aims to introduce fractal geometry into graph theory, and to establish a potential theoretical foundation for complex networks. Specifically, we employ the method of substitution to create and explore fractal-like graphs, termed deterministic or random iterated graph systems. While the concept of substitution is commonplace in fractal geometry and dynamical systems, its analysis in the context of graph theory remains a nascent field.
  By delving into the properties of these systems, including diameter and distal, we derive two primary outcomes. Firstly, within the deterministic iterated graph systems, we establish that the Minkowski dimension and Hausdorff dimension align analytically through explicit formulae. Secondly, in the case of random iterated graph systems, we demonstrate that almost every graph limit exhibits identical Minkowski and Hausdorff dimensions numerically by their Lyapunov exponents.
  The exploration of iterated graph systems holds the potential to unveil novel directions. These findings not only, mathematically, contribute to our understanding of the interplay between fractals and graphs, but also, physically, suggest promising avenues for applications for complex networks.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Approach for Nonparametric Analysis of Random Utility Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14249v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We readdress the problem of nonparametric statistical testing of random utility models proposed in Kitamura and Stoye (2018). Although their test is elegant, it is subject to computational constraints which leaves execution of the test infeasible in many applications. We note that much of the computational burden in Kitamura and Stoye's test is due to their test defining a polyhedral cone through its vertices rather than its faces. We propose an alternative but equivalent hypothesis test for random utility models. This test relies on a series of equality and inequality constraints which defines the faces of the corresponding polyhedral cone. Building on our testing procedure, we develop a novel axiomatization of the random utility model. Our new axiom can be interpreted as a condition on surplus allocation in cooperative games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks are typically used to learn from data that lives on a graph. However, for any graph $G$ that has $n$ vertices, using the symmetric group $S_n$ as its group of symmetries does not take into account the relations that exist between the vertices. Given that the actual group of symmetries is the automorphism group Aut$(G)$, we show how to construct neural networks that are equivariant to Aut$(G)$ by obtaining a full characterisation of the learnable, linear, Aut$(G)$-equivariant functions between layers that are some tensor power of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In particular, we find a spanning set of matrices for these layer functions in the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This result has important consequences for learning from data whose group of symmetries is a finite group because a theorem by Frucht (1938) showed that any finite group is isomorphic to the automorphism group of a graph.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be an undirected and simple graph. A set $ S $ of vertices in $\Gamma$ is called a {cyclic vertex cutset} of $\Gamma$ if $\Gamma - S$ is disconnected and has at least two components containing cycles. If $\Gamma$ has a cyclic vertex cutset, then it is said to be {cyclically separable}. The {cyclic vertex connectivity} of $\Gamma$ is the minimum of cardinalities of the cyclic vertex cutsets of $\Gamma$. The {power graph} $\mathcal{P}(G)$ of a group $G$ is the undirected and simple graph whose vertices are the elements $G$ and two vertices are adjacent if one of them is the power of other in $G$. In this paper, we first characterize the finite $ p $-groups ($p$ is a prime number) whose power graphs are cyclically separable in terms of their maximal cyclic subgroups. Then we characterize the finite $ p $-groups whose power graphs have equal vertex connectivity and cyclic vertex connectivity.</description>

      <title>Non-backtracking eigenvalues and eigenvectors of random regular graphs and hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-backtracking operator of a graph is a powerful tool in spectral graph theory and random matrix theory. Most existing results for the non-backtracking operator of a random graph concern only eigenvalues or top eigenvectors. In this paper, we take the first step in analyzing its bulk eigenvector behaviors. We demonstrate that for the non-backtracking operator $B$ of a random $d$-regular graph, its eigenvectors corresponding to nontrivial eigenvalues are completely delocalized with high probability. Additionally, we show complete delocalization for a reduced $2n \times 2n$ non-backtracking matrix $\tilde{B}$. By projecting all eigenvalues of $\tilde{B}$ onto the real line, we obtain an empirical measure that converges weakly in probability to the Kesten-McKay law for fixed $d\geq 3$ and to a semicircle law as $d \to\infty$ with $n \to\infty$. We extend our analysis to random regular hypergraphs, including the limiting measure of the real part of the spectrum for $\tilde{B}$, $\ell_{\infty}$-norm bounds for the eigenvectors of $\tilde{B}$ and $B$, and a deterministic relation between eigenvectors of $B$ and the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix.
  As an application, we analyze the non-backtracking spectrum of the regular stochastic block model (RSBM) and provide a spectral method based on eigenvectors of $\tilde{B}$ to recover the community structure exactly. We also show that there exists an isolated real eigenvalue with an informative eigenvector inside the circle of radius $\sqrt{d_1+d_2-1}$ in the spectrum of $B$, analogous to the "eigenvalue insider" phenomenon for the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi stochastic block model conjectured in Dall'Amico et al. (2019).</description>

Abstract: Basic algebraic and combinatorial properties of finite vector spaces in which individual vectors are allowed to have multiplicities larger than $ 1 $ are derived. An application in coding theory is illustrated by showing that multispace codes that are introduced here may be used in random linear network coding scenarios, and that they generalize standard subspace codes (defined in the set of all subspaces of $ \mathbb{F}_q^n $) and extend them to an infinitely larger set of parameters. In particular, in contrast to subspace codes, multispace codes of arbitrarily large cardinality and minimum distance exist for any fixed $ n $ and $ q $.</description>

Abstract: Given an integer $M\geq 2$, we deploy the generating function techniques to compute the number of $M$-th roots of identity in some of the well-known finite groups of Lie type, more precisely for finite general linear groups, symplectic groups, orthogonal groups of all types and unitary groups over finite fields of odd characteristics.</description>
