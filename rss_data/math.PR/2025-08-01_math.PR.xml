      <title>Scaling limits of multitype Bienaym\'e trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider critical multitype Bienaym\'e trees that are either irreducible or possess a critical irreducible component with attached subcritical components. These trees are studied under two distinct conditioning frameworks: first, conditioning on the value of a linear combination of the numbers of vertices of given types; and second, conditioning on the precise number of vertices belonging to a selected subset of types. We prove that, under a finite exponential moment condition, the scaling limit as the tree size tends to infinity is given by the Brownian Continuum Random Tree. Additionally, we establish strong non-asymptotic tail bounds for the height of such trees. Our main tools include a flattening operation applied to multitype trees and sharp estimates regarding the structure of monotype trees with a given sequence of degrees.</description>

      <title>Killed path-dependent McKean-Vlasov SDEs for a probabilistic representation of non-conservative McKean PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation subject to killing associated to a regularised non-conservative and path-dependent nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation is studied. The existence and pathwise uniqueness of a strong solution and the regularity properties of its sub-probability law are proved. The density of such a law may be seen as a weak solution of the considered PDE. The well-posedness of the associated particle system is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Matching Large Deviation Bounds of the Zero-Range Process in the whole space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the large deviations of the hydrodynamic rescaling of the zero-range process on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in any dimension $d\ge 1$. Under mild and canonical hypotheses on the local jump rate, we obtain matching upper and lower bounds, thus resolving the problem opened by \cite{KL99}. On the probabilistic side, we extend the superexponential estimate to any dimension, and prove the superexponential concentration on paths with finite entropy dissipation. In addition, we extend the theory of the parabolic-hyperbolic skeleton equation to the whole space, and remove global convexity/concavity assumptions on the nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative self-decomposition of the exponential and gamma distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplicative self-decomposable laws describe random variables that can be decomposed into a product of a scaled-down version of themselves and an independent residual term. Shanbhag et al.~(1977) have shown that the gamma distribution is multiplicative self-decomposable (in particular, the exponential distribution). As a result, they established the multiplicative self-decomposability of the absolute value of a centered normal random variable. A limitation of Shanbhag's result is that the distribution of the residual component is not explicitly identified. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by providing an explicit distribution of the residual term. In more detail, the residual term follows an $M$-Wright distribution in the case of the exponential distribution, whereas for the gamma distribution it follows a Fox $H$-function distribution. This, in turn, enables us to identify the distribution of the residual term of the absolute value of a centered normal random variable as a Wright distribution.</description>

      <title>Exact values of Fourier dimensions of Gaussian multiplicative chaos on high dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the exact values of the Fourier dimensions for Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos measures on the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^d$ for all integers $d \ge 1$. This resolves a problem left open in previous works [LQT24,LQT25] for high dimensions $d\ge 3$. The proof relies on a new construction of log-correlated Gaussian fields admitting specific decompositions into smooth processes with high regularity. This construction enables a multi-resolution analysis to obtain sharp local estimates on the measure's Fourier decay. These local estimates are then integrated into a global bound using Pisier's martingale type inequality for vector-valued martingales.</description>

      <title>Smallest gaps of the two-dimensional Coulomb gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Coulomb gas with general potential at the determinantal temperature, or equivalently, the eigenvalues of random normal matrices. We prove that the smallest gaps between particles are typically of order $n^{-3/4}$, and that the associated joint point process of gap locations and gap sizes, after rescaling the gaps by $n^{3/4}$, converges to a Poisson point process. As a consequence, we show that the $k$-th smallest rescaled gap has a limiting density proportional to $x^{4k-1}e^{-\frac{\mathcal{J}}{4}x^{4}}$, where $\mathcal{J}=\pi^{2}\int \rho(z)^{3}d^{2}z$ and $\rho$ is the density of the equilibrium measure. This generalizes a result of Shi and Jiang beyond the quadratic potential.</description>

      <title>McKean-Vlasov equations with singular coefficients - a review of recent results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on recent works on McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) involving singular coefficients. After recalling the classical framework, we review existing recent literature depending on the type of singularities of the coefficients: on the one hand they satisfy some integrability and measurability conditions only, while on the other hand the drift is allowed to be a generalised function. Different types of dependencies on the law of the unknown and different noises will also be considered. McKean-Vlasov SDEs are closely related to non-linear Fokker-Planck equations that are satisfied by the law (or its density) of the unknown. These connections are often established also in this singular setting and will be reviewed here. Important tools for dealing with singular coefficients are also included in the paper, such as Figalli-Trevisan superposition principle, Zvonkin transformation, Markov marginal uniqueness, and stochastic sewing lemma.</description>

      <title>A stochastic heat equation with non-locally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic heat equation (SHE) on the torus $\mathbb{T}=[0,1]$, driven by space-time white noise $\dot W$, with an initial condition $u_0$ that is nonnegative and not identically zero:
  \begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \tfrac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + b(u) + \sigma(u)\dot{W}.
  \end{equation*} The drift $b$ and diffusion coefficient $\sigma$ are Lipschitz continuous away from zero, although their Lipschitz constants may blow up as the argument approaches zero. We establish the existence of a unique global mild solution that remains strictly positive. Examples include $b(u)=u|\log u|^{A_1}$ and $\sigma(u)=u|\log u|^{A_2}$ with $A_1\in(0,1)$ and $A_2\in(0,1/4)$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for aggregated interdependent multivariate subexponential claims with general investment returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates asymptotic estimates for the entrance probability of the discounted aggregate claim vector from a multivariate renewal risk model into some rare set. We provide asymptotic results for the entrance probability on both finite and infinite time horizons under various assumptions regarding the stochastic price process of the investment portfolio, the distribution class of claim vectors, and the dependence structure among the claim vectors. We note that the main results extend beyond the class of multivariate regular variation. Furthermore, we introduce two dependence structures to model the dependence among the claim vectors. The immediate consequence of the main results is the asymptotic estimates of the ruin probabilities on finite and infinite time horizons</description>

      <title>General diffusions on metric graphs as limits of time-space Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Space-Time Markov Chain Approximation (STMCA) for a general diffusion process on a finite metric graph $\Gamma$. The STMCA is a doubly asymmetric (in both time and space) random walk defined on a subdivisions of $\Gamma$, with transition probabilities and conditional transition times that match, in expectation, those of the target diffusion. We derive bounds on the $p$-Wasserstein distances between the diffusion and its STMCA in terms of a thinness quantifier of the subdivision. This bound shows that convergence occurs at any rate inferior to $\frac{1}{4} \wedge \frac{1}{p} $ in terms of the the maximum cell size of the subdivision, for adapted subdivisions, at any rate inferior to $\frac{1}{2} \wedge \frac{2}{p} $. Additionally, we provide explicit analytical formulas for transition probabilities and times, enabling practical implementation of the STMCA. Numerical experiments illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>The Squishy Grid Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of approximating Euclidean distances by the infinite integer grid graph. Although the topology of the graph is fixed, we have control over the edge-weight assignment $w:E\to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, and hope to have grid distances be asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, that is, for all grid points $u,v$, $\mathrm{dist}_w(u,v) = (1\pm o(1))\|u-v\|_2$. We give three methods for solving this problem, each attractive in its own way.
  * Our first construction is based on an embedding of the recursive, non-periodic pinwheel tiling of Radin and Conway into the integer grid. Distances in the pinwheel graph are asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, but no explicit bound on the rate of convergence was known. We prove that the multiplicative distortion of the pinwheel graph is $(1+1/\Theta(\log^\xi \log D))$, where $D$ is the Euclidean distance and $\xi=\Theta(1)$. The pinwheel tiling approach is conceptually simple, but can be improved quantitatively.
  * Our second construction is based on a hierarchical arrangement of "highways." It is simple, achieving stretch $(1 + 1/\Theta(D^{1/9}))$, which converges doubly exponentially faster than the pinwheel tiling approach.
  * The first two methods are deterministic. An even simpler approach is to sample the edge weights independently from a common distribution $\mathscr{D}$. Whether there exists a distribution $\mathscr{D}^*$ that makes grid distances Euclidean, asymptotically and in expectation, is major open problem in the theory of first passage percolation. Previous experiments show that when $\mathscr{D}$ is a Fisher distribution, grid distances are within 1\% of Euclidean. We demonstrate experimentally that this level of accuracy can be achieved by a simple 2-point distribution that assigns weights 0.41 or 4.75 with probability 44\% and 56\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Mean-field approximation, Gibbs relaxation, and cross estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the propagation of chaos and the relaxation to Gibbs equilibrium for a system of $N$ classical Brownian particles with weak mean-field interactions. While it is known that propagation of chaos holds at rate $O(N^{-1})$ uniformly in time, and Gibbs relaxation at rate $O(e^{-ct})$ uniformly in $N$, we go a step further by showing that the cross error between chaos propagation and Gibbs relaxation is $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. For translation-invariant systems on the torus, this leads to an improved mean-field approximation error at the level of the one-particle density: the error decreases from $O(N^{-1})$ to $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. Our approach relies on a detailed analysis of the BBGKY hierarchy for correlation functions, and applies to both underdamped and overdamped Langevin dynamics with merely bounded interaction forces. We also derive new results on Gibbs relaxation and present partial extensions beyond the weak interaction regime.</description>

      <title>Optimal compressed sensing for mixing stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jalali and Poor introduced an asymptotic framework for compressed sensing of stochastic processes, demonstrating that any rate strictly greater than the mean information dimension serves as an upper bound on the number of random linear measurements required for (universal) almost lossless recovery of $\psi^*$-mixing processes, as measured in the normalized $L^2$ norm. In this work, we show that if the normalized number of random linear measurements is strictly less than the mean information dimension, then almost lossless recovery of a $\psi^*$-mixing process is impossible by any sequence of decompressors. This establishes the mean information dimension as the fundamental limit for compressed sensing in this setting (and, in fact, the precise threshold for the problem). To this end, we introduce a new quantity, related to techniques from geometric measure theory: the correlation dimension rate, which is shown to be a lower bound for compressed sensing of arbitrary stationary stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>CLT in high-dimensional Bayesian linear regression with low SNR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study central limit theorems for linear statistics in high-dimensional Bayesian linear regression with product priors. Unlike the existing literature where the focus is on posterior contraction, we work under a non-contracting regime where neither the likelihood nor the prior dominates the other. This is motivated by modern high-dimensional datasets characterized by a bounded signal-to-noise ratio. This work takes a first step towards understanding limit distributions for one-dimensional projections of the posterior, as well as the posterior mean, in such regimes. Analogous to contractive settings, the resulting limiting distributions are Gaussian, but they heavily depend on the chosen prior and center around the Mean-Field approximation of the posterior. We study two concrete models of interest to illustrate this phenomenon -- the white noise design, and the (misspecified) Bayesian model. As an application, we construct credible intervals and compute their coverage probability under any misspecified prior. Our proofs rely on a combination of recent developments in Berry-Esseen type bounds for Random Field Ising models and both first and second order Poincar\'{e} inequalities. Notably, our results do not require any sparsity assumptions on the prior.</description>

      <title>Volatility Modeling with Rough Paths: A Signature-Based Alternative to Classical Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare two methodologies for calibrating implied volatility surfaces: a second-order asymptotic expansion method derived via Malliavin calculus, and a data-driven approach based on path signatures from rough path theory. The former, developed in Al\`os et al. (2015), yields efficient and accurate calibration formulas under the assumption that the asset price follows a Heston-type stochastic volatility model. The latter models volatility as a linear functional of the signature of a primary stochastic process, enabling a flexible approximation without requiring a specific parametric form.
  Our numerical experiments show that the signature-based method achieves calibration accuracy comparable to the asymptotic approach when the true dynamics are Heston. We then test the model in a more general setting where the asset follows a rough Bergomi volatility process-a regime beyond the scope of the asymptotic expansion-and show that the signature approach continues to deliver accurate results. These findings highlight the model-independence, robustness and adaptability of signature-based calibration methods in settings where volatility exhibits rough or non-Markovian features.</description>

      <title>Threshold-Driven Streaming Graph: Expansion and Rumor Spreading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A randomized distributed algorithm called RAES was introduced in [Becchetti et al., SODA 2020] to extract a bounded-degree expander from a dense $n$-vertex expander graph $G = (V, E)$. The algorithm relies on a simple threshold-based procedure. A key assumption in [Becchetti et al., SODA 2020] is that the input graph $G$ is static - i.e., both its vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$ remain unchanged throughout the process - while the analysis of RAES in dynamic models is left as a major open question.
  In this work, we investigate the behavior of RAES under a dynamic graph model induced by a streaming node-churn process (also known as the sliding window model), where, at each discrete round, a new node joins the graph and the oldest node departs. This process yields a bounded-degree dynamic graph $\mathcal{G} =\{ G_t = (V_t, E_t) : t \in \mathbb{N}\}$ that captures essential characteristics of peer-to-peer networks -- specifically, node churn and threshold on the number of connections each node can manage. We prove that every snapshot $G_t$ in the dynamic graph sequence has good expansion properties with high probability. Furthermore, we leverage this property to establish a logarithmic upper bound on the completion time of the well-known PUSH and PULL rumor spreading protocols over the dynamic graph $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <title>Tree-indexed sums of Catalan numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of infinite sums of products of Catalan numbers, indexed by trees. We show that these sums are polynomials in $1/\pi$ with rational coefficients; the proof is effective and provides an algorithm to explicitly compute these sums. Along the way we introduce parametric liftings of our sums, and show that they are polynomials in the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind. Moreover, the degrees of these polynomials are at most half of the number of vertices of the tree. The computation of these tree-indexed sums is motivated by the study of large meandric systems, which are non-crossing configurations of loops in the plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the information geometry of L\'evy processes. As a starting point, we derive the $\alpha$-divergence between two L\'evy processes. Subsequently, the Fisher information matrix and the $\alpha$-connection associated with the geometry of L\'evy processes are computed from the $\alpha$-divergence. In addition, we discuss statistical applications of this information geometry. As illustrative examples, we investigate the differential-geometric structures of various L\'evy processes relevant to financial modeling, including tempered stable processes, the CGMY model, and variance gamma processes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show local well-posedness of the g-PAM and the $\phi^{K+1}_2$-equation for $K\geq 1$ on the two-dimensional torus when the coefficient field is random and correlated to the driving noise. In the setting considered here, even when the model in the sense of [Hai14] is stationary, naive use of renormalisation constants in general leads to variance blow-up. Instead, we prove convergence of renormalised models choosing random renormalisation functions analogous to the deterministic variable coefficient setting. The main technical contribution are stochastic estimates on the model in this correlated setting which are obtained by a combination of heat kernel asymptotics, Gaussian integration by parts formulae and Hairer--Quastel type bounds [HQ18].</description>

      <title>Parity questions in critical planar Brownian loop-soups (or "where did the free planar bosons go?")</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical two-dimensional Brownian loop-soup is an infinite collection of non-interacting Brownian loops in a planar domain that possesses some combinatorial features related to the notion of indistinguishability of bosons. The properly renormalized occupation time field of this collection of loops is known to be distributed like the properly defined square of a Gaussian free field. In the present paper, we investigate aspects of the question about how much information these fields provide about the loop-soup. Among other things, we show that the exact set of points that are actually visited by some loops in the loop-soup is not determined by these fields. We further prove that given the fields, a dense family of special points will each have a conditional probability 1/2 of being part of the loop-soup. We also exhibit another instance where the possible decompositions (given the field) into individual loops and excursions can be grouped into two clearly different groups, each having a conditional probability 1/2 of occurring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modelling the evolution of a continuous trait in a biological population is one of the oldest problems in evolutionary biology, which led to the birth of quantitative genetics. With the recent development of GWAS methods, it has become essential to link the evolution of the trait distribution to the underlying evolution of allelic frequencies at many loci, co-contributing to the trait value. The way most articles go about this is to make assumptions on the trait distribution, and use Wright's formula to model how the evolution of the trait translates on each individual locus. Here, we take a gene's eye-view of the system, starting from an explicit finite-loci model with selection, drift, recombination and mutation, in which the trait value is a direct product of the genome. We let the number of loci go to infinity under the assumption of strong recombination, and characterize the limit behavior of a given locus with a McKean-Vlasov SDE and the corresponding Fokker-Planck IPDE. In words, the selection on a typical locus depends on the mean behaviour of the other loci which can be approximated with the law of the focal locus. Results include the independence of two loci and explicit stationary distribution for allelic frequencies at a given locus (under some assumptions on the fitness function).</description>

      <title>General diffusions on the star graph as time-changed Walsh Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the representation of general regular diffusions on star-shaped graphs as time-changed Walsh Brownian motions. These are regular continuous Markov processes described locally by a family generalized second order differential operators defined on every edge and a gluing condition at the junction vertex. This allows us to prove two additional results: (i) A representation of diffusions with sticky gluing conditions as time-changes of diffusions governed by the same differential operators but with non-sticky gluing conditions. (ii) An occupation times formula for such diffusions, analogous to the classical It\^o--McKean formula for one-dimensional diffusions.
  Additionally, we prove two results of independent interest. First, conditions under which a diffusion on the star graph is Feller and Feller--Dynkin, extending classical results for one-dimensional diffusions. Second, the existence uniqueness of solutions to the Dirichlet problem on the unit disk of the star graph for a general diffusion operator and explicit expressions for its solution.</description>

      <title>Backward stochastic differential equations with nonlinear Young drivers I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper (alongside its companion, Part II \cite{BSDEYoung-II}) investigates backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) involving a nonlinear Young integral of the form $\int_{t}^{T}g(Y_{r})\eta(dr,X_{r})$, where the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is a space-time H\"older continuous function and $X$ is a diffusion process. Solutions to such equations provide a probabilistic interpretation of the solutions to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) driven by space-time noise.
  Assuming the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is bounded, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to these BSDEs via a modified Picard iteration method. We then derive a comparison principle by analyzing the associated linear BSDEs and establish regularity properties of the solutions. As an application, we obtain Feynman-Kac formulae for a class of linear stochastic heat equations subject to Neumann boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thurstone's latent-normal model, introduced a century ago to describe human preferences in psychometrics (1927), remains a cornerstone for modeling random rankings. Yet when the underlying normals differ in distribution, the joint law of ranks $R_{i}:=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\mathbf{1}_{X_{j}\leq X_{i}}$ is virtually unexplored. We study the simplest non-identically-distributed case: $n+1$ independent normals with $X_{0}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(\mu_{0},\,\sigma_{0}^{2}\right)$ and $X_{i}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(\mu,\,\sigma^{2}\right)$ for $1\leq i\leq n$. Here, $R_0 \mid X_0 \;\sim\; 1 + \mathrm{Binomial}\bigl(n,\;\Phi\bigl(\bigl(X_0 - \mu\bigr)\big/\sigma\bigr)\bigr)$, and the success probability $\Phi\bigl(\bigl(X_0 - \mu\bigr)\big/\sigma\bigr)$ is accurately modeled by a beta distribution. Exploiting beta-binomial conjugacy, we observe that $R_{0}-1$ follows a beta-binomial law, which then yields a precise approximation for the joint distribution of $\left(R_{0},R_{i_{1}},\ldots,R_{i_{m}}\right)$. We derive closed-form expressions for $\mathbb{E}R_{i}$, $\mathrm{Cov}\left(R_{i},R_{j}\right)$, and the limiting distributions of $\left(R_{0},R_{i_{1}},\ldots,R_{i_{m}}\right)$ as key parameters grow large or small.</description>

      <title>On the Approximation of Stationary Processes using the ARMA Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10610v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We look at a problem related to Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, on quantifying the approximation error between a true stationary process $X_t$ and an ARMA model $Y_t$. We take the transfer function representation $x(L)$ of a stationary process $X_t$ and show that the $L^{\infty}$ norm of $x$ acts as a valid norm on $X_t$ that controls the $\ell^2$ norm of its Wold coefficients. We then show that a certain subspace of stationary processes, which includes ARMA models, forms a Banach algebra under the $L^{\infty}$ norm that respects the multiplicative structure of $H^{\infty}$ transfer functions and thus improves on the structural properties of the cepstral norm for ARMA models. The natural definition of invertibility in this algebra is consistent with the original definition of ARMA invertibility, and generalizes better to non-ARMA processes than Wiener's $\ell^1$ condition. Finally, we calculate some explicit approximation bounds in the simpler context of continuous transfer functions, and critique some heuristic ideas on Pad\'e approximations and parsimonious models.</description>

      <title>Electricity Price Prediction Using Multi-Kernel Gaussian Process Regression Combined with Kernel-Based Support Vector Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00123v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new hybrid model for predicting German electricity prices. The algorithm is based on a combination of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Although GPR is a competent model for learning stochastic patterns within data and for interpolation, its performance for out-of-sample data is not very promising. By choosing a suitable data-dependent covariance function, we can enhance the performance of GPR for the German hourly power prices being tested. However, since the out-of-sample prediction is dependent on the training data, the prediction is vulnerable to noise and outliers. To overcome this issue, a separate prediction is calculated using SVR, which applies margin-based optimization. This method is advantageous when dealing with non-linear processes and outliers, since only certain necessary points (support vectors) in the training data are responsible for regression. The individual predictions are then linearly combined using uniform weights. When tested on historic German power prices, this approach outperforms the publicly available benchmarks, namely the LASSO estimated autoregressive regression model, deep neural network provided in the recent research by [1].</description>

      <title>A ZeNN architecture to avoid the Gaussian trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new simple architecture, Zeta Neural Networks (ZeNNs), in order to overcome several shortcomings of standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Namely, in the large width limit, MLPs are non-parametric, they do not have a well-defined pointwise limit, they lose non-Gaussian attributes and become unable to perform feature learning; moreover, finite width MLPs perform poorly in learning high frequencies. The new ZeNN architecture is inspired by three simple principles from harmonic analysis:
  i) Enumerate the perceptons and introduce a non-learnable weight to enforce convergence;
  ii) Introduce a scaling (or frequency) factor;
  iii) Choose activation functions that lead to near orthogonal systems.
  We will show that these ideas allow us to fix the referred shortcomings of MLPs. In fact, in the infinite width limit, ZeNNs converge pointwise, they exhibit a rich asymptotic structure beyond Gaussianity, and perform feature learning. Moreover, when appropriate activation functions are chosen, (finite width) ZeNNs excel at learning high-frequency features of functions with low dimensional domains.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Optimality in Data-Driven Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given data generated by an observable stochastic process, we study how to construct statistically optimal decisions for general stochastic optimization problems. Our setting encompasses non-standard data structures, including data originating from heterogeneous sources or from randomly evolving data-generating mechanisms. We propose a decision-making approach that identifies optimal decisions for which a specific notion of risk of shifted regret decays to zero at a prescribed exponential rate. This optimal decision arises as the solution to a multi-objective optimization problem, which reflects asymptotic behavior properties of the data-generating process. Central to our framework is a rate function that characterizes this behavior via a Laplace principle, thereby generalizing standard concepts from large deviation theory. Our general formulation enables our approach to account for data from uncertain distributions and recovers classical results in data-driven decision making under uncertainty as special cases, including distributionally robust optimization. Moreover, our method enables decision-makers to systematically balance a desired rate of asymptotic risk decay against a potential loss in statistical consistency of the resulting data-driven decision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through illustrative examples from operations research, such as the newsvendor problem, under aleatoric uncertainty induced by heterogeneous data sources.</description>
