      <title>A recursion formula for Branching from $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ to $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any representation of a complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n$, one problem of branching rules to $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-subalgebra is to determine the multiplicity of each irreducible component. In this paper, we derive a recursion formula of such multiplicities by restricting a certain tensor representation in two ways, in which the Pieri's rule is involved. We also investigate branching rules for fundamental representations as they are initial conditions of the recursion formula.</description>

      <title>$K$-type multiplicities in degenerate principal series via Howe duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be one of the complex classical groups ${\rm O}_k$, ${\rm GL}_k$, or ${\rm Sp}_{2k}$. Let $M \subseteq K$ be the block diagonal embedding ${\rm O}_{k_1} \times \cdots \times {\rm O}_{k_r}$ or ${\rm GL}_{k_1} \times \cdots \times {\rm GL}_{k_r}$ or ${\rm Sp}_{2k_1} \times \cdots \times {\rm Sp}_{2k_r}$, respectively. By using Howe duality and seesaw reciprocity as a unified conceptual framework, we prove a formula for the branching multiplicities from $K$ to $M$ which is expressed as a sum of generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, valid within a certain stable range. By viewing $K$ as the complexification of the maximal compact subgroup $K_{\mathbb{R}}$ of the real group $G_{\mathbb{R}} = {\rm GL}(k,\mathbb{R})$, ${\rm GL}(k, \mathbb{C})$, or ${\rm GL}(k,\mathbb{H})$, respectively, one can interpret our branching multiplicities as $K_{\mathbb{R}}$-type multiplicities in degenerate principal series representations of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$. Upon specializing to the minimal $M$, where $k_1 = \cdots = k_r = 1$, we establish a fully general tableau-theoretic interpretation of the branching multiplicities, corresponding to the $K_{\mathbb{R}}$-type multiplicities in the principal series.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Hall algebras of one-dimensional sheaves on surfaces and Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We begin the systematic study of cohomological Hecke operators of modifications of coherent sheaves on a smooth surface $X$, along a fixed proper curve $Z \subset X$. We develop the necessary geometric foundations in order to define the $T$-equivariant cohomological Hall algebra $\mathbf{HA}^{\mathbf{D}, T}_{X,Z}$ of the moduli stack of coherent sheaves on $X$ with set-theoretic support on $Z$, in the setting of a general motivic formalism $\mathbf{D}$. The algebra $\mathbf{HA}^{\mathbf{D}, A}_{X,Z}$ is functorial with respect to closed immersions $Z' \subset Z$ and transformations of the motivic formalism $\mathbf{D}$, and only depends on the formal neighborhood $\widehat{X}_Z$ of $Z$ in $X$.
  Assume $\mathbf{D}$ gives rise to Borel-Moore homology. When $X$ is a resolution of a Kleinian singularity and $Z$ is the exceptional divisor, we explicitly identify $\mathbf{HA}^T_{X,Z}$ with a completed nonstandard positive half $\mathbb{Y}^+_\infty(\mathfrak{g})$ of the affine Yangian $\mathbb{Y}(\mathfrak{g})$ of the corresponding affine ADE type Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Let $Z_1,Z_2 \subset X$ be curves with $Z_1\cap Z_2$ being zero-dimensional. We conjecture a PBW type theorem relating the COHAs of the pairs $(X, Z_1\cup Z_2), (X, Z_1)$, and $(X, Z_2)$ and partially prove it in several interesting cases, including all Kleinian resolutions of singularities and elliptic surfaces of types $D$ and $E$.
  Our main tools are: (i) a continuity theorem describing the behavior of COHAs of objects in the heart of $t$-structures $\tau_n$ when the sequence $(\tau_n)_n$ converges in an appropriate sense to a fixed $t$-structure $\tau_\infty$; (ii) a theorem relating the action of the braid group $B_Q$ by derived autoequivalences on the preprojective algebra of a quiver $Q$ with the algebraic action of $B_Q$ on the associated COHA $\mathbf{HA}^T_Q$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time classical versus quantum algorithms for representation theoretic multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Littlewood-Richardson, Kronecker and plethysm coefficients are fundamental multiplicities of interest in Representation Theory and Algebraic Combinatorics. Determining a combinatorial interpretation for the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients is a major open problem, and prompts the consideration of their computational complexity. Recently it was shown that they behave relatively well with respect to quantum computation, and for some large families there are polynomial time quantum algorithms [Larocca,Havlicek, arXiv:2407.17649] (also [BCGHZ,arXiv:2302.11454]). In this paper we show that for many of those cases the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients can also be computed in polynomial time via classical algorithms, thereby refuting some of the conjectures in [LH24]. This vastly limits the cases in which the desired super-polynomial quantum speedup could be achieved.</description>

      <title>Partial Resolutions of Affine Symplectic Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between the Poisson deformation theory, birational geometry, and Springer theory of partial resolutions of affine symplectic singularities. Let $\rho: X' \rightarrow X$ be a crepant partial resolution of a conical affine symplectic singularity $X$. We show that the Poisson deformation functor of $X'$ is prorepresentable and unobstructed. Additionally, we define a version of the Namikawa Weyl group for these crepant partial resolutions. In particular, the Namikawa Weyl group of $X'$ is a parabolic subgroup of the Namikawa Weyl group of $X$ that is determined by the birational geometry of $X'$. If $\pi: Y \rightarrow X$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial terminalization of $X$ that covers $X'$, we show there is a natural functor from Poisson deformations of $Y$ to those of $X'$. Building on work of Namikawa, we show that this morphism is a Galois covering and the Galois group is the Namikawa Weyl group of $X'$. Finally, we put these partial resolutions and their universal deformations into the context of recent work of McGerty and Nevins, obtaining some preliminary results concerning their Springer theory. In particular, if the universal deformation of $X'$ is rationally smooth, we compute the cohomology of the fibers of $\rho$ in terms of the cohomology of the fibers of $\pi$ and the Namikawa Weyl group of $X'$.</description>

      <title>Cluster categories for completed infinity-gons I: Categorifying triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Paquette and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m recently introduced triangulated categories of arcs in completed infinity-gons, which are discs with an infinite closed set of marked points on their boundary. These categories have many features in common with the cluster categories associated to discs with different sets of marked points. In particular, they have (weak) cluster-tilting subcategories, which Paquette and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m show are in bijection with very special triangulations of the disc. This is in contrast to Igusa and Todorov's earlier work in the uncompleted case, in which every triangulation corresponds to a weak cluster-tilting subcategory.
  In this paper, we replace the triangulated structure of Paquette and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m's category by an extriangulated substructure and prove that, with this structure, the weak cluster-tilting subcategories are once again in bijection with triangulations. We further show that functorial finiteness of a weak cluster-tilting subcategory is equivalent to a very mild condition on the triangulation, which also appears in \c{C}anak\c{c}{\i} and Felikson's study of infinite rank cluster algebras from Teichm\"uller theory. By comparison with the combinatorics of triangulations, we are also able to characterise when weak cluster-tilting subcategories can be mutated in this new extriangulated category.</description>

      <title>Projective Modules and Cohomology for Integral Basic Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebras defined over fields of characteristic zero and positive characteristic usually do not behave the same way. However, for certain algebras, for example the group algebras, they behave the same way as the characteristic zero case at "good enough" prime. In this paper, we initiate the study of this topic by imposing increasingly strong hypotheses on basic algebras. When the algebras satisfy the right hypotheses, we have equalities of the dimensions of their cohomology groups between simple modules and equalities of graded Cartan numbers. The examples include the Solomon descent algebras of finite Coxeter groups at large enough primes, nilCoxeter algebra, and certain finite semigroup algebras at an arbitrary prime.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture via the branching rule for $\imath$quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Naito--Sagaki conjecture asserts that the branching rule for the restriction of finite-dimensional, irreducible polynomial representations of $GL_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to $Sp_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ amounts to the enumeration of certain ``rational paths'' satisfying specific conditions. This conjecture can be thought of as a non-Levi type analog of the Levi type branching rule, stated in terms of the path model due to Littelmann, and was proved combinatorially in 2018 by Schumann--Torres. In this paper, we give a new proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture independently of Schumann--Torres, using the branching rule based on the crystal basis theory for $\imath$quantum groups of type $\mathrm{AII}_{2n-1}$. Here, note that $\imath$quantum groups are certain coideal subalgebras of a quantized universal enveloping algebra obtained by $q$-deforming symmetric pairs, and also regarded as a generalization of quantized universal enveloping algebras; these were defined by Letzter in 1999, and since then their representation theory has become an active area of research. The main ingredients of our approach are certain combinatorial operations, such as promotion operators and Kashiwara operators, which are well-suited to the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Homological Mirror Symmetry for Hypertoric Varieties I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.10646v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider homological mirror symmetry in the context of hypertoric varieties, showing that appropriate categories of B-branes (that is, coherent sheaves) on an additive hypertoric variety match a category of A-branes on a Dolbeault hypertoric manifold for the same underlying combinatorial data. For technical reasons, the category of A-branes we consider is the modules over a deformation quantization (that is, DQ-modules). We consider objects in this category equipped with an analogue of a Hodge structure, which corresponds to a $\mathbb{G}_m$-action on the dual side of the mirror symmetry.
  This result is based on hands-on calculations in both categories. We analyze coherent sheaves by constructing a tilting generator, using the characteristic $p$ approach of Kaledin; the result is a sum of line bundles, which can be described using a simple combinatorial rule. The endomorphism algebra $H$ of this tilting generator has a simple quadratic presentation in the grading induced by $\mathbb{G}_m$-equivariance. In fact, we can confirm it is Koszul, and compute its Koszul dual $H^!$.
  We then show that this same algebra appears as an Ext-algebra of simple A-branes in a Dolbeault hypertoric manifold. The $\mathbb{G}_m$-equivariant grading on coherent sheaves matches a Hodge grading in this category.</description>
