      <title>Radicals of Biduals of Beurling Algebras Can Be Different for the Two Arens Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\operatorname{rad}$ denote the Jacobson radical of a Banach algebra, and let $\Box$ and $\Diamond$ denote the two Arens products on its bidual. We give an example of a Beurling algebra $\mathcal{A}$ for which $\operatorname{rad}(\mathcal{A}^{**}, \Box) \neq \operatorname{rad}(\mathcal{A}^{**}, \Diamond)$, answering a question of Dales and Lau. The underlying group in our example is the free group on three generators.</description>

      <title>The Weyl-von Neumann theorem for antilinear skew-self-adjoint operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the Weyl-von Neumann theorem for antilinear skew-self-adjoint operators. More specifically, we prove the following:
  Let $A$ be an antilinear skew-self-adjoint operator on a separable Hilbert space $H$ whose kernel is either even dimensional or infinite dimensional. Let $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Then for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists an antilinear skew block diagonal operator $D$ and an antilinear Schatten $p$-class operator $K$ such that $A=K+D$ with $\|K\|_{p}&lt;\epsilon$.
  As a consequence of this, we prove the Weyl-von Neumann theorem for complex skew-symmetric operators:
  Let $\tau$ be a conjugation on $H$ and let $T$ be a $\tau$-skew-symmetric bounded linear operator with $\dim N(T)=\infty$ or $\dim N(T)$ is even. Let $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Then for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists a $\tau$-skew-symmetric Schatten $p$-class operator $K$, a skew-symmetric block diagonal operator $D$ and a unitary operator $U$ such that $T=K+UDU^{tr}$ and $\|K\|_{p}&lt;\epsilon$, where $U^{tr}$ is the transpose of $U$ with respect to an orthonormal basis ${\{e_n:n\in \mathbb N}\}$ such that $\tau(e_n)=e_n$ for each $n\in \mathbb N$.
  Furthermore, the above result holds even without any assumption on the dimension of $N(T)$, provided that $N(T)=N(T^*)$.</description>

      <title>Invariant Extremal Projections for Operator-Ordered Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an extremal projection principle for families of operators ordered by domination, induced by fixed bounded linear mappings acting on a source with an additive baseline. Stability is defined through domination of second--order structure, leading to a covariance envelope of admissible sources ordered by the L\"owner relation.
  Our main result establishes an envelope extremal principle: the maximal value of the quadratic functional over the entire envelope coincides with that of a single extremal configuration, which may lie only in the closure of the admissible class. This identification is obtained without convexity, compactness, or any global Hilbert space structure governing all components of the system, and relies instead on an operator--theoretic approximation scheme.
  As a consequence, minimax optimization over stability sets reduces to an ordinary quadratic minimization problem with well--posed existence and uniqueness properties for the associated minimizing operators. Structural properties of covariance envelopes are also derived, including density, closure, and spectral characterizations in stationary settings.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation of Continuous Functionals on Compact Subsets via Linear Measurements and Scalar Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study universal approximation of continuous functionals on compact subsets of products of Hilbert spaces. We prove that any such functional can be uniformly approximated by models that first take finitely many continuous linear measurements of the inputs and then combine these measurements through continuous scalar nonlinearities. We also extend the approximation principle to maps with values in a Banach space, yielding finite-rank approximations. These results provide a compact-set justification for the common ``measure, apply scalar nonlinearities, then combine'' design pattern used in operator learning and imaging.</description>

      <title>Base norm spaces--classical, complex, and noncommutative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of base norm spaces to the complex case, and further to the noncommutative setting relevant to `quantum convexity'. In particular, we establish the duality between complex Archimedean order unit spaces and complex base norm spaces, as well as the corresponding duality between their noncommutative counterparts. Additional topics include an exploration of natural connections with various notions of quantum convexity and regularity of noncommutative convex sets, and an analysis of how these concepts interact with complexification. We also define, as in the classical case, a class that contains and generates the noncommutative base norm spaces, but is defined by fewer axioms. We show how this may be applied to provide new and interesting examples of noncommutative base norm spaces.</description>

      <title>Regularity of compact convex sets--classical and noncommutative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical theory of regularity of embeddings of compact convex sets was developed in the 1970s, exclusively in the real case, and even there it does not appear to have been stated in its simplest form. We begin by revisiting this setting, showing that under a reasonable condition, every locally convex topological vector space $E$ that contains and is spanned by a compact convex set lying in a hyperplane not passing through the origin, is a (specific) dual Banach space equipped with the weak* topology. Second, we establish the corresponding regularity theory for convex sets in complex LCTVS's. Third, we develop a theory of regular embeddings for complex noncommutative convex sets, in the sense of Davidson and Kennedy. Finally, we use the complex theory to derive a theory of regular embeddings for real noncommutative convex sets. Interestingly, at present there appears to be no direct route to the latter.</description>

      <title>The R-Shilov boundary for a local operator space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To extend the notion of the injective envelope of a unital operator space to the locally convex case, Dosi (2014) first introduced the notion of the injective R-envelope for a unital operator space and then defined the injective R-envelope for a unital local operator space as the closure of the injective R-envelope for its bounded part. In this paper, we investigate the existence of the Shilov boundary ideal in this context, as defined by Arveson (1969). To do this, by following the conceptual frameworks underlying Hamana's constructions of the injective envelope and the C*-envelope, respectively, we define the notions of the injective R-envelope and the R-C*-envelope for a unital local operator space. Furthermore, we show that the injective R-envelope construction given by us coincides with the one given by Dosi (2014).</description>

      <title>On the maximal perimeter of isotropic log-concave probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the maximal perimeter constant of isotropic log-concave probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$. For a measure $\mu$, this quantity, denoted by $\Gamma(\mu)$, is defined as the supremum of the $\mu$-perimeter over all convex bodies and measures the largest possible boundary contribution of convex sets with respect to $\mu$. Let $$\Gamma_n := \sup\{\Gamma(\mu) : \mu \text{ is an isotropic log-concave probability measure on } \mathbb{R}^n\}.$$ We prove that $\Gamma_n \leqslant Cn^{3/2}$, where $C&gt;0$ is an absolute constant. This result improves the previously known $O(n^2)$ upper bound. Under additional structural assumptions, we obtain sharp linear bounds of order $O(n)$.</description>

      <title>Preserving Besov (fractional Sobolev) energies under sphericalization and flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new sphericalization mapping for metric spaces that is applicable in very general situations, including totally disconnected fractal type sets. For an unbounded complete metric space which is uniformly perfect at a base point for large radii and equipped with a doubling measure, we make a more specific construction based on the measure and equip it with a weighted measure. This mapping is then shown to preserve the doubling property of the measure and the Besov (fractional Sobolev) energy.
  The corresponding results for flattening of bounded complete metric spaces are also obtained. Finally, it is shown that for the composition of a sphericalization with a flattening, or vice versa, the obtained space is biLipschitz equivalent with the original space and the resulting measure is comparable to the original measure.</description>

      <title>Some Geometric Aspects Related to Lim's Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their seminal work, Lau and Mah (1986) study $w^*$-normal structure in the space of operators $\mathcal{L}(H)$, on a Hilbert space $H$, using a geometric property of the dual unit ball called Lim's condition. In this paper, we study a weaker form of Lim's condition, which we call property ($\ddagger$), for $C^\ast$-algebras, uniform algebras, and $L^1$-predual spaces. In the case of a $C^\ast$-algebra, we prove that property $(\ddagger)$ is equivalent to Lim's condition and consequently, we obtain a geometric characterization of $C^*$-algebras which are $c_0$-direct sum of finite-dimensional operator spaces. For a uniform algebra, we extend a result of Lau and Mah to show that property $(\ddagger)$ implies that the space is finite-dimensional. In the case of an $L^1$-predual space, we show that this condition implies $k$-smoothness of the norm in the sense considered in Lin and Rao (2007).</description>

  the analogous problem for the classes of regular

      <title>The wanted extension of Fujii and Tsurumaru's formula for the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by a recent paper of Yuki Fujii and Toyohiro Tsurumaru in which they established a beautiful formula for the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. To tackle the operator on infinite-dimensional spaces, they elaborated a method based on appropriate approximation of commutators of infinite-dimensional orthogonal projections by commutators of orthogonal projections on finite-dimensional spaces. We here give a proof of Fujii and Tsurumaru's original formula that works in all dimensions. We also present an alternative approximation procedure, uncover the connection of the problem with block Toeplitz operators, and derive good estimates and explicit expressions for the spectral radius in concrete cases.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a group of subexponential growth and $\mathscr C\overset{q}{\to}G$ a Fell bundle. We show that any Banach $^*$-algebra that sits between the associated $\ell^1$-algebra $\ell^1( G\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$ and its $C^*$-envelope has the same topological stable rank and real rank as $\ell^1( G\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$. We apply this result to compute the topological stable rank and real rank of various classes of symmetrized twisted $L^p$-crossed products and show that some twisted $L^p$-crossed products have topological stable rank 1. Our results are new even in the case of (untwisted) group algebras.</description>

Abstract: We show that, on a standard non-atomic probability space, invertible measure-preserving transformations form a dense $G_\delta$ subset of the space of all measure-preserving transformations endowed with the strong (=weak) operator topology. This implies that all properties which are generic for invertible transformations are also generic for general ones.</description>
