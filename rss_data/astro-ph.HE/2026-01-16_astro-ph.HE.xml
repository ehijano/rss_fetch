      <title>New Hard X-Ray and Multiwavelength Study of the PeVatron Candidate PWN G0.9+0.1 in the Galactic Center Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new X-ray study and multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of the young pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by the energetic pulsar PSR J1747-2809, inside the composite supernova remnant (SNR) G0.9+0.1, located in the Galactic Center region. The source is detected by NuSTAR up to 30 keV with evidence for the synchrotron burnoff effect in the changing spatial morphology with increasing energy. The broadband 2-30 keV spectrum of PWN G0.9+0.1 is modeled by a single power law with photon index $\Gamma=2.11\pm0.07$. We combined the new X-ray data with the multiwavelength observations in radio, GeV, and TeV gamma rays and modeled the SED, applying a one-zone and a multi-zone leptonic model. The comparison of the models is successful, as we obtained physically compatible results in the two cases. Through the one-zone model, we constrain the age of the system to $\sim2.2$ kyr, as well as reproduce the observed PWN and SNR radio sizes. In both the one-zone and multi-zone leptonic models, the electron injection spectrum is well-described by a single power law with spectral index $p \sim 2.6$ and a maximum electron energy of $\sim2$ PeV, suggesting the source could be a leptonic PeVatron candidate. We estimate the average magnetic field to be $B_{\rm PWN} \sim 20\ \mu$G. We also report the serendipitous NuSTAR detection of renewed X-ray activity from the very faint X-ray transient XMMU J174716.1-281048 and characterize its spectrum.</description>

      <title>Stellar-wind Fueled Accretion onto Sagittarius A* in the Presence of a Nuclear Star Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way's Galactic Center hosts the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which provides us with a close-up view into supermassive black hole accretion and feedback. Recent works have shown that the winds from $\sim 30$ Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars orbiting Sgr A* at about 4 arcsec are important contributors to feeding the supermassive black hole. A nuclear star cluster (NSC) with a mass of several $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$, of which $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$ is within 1 pc, also surrounds Sgr A*. The NSC contributes to the gravitational potential in the Galactic Center, affecting the orbits of the WR stars and their stellar winds. In this work, we examine the effects that the NSC has on the accretion of these stellar winds onto Sgr A* which have previously been neglected. We find that, on the parsec scale, the effect from the gravitational potential of the NSC is negligible on the wind-fed accretion flow, validating the existing simulations used in the literature.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Pumping: Plasma Heating to Particle Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the earliest mechanisms proposed for plasma heating was magnetic pumping (MP). However, its significance for astrophysical phenomena, including particle acceleration, has yet to be appreciated. MP-energized particles tap energy from magnetic-field oscillations. A particle's momentum component perpendicular to the local B-field increases during field growth by virtue of the adiabatic invariant $p_{\perp}^{2}/B=const$. The gained $p_{\perp}$ is then partially scattered elastically into the parallel momentum, $p_{\parallel}$, with $p^{2}=p_{\parallel}^{2}+p_{\perp}^{2}=const$, thereby retaining some fraction of the gained energy before the field decreases to its minimum. This scattering breaks the reversibility of energy exchange between particles and oscillating magnetic fields, thereby increasing the particle energy after each MP cycle. Field oscillations are often assumed to be sinusoidal, and the resulting MP is treated perturbatively. These simplifications restrict astrophysical applications, leaving objects with strong magnetic perturbations outside the scope of adequate treatment. We develop a nonperturbative approach to MP that is suitable for a broad spectrum of magnetic turbulence. The treatment comprises two steps. The first step is common: converting a kinetic equation into an infinite hierarchy of moments of the particle distribution function. The second step is new in MP treatments: we find an exact closure at an arbitrary level of the moment system. The heating is treated exactly at the second-moment closure. Particle acceleration generally requires a higher-level closure to determine the power-law index and the maximum energy of accelerated particles. We propose a method for extracting these crucial acceleration data from the second moment for a broadband random field.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Strain and Orbital Dynamics of Binary Pulsars from LIGO-Virgo to LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize the current state of the art and calculate gravitational wave strain amplitudes for known binary pulsars, using data from current ground-based detectors (LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA) and the upcoming space-based missions (LISA). We present detailed calculations of the characteristic gravitational wave strain values, ranging from 3.0 to 73 $\times10^{-22}$, across frequencies between 0.66 and 5.87 $\times10^{-4}$ Hz. Our post-Newtonian approximation analysis yields predicted periastron advance rates from 1.6 to 80.5 deg/yr and orbital period decay rates between -5 and -176 $\mu$s/yr for the binary pulsar population. We derive common envelope efficiency parameters ($\alpha_{CE}$) for representative progenitor scenarios within our sample, finding values between 0.63 and 1.16, with notable sensitivity to the binding energy parameter $\lambda$. Binary neutron star merger rates are estimated at $22.77^{+6.83}_{-6.83}$ Myr$^{-1}$ for the Milky Way, corresponding to a volumetric rate of $227.71^{+68.31}_{-68.31}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with the latest LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observational constraints. Our results illustrate how multi-band gravitational wave observations, from LIGO/Virgo to LISA, can contribute to precise measurements of binary pulsar strain and orbital evolution histories, improving merger time predictions and constraining neutron star physics and common envelope processes</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Apsidal Motion in Non-Synchronous Binary Pulsars Coupled Orbit and Spin Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apsidal motion of a non-synchronous binary pulsar serves as a valuable probe of relativistic gravity, stellar stricture, and dynamical evolution of close binary systems, In this study, we investigate the combined influence of general relativity, stellar oblateness and tidal interaction on the apsidal motion of three binary pulsars: 1913+16, J0737-3039A/B, and J0621+1002. Zahn's tidal equations \cite{1977A&amp;A....57..383Z, 1989A&amp;A...220..112Z} were employed for numerical integrations to describe tidal effects and their role in orbital and spin evolution. We estimated the timescales for tidal synchronization and orbital circularization for each system. The results indicate that tidal effects play only a minor role in orbital decay compared with energy loss due to gravitational wave emission. This is evident in the compact system PSR 1913+16, where the orbital period decreases by approximately 76.5 $\mu$s/yr as a result of gravitational radiation. The double pulsar J0737-3039A/B exhibits faster orbital evolution, with synchronization occurring in about 8.4$\times10{^3}$ years, whereas the wider system J0621+1002 shows negligible orbital change over timescales exceeding 10$^{10}$ years. The simulations demonstrate clear trends of decreasing semi-major axis and eccentricity, accompanied by an increase in spin rate among the binary pulsars studied. The derived apsidal motion constants [$k\simeq0.1$] are consistent with theoretical expected values, and the corresponding tidal friction times (between a few hours to several days) agree well with theoretical predication. These results emphasize the dominant role of relativistic effects in neutron star binaries and highlight the importance of including gravitational-wave terms long-term orbital evolution</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Prospects for Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts: Joint Neutrino and X-Ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low--luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LLGRBs) are promising candidates for high-energy neutrinos, yet no coincident neutrino events have been detected so far. Recent advances in X-ray time-domain astronomy, together with the development of next-generation neutrino telescopes, open new opportunities for joint X-ray and neutrino observations of these transients. We calculate the jet dynamical evolution and the associated neutrino production for both non-magnetized and magnetized outflows. For individual events, joint X-ray and neutrino detection is generally limited to nearby LLGRBs or sources with high luminosities. Thus, we consider a next-generation neutrino telescope with an effective area enhanced by a factor of $\sim30$ relative to IceCube. In the non-magnetized scenario, joint detection of individual events is enabled for sources with typical isotropic luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to luminosity distances of $D_L\sim1.6\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $1$ per year. In contrast, for the magnetized scenario at the same luminosity, the accessible distance is significantly reduced, with joint observations confined to sources within $D_L\sim6.5\times10^{1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and an expected detection rate of order $0.5$ per year. For stacked samples of $\sim100$ magnetized LLGRBs, stacking substantially enlarges the accessible distance range, enabling joint observations for sources with representative luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim1\times10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to $D_L\lesssim7.0\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $2$ per year. These results demonstrate that joint X-ray and next-generation neutrino observations enable a practical multimessenger probe of LLGRBs.</description>

      <title>Long Period Transients (LPTs): a comprehensive review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long Period Transients (LPTs) are a recently identified class of sources characterized by periodic radio bursts lasting seconds to minutes, with flux densities that might reach several tens of Jy. These radio bursts repeat with periodicity from minutes to hours, and they exhibit strong polarization and transient activity periods. To date, about 12 such sources have been identified, which might encompass the same or different physical scenarios. Proposed explanations include binary systems with a white dwarf and a low-mass star companion, slow-spinning magnetars, highly magnetized isolated white dwarfs, and other exotic objects. In a few cases the optical counterpart indeed points toward a white dwarf with a low-mass companion, while in other cases, transient X-ray emission was detected, very common in magnetars. However, despite being able to reproduce partially some of the characteristics of LPTs, all the proposed scenarios find difficulty in explaining the exact physical origin of their bright, highly polarized and periodic radio emission. We review here the state-of-the-art in the observations and interpretation of this puzzling class of radio transients.</description>

      <title>On the Physical Origins of the Millimeter Fundamental Plane in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of active galactic nuclei have revealed a correlation between millimeter luminosity, X-ray luminosity, and mass, suggesting the emission in each of these bands is powered by a common source. Starting with a set of five general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with dynamically important magnetic fields, we perform ray-tracing calculations to produce spectra including synchrotron emission, bremsstrahlung emission, and Compton scattering. Our models with similar Eddington ratios to the objects for which the relationship was inferred naturally reproduce observations without tuning. Our lower Eddington ratio models depart from this relationship, likely attributable to an observational bias against extremely low accretion rates. We find that inverse Compton scattering dominates the production of X-rays over bremsstrahlung radiation in almost all models, and in all models consistent with the observed correlation. We find only a modest spin dependence in this relationship. This study demonstrates that a compact, hot accretion flow with dynamically important magnetic fields can naturally explain observed millimeter and X-ray properties in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. Future work should explore the impacts of non-thermal electron populations, weaker magnetic fields, and radiative cooling.</description>

      <title>When spacetime vibrates: An introduction to gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the physics of gravitational waves, exploring both the theoretical foundations and the most recent experimental advances. After a general introduction to the theory of general relativity and its major implications, the article discusses the history of gravitational waves, from their prediction by Einstein to their actual detection. It then explains what gravitational waves are and how they interact with appropriate detectors. The main mechanisms of gravitational radiation emission are analyzed, with a focus on compact binary systems of compact objects, whose orbits typically evolve in three phases: inspiral, merger, and the final ringdown phase, each of these phases leaving distinct signatures in the emitted waves. The article highlights the fundamental role of the giant interferometers LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, true cathedrals of modern science, and revisits the historic event GW150914, the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which confirmed the predictions of general relativity and opened a new era for astronomy. This achievement was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Other observed events are also discussed, along with their astrophysical sources, and the possibility of detecting gravitational waves of cosmological origin, originating from the Big Bang itself. Finally, current and future projects are analyzed, including observatories based on increasingly sophisticated interferometers, as well as proposals for alternative detection methods, illustrating how gravitational-wave astronomy is shaping the present and future of our exploration of the universe. In concluding, the detection of gravitational waves is set in a broader context by examining the discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum, thereby illustrating the complementary perspectives these different observational channels provide.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Neutrino Background is within Reach of Future Neutrino Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) can be boosted to high energies due to scatterings with energetic cosmic rays (CRs) across cosmological scales. Previous calculations focused on neutral current incoherent and coherent elastic scatterings of cosmic-ray protons off relic neutrinos. However, charged current interactions and deep inelastic scatterings are also expected to occur, which enhances the boosted relic neutrino fluxes on Earth. Here, we compute the \textit{total} diffuse boosted cosmic neutrino background (DBC$\nu$B) arising from CRs at all redshifts in the Universe, accounting for neutral current and charged current elastic and deep inelastic scatterings. We find that IceCube already places an upper limit on the cosmic neutrino background overdensity in cosmological scales of ~$\mathcal{O}(100-1000)$ at $E_{\nu}=10^{10}$ GeV, for a lightest neutrino mass of $m_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.1$ eV. We further show that IceCube-Gen2 could test $\mathcal{O}(1-10)$ C$\nu$B overdensities, and the combination of $10$ future neutrino telescopes with similar sensitivity would allow us to test the $\Lambda$CDM expected C$\nu$B density for a lightest neutrino mass compatible with the KATRIN bound.</description>

      <title>Multibanded Reduced Order Quadrature Techniques for Gravitational Wave Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced-order quadrature (ROQ) is commonly used to speed up parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy; however, the construction of ROQ bases can be computationally costly, particularly for longer duration signals. We propose a modified construction strategy based on PyROQ that accelerates this process by performing the basis search using multiband waveforms, without compromising the desired likelihood speed and accuracy. We use this altered method to construct a set of ROQs in the sub-solar mass range using the \texttt{IMRPhenomXAS\_NRTidalV3} waveform. We find a 20\% to 30\% decrease in basis size and a $\sim 10$ times decrease in basis construction time. We verify the altered method preserves the likelihood accuracy and mantains consitent parameter estimation results.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Type II-P Supernova Progenitors with the Euclid and CSST Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central goal in supernova (SN) research is to identify and characterize their progenitors. However, this is very difficult due to the limited archival images with sufficient depth and spatial resolution required for direct progenitor detection and due to the circumstellar dust which often biases the estimate of their intrinsic parameters. This field will be revolutionized by Euclid and the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST), which conduct deep, wide-field, high-resolution and multi-band imaging surveys. We analyze their detection capability by comparing the model magnitudes of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors with the detection limits under different conditions, and we estimate the annual detection rates with Monte-Carlo simulations. We explore how to recover the intrinsic properties of SN progenitors with the help of radiation transfer calculations in circumstellar dust. We find the optical and near-infrared filters of the Euclid and CSST are highly effective for detecting RSG progenitors. We predict that archival images from the completed 2 surveys will enable $\lesssim13$ (or 24) progenitor detections per year within the mass range of 8--16 (or 8--25)M_\odot, an order of magnitude higher than the current detection rate of $\sim1$ detection per year. In the presence of circumstellar dust, the emerging spectral energy distribution (SED) of the progenitor is mainly affected by the optical depth and is almost independent of dust temperature in the Euclid and CSST filters. Our mock tests demonstrate that one can derive the progenitor mass and dust optical depth simultaneously by fitting the observed SED over the 11 filters of the 2 surveys while fixing the dust temperature to a typical value. Euclid and CSST will significantly enlarge the sample of direct progenitor detections with accurate mass measurements, which is crucial to resolve the long-standing RSG problem.</description>

      <title>Effects of spontaneous Lorentz Symmetry breaking on Letelier-AdS charged black boles within Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of massless particles -- specifically photons -- in the spacetime of a charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) surrounded by a cloud of strings (CoS) within the framework of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $\alpha$ and the KR field parameter $\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.</description>

      <title>Charged Simpson-Visser AdS Black Holes: Geodesic Structure and Thermodynamic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) charged black holes and investigate the resulting spacetime geometry in detail, with emphasis on both geodesic structure and thermodynamic behavior. In particular, we analyze the motion of massless particle, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere, black hole shadow, photon trajectory and the dynamics of charged particles, including the characteristics of the circular and type of orbits. Furthermore, we compare the theoretical predictions of the charged SV-AdS black hole with recent observations reported by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT) for M87* and Sgr~A*. Beyond the geodesic analysis, we explore the thermodynamics of the regularized charged SV-AdS black hole by deriving essential quantities such as the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. Through a systematic examination of these thermodynamic variables, we demonstrate how the regularization parameter inherent in the SV regularization influences particle dynamics, stability conditions, and the overall thermal properties of the modified black hole solution. This comprehensive study highlights the interplay between regularization effects and the physical observables associated with charged AdS black holes.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillating and differentially rotating neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remnants of binary neutron star mergers are expected to be massive, rapidly rotating stars whose oscillations produce gravitational waves in the kilohertz band. The degree of differential rotation and the rotation profiles strongly influence their structure, stability and oscillation spectrum, and must therefore be taken into account when modeling their dynamics. We extend the pseudospectral code ROXAS (Relativistic Oscillations of non-aXisymmetric neutron stArS) to enable the dynamical evolution of oscillating, differentially rotating neutron stars. Using the updated code, we aim to study the star's oscillation frequencies. We extend the previous formalism, based on primitive variables and the conformal flatness approximation, to differential rotation. Within this framework, we run a series of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric simulations of perturbed, differentially rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates, and extract their oscillation frequencies. Axisymmetric modes, as well as those under the Cowling approximation, show excellent agreement with published results. We show that the secondary fundamental mode in the Cowling approximation is an artifact that does not appear in dynamical spacetimes. In addition, we provide, for the first time, frequency values for non-axisymmetric modes in differentially rotating configurations evolved in conformal flatness. This extension broadens the range of physical scenarios that can be studied with ROXAS, and represents a step toward more realistic modeling of post-merger remnants and their gravitational-wave emission.</description>

      <title>Neutrino and pair creation in reconnection-powered coronae of accreting black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12638v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A ubiquitous feature of accreting black hole systems is their hard X-ray emission which is thought to be produced through Comptonization of soft photons by electrons and positrons in the vicinity of the black hole, in a region with optical depth of order unity. The origin and composition of this Comptonizing region, known as the corona, is a matter open for debate. In this paper we investigate the role of relativistic protons accelerated in black-hole magnetospheric current sheets for the pair enrichment and neutrino emission of AGN coronae. Our model has two free parameters, namely the proton plasma magnetization $\sigma_{\rm p}$, which controls the peak energy of the neutrino spectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd}$ (defined as the ratio between X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm Edd}$), which controls the amount of energy transferred to secondary particles. For sources with $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd} \gtrsim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$ (where $\lambda_{\rm Edd, crit} \sim 10^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm p}=10^5$ or $\sim 10^{-2}$ for $\sigma_{\rm p}=10^7$), proton-photon interactions and $ \gamma \gamma$ annihilation produce enough secondary pairs to achieve Thomson optical depths $\tau_{\rm T} \sim 0.1-10$. In the opposite case of $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd} \lesssim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$, the coronal pairs cannot originate only from hadronic interactions. Additionally, we find that the neutrino luminosity scales as $L^2_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$ for $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd} \lesssim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$, while it is proportional to $L_{\rm X}$ for higher $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd}$ values. We apply our model to four Seyfert galaxies, including NGC 1068, and discuss our results in light of recent IceCube observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Nonstandard Neutrino Properties in Collapsing Stellar Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-messenger approach for probing nonstandard neutrino properties through the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsing stellar cores and associated supernova explosions. We show that neutrino flavor conversion inside the proto-neutron star (PNS), motivated by physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), can significantly boost PNS convection. This effect leads to large-amplitude GW emission over a wide frequency range during an otherwise relatively quiescent GW phase shortly after core bounce. Such a signal provides a promising new avenue for exploring nonstandard neutrino phenomena and other BSM physics impacting PNS convection.</description>

      <title>Rates of Strongly Lensed Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the coming years, surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to increase the number of observed Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) substantially. We employ Monte Carlo integration to calculate the unlensed and lensed TDE rate as a function of limiting magnitude in $u$, $g$, $r$, and $i$-bands. We investigate the impact of multiple luminosity models, black hole mass functions (BHMFs), and flare temperatures on the TDE rate. Notably, this includes a semi-analytical model, which enables the determination of the TDE temperature in terms of black hole (BH) mass. We predict the highest unlensed TDE rate to be in $g$-band. It ranges from $16$ to $5,440\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\;(20,000\;\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$ for the Zwicky Transient Facility, being more consistent with the observed rate at the low end. For LSST, we expect a rate in $g$-band between $3,580$ and $82,060\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\;(20,000\;\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$. A higher theoretical prediction is understandable, as we do not consider observational effects such as completeness. The unlensed and lensed TDE rates are insensitive to the redshift evolution of the BHMF, even for LSST limiting magnitudes. The best band for detecting lensed TDEs is also $g$-band. Its predicted rates range from $0.43$ to $15\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\;(20,000\;\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$ for LSST. The scatter of predicted rates reduces when we consider the fraction of lensed TDEs; that is, a few in ten thousand TDEs will be lensed. Despite the large scatter in the rates of lensed TDEs, our comprehensive considerations of multiple models suggest that lensed TDEs will occur in the $10$-year LSST lifetime, providing an exciting prospect for detecting such events. We expect the median redshift of a lensed TDE to be between $1.5$ and $2$. In this paper, we additionally report on lensed TDE properties, such as the BH mass and time delays.</description>

      <title>Topology of the Superconducting Heart of Neutron Stars: Effects of Microphysics and Gravitational-Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general-relativistic study of the distribution of proton superconductivity in strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), using the XNS code to solve the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations. We investigate equilibrium configurations with both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field geometries and incorporate complex many-body effects through microscopically derived proton pairing gaps. The models employ equations of state (EoS) obtained from microscopic many-body theory - including realistic two- and three-body nuclear interactions - as well as from relativistic mean-field approaches. We compare superconducting topologies across our collection of EoS and explore the influences of magnetic field geometry in stellar models parameterized by central density. Our models confirm the absence of $S$-wave superconductivity in the inner core and, importantly, reveal that non-superconducting regions exhibit complex three-dimensional geometries: doughnut-shaped for toroidal fields and prolate-shaped for poloidal fields -- spatial structures that are inherently absent in one-dimensional analyses. We also compute magnetic deformations and ellipticities for several millisecond pulsars (MSPs), estimating their continuous gravitational wave strain. While these MSPs remain undetectable by current detectors, next-generation instruments such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer may detect their signals, opening an observational window into internal superconductivity and internal magnetic field of NSs, as well as the fundamental microphysics of dense matter.</description>

      <title>Decoding Cygnus X-2: The Critical Role of Reflection in IXPE Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectro-polarimetric re-analysis of the first IXPE observation of Cygnus X-2 which we determine to be mainly in the normal branch, from quasi-simultaneous observations with NuSTAR, NICER, and INTEGRAL. We measure the hard X-ray polarization angle and find it to be consistent with the previously measured position angle of the radio jet. Leveraging NuSTAR's detection of both the relativistic Fe K emission line and the Compton hump, we constrain the flux contribution of the reflected emission from the inner accretion disk to be 10% of the total X-ray flux in the IXPE energy band. Unlike previous studies that modeled only the Fe K emission line, we fit the full-band reflection spectrum using a fully relativistic disk model. There is strong degeneracy between the Comptonized and reflection components. Given that the Comptonized component is not expected to be highly polarized, a polarization degree of approximately 20% for the reflection component could explain the X-ray polarization data from IXPE. We also discuss the disk inclination angle inferred from our spectro-polarimetric modeling, as well as other possible explanations for the data.</description>

      <title>Late-Time Infrared Cooling in Magnetar-Driven Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central magnetar engine is commonly invoked to explain energetic supernovae, which should have multiple signals in multiwavelength emission. Photoionization from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) can create distinct spectroscopic signals in the nebular phase. Recent models suggest infrared emission, particularly from Ne II, can be prominent at late times. This work examines the cooling power of optical and infrared transitions to determine which lines contribute strongly to cooling and on what timescale. The models show infrared cooling becomes strong at $\sim$ 3 years post-explosion and dominates by 6 years, with [Ne II] 12.8$\mu$m being the strongest coolant. The fraction of total cooling in the infrared increases sharply once the PWN luminosity decreases below 10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and this fraction also increases with increasing ejecta mass and decreasing average PWN photon energy. However, the emission from [Ne II] 12.8$\mu$m increases with increasing PWN luminosity and increasing ejecta mass. Cooling at 1 year is dominated by optical O and S lines, with infrared Ar, Ni, and Ne lines becoming strong at 3 years. Optical cooling is almost negligible at 6 years, with the supernova cooling almost entirely through mid- and far-infrared transitions. JWST spectroscopy with MIRI should be able to detect these lines out to $z \sim 0.1$. Supernovae with higher magnetic fields transition to infrared cooling on earlier timescales, while infrared-dominated supernovae should have strong emission from neutral atoms and emit strongly in radio at sub-decade timescales.</description>

      <title>Upper limits on microhertz gravitational waves from supermassive black-hole binaries using PSR J1909-3744 data from the second IPTA data release</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for gravitational waves (GWs) from individual sources using high-cadence observations of PSR J1909\(-\)3744 obtained during an intensive observing campaign with the International Pulsar Timing Array second data release (IPTA-DR2) between July 2010 and November 2012. The observations, conducted at three different radio frequencies with the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope (NRT) and Parkes Telescope (PKS) and five frequencies with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), enabled precise corrections for dispersion measure effects and scattering variations. After these corrections, the timing residuals showed an unmodeled periodic noise component with an amplitude of 340 ns. Our analysis yields upper limits on the GW strain from individual sources, constraining it to be below \(1.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at 71 nHz and \(2.3 \times 10^{-13}\) at 1 \textmu Hz for average sky locations, while for optimal source locations the limits improve to \(6.2 \times 10^{-15}\) and \(8.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at the same frequencies, respectively. Our new limits are about a factor of 1.52 more stringent than those of Perera et al. based on an earlier EPTA data.</description>

      <title>An Excited Dark Matter Solution to the MeV Galactic Center Excesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent COMPTEL data analysis reveals a $\sim$ 2 MeV continuum excess whose spatial distribution closely matches the long-standing 511 keV line observed by INTEGRAL/SPI, indicating a common population of low-energy positrons that is difficult to reconcile with known astrophysical sources or standard thermal dark matter (DM). We show that a minimal Excited Dark Matter (XDM) model naturally explains these features. In this scenario a DM particle $\chi$ is inelastically upscattered into an excited state $\chi^*$, followed by de-excitation $\chi^*\to\chi e^+ e^-$ producing $\sim$2 MeV positrons that reproduce the 511 keV line morphology and the COMPTEL MeV continuum. Using a full cosmic-ray (CR) propagation treatment, we obtain an excellent fit for $m_\chi\simeq$ 1.5 TeV DM particle with mass-splitting $\Delta m =m_{\chi^*}-m_\chi \simeq$ 4 MeV for an inelastic geometric scattering cross section of $\sigma_\textrm{mr}= 3-4\times 10^{-23}\,\textrm{cm}^2$. The same positrons supply a substantial, radially flat contribution to the anomalous Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) ionization rate. This is the first unified treatment of XDM-induced positrons across all three observables, yielding correlated MeV signatures testable by upcoming missions targeting the Galactic MeV band.</description>

      <title>Pre-supernova O-C shell mergers could produce more $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ than the explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17705v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ in massive stars is thought to occur during explosive nucleosynthesis, however recent studies have shown it can be produced during O-C shell mergers prior to core collapse. We investigate how mixing according to 3D macro physics derived from hydrodynamic simulations impacts the pre-supernova O-C shell merger nucleosynthesis and if it can dominate the explosive supernova production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive isotopes. We compare a range of observations and models of explosive $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ yields to pre-explosive multi-zone mixing-burning nucleosynthesis simulations of an O-C shell merger in a $15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ stellar model with mixing conditions corresponding to different 3D hydro mixing scenarios. Radioactive species produced in the O shell have a spread in their pre-explosive yields predictions across different 3D mixing scenarios of 2.14 dex on average. $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ has the largest spread of 4.78 dex. The pre-explosive production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ can be larger than the production of all massive star models in the NuGrid data set where $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis contribution, as well all other massive star and supernova models. We conclude that quantitative predictions of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive species more broadly require an understanding of the 3D hydrodynamic mixing conditions present during the O-C shell merger.</description>
