      <title>Performance Evaluation of CMOS Annealing with Support Vector Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, support vector machine (SVM) performance was assessed utilizing a quantum-inspired complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) annealer. The primary focus during performance evaluation was the accuracy rate in binary classification problems. A comparative analysis was conducted between SVM running on a CPU (classical computation) and executed on a quantum-inspired annealer. The performance outcome was evaluated using a CMOS annealing machine, thereby obtaining an accuracy rate of 93.7% for linearly separable problems, 92.7% for non-linearly separable problem 1, and 97.6% for non-linearly separable problem 2. These results reveal that a CMOS annealing machine can achieve an accuracy rate that closely rivals that of classical computation.</description>

      <title>SynthEval: A Framework for Detailed Utility and Privacy Evaluation of Tabular Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing demand for synthetic data to address contemporary issues in machine learning, such as data scarcity, data fairness, and data privacy, having robust tools for assessing the utility and potential privacy risks of such data becomes crucial. SynthEval, a novel open-source evaluation framework distinguishes itself from existing tools by treating categorical and numerical attributes with equal care, without assuming any special kind of preprocessing steps. This~makes it applicable to virtually any synthetic dataset of tabular records. Our tool leverages statistical and machine learning techniques to comprehensively evaluate synthetic data fidelity and privacy-preserving integrity. SynthEval integrates a wide selection of metrics that can be used independently or in highly customisable benchmark configurations, and can easily be extended with additional metrics. In this paper, we describe SynthEval and illustrate its versatility with examples. The framework facilitates better benchmarking and more consistent comparisons of model capabilities.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Wafer-Scale Reduce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient Reduce and AllReduce communication collectives are a critical cornerstone of high-performance computing (HPC) applications. We present the first systematic investigation of Reduce and AllReduce on the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE). This architecture has been shown to achieve unprecedented performance both for machine learning workloads and other computational problems like FFT. We introduce a performance model to estimate the execution time of algorithms on the WSE and validate our predictions experimentally for a wide range of input sizes. In addition to existing implementations, we design and implement several new algorithms specifically tailored to the architecture. Moreover, we establish a lower bound for the runtime of a Reduce operation on the WSE. Based on our model, we automatically generate code that achieves near-optimal performance across the whole range of input sizes. Experiments demonstrate that our new Reduce and AllReduce algorithms outperform the current vendor solution by up to 3.27x. Additionally, our model predicts performance with less than 4% error. The proposed communication collectives increase the range of HPC applications that can benefit from the high throughput of the WSE. Our model-driven methodology demonstrates a disciplined approach that can lead the way to further algorithmic advancements on wafer-scale architectures.</description>

      <title>NonGEMM Bench: Understanding the Performance Horizon of the Latest ML Workloads with NonGEMM Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) operators are the building blocks to design ML models with various target applications. GEneral Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operators are the backbone of ML models. They are notorious for being computationally expensive requiring billions of multiply-and-accumulate. Therefore, significant effort has been put to study and optimize the GEMM operators in order to speed up the execution of ML models. GPUs and accelerators are widely deployed to accelerate ML workloads by optimizing the execution of GEMM operators. Nonetheless, the performance of NonGEMM operators have not been studied as thoroughly as GEMMs. Therefore, this paper describes \bench, a benchmark to study NonGEMM operators. We first construct \bench using popular ML workloads from different domains, then perform case studies on various grade GPU platforms to analyze the behavior of NonGEMM operators in GPU accelerated systems. Finally, we present some key takeaways to bridge the gap between GEMM and NonGEMM operators and to offer the community with potential new optimization directions.</description>
