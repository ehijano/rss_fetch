      <title>A Spatio-Temporal Dirichlet Process Mixture Model on Linear Networks for Crime Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing crime events is crucial to understand crime dynamics and it is largely helpful for constructing prevention policies. Point processes specified on linear networks can provide a more accurate description of crime incidents by considering the geometry of the city. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model on a linear network to analyze crime events in Valencia, Spain. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</description>

      <title>Visualisation of multi-indication randomised control trial evidence to support decision-making in oncology: a case study on bevacizumab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Evidence maps have been used in healthcare to understand existing evidence and to support decision-making. In oncology they have been used to summarise evidence within a disease area but have not been used to compare evidence across different diseases. As an increasing number of oncology drugs are licensed for multiple indications, visualising the accumulation of evidence across all indications can help inform policy-makers, support evidence synthesis approaches, or to guide expert elicitation on appropriate cross-indication assumptions. Methods: The multi-indication oncology therapy bevacizumab was selected as a case-study. We used visualisation methods including timeline, ridgeline and split-violin plots to display evidence across seven licensed cancer types, focusing on the evolution of evidence on overall and progression-free survival over time as well as the quality of the evidence available. Results: Evidence maps for bevacizumab allow for visualisation of patterns in study-level evidence, which can be updated as evidence accumulates over time. The developed tools display the observed data and synthesised evidence across- and within-indications. Limitations: The effectiveness of the plots produced are limited by the lack of complete and consistent reporting of evidence in trial reports. Trade-offs were necessary when deciding the level of detail that could be shown while keeping the plots coherent. Conclusions: Clear graphical representations of the evolution and accumulation of evidence can provide a better understanding of the entire evidence base which can inform judgements regarding the appropriate use of data within and across indications. Implications: Improved visualisations of evidence can help the development of multi-indication evidence synthesis. The proposed evidence displays can lead to the efficient use of information for health technology assessment.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Parametric Bayesian Spatial Model for Rainfall Events in Geographically Complex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental phenomena are influenced by complex interactions among various factors. For instance, the amount of rainfall measured at different stations within a given area is shaped by atmospheric conditions, orography, and physics of water processes. Motivated by the need to analyze rainfall across complex spatial locations, we propose a flexible Bayesian semi-parametric model for spatially distributed data. This method effectively accounts for spatial correlation while incorporating dependencies on geographical characteristics in a highly flexible manner. Indeed, using latent Gaussian processes, indexed by spatial coordinates and topographical features, the model integrates spatial dependencies and environmental characteristics within a nonparametric framework. Posterior inference is conducted using an efficient rejection-free Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which eliminates the need for tuning parameter calibration, ensuring smoother and more reliable estimation. The model's flexibility is evaluated through a series of simulation studies, involving different rainfall and spatial correlation scenarios, to demonstrate its robustness across various conditions. We then apply the model to a large dataset of rainfall events collected from the Italian regions of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige, these areas are known for their complex orography and diverse meteorological drivers. By analyzing this data, we generate detailed maps that illustrate the mean and variance of rainfall and rainy days. The method is implemented in a new R package available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Investigating Primary Care Indications to Improve Electronic Health Record in Dementia Target Trial Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Missing data, inaccuracies in medication lists, and recording delays in electronic health records (EHR) are major limitations for target trial emulation (TTE), the process by which EHR data are used to retrospectively emulate a randomized control trial. EHR TTE relies on recorded data that proxy true drug exposures and outcomes. We investigate the under-utilized criterion that a patient has indications of primary care provider (PCP) encounters within the EHR. Such patients tend to have more records overall and a greater proportion of the types of encounters that materialize comprehensive and up-to-date records. We examine the impact of including a PCP feature in the TTE model or as an eligibility criterion for cohort selection, contrasted with ignoring it altogether. To that end, we compare the estimated effects of two first line antidiabetic drug classes on the onset of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). We find that the estimated treatment effect is sensitive to the consideration of a PCP feature, particularly when used as an eligibility criterion. Our work suggests that this PCP feature should be further researched.</description>

      <title>BiDepth Multimodal Neural Network: Bidirectional Depth Deep Learning Arcitecture for Spatial-Temporal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of spatial-temporal (ST) information in dynamic systems, such as urban mobility and weather patterns, is a crucial yet challenging problem. The complexity stems from the intricate interplay between spatial proximity and temporal relevance, where both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations are present in convoluted patterns. Existing approaches, including traditional statistical methods and conventional neural networks, may provide inaccurate results due to the lack of an effective mechanism that simultaneously incorporates information at variable temporal depths while maintaining spatial context, resulting in a trade-off between comprehensive long-term historical analysis and responsiveness to short-term new information. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the BiDepth Multimodal Neural Network (BDMNN) with bidirectional depth modulation that enables a comprehensive understanding of both long-term seasonality and short-term fluctuations, adapting to the complex ST context. Case studies with real-world public data demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy, with a 12% reduction in Mean Squared Error for urban traffic prediction and a 15% improvement in rain precipitation forecasting compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, without demanding extra computational resources.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Expectile Representations of a Data Matrix, with Application to Diurnal Heart Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank matrix factorization is a powerful tool for understanding the structure of 2-way data, and is usually accomplished by minimizing a sum of squares criterion. Expectile analysis generalizes squared-error loss by introducing asymmetry, allowing tail behavior to be elicited. Here we present a framework for low-rank expectile analysis of a data matrix that incorporates both additive and multiplicative effects, utilizing expectile loss, and accommodating arbitrary patterns of missing data. The representation can be fit with gradient-descent. Simulation studies demonstrate the accuracy of the structure recovery. Using diurnal heart rate data indexed by person-days versus minutes within a day, we find divergent behavior for lower versus upper expectiles, with the lower expectiles being much more stable within subjects across days, while the upper expectiles are much more variable, even within subjects.</description>

      <title>SupplyGraph: A Benchmark Dataset for Supply Chain Planning using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained traction across different domains such as transportation, bio-informatics, language processing, and computer vision. However, there is a noticeable absence of research on applying GNNs to supply chain networks. Supply chain networks are inherently graph-like in structure, making them prime candidates for applying GNN methodologies. This opens up a world of possibilities for optimizing, predicting, and solving even the most complex supply chain problems. A major setback in this approach lies in the absence of real-world benchmark datasets to facilitate the research and resolution of supply chain problems using GNNs. To address the issue, we present a real-world benchmark dataset for temporal tasks, obtained from one of the leading FMCG companies in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning for production purposes. The dataset includes temporal data as node features to enable sales predictions, production planning, and the identification of factory issues. By utilizing this dataset, researchers can employ GNNs to address numerous supply chain problems, thereby advancing the field of supply chain analytics and planning.
