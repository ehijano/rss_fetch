      <title>Starshade Exoplanet Data Challenge: What We Learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starshade is one of the technologies that will enable the observation and characterization of small planets around nearby stars through direct imaging. The Starshade Exoplanetary Data Challenge (SEDC) was designed to validate starshade-imaging's noise budget and evaluate the capabilities of image-processing techniques, by inviting community participating teams to analyze &gt;1000 simulated images of hypothetical exoplanetary systems observed through a starshade. Because the starshade would suppress the starlight so well, the dominant noise source and the main challenge for the planet detection becomes the exozodiacal disks and their structures. In this paper, we summarize the techniques used by the participating teams and compare their findings with the truth. With an independent component analysis to remove the background, about 70% of the inner planets (close to the inner working angle) have been detected and ~40% of the outer planet (fainter than the inner counterparts) have been identified. Planet detection becomes more difficult in the cases of higher disk inclination, as the false negative and false positive counts increase. Interestingly, we found little difference in the planet detection ability between 1e-10 and 1e-9 instrument contrast, confirming that the dominant limitations are from the astrophysical background and not due to the performance of the starshade. Finally, we find that a non-parametric background calibration scheme, such as the independent component analysis reported here, results in a mean residual of 10% the background brightness. This background estimation error leads to substantial false positives and negatives and systematic bias in the planet flux estimation, and should be included in the estimation of the planet detection signal-to-noise ratio for imaging using a starshade and also a coronagraph that delivers exozodi-limited imaging.</description>

      <title>Deep learning reconstruction of neutrino direction, energy, and flavor with complete uncertainty predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the IceCube-Gen2 observatory under development and RNO-G under construction, the first detection of ultra-high-energy neutrinos is on the horizon making event reconstruction a priority. Here, we present a full reconstruction of the neutrino direction, shower energy, and interaction type (and thereby flavor) from raw antenna signals. We use a deep neural network with conditional normalizing-flows for the reconstruction. This, for the first time, allows for event-by-event predictions of the posterior distribution of all reconstructed properties, in particular, the asymmetric uncertainties of the neutrino direction. The algorithm was applied to an extensive MC dataset of 'shallow' and 'deep' detector components in South Pole ice. We present the reconstruction performance and compare the two station components. For the first time, we quantify the effect of birefringence on event reconstruction.</description>

      <title>GRRIS: a real-time intra-site observation scheduling scheme for distributed survey telescope arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distributed telescope array offers promise for conducting large-sky-area, high-frequency time domain surveys. Multiple telescopes can be deployed at each observation site, so intra-site observation task scheduling is crucial for enhancing observation efficiency and quality. Efficient use of observable time and rapid response to special situations are critical to maximize scientific discovery in time domain surveys. Besides, the competing scientific priorities, time-varying observation conditions, and capabilities of observation equipment, lead to a vast search space of the scheduling. So with the increasing number of telescopes and observation fields, balancing computational time with solution quality in observation scheduling poses a significant challenge. Informed by the seminal contributions of earlier studies on a multilevel scheduling model and global scheduler for time domain telescope array, this study is devoted to further exploring the site scheduler. Formulating the observation scheduling of multiple telescopes at the site as a cooperative decision-making problem, this paper proposes GRRIS, a real-time intra-site observation scheduling scheme for telescope array using graph and reinforcement learning. It employs a graph neural network to learn node features that can embed the spatial structure of the observation scheduling. An algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning is designed to efficiently learn the optimum allocation policy of telescope agents to field nodes. Through numerical simulations with real-world scenarios, GRRIS can achieve up to a 22% solution improvement over the most competitive scheme. It offers better scalability and sub-second decision speed, meeting the needs of observation scheduling control for future distributed telescope arrays.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Peer Review in Astronomy: A Machine Learning and Optimization Approach to Reviewer Assignments for ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing volume of papers and proposals undergoing peer review emphasizes the pressing need for greater automation to effectively manage the growing scale. In this study, we present the deployment and evaluation of machine learning and optimization techniques for assigning proposals to reviewers that was developed for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) during the Cycle 10 Call for Proposals issued in 2023. By utilizing topic modeling algorithms, we identify the proposal topics and assess reviewers' expertise based on their historical ALMA proposal submissions. We then apply an adapted version of the assignment optimization algorithm from PeerReview4All (Stelmakh et al. 2021a) to maximize the alignment between proposal topics and reviewer expertise. Our evaluation shows a significant improvement in matching reviewer expertise: the median similarity score between the proposal topic and reviewer expertise increased by 51 percentage points compared to the previous cycle, and the percentage of reviewers reporting expertise in their assigned proposals rose by 20 percentage points. Furthermore, the assignment process proved highly effective in that no proposals required reassignment due to significant mismatches, resulting in a savings of 3 to 5 days of manual effort.</description>

      <title>Lens Modeling of STRIDES Strongly Lensed Quasars using Neural Posterior Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly lensed quasars can be used to constrain cosmological parameters through time-delay cosmography. Models of the lens masses are a necessary component of this analysis. To enable time-delay cosmography from a sample of $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ lenses, which will soon become available from surveys like the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Euclid Wide Survey, we require fast and standardizable modeling techniques. To address this need, we apply neural posterior estimation (NPE) for modeling galaxy-scale strongly lensed quasars from the Strong Lensing Insights into the Dark Energy Survey (STRIDES) sample. NPE brings two advantages: speed and the ability to implicitly marginalize over nuisance parameters. We extend this method by employing sequential NPE to increase precision of mass model posteriors. We then fold individual lens models into a hierarchical Bayesian inference to recover the population distribution of lens mass parameters, accounting for out-of-distribution shift. After verifying our method using simulated analogs of the STRIDES lens sample, we apply our method to 14 Hubble Space Telescope single-filter observations. We find the population mean of the power-law elliptical mass distribution slope, $\gamma_{\text{lens}}$, to be $\mathcal{M}_{\gamma_{\text{lens}}}=2.13 \pm 0.06$. Our result represents the first population-level constraint for these systems. This population-level inference from fully automated modeling is an important stepping stone towards cosmological inference with large samples of strongly lensed quasars.</description>

      <title>Extending the cosmic distance ladder two orders of magnitude with strongly lensed Cepheids, carbon AGB, and RGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme magnification of stars near the caustics of clusters allow to detect individual luminous stars at high redshift. We show how deep exposures of caustic crossing galaxies at $z\lesssim1$ with IR telescopes such as JWST, can detect non-explosive distance calibrators, such as Cepheids, carbon stars in the asymptotic giant branch or stars in the tip of the red giant branch. A large number of such detections, combined with careful modelling of the magnification affecting these stars (including microlensing), opens the door to using them as alternative standard candles to SNe in a redshift range that would extend the cosmic distance ladder two orders of magnitude for these distance calibrators. As a bonus, strongly lensed stars detected in deep exposures provide also a robust method of mapping small dark matter substructures since they cluster around the critical curves of small scale dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>An Approach to Gamma-Hadron Separation via Measurements of the Middle-UV Fraction of EAS emission by an Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope with UV-Sensitive SiPM detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operation of a small-size Cherenkov gamma-ray telescope TAIGA-IACT with camera on SiPMs OnSemi MicroFJ-60035 has been modelled by multiparticle Monte Carlo (MC) methods. The model implies that telescope camera is equipped with two specific types of filters of 290-590 nm (visible+NUV) and 220-320 nm (MUV+UVB)-bands, each covering half of the camera pixels in some uniform order. This allows one to measure the fraction of UV-radiation in total amount of Cherenkov radiation of an extensive air shower (EAS), that can be used for efficient gamma-hadron separation. The corresponding quality factor takes values up to 5.07 in the 10-100 TeV range depending on the distance to EAS axis and camera orientation.</description>

      <title>Launching mass from the Moon helped by lunar gravity anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normally a passive object launched from the Moon at less than the escape velocity orbits the Moon once and then crashes back to the launch site. We show that thanks to lunar gravity anomalies, for specific launch sites and directions, a passive projectile can remain in lunar orbit for up to 9 Earth days. We find that such sites exist at least on the lunar equator for prograde equatorial orbit launches. Three of the sites are located on the lunar nearside. We envision that this can be used to lift material from the Moon at low cost because it gives prolonged opportunities for an active spacecraft to catch the projectile. Passive projectiles can be made entirely from lunar material so that a stream of Earth-imported parts is not needed. To reduce the mass and cost of the launcher, the projectile mass can be scaled down with a corresponding increase in the launch frequency. The projectile launcher itself can be a coilgun, railgun, superconducting quenchgun, sling or any other device that can give a projectile an orbital speed of about 1.7 km/s.</description>

      <title>State-space analysis of a continuous gravitational wave source with a pulsar timing array: inclusion of the pulsar terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays can detect continuous nanohertz gravitational waves emitted by individual supermassive black hole binaries. The data analysis procedure can be formulated within a time-domain, state-space framework, in which the radio timing observations are related to a temporal sequence of latent states, namely the intrinsic pulsar spin frequency. The achromatic wandering of the pulsar spin frequency is tracked using a Kalman filter concurrently with the pulse frequency modulation induced by a gravitational wave from a single source. The modulation is the sum of terms proportional to the gravitational wave strain at the Earth and at every pulsar in the array. Here we generalize previous state-space formulations of the pulsar timing array problem to include the pulsar terms; that is, we copy the pulsar terms from traditional, non-state-space analyses over to the state-space framework. The performance of the generalized Kalman filter is tested using astrophysically representative software injections in Gaussian measurement noise. It is shown that including the pulsar terms corrects for previously identified biases in the parameter estimates (especially the sky position of the source) which also arise in traditional matched-filter analyses that exclude the pulsar terms. Additionally, including the pulsar terms decreases the minimum detectable strain by $14\%$. Overall, the study verifies that the pulsar terms do not raise any special extra impediments for the state-space framework, beyond those studied in traditional analyses. The inspiral-driven evolution of the wave frequency at the Earth and at the retarded time at every pulsar in the array is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Dual-Mode Calorimetric Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dual-operation mode SNSPD is demonstrated. In the conventional Geiger SNSPD mode the sensor operates at temperatures well below the critical temperature, Tc, working as an event counter without sensitivity to the number of photons impinging the sensor. In the calorimetric mode, the detector is operated at temperatures just below Tc and displays photon-number sensitivity for wavelengths in the optical spectrum. In this energy sensitive mode, photon absorption causes Joule heating of the SNSPD that becomes partially resistive without the presence of latching. Depending on the application, by tuning the sample temperature and bias current using the same readout system, the SNSPD can readily switch between the two modes. In the calorimetric mode, SNSPD recovery times shorter than the ones in the Geiger mode are observed, reaching values as low as 580ps. Dual-mode SNSPD's may provide significant advancements in spectroscopy and calorimetry, where precise timing, photon counting and energy resolution are required.</description>

      <title>Towards Searching for Photons with Energies beyond the PeV Range from Galactic PeVatrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several gamma-ray observatories have discovered photons of cosmic origin with energies in the PeV ($10^{15}\,\text{eV}$) range. Photons at these energies might be produced as by-products from particle acceleration in so-called PeVatrons, which are widely assumed to be the sources of a large part of galactic cosmic rays. Based on recent measurements of these PeV $\gamma$-sources by LHAASO and HAWC, we extrapolate the energy spectra of selected sources up to the ultra-high-energy (UHE, ${\geq}10\,\text{PeV}$) regime. The goal of this study is to evaluate if (and under what conditions) giant air-shower observatories, for example the Pierre Auger Observatory, could contribute to testing the UHE luminosity of PeV $\gamma$-sources. Possible propagation effects are investigated as well as the required discrimination power to distinguish photon- and hadron-initiated air showers. For present detector setups, it turns out to be challenging to achieve the required sensitivity due to the energy threshold being too high or the detection area too small. Dedicated detector concepts appear to be needed to explore the UHE frontier. Ultimately, this could provide complementary information on the sources of cosmic rays beyond the PeV regime -- a key objective of current efforts in multimessenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Testing interacting dark energy with Stage IV cosmic shear surveys through differentiable neural emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a novel framework for accelerated cosmological inference, based on neural emulators and gradient-based sampling methods, to forecast constraints on dark energy models from Stage IV cosmic shear surveys. We focus on dark scattering (DS), an interacting dark energy model with pure momentum exchange in the dark sector, and train COSMOPOWER emulators to accurately and efficiently model the DS non-linear matter power spectrum produced by the halo model reaction framework, including the effects of baryon feedback and massive neutrinos. We embed the emulators within a fully-differentiable pipeline for gradient-based cosmological inference for which the batch likelihood call is up to $O(10^5)$ times faster than with traditional approaches, producing parameter constraints from simulated Stage IV cosmic shear data running on a single graphics processing unit (GPU). We also perform model comparison on the output chains from the inference process, employing the learnt harmonic mean estimator implemented in the software HARMONIC. We investigate degeneracies between dark energy and systematics parameters and assess the impact of scale cuts on the final constraints. Assuming a DS model for the mock data vector, we find that a Stage IV survey cosmic shear analysis can constrain the DS amplitude parameter $A_{\mathrm{ds}}$ with an uncertainty roughly an order of magnitude smaller than current constraints from Stage III surveys, even after marginalising over baryonic feedback, intrinsic alignments and redshift distribution uncertainties. These results show great promise for constraining DS with Stage IV data; furthermore, our methodology can be straightforwardly extended to a wide range of dark energy and modified gravity models.</description>

      <title>Field-level cosmological model selection: field-level simulation-based inference for Stage IV cosmic shear can distinguish dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework that for the first time allows Bayesian model comparison to be performed for field-level inference of cosmological models. We achieve this by taking a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach using neural likelihood estimation, which we couple with the learned harmonic mean estimator in order to compute the Bayesian evidence for model comparison. We apply our framework to mock Stage IV cosmic shear observations to assess its effectiveness at distinguishing between various models of dark energy. If the recent DESI results that provided exciting hints of dynamical dark energy were indeed the true underlying model, our analysis shows Stage IV cosmic shear surveys could definitively detect dynamical dark energy. We also perform traditional power spectrum likelihood-based inference for comparison, which we find is not able to distinguish between dark energy models, highlighting the enhanced constraining power for model comparison of our field-level SBI approach.</description>

      <title>ANAIS-112 three years data: a sensitive model independent negative test of the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are well-motivated candidates for dark matter. One signature of galactic WIMPs is the annual modulation expected in a detector's interaction rate, which arises from Earth's revolution around the Sun. Over two decades, the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has observed such modulation with 250 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators, in accordance with WIMP expectations but inconsistent with the negative results of other experiments. The signal depends on the target material, so to validate or refute the DAMA result, the experiment must be replicated using the same material. This is the goal of the ANAIS-112 experiment, currently underway since August 2017 with 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl). In this work, we present a reanalysis of three years of data employing an improved analysis chain to enhance the experimental sensitivity. The results presented here are consistent with the absence of modulation and inconsistent with DAMA's observation at nearly 3$\sigma$ confidence level, with the potential to reach a 5$\sigma$ level within 8 years from the beginning of the data collection. Additionally, we explore the impact of different scintillation quenching factors in the comparison between ANAIS-112 and DAMA/LIBRA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this third installment of SETI in 20xx, we very briefly and subjectively review developments in SETI in 2022. Our primary focus is 80 papers and books published or made public in 2022, which we sort into six broad categories: results from actual searches, new search methods and instrumentation, target and frequency selection, the development of technosignatures, theory of ETIs, and social aspects of SETI.</description>

      <title>The JWST Early Release Science Program for Direct Observations of Exoplanetary Systems III: Aperture Masking Interferometric Observations of the star HIP 65426</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present aperture masking interferometry (AMI) observations of the star HIP 65426 at $3.8\,\rm{\mu m}$ as a part of the JWST Direct Imaging Early Release Science (ERS) program obtained using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument. This mode provides access to very small inner working angles (even separations slightly below the Michelson limit of $0.5\lambda/D$ for an interferometer), which are inaccessible with the classical inner working angles of the JWST coronagraphs. When combined with JWST's unprecedented infrared sensitivity, this mode has the potential to probe a new portion of parameter space across a wide array of astronomical observations. Using this mode, we are able to achieve a $5\sigma$ contrast of $\Delta m{\sim}7.62{\pm}0.13$ mag relative to the host star at separations ${\gtrsim}0.07{"}$, and the contrast deteriorates steeply at separations ${\lesssim}0.07{"}$. However, we detect no additional companions interior to the known companion HIP 65426 b (at separation ${\sim}0.82{"}$ or, $87^{+108}_{-31}\,\rm{au}$). Our observations thus rule out companions more massive than $10{-}12\,\rm{M_{Jup}}$ at separations ${\sim}10{-}20\,\rm{au}$ from HIP 65426, a region out of reach of ground or space-based coronagraphic imaging. These observations confirm that the AMI mode on JWST is sensitive to planetary mass companions at close-in separations (${\gtrsim}0.07{"}$), even for thousands of more distant stars at $\sim$100 pc, in addition to the stars in the nearby young moving groups as stated in previous works. This result will allow the planning and successful execution of future observations to probe the inner regions of nearby stellar systems, opening an essentially unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>A New Monte-Carlo Model for the Space Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Monte Carlo (MC) method to simulate the evolution of the low-earth orbit environment, enhancing the MIT Orbital Capacity Analysis Tool (MOCAT). In recent decades, numerous space environment models have been developed by government agencies and research groups to understand and predict the dynamics of space debris. Our MC approach advances this by simulating the trajectories of space objects and modeling their interactions, such as collisions and explosions. This aids in analyzing the trends of space-object and debris populations. A key innovation of our method is the computational efficiency in orbit propagation, which is crucial for handling potentially large numbers of objects over centuries. We present validation results against the IADC (Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee) study and explore various scenarios, including ones without future launches and those involving the launch of proposed megaconstellations with over 80,000 active payloads. With the improvement in computational efficiencies provided by this work, we can run these new scenarios that predict millions of trackable objects over a 200-year period. The previous state-of-the-art was 400,000 objects over the same period of time. Notably, while fewer megaconstellations are planned for altitudes above 800 km, even minimal failures in post-mission disposal or collision avoidance maneuvers can significantly impact orbital debris accumulation.</description>

      <title>New Candidates for Organic-rich Regions on Ceres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the spatial distribution of organics on Ceres using the visible and near-infrared data collected by the Dawn mission. We employ a spectral mixture analysis (SMA) approach to map organic materials within the Ernutet crater at the highest available spatial resolution revealing a discontinuous, granular distribution and a possible correlation with an ancient crater on which Ernutet has been superimposed. The SMA technique also helps us identify 11 new areas as potential sites for organics. These regions are predominantly located within craters or along their walls, resembling the distribution pattern observed in Ernutet, which implies a possible geological link with materials exposed from beneath the surface. In one of these candidate regions situated in the Yalode quadrangle, we detected the characteristic 3.4-micron absorption band in the infrared spectrum, indicative of organics and carbonates. By combining the spatial resolution of the Framing Camera data with the spectral resolution of the Visual and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer using SMA, we investigated the distribution of the 3.4-micron band in this quadrangle. The absorption pattern correlates with the Yalode/Urvara smooth material unit, which formed after significant impacts on Ceres. The association of organic-rich materials with complex and multiple large-impact events supports for an endogenous origin for the organics on Ceres.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-$C_\ell$s for spin-$s$ fields with component-wise weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generalisation of the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach for power spectrum estimation to the case of spin-$s$ fields weighted by a general positive-definite weight matrix that couples the different spin components of the field (e.g. $Q$ and $U$ maps in CMB polarisation analyses, or $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ shear components in weak lensing). Relevant use cases are, for example, data with significantly anisotropic noise properties, or situations in which different masks must be applied to the different field components. The weight matrix map is separated into a spin-0 part, which corresponds to the "mask" in the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach, and a spin-$2s$ part sourced solely by the anisotropic elements of the matrix, leading to additional coupling between angular scales and $E/B$ modes. The general expressions for the mode-coupling coefficients involving the power spectra of these anisotropic weight components are derived and validated. The generalised algorithm is as computationally efficient as the standard approach. We implement the method in the public code NaMaster.</description>
