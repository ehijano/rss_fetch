      <title>Enumeration of Bases in Matroid with Exponentially Large Ground Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When we deal with a matroid ${\mathcal M}=(U,{\mathcal I})$, we usually assume that it is implicitly given by means of the membership (MEM) oracle. Many existing efficient algorithms run in polynomial time with respect to $|U|$ and the running time of the MEM-oracle. However, they are not efficient any more when $U$ is exponentially large in some context. In this paper, we study two problems of enumerating bases in such matroids. First, we present an incremental-polynomial algorithm that enumerates all minimum-weighted bases, where the bounding polynomial does not depend on $|U|$. To design the algorithm, we assume two oracles other than the MEM-oracle: the MinB-oracle that returns a minimum basis and the REL-oracle that returns a relevant element one by one in non-decreasing order of weight. The proposed algorithm is applicable to enumeration of minimum bases of binary matroids from cycle space, path space and cut space, all of which have exponentially large $U$ with respect to a given graph. The highlight in this context is that, to design the REL-oracle for cut space, we develop the first polynomial-delay algorithm that enumerates all relevant cuts of a given graph in non-decreasing order of weight. Finally, we present a polynomial-delay algorithm that enumerates all sets of linearly independent $r$-dimensional $r$ vectors over $\mathit{GF}(2)$. Using the algorithm, we can enumerate all unweighted bases of a binary matroid such that elements are closed under addition, in polynomial-delay with respect to the matroid rank $r$.</description>

      <title>Dividing sums of cycles in the semiring of functional digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional digraphs are unlabelled finite digraphs where each vertex has exactly one out-neighbor. They are isomorphic classes of finite discrete-time dynamical systems. Endowed with the direct sum and product, functional digraphs form a semiring with an interesting multiplicative structure. For instance, we do not know if the following division problem can be solved in polynomial time: given two functional digraphs $A$ and $B$, does $A$ divide $B$? That $A$ divides $B$ means that there exists a functional digraph $X$ such that $AX$ is isomorphic to $B$, and many such $X$ can exist. We can thus ask for the number of solutions $X$. In this paper, we focus on the case where $B$ is a sum of cycles (a disjoint union of cycles, corresponding to the limit behavior of finite discrete-time dynamical systems). There is then a na\"ive sub-exponential algorithm to compute the non-isomorphic solutions $X$, and our main result is an improvement of this algorithm which has the property to be polynomial when $A$ is fixed. It uses a divide-and-conquer technique that should be useful for further developments on the division problem.</description>

      <title>On the Regularity of Random 2-SAT and 3-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the random $k$-SAT problem with $n$ variables, $m=m(n)$ clauses, and clause density $\alpha=\lim_{n\to\infty}m/n$ for $k=2,3$. It is known that if $\alpha$ is small enough, then the random $k$-SAT problem admits a solution with high probability, which we interpret as the problem being under-constrained. In this paper, we quantify exactly how under-constrained the random $k$-SAT problems are by determining their degrees of freedom, which we define as the threshold for the number of variables we can fix to an arbitrary value before the problem no longer is solvable with high probability. We show that the random $2$-SAT and $3$-SAT problems have $n/m^{1/2}$ and $n/m^{1/3}$ degrees of freedom, respectively. Our main result is an explicit computation of the corresponding threshold functions. Our result shows that the threshold function for the random $2$-SAT problem is regular, while it is non-regular for the random $3$-SAT problem. By regular, we mean continuous and analytic on the interior of its support. This result shows that the random $3$-SAT problem is more sensitive to small changes in the clause density $\alpha$ than the random $2$-SAT problem.</description>

      <title>The Gray graph is pseudo 2-factor isomorphic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph is pseudo 2-factor isomorphic if all of its 2-factors have the same parity of number of cycles. Abreu et al. [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B. 98 (2008) 432--442] conjectured that $K_{3,3}$, the Heawood graph and the Pappus graph are the only essentially 4-edge-connected pseudo 2-factor isomorphic cubic bipartite graphs. This conjecture was disproved by Goedgebeur [Discr. Appl. Math. 193 (2015) 57--60] who constructed a counterexample $\mathcal{G}$ (of girth 6) on 30 vertices. Using a computer search, he also showed that this is the only counterexample up to at least 40 vertices and that there are no counterexamples of girth greater than 6 up to at least 48 vertices.
  In this manuscript, we show that the Gray graph -- which has 54 vertices and girth 8 -- is also a counterexample to the pseudo 2-factor isomorphic graph conjecture. Next to the graph $\mathcal{G}$, this is the only other known counterexample. Using a computer search, we show that there are no smaller counterexamples of girth 8 and show that there are no other counterexamples up to at least 42 vertices of any girth. Moreover, we also verified that there are no further counterexamples among the known censuses of symmetrical graphs.
  Recall that a graph is 2-factor Hamiltonian if all of its 2-factors are Hamiltonian cycles. As a by-product of the computer searches performed for this paper, we have verified that the $2$-factor Hamiltonian conjecture of Funk et al. [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B. 87(1) (2003) 138--144], which is still open, holds for cubic bipartite graphs of girth at least 8 up to 52 vertices, and up to 42 vertices for any girth.</description>

      <title>Set families: restricted distances via restricted intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denote by $f_D(n)$ the maximum size of a set family $\mathcal{F}$ on $[n] = \{1, \dots, n\}$ with distance set $D$. That is, $|A \bigtriangleup B| \in D$ holds for every pair of distinct sets $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$. Kleitman's celebrated discrete isodiametric inequality states that $f_D(n)$ is maximized at Hamming balls of radius $d/2$ when $D = \{1, \dots, d\}$. We study the generalization where $D$ is a set of arithmetic progression and determine $f_D(n)$ asymptotically for all homogeneous $D$. In the special case when $D$ is an interval, our result confirms a conjecture of Huang, Klurman, and Pohoata. Moreover, we demonstrate a dichotomy in the growth of $f_D(n)$, showing linear growth in $n$ when $D$ is a non-homogeneous arithmetic progression. Different from previous combinatorial and spectral approaches, we deduce our results by converting the restricted distance problems to restricted intersection problems.
  Our proof ideas can be adapted to prove upper bounds on $t$-distance sets in Hamming cubes (also known as binary $t$-codes), which has been extensively studied by algebraic combinatorialists community, improving previous bounds from polynomial methods and optimization approaches.</description>

      <title>Tangled Paths: A Random Graph Model from Mallows Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.04786v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the random graph $\mathcal{P}(n,q)$ which results from taking the union of two paths of length $n\geq 1$, where the vertices of one of the paths have been relabelled according to a Mallows permutation with parameter $0&lt;q(n)\leq 1$. This random graph model, the tangled path, goes through an evolution: if $q$ is close to $0$ the graph bears resemblance to a path, and as $q$ tends to $1$ it becomes an expander. In an effort to understand the evolution of $\mathcal{P}(n,q)$ we determine the treewidth and cutwidth of $\mathcal{P}(n,q)$ up to log factors for all $q$. We also show that the property of having a separator of size one has a sharp threshold. In addition, we prove bounds on the diameter, and vertex isoperimetric number for specific values of $q$.</description>
