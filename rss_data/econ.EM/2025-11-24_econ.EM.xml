      <title>Approximate Least-Favorable Distributions and Nearly Optimal Tests via Stochastic Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of hypothesis testing problems where the null hypothesis postulates $M$ distributions for the observed data, and there is only one possible distribution under the alternative. We show that one can use a stochastic mirror descent routine for convex optimization to provably obtain - after finitely many iterations - both an approximate least-favorable distribution and a nearly optimal test, in a sense we make precise. Our theoretical results yield concrete recommendations about the algorithm's implementation, including its initial condition, its step size, and the number of iterations. Importantly, our suggested algorithm can be viewed as a slight variation of the algorithm suggested by Elliott, M\"uller, and Watson (2015), whose theoretical performance guarantees are unknown.</description>

      <title>Optimising pandemic response through vaccination strategies using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemic risk assessment poses inherent challenges, with traditional approaches often failing to balance health outcomes and economic constraints. This paper presents a data-driven decision support tool that models epidemiological dynamics and optimises vaccination strategies to control disease spread whilst minimising economic losses. The proposed economic-epidemiological framework comprises three phases: modelling, optimising, and analysing. First, a stochastic compartmental model captures epidemic dynamics. Second, an optimal control problem is formulated to derive vaccination strategies that minimise pandemic-related expenditure. Given the analytical intractability of epidemiological models, neural networks are employed to calibrate parameters and solve the high-dimensional control problem. The framework is demonstrated using COVID-19 data from Victoria, Australia, empirically deriving optimal vaccination strategies that simultaneously minimise disease incidence and governmental expenditure. By employing this three-phase framework, policymakers can adjust input values to reflect evolving transmission dynamics and continuously update strategies, thereby minimising aggregate costs, aiding future pandemic preparedness.</description>

      <title>Modified Delayed Acceptance MCMC for Quasi-Bayesian Inference with Linear Moment Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a computationally efficient framework for quasi-Bayesian inference based on linear moment conditions. The approach employs a delayed acceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo (DA-MCMC) algorithm that uses a surrogate target kernel and a proposal distribution derived from an approximate conditional posterior, thereby exploiting the structure of the quasi-likelihood. Two implementations are introduced. DA-MCMC-Exact fully incorporates prior information into the proposal distribution and maximizes per-iteration efficiency, whereas DA-MCMC-Approx omits the prior in the proposal to reduce matrix inversions, improving numerical stability and computational speed in higher dimensions. Simulation studies on heteroskedastic linear regressions show substantial gains over standard MCMC and conventional DA-MCMC baselines, measured by multivariate effective sample size per iteration and per second. The Approx variant yields the best overall throughput, while the Exact variant attains the highest per-iteration efficiency. Applications to two empirical instrumental variable regressions corroborate these findings: the Approx implementation scales to larger designs where other methods become impractical, while still delivering precise inference. Although developed for moment-based quasi-posteriors, the proposed approach also extends to risk-based quasi-Bayesian formulations when first-order conditions are linear and can be transformed analogously. Overall, the proposed algorithms provide a practical and robust tool for quasi-Bayesian analysis in statistical applications.</description>

      <title>Large Bayesian Tensor Autoregressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The availability of multidimensional economic datasets has grown significantly in recent years. An example is bilateral trade values across goods among countries, comprising three dimensions -- importing countries, exporting countries, and goods -- forming a third-order tensor time series. This paper introduces a general Bayesian tensor autoregressive framework to analyze the dynamics of large, multidimensional time series with a particular focus on international trade across different countries and sectors. Departing from the standard homoscedastic assumption in this literature, we incorporate flexible stochastic volatility into the tensor autoregressive models. The proposed models can capture time-varying volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic and recent outbreaks of war. To address computational challenges and mitigate overfitting, we develop an efficient sampling method based on low-rank Tucker decomposition and hierarchical shrinkage priors. Additionally, we provide a factor interpretation of the model showing how the Tucker decomposition projects large-dimensional disaggregated trade flows onto global factors.</description>
