      <title>S2Doc - Spatial-Semantic Document Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Documents are a common way to store and share information, with tables being an important part of many documents. However, there is no real common understanding of how to model documents and tables in particular. Because of this lack of standardization, most scientific approaches have their own way of modeling documents and tables, leading to a variety of different data structures and formats that are not directly compatible. Furthermore, most data models focus on either the spatial or the semantic structure of a document, neglecting the other aspect. To address this, we developed S2Doc, a flexible data structure for modeling documents and tables that combines both spatial and semantic information in a single format. It is designed to be easily extendable to new tasks and supports most modeling approaches for documents and tables, including multi-page documents. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first approach of its kind to combine all these aspects in a single format.</description>

      <title>Reforming research funding: Combining editorial preregistration with grant peer review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competitive grant funding is associated with high costs and a potential bias to favor conservative research. This comment proposes integrating editorial preregistration, in the form of registered reports, into grant peer review processes as a reform strategy. Linking funding decisions to in principle accepted study protocols would reduce reviewer burden, strengthen methodological rigor, and provide an institutional foundation for (more) replication, theory driven research, and high risk research. Our proposal also minimizes strategic proposal writing and ensures scholarly output through the publication of preregistered protocols, regardless of funding outcomes. Possible implementation models include direct coupling of journal acceptance with funding, co review mechanisms, voucher systems, and lotteries. While challenges remain in aligning journal and funding agency procedures, the integration of preregistration and funding offers a promising pathway toward a more transparent and efficient research ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Calculating Web Impact Factor for University Websites of Jammu and Kashmir: A Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines and explores the web impact factor through a webometric study of the present 12 University Websites of Jammu and Kashmir. Identifies the domain systems of the websites; analyzes the number of web pages and link pages, and calculates the External Link WIF or simple web impact factor (WIF) and external web impact factor of all the University websites. Also reflects that some university websites have higher number of web pages, but correspondingly their link pages are very small in number and websites fall behind in their simple and external link web impact factor. It found that the Cluster University of Jammu ranked 1 (0.9018) in Internal Link WIF of Websites in Jammu and Kashmir. Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University ranked 1 (0.7249) in External Link Web Impact Factor.</description>

      <title>Incorrect Citation Association for Articles in Online-Only Springer Nature Journals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that citation metrics of journal articles in many of the online-only Springer Nature journals and associated ones, such as Scientific Reports, Nature Communications, Communications journals, as well as many BMC, Discovery and npj journals, are distorted, going back to articles from 2001. We find that most likely due to an API response error, many references lead to the wrong article, typically to Article Number 1 of a given Volume. Beyond the negative effect of introducing incorrect reference information, this distorts the citation statistics of articles in these journals, with a few articles being massively over-cited compared to their peers, while many lose citations; e.g. both in Scientific Reports and in Nature Communications, 5 of the 10 top cited articles are article number 1s. We validate the distorted statistics by assessing data from multiple scientific literature databases: Crossref, OpenCitations, Semantic Scholar, and the journals' websites. The issue primarily arises from the inconsistent transition from page-based referencing of articles to article number-based referencing, as well as the improper handling of the change in the publisher's article metadata API. It seems that the most pressing problem has been present since approximately 2011, which we estimate affects the citation count of millions of authors.</description>

      <title>Novelty and Impact of Economics Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework that recasts scientific novelty not as a single attribute of a paper, but as a reflection of its position within the evolving intellectual landscape. We decompose this position into two orthogonal dimensions: \textit{spatial novelty}, which measures a paper's intellectual distinctiveness from its neighbors, and \textit{temporal novelty}, which captures its engagement with a dynamic research frontier. To operationalize these concepts, we leverage Large Language Models to develop semantic isolation metrics that quantify a paper's location relative to the full-text literature. Applying this framework to a large corpus of economics articles, we uncover a fundamental trade-off: these two dimensions predict systematically different outcomes. Temporal novelty primarily predicts citation counts, whereas spatial novelty predicts disruptive impact. This distinction allows us to construct a typology of semantic neighborhoods, identifying four archetypes associated with distinct and predictable impact profiles. Our findings demonstrate that novelty can be understood as a multidimensional construct whose different forms, reflecting a paper's strategic location, have measurable and fundamentally distinct consequences for scientific progress.</description>

      <title>"Don't Teach Minerva": Guiding LLMs Through Complex Syntax for Faithful Latin Translation with RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Translating a morphology-rich, low-resource language like Latin poses significant challenges. This paper introduces a reproducible draft-based refinement pipeline that elevates open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to a performance level statistically comparable to top-tier proprietary systems. Our method first uses a fine-tuned NLLB-1.3B model to generate a high-quality, structurally faithful draft. A zero-shot LLM (Llama-3.3 or Qwen3) then polishes this draft, a process that can be further enhanced by augmenting the context with retrieved out-context examples (RAG). We demonstrate the robustness of this approach on two distinct benchmarks: a standard in-domain test set (Rosenthal, 2023) and a new, challenging out-of-domain (OOD) set of 12th-century Latin letters (2025). Our central finding is that this open-source RAG system achieves performance statistically comparable to the GPT-5 baseline, without any task-specific LLM fine-tuning. We release the pipeline, the Chartres OOD set, and evaluation scripts and models to facilitate replicability and further research.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Approach to Estimating Bias, Favouritism and Distortion in Scientific Journalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While traditionally not considered part of the scientific method, science communication is increasingly playing a pivotal role in shaping scientific practice. Researchers are now frequently compelled to publicise their findings in response to institutional impact metrics and competitive grant environments. This shift underscores the growing influence of media narratives on both scientific priorities and public perception. In a current trend of personality-driven reporting, we examine patterns in science communication that may indicate biases of different types, towards topics and researchers. We focused and applied our methodology to a corpus of media coverage from three of the most prominent scientific media outlets: Wired, Quanta, and The New Scientist -- spanning the past 5 to 10 years. By mapping linguistic patterns, citation flows, and topical convergence, our objective was to quantify the dimensions and degree of bias that influence the credibility of scientific journalism. In doing so, we seek to illuminate the systemic features that shape science communication today and to interrogate their broader implications for epistemic integrity and public accountability in science. We present our results with anonymised journalist names but conclude that personality-driven media coverage distorts science and the practice of science flattening rather than expanding scientific coverage perception. Keywords : selective sourcing, bias, scientific journalism, Quanta, Wired, New Scientist, fairness, balance, neutrality, standard practices, distortion, personal promotion, communication, media outlets.</description>

      <title>Gymnasium: A Standard Interface for Reinforcement Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17032v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a continuously growing field that has the potential to revolutionize many areas of artificial intelligence. However, despite its promise, RL research is often hindered by the lack of standardization in environment and algorithm implementations. This makes it difficult for researchers to compare and build upon each other's work, slowing down progress in the field. Gymnasium is an open-source library that provides a standard API for RL environments, aiming to tackle this issue. Gymnasium's main feature is a set of abstractions that allow for wide interoperability between environments and training algorithms, making it easier for researchers to develop and test RL algorithms. In addition, Gymnasium provides a collection of easy-to-use environments, tools for easily customizing environments, and tools to ensure the reproducibility and robustness of RL research. Through this unified framework, Gymnasium significantly streamlines the process of developing and testing RL algorithms, enabling researchers to focus more on innovation and less on implementation details. By providing a standardized platform for RL research, Gymnasium helps to drive forward the field of reinforcement learning and unlock its full potential. Gymnasium is available online at https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium</description>
