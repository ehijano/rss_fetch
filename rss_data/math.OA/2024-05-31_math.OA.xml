      <title>On Haagerup noncommutative quasi $H^p(\A)$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a $\sigma$-finite von Neumann algebra, equipped with a normal faithful state $\varphi$, and let $\mathcal{A}$ be a maximal subdiagonal subalgebra of $\mathcal{M}$.
  We have proved that for $0&lt; p&lt;1$, $H^p(\mathcal{A})$ is independent of $\varphi$. Furthermore, in the case that $\mathcal{A}$ is a type 1 subdiagonal subalgebra, we have extended the most recent results about the Riesz type factorization to the case $0&lt;p&lt;1$ and have proved an interpolation theorem for $H^p(\mathcal{A})$ in the case where $0 &lt; p_0, p_1 \le \infty$.</description>

      <title>Katsura's self-similar groupoid actions, Putnam's binary factors, and their limit spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the dynamical system associated by Putnam to a pair of graph embeddings is identical to the shift map on the limit space of a self-similar groupoid action on a graph. Moreover, performing a certain out-split on said graph gives rise to a Katsura groupoid action on the out-split graph whose associated limit space dynamical system is conjugate to the previous one. We characterise the self-similar properties of these groupoids in terms of properties of their defining data, two matrices $A$, $B$. We prove a large class of the associated limit spaces are bundles of circles and points which fibre over a totally disconnected space, and the dynamics restricted to each circle is of the form $z\to z^{n}$. Moreover, we find a planar embedding of these spaces, thereby answering a question Putnam posed in his paper.</description>

      <title>A collection of cancellative, right LCM, not group-embeddable monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By classical results of Malcev, cancellative monoids need not be group-embeddable. In this paper, we describe and give presentations for and study an infinite family $\mathcal{M}_n$ of cancellative monoids which are not group-embeddable, originating from Malcev's original work. We show that $\mathcal{M}_n$ is right LCM for $n \geq 2$, owing to applications in the study of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras by Brix, Bruce and Dor-On. We finish by showing that $\mathcal{M}_1$ is not right LCM, but is $2$-aligned.</description>

      <title>Multiplication operators on the Bergman space of bounded domains in C^d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:1511.01678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study multiplication operators on Bergman spaces of high dimensional bounded domains and those von Neumann algebras induced by them via the geometry of domains and function theory of their symbols. In particular, using local inverses and $L^2_a$-removability, we show that for a holomorphic proper map $\Phi =(\phi_1, \phi_2, \cdots , \phi_d)$ on a bounded domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{C}^{d}$, the dimension of the von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{V}^*(\Phi ,\Omega) $ consisting of bounded operators on the Bergman space $L_a^2(\Omega)$, which commute with both $ M_{\phi_j}$ and its adjoint $M_{\phi_j}^*$ for each $j$, equals the number of components of the complex manifold $\mathcal{S}_{\Phi }= \{(z,w)\in \Omega^2: \Phi (z)=\Phi (w),\, z\not\in \Phi ^{-1}(\Phi (Z))\},$ where $Z$ is the zero variety of the Jacobian $J\Phi $ of $ \Phi.$ This extends the main result in \cite{DSZ} in high dimensional complex domains. Moreover we show that the von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{V}^*(\Phi ,\Omega) $ may not be abelian in general although Douglas, Putinar and Wang \cite{DPW} showed that $\mathcal{V}^*(\Phi ,\mathbb{D})$ for the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ is abelian.</description>

      <title>Free Integral Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of conditional expectations in free random variables and provide closed formulas for the conditional expectation of resolvents of arbitrary non-commutative polynomials in free random variables onto the subalgebra of an arbitray subset of the variables. More precisely, given a linearization of the resolvent we compute a linearization of its conditional expectation. The coefficients of the expressions obtained in this process involve certain Boolean cumulant functionals which can be computed by solving a system of equations. On the way towards the main result we introduce a non-commutative differential calculus which allows to evaluate conditional expectations and the said Boolean cumulant functionals. We conclude the paper with several known and new examples which illustrate the working of the developed machinery and two appendices. The first appendix contains a purely algebraic approach to Boolean cumulants and the second appendix provides a crash course on linearizations of rational series.</description>

      <title>Spectral Truncation Kernels: Noncommutativity in $C^*$-algebraic Kernel Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new class of positive definite kernels based on the spectral truncation, which has been discussed in the fields of noncommutative geometry and $C^*$-algebra. We focus on kernels whose inputs and outputs are functions and generalize existing kernels, such as polynomial, product, and separable kernels, by introducing a truncation parameter $n$ that describes the noncommutativity of the products appearing in the kernels. When $n$ goes to infinity, the proposed kernels tend to the existing commutative kernels. If $n$ is finite, they exhibit different behavior, and the noncommutativity induces interactions along the data function domain. We show that the truncation parameter $n$ is a governing factor leading to performance enhancement: by setting an appropriate $n$, we can balance the representation power and the complexity of the representation space. The flexibility of the proposed class of kernels allows us to go beyond previous commutative kernels.</description>
