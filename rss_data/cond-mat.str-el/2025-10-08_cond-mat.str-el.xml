      <title>Vestigial $d$-wave charge-$4e$ Superconductivity from Bidirectional Pair Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the leading vestigial instability due to the melting of a bidirectional pair-density-wave state in two dimensions. In a previous work by one of the authors, it was found that the interplay between pair-density-wave fluctuations with ordering momenta along the $x$ and $y$ directions can provide a strong attractive interaction for charge-$4e$ superconductivity in the $d$-wave channel. In this work, we go beyond the artificial large-$M$ mean-field theory previously adopted and compute the phase diagram by incorporating phase fluctuations of the pair-density-wave order parameters. By investigating the relevance of various topological defects, we show that the interaction in the $d$-wave channel, together with the strong anisotropy of phase fluctuations around the pair-density-wave ordering momenta, favors a vestigial charge-$4e$ superconducting order at intermediate temperatures. By contrast, a competing charge-density-wave vestigial order does not develop, due to the suppression of its stiffness.</description>

      <title>Spin-spiral instability of the Nagaoka ferromagnet in the crossover between square and triangular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model in the crossover between square and triangular lattices near half-filling. As was recognized by Nagaoka in the 1960s, on the square lattice the presence of a single hole leads to ferromagnetic spin ordering. On the triangular lattice, geometric frustration instead leads to a spin-singlet ground state, which can be associated with a 120-degree spiral order. On lattices which interpolate between square and triangular, there is a phase transition at which the ferromagnetic order becomes unstable to a spin spiral. We model this instability, finding the exact critical point.</description>

      <title>TeMFpy: a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states into tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce TeMFpy, a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states to finite or infinite matrix product state (MPS) form. TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Boundary criticality in two-dimensional correlated topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a boundary enriches the nature of quantum phase transitions. However, the boundary critical phenomena in topological superconductors remain underexplored so far. Here, we investigate the boundary criticality in a two-dimensional correlated time-reversal-invariant topological superconductor tuned through a quantum phase transition into a trivial time-reversal-breaking superconductor. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we chart the quantum phase diagram and reveal the boundary criticalities encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. Additionally, using renormalization group analysis, we compute the boundary critical exponent up to two loops. Remarkably, the simulations and two-loop renormalization group calculations consistently demonstrate that the presence of the boundary Majorana fermion at the special transition gives rise to a new type of boundary Gross-Neveu-Yukawa fixed point. We conclude with a discussion of possible experimental realizations in iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in vanadium Kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of layered Kagome metals $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$ has recently attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, as suggested by their response to magnetic fields. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic phase that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Starting from a nine-band tight-binding model and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, we find nematic order to emerge in a narrow region of phase space within mean-field theory. The nematic state is a superposition of charge-bond order along one Kagome bond and loop-current order on the other two, preserving one of the three mirror planes. To understand this behaviour, we examine an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Within the effective model, nematic order is stabilized by the coupling between the complex phases of the three bond order parameters. As a consequence, the nematic phase develops an elongated Fermi surface distinct from those of competing phases.</description>

      <title>Liquid-gas analog multicriticality in a frustrated Ising bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a multicritical point that extends the liquid-gas paradigm to systems with competing symmetry-breaking orders. Using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of a frustrated bilayer Ising antiferromagnet with tunable couplings, we map out a rich finite-temperature phase diagram hosting three ordered phases separated by both continuous and first-order transitions. By tuning the couplings, a tricritical line and a critical end-point line converge into a single multicritical line. At all points along the multicritical line, symmetry-distinct phases exhibit identical leading critical behavior -- consistent with the tricritical Ising universality class -- while the subleading exponent exhibits a sharp shift from $y_g = 0.8$ to $y_g = 1$. This shift reflects an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry akin to that of the liquid-gas critical point, but realized here at a genuine multicritical point involving simultaneous microscopic symmetry breaking. Our results establish a universality scenario in which emergent symmetry preserves the leading class but reorganizes subleading scaling, providing a general mechanism for symmetry-enforced multicriticality.</description>

      <title>Hidden phonon-assisted charge density wave transition in BaFe2Al9 revealed by ultrafast optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom is fundamental to charge density wave (CDW) formation, yet the microscopic origin often remains elusive. Here, we investigate the transient optical response of the intermetallic compound BaFe2Al9 using polarization-resolved ultrafast optical spectroscopy. We identify a discontinuous sign reversal in the transient reflectivity at Tc ~ 110 K, providing unambiguous evidence for the first-order transition. The anisotropic quasiparticle relaxation establishes the three-dimensional nature of the ordered state. Below Tc, a single coherent 1.6 THz oscillation appears abruptly and remains confined to the CDW phase. This mode exhibits weak temperature dependence with negligible softening and is absent in Raman spectra. First-principles calculations imply that it is a precursor phonon at the CDW wave vector with strong electron-phonon coupling. Our results indicate that the CDW in BaFe2Al9 arises from intertwined electronic and lattice instabilities, assisted by a displacive mechanism mediated by a hidden strongly coupled phonon, distinct from conventional amplitude-mode softening scenarios.</description>

      <title>Metastability of the Topological Magnetic Orders in the Chiral Antiferromagnet EuPtSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report resistivity and Hall effect measurements in the chiral antiferromagnet EuPtSi. Depending on the magnetic field orientation with respect to the crystallographic axes, EuPtSi presents different topological magnetic phases below the N\'eel temperature $T_N=4.05$K. In particular, for a field $H \parallel $ [111], it exhibits the well known skyrmion lattice A-phase inside the conical phase between $T=0.45$K and $T_N$ in the field range from 0.8T to 1.4T. Remarkably, the skyrmion lattice state in EuPtSi, composed of nanoscale skyrmions, can be extended down to very low temperature (lower than 0.1K) through field-cooling regardless of the cooling rate and of the magnetic history. Similarly the metastability of the A'- and B-phases ($H \parallel $ [100]) at low temperature is evidenced by our measurements. These results suggest that EuPtSi is a peculiar example where the competition between the topological stability and the thermal agitation can lead to metastable quantum skyrmion state.</description>

      <title>Commensurate-incommensurate Mott transition without magnetic field: emergence of nematic Luttinger liquid in XXZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-magnetization phase diagram of a spin-1/2 chain with competing ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor exchange couplings in the strongly interacting regime. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we discover two successive commensurate-incommensurate transitions of the non-conformal Pokrovsky-Talapov universality class, occurring (even) at zero magnetic field. The first transition marks the condensation of bound pairs of magnons into a critical phase with central charge $c=2$, emerging from a gapped period-4 phase. At the second transition, an incommensurate quadrupolar (or nematic) Luttinger liquid forms out of a gapped phase separation state, via the pairwise condensation of domain walls. We argue that both transitions involve the same underlying incommensurate nematic Luttinger liquid, and that the $c=2$ phase can be understood as a coexistence of a conventional (single-magnon type) and quadrupolar (two-magnon type) Luttinger liquids. Our results demonstrate that frustration alone is sufficient to drive continuous commensurate-incommensurate transitions of Mott type and stabilise incommensurate quasi-long-range order without doping.</description>

      <title>Identifying chiral topological order in microscopic spin models by modular commutator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral central charge $c_-$ is a key topological invariant of the edge characterizing the bulk two-dimensional chiral topological order, but its direct evaluation in microscopic spin models has long been a challenge, especially for non-abelian topological order. Building on the recently developed modular commutator formalism, we numerically obtain $c_-$ directly from single ground-state wave functions of two-dimensional interacting spin models that have chiral topological order. This provides a geometry-independent and bulk diagnostic of chirality. We study two nonintegrable systems -- the Zeeman-Kitaev honeycomb model and the kagome antiferromagnet -- both subjected to scalar spin chirality perturbations. We find that the modular commutator yields results consistent with the expected topological quantum field theories. We also compute the topological entanglement entropy which provides an independent diagnostic of the topological orders. Our work establishes modular commutators as a powerful numerical probe of chiral topological order in strongly correlated quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Frieze charge-stripes in a correlated kagome superconductor CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals have developed into a vibrant playground for materials physics, where geometric frustration, electronic correlations and band topology come together to create a variety of exotic phenomena. Recently synthesized CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ has provided a rare opportunity to explore unconventional superconductivity in a strongly correlated kagome system with hints of frustrated magnetism and quantum criticality. Using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we reveal a cascade of density wave transitions with different symmetries in bulk single crystals of CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$. In particular, we discover a new electronic state $-$ a unidirectional density wave that breaks all mirror symmetries akin to a chiral density wave, but in contrast retains a mirror-glide symmetry. We term this state a frieze charge-stripe order phase, because its symmetry properties agree with one of the fundamental frieze symmetry groups. A combination of high-resolution imaging, Fourier analysis and theoretical simulations uncovers the crucial role of sublattice degrees of freedom in forming this phase, with internal chiral textures of opposite handedness. Our experiments reveal that superconductivity in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ develops from a new type of a unidirectional density wave, and set the foundation for exploring electronic states with frieze symmetry groups in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.</description>

      <title>Superfluid weight in disordered flat-band superconductors as a competition between localization functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to Anderson's theorem, the gap of a time-reversal symmetric weak-coupling superconductor is unaffected by non-magnetic disorder. However, the superfluid weight (stiffness) is reduced in the disordered limit by a factor of $\Delta \tau$, a product of the scattering time $\tau$ and the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$. Here we show that the opposite holds true in flat-band superconductors. While non-magnetic disorder does reduce the order parameter, we find that its direct effect on superfluid weight is mostly negligible. We show analytically that the effect of disorder is to lowest order given in terms of the difference between the intraband and interband parts of the localization functional of impurity wavefunctions, finding it to be typically vanishing.</description>

      <title>Variational and field-theoretical approach to exciton-exciton interactions and biexcitons in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general description of their interactions is complicated due to their composite nature, which leads to exchange between the identical fermions of different excitons. In this work we employ a variational approach to study interactions between Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This potential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the particles. When particularized to hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, it becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the Heitler-London potential to arbitrary masses. Including corrections due to excited states results in a van der Waals potential at large distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a many-body theory for a gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in the field representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal exchange processes arise in the field-theoretical treatment, and show that the diagrams corresponding to the interactions between excitons align with our variational calculation when evaluated on shell. Our methods and results lay the groundwork for a generalized theory of exciton-exciton interactions and their application to the study of biexciton spectra and correlated excitonic matter.</description>

      <title>Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact solution for a quantum quench in an integrable system that reveals a new, coherent pathway to thermalization. In chaotic systems, thermalization is understood via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which implies that a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state should exhibit trivial dynamics. In contrast, integrable systems are expected to retain memory of their initial conditions in a non-thermal generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We show that a quench from a TPQ state in the integrable spin-1/2 XX chain defies both expectations. The system thermalizes to a canonical Gibbs ensemble, yet the entanglement dynamics are highly non-trivial, exhibiting a "double plateau" structure. We solve this process exactly using techniques in two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories (CFT), an exact numerical method based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. We prove that the non-trivial dynamics are the macroscopic signature of the coherent dephasing of the initial state's anomalous pairing correlations.</description>

      <title>Hayden--Preskill Model via Local Quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the Hayden--Preskill (HP) information recovery protocol in 2d CFTs via local joining quenches. Euclidean path integrals with slits prepare the HP subsystems: the message $M$, its reference $N$, the Page-time black hole $B$, the early radiation $E$, and the late radiation $R$; the remaining black hole after emitting $R$ is denoted as $B'$. The single-slit geometry provides an analytically tractable toy model, while the bounded-slit geometry more closely captures the HP setup. In the free Dirac fermion 2d CFT, the mutual information $I(N\!:\!B')$ shows quasi-particle dynamics with partial or full revivals, whereas that in holographic 2d CFTs, which are expected to be maximally chaotic, exhibit sharp transitions: in the bounded-slit case, when the size of the late radiation becomes comparable to that of the reference $N$, $I(N\!:\!B')$ does vanish at late time, otherwise it remains finite. This contrast between free CFTs and holographic CFTs gives a clear characterization of the HP recovery threshold.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical analog simulation of two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard models with neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model using a Rydberg-based quantum processing unit in the analog mode. Our approach avoids encoding directly the original fermions into qubits and instead relies on reformulating the original model onto a system of fermions coupled to spins and then decoupling them in a self-consistent manner. We then introduce the auxiliary spin solver: this hybrid quantum-classical algorithm handles a free-fermion problem, which can be solved efficiently with a few classical resources, and an interacting spin problem, which can be naturally encoded in the analog quantum computer. This algorithm can be used to study both the equilibrium Mott transition as well as non-equilibrium properties of the original Fermi-Hubbard model, highlighting the potential of quantum-classical hybrid approaches to study strongly correlated matter.</description>

      <title>Connections between Richardson-Gaudin States, Perfect-Pairing, and Pair Coupled-Cluster Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slater determinants underpin most electronic structure methods, but orbital-based approaches often struggle to describe strong correlation efficiently. Geminal-based theories, by contrast, naturally capture static correlation in bond-breaking and multireference problems, though at the expense of implementation complexity and limited treatment of dynamic effects. In this work, we examine the interplay between orbital and geminal frameworks, focusing on perfect-pairing (PP) wavefunctions and their relation to pair coupled-cluster doubles (pCCD) and Richardson-Gaudin (RG) states. We show that PP arises as an eigenvector of a simplified reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) Hamiltonian expressed in bonding/antibonding orbital pairs, with the complementary eigenvectors enabling a systematic treatment of weak correlation. Second-order Epstein-Nesbet perturbation theory on top of PP is found to yield energies nearly equivalent to pCCD. These results clarify the role of pair-based ans\"atze and open avenues for hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of orbital- and geminal-based methods.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional "spin" systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <title>Visualization of spin-orbit entangled 4f electrons in crystalline materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lanthanide 4f electrons are strongly influenced by spin-orbit coupling, resulting in well-defined J multiplets, which are further split by the crystalline electric field in condensed matter. While the anisotropy of 4f electrons is closely linked to material properties, direct experimental observation of the 4f electron distribution in real space remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an approach for visualizing the anisotropic distribution of lanthanide 4f electrons in pyrochlore oxides by combining high-photon-energy X-ray diffraction and valence electron density (VED) analysis based on the core differential Fourier synthesis (CDFS) method. The observed VED distributions around the lanthanide site reveal the parameters of the ground-state wavefunction, which roughly agree with point-charge calculations for the trigonal crystal electric field under the LS coupling scheme. This CDFS-based VED observation method not only provides insights into the anisotropic nature of 4f electrons but also opens a pathway for studying the 4f states in a wide range of crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Catalog of cubic, symmetry-protected, non-Fermi liquid, Kondo-type exchange models for doublet impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To identify what types of non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior are most likely to occur in cubic metals due to doublet impurities, we derive every cubic symmetry-allowed, NFL, Kondo-type exchange coupling that does not need accidental degeneracy for its realization. We find three distinct types of NFL behavior: two-channel Kondo (2CK) behavior for a non-Kramers doublet impurity coupled to local $\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons; topological Kondo physics for a Kramers doublet impurity and $\Gamma_4$ or $\Gamma_5$ conduction electrons; and lastly, spin-half impurity spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ conduction electron Kondo behavior for a Kramers doublet impurity and $\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons. The first two critical behaviors are not straightforward to realize. In the first case, 2CK physics is not guaranteed, since cubic symmetry does not prevent an effective spatial anisotropy from exceeding the 2CK coupling, which restores a Fermi liquid behavior. In the second case, the topological Kondo interaction is guaranteed to dominate, however, the spin degeneracy of the conduction electrons needs to be lifted e.g. by a magnetic field$-$so that they can be represented by $\Gamma_4$ or $\Gamma_5$ triplets$-$which then also lifts the degeneracy of the Kramers doublet. We find that the spin-half impurity spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ conduction electron, NFL, Kondo behavior has the greatest chance of existing in diluted, cubic compounds. We compute the thermodynamics of the topological Kondo model using the numerical renormalization group, and discuss the thermodynamics of the spin-half impurity spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ conduction electron Kondo model. We also identify candidate materials where the corresponding NFL behaviors could be observed.</description>

      <title>Multipolar Fermi Surface Deformations in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ Probed by Resistivity and Sound Attenuation: A Window into Electron Viscosity and the Collision Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in electron hydrodynamics have demonstrated the importance of considering the full structure of the electron-electron scattering operator, which encodes a sequence of lifetimes, one for each component of the Fermi surface deformation in a multipolar expansion. In this context, the dipolar lifetime is measured by resistivity, whereas the quadrupolar component probes the viscosity and can be measured in the bulk via sound attenuation. We introduce a framework to extract the collision operator of an arbitrary metal by combining resistivity and sound attenuation measurements with a realistic calculation of the scattering operator that includes multiband and Umklapp effects. The collision operator allows for the prediction of a plethora of properties, including the non-local conductivity, and can be used to predict hydrodynamic behavior for bulk metals. As a first application, we apply this framework to Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in a temperature range where electron-electron scattering is dominant. We find quantitative agreement between our model and the temperature dependence of both the resistivity and the sound attenuation, we find the quadrupolar (B1g) relaxation rate to be 30% higher than the dipolar one due to the presence of hot spots on the $\gamma$ band, and we predict a strongly anisotropic viscosity arising from the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model, such anyons of the QSL state can be bound to nonmagnetic spin vacancies and endowed with non-Abelian statistics by an infinitesimal magnetic field. Here, we investigate how this approach for stabilizing non-Abelian anyons extends to a finite magnetic field represented by a proper Zeeman term. Through large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute the vacancy-anyon binding energy as a function of magnetic field for both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev models. We find that anyon binding remains robust within the entire QSL phase for the FM Kitaev model but breaks down already inside this phase for the AFM Kitaev model. To compute a binding energy several orders of magnitude below the magnetic energy scale, we introduce both a refined definition and an extrapolation scheme based on carefully tailored perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spin systems with extensive degeneracies in the classical ground states due to anisotropic frustrated spin interactions, where the degeneracy is not protected by symmetry. Using spin functional integration, we study the lifting of the degeneracies by fluctuations called order-by-disorder (ObD), and the associated gap in the spin-wave spectrum. It is shown that ObD corresponds to gradient-dependent anisotropic interactions of the pseudo-Goldstone modes, which vanish for a classical uniform spin configuration. Fluctuations generate a gradient-independent effective potential which determines the ground state and the pseudo-Goldstone gap. Furthermore, we recover previous predictions for the pseudo-Goldstone gap in type-I and II ObD with two-spin interactions in the large spin-$S$ limit or the classical small temperature limit, by computing the gap explicitly for the type-II cubic compass model and the type-I square compass model. We show that these two limits correspond to the one-loop approximation for the effective potential. We also discuss other types of order by disorder due to $m$-spin interactions where $m&gt;2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation of electronic order-quantum phase interplay in kagome lattices commonly employs the extended Kagome-Hubbard model, where the critical parameters comprise on-site $(U)$ and intersite $(V)$ Coulomb interactions. In prototypical kagome metals \ch{AV3Sb5} (A = K, Rb, Cs), the geometrically frustrated quasi-2D architecture induces pressure-dependent complexity in vanadium d-electron correlations, necessitating systematic theoretical scrutiny. Utilizing the $d-dp$ model within constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), we quantified $U$, $V$, and Hund's coupling $J$ under hydrostatic pressure (0-9 GPa). While \ch{KV3Sb5} and \ch{RbV3Sb5} exhibit pressure-insensitive interaction parameters, \ch{CsV3Sb5} manifests anomalous discontinuities in $U$ and $V$ near $0.2$ GPa, suggesting a first-order electronic phase transition. This work establishes cRPA-derived interaction landscapes as critical predictors for pressure-tunable quantum phenomena in correlated kagome systems, offers a new insight into the understanding of the interplay between the CDW transition and the double superconductivity dome in \ch{CsV3Sb5} at low pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonsymmorphic space group symmetry breakings in correlated electron systems. Under nonsymmorphic symmetry, it is well known that there are degeneracies in the electronic Bloch states at the Brillouin zone boundaries. When the system undergoes a phase transition into an ordered phase with breaking the nonsymmorphic symmetry, the degeneracy is lifted. This happens even when the order parameter is uniform. We point out that this general feature leads to various {\it uniform} Peierls transition in nonsymmorphic systems. In particular, we show that such mechanism of the Peierls gap formation can be realized accompanying with uniform anisotropic Kondo singlet formations. This explains the hidden electric order observed in CeCoSi.</description>

Abstract: Topological nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) are a new family of topological materials characterized by electronic band crossings that form lines in the Brillouin zone. These NLSMs host exotic nodal-line structures and exhibit distinct features such as drumhead surface states and unique electromagnetic responses. This review classifies various NLSM types based on their nodal structures and protecting symmetries, highlighting that these nodal-line structures can form links, knots, and chains. We discuss their characteristic electromagnetic responses, including Landau level spectroscopy, optical conductivity, and permittivity. Furthermore, the strong correlation effects in these NLSMs modify their semimetallic phases and lead to novel quantum phases where magnetism and superconductivity intertwine.</description>

      <title>Scalable tensor network algorithm for quantum impurity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method has shown great potential as a general-purpose quantum impurity solver, as its numerical errors can be well-controlled and it is flexible to be applied on both the imaginary- and real-time axis. However, a major limitation of it is that its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve large-scale quantum impurity problems.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature dopant-induced spin reorganization explored via tensor networks in the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear response functions and disorder: the case of photogalvanic effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of disorder in the form of impurity scattering on a generalized version of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals where the frequency detuning between the two orthogonally polarized beams is nonzero. Considering a minimal model with two Weyl nodes at different energies, we employ the self-consistent Born approximation to unravel the dependence of the associated two-point retarded Green's function on the strength of intra- and internode scattering, frequency detuning, and energy difference between the two Weyl nodes. In the case of intranode scattering only, the second-order current density acquires Drudelike features, which we elucidate further by introducing an effective scattering strength. The Drude-like theory can even describe the second-order response in the presence of strong internode scattering, provided the latter has a linear interdependence with the intranode scattering. By properly adjusting the frequency detuning, we also find the real part of the two-point retarded Green's function to be reminiscent of a "quantized CPGE"-like form, although the imaginary part of the latter function is in general finite, and the second-order current density oscillates with time due to the finite frequency detuning.We finally conclude with an outlook on possible experimental consequences.</description>

      <title>Gauging a superposition of fermionic Gaussian projected entangled pair states to get lattice gauge theory eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauged fermionic projected entangled pair states (GFPEPS) and their Gaussian counterpart (GGFPEPS) are a novel type of lattice gauge theory Ansatz state that combine ideas from the Monte Carlo and tensor network communities. In particular, computation of observables for such states boils down to a Monte Carlo integration over possible gauge field configurations that have probabilities dictated by a fermionic tensor network contraction that accounts for the matter in that background configuration. Crucially, this probability distribution is positive definite and real so that there is no sign problem.
  When the underlying PEPS is Gaussian, tensor network contraction can be done efficiently, and in this scenario the Ansatz has been tested well numerically. In this work we propose to gauge superpositions of Gaussian PEPS and demonstrate that one can still efficiently compute observables when few Gaussians are in the superposition. As we will argue, the latter is exactly the case for bound states on top of the strongly interacting LGT vacuum, which makes this Ansatz particularly suitable for that scenario.
  As a corollary, we will provide an exact representation of the LGT ground state as a gauged PEPS.</description>

      <title>Towards Code States via Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuits: Application to Tetra-Digit Topological Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Demonstrating how long-range entangled states are born from product states has gained much attention, which is not only important for quantum technology but also provides an unconventional tool in characterizing and classifying exotic phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a unified and efficient framework of quantum circuits (i.e., a series of local unitary transformations), termed the \emph{Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuit} (SEESQC) to construct long-range entangled states (i.e., code states) in code space of topological error-correcting codes. Specifically, we apply SEESQC to construct code states of Tetra-Digit models -- a broad class of long-range entangled stabilizer codes indexed by a four-digit parameter. These models are not rare but encompass Toric Codes across arbitrary dimensions and subsume the X-cube fracton code as special cases. Featuring a hierarchical structure of generalized entanglement renormalization group, many Tetra-Digit models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes, and exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability, and exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale exponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. In this work, we begin with graphical and algebraic demonstration of quantum circuits for computational basis states, before generalizing to broader cases. Central to this framework is a key ingredient termed the \emph{seed-entangler} acting on a small number of qubits termed \textit{seeds}, enabling a systematic scheme to achieve arbitrary code states. Remarkably, the number of available seeds equals the number of logical qubits for the constructed examples, which leaves plenty of room for future investigation in theoretical physics, mathematics and quantum information science. Beyond the critical limitation of prior state-engineering methodologies, ...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the phase diagram of an anisotropic Dicke model by revealing the non-analyticity induced by underlying exceptional points (EPs). We find that, from a dynamical perspective, the conventional superradiant phase can be further separated into three regions, in which the systems are characterized by different effective Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the Loschmidt echo to characterize different quantum phases by analyzing the quench dynamics of a trivial initial state. Numerical simulations for finite systems confirm our predictions about the existence of hierarchic superradiant phases.</description>

Abstract: The charged (symmetry-resolved) vacuum R\'enyi entanglement entropy on a disk is computed in the limit of large U(1) global charge for any R\'enyi index. We show that it behaves universally for a broad class of conformal field theories including the O(2) Wilson-Fisher fixed-point, by using the effective field theory at large global charge. The result establishes one of the first concrete computations of entanglement quantities in strongly-coupled field theories.</description>

      <title>Generalized Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spin-orbit-coupled systems the charge and spin transport are generally coupled to each other, namely a charge current will induce a spin current and vice versa. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry $T$, the cross-coupling transport coefficients describing how one process affects the other are constrained by the famous Onsager reciprocal relations. In this paper, we generalize the Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport to systems that break the time-reversal symmetry but preserve a combined symmetry of $T$ and some other symmetry operation $O$. We show that the symmetry or antisymmetry of the cross-coupling transport coefficients remains in place provided that the operator $O$ meets certain conditions. Among many candidate systems where our generalized Onsager relations apply, we focus on a conceptually simple and experimentally realized model in cold atomic systems for explicit demonstration and use these relations to predict highly non-trivial transport phenomena that can be readily verified experimentally.</description>

      <title>Thermal field theory correlators in the large-$N$ limit and the spectral duality relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Ref.~\cite{Grozdanov:2024wgo}, we derived a spectral duality relation applicable to the spectra of 3$d$ conformal field theories (CFTs) and their holographically dual 4$d$ black holes. In this work, we further elaborate on the properties of this duality relation and argue that the same relation can be applied to certain pairs of thermal correlator spectra in large-$N$ quantum field theories in any number of spacetime dimensions, provided the correlators are meromorphic functions with only simple poles and satisfy the thermal product formula. We discuss a rich set of properties that such retarded two-point functions must exhibit. We then show that the spectral duality relation and its implications apply to pairs of correlators in double-trace deformed CFTs and, more generally, to correlators in theories related by the Legendre transform. We illustrate, through several examples, how the spectrum of one correlator can be reconstructed from that of its dual correlation function. Notably, this includes cases relating the thermal spectra of scalar primary operators at ultraviolet and infrared fixed points, as well as current operators in a CFT$_3$ and its particle-vortex dual.</description>

      <title>Coupling induced emergent topology in a two-leg fermionic ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state properties of spinless fermions on a two leg ladder, by allowing the nearest-neighbour hopping dimerization in one leg and uniform hopping in the other. In the non-interacting limit, we find that, at half-filling, the system exhibits robust topological behavior if the inter-leg hopping is allowed. Though depending on the dimerization pattern, the dimerized leg can be either topological or trivial in nature, here we show that by connecting such a leg to a uniform leg through inter-chain coupling, the overall system becomes topological irrespective of the dimerization pattern in the dimerized leg. As a result, a topological phase transition occurs as a function of the inter-leg hopping. When the inter-leg interaction is turned on, the topological phase survives, and we obtain an interaction induced topological phase transition. Finally, we reveal that when uniform interactions are included on all the bonds of the ladder, the topological phase transitions to a symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) phase.</description>
