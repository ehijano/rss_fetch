      <title>Constructing elicitable risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a constructive way of defining new elicitable risk measures that are characterised by a multiplicative scoring function. We show that depending on the choice of the scoring function's components, the resulting risk measure possesses properties such as monotonicity, translation invariance, convexity, and positive homogeneity. Our framework encompasses the majority of well-known elicitable risk measures including all elicitable convex and coherent risk measures. Our setting moreover allows to construct novel elicitable risk measures that are, for example, convex but not coherent. Furthermore, we discuss how higher-order elicitability, such as jointly eliciting the mean and variance or different quantile levels, fall within our setting.</description>

      <title>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About XVA Model Risk but Were Afraid to Ask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Valuation adjustments, collectively named XVA, play an important role in modern derivatives pricing to take into account additional price components such as counterparty and funding risk premia. They are an exotic price component carrying a significant model risk and computational effort even for vanilla trades. We adopt an industry-standard realistic and complete XVA modelling framework, typically used by XVA trading desks, based on multi-curve time-dependent volatility G2++ stochastic dynamics calibrated on real market data, and a multi-step Monte Carlo simulation including both variation and initial margins. We apply this framework to the most common linear and non-linear interest rates derivatives, also comparing the MC results with XVA analytical formulas. Within this framework, we identify the most relevant model risk sources affecting the precision of XVA figures and we measure the corresponding computational effort. In particular, we show how to build a parsimonious and efficient MC time simulation grid able to capture the spikes arising in collateralized exposure during the margin period of risk. As a consequence, we also show how to tune accuracy vs performance, leading to sufficiently robust XVA figures in a reasonable time, a very important feature for practical applications. Furthermore, we provide a quantification of the XVA model risk stemming from the existence of a range of different parameterizations according to the EU prudent valuation regulation. Finally, this work also serves as an handbook containing step-by-step instructions for the implementation of a complete, realistic and robust modelling framework of collateralized exposure and XVA.</description>

      <title>Using quantile time series and historical simulation to forecast financial risk multiple steps ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method for quantile-based, semi-parametric historical simulation estimation of multiple step ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) models is developed. It uses the quantile loss function, analogous to how the quasi-likelihood is employed by standard historical simulation methods. The returns data are scaled by the estimated quantile series, then resampling is employed to estimate the forecast distribution one and multiple steps ahead, allowing tail risk forecasting. The proposed method is applicable to any data or model where the relationship between VaR and ES does not change over time and can be extended to allow a measurement equation incorporating realized measures, thus including Realized GARCH and Realized CAViaR type models. Its finite sample properties, and its comparison with existing historical simulation methods, are evaluated via a simulation study. A forecasting study assesses the relative accuracy of the 1% and 2.5% VaR and ES one-day-ahead and ten-day-ahead forecasting results for the proposed class of models compared to several competitors.</description>
