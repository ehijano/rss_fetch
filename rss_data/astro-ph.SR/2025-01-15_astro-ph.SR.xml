      <title>Protostellar disc structure and dynamics during star formation from cloud-scale initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early evolution of protostellar, star-forming discs, including their density structure, turbulence, magnetic dynamics, and accretion variability, remains poorly understood. We present high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations, using adaptive mesh refinement to capture detailed disc dynamics down to sub-AU scales. Starting from initial conditions derived from a molecular cloud simulation, we model the collapse of a dense core into a protostellar disc over 10,000 yr following sink particle (star) formation, achieving a maximum effective resolution of 0.63 AU. This simulation traces the evolution of the disc density, accretion rates, turbulence, and magnetic field structures. We find that the protostellar disc grows to a diameter of approximately 100 AU, with mass accretion occurring in episodic bursts influenced by the turbulence of the core from which the disc builds up. The disc is highly turbulent with a sonic Mach number of $\sim2$. The magnetic field is wound up by rotational motions, generating a magneto-centrifugal outflow, while episodic accretion events within the disc cause intermittent increases in mass and magnetic energy density, resulting in an equipartition of the thermal and magnetic pressure and an Alfv\'en Mach number of ~ 2. The disc density profiles steepen over time, following a power law consistent with observed young stellar discs and the minimum mass solar nebula. These results underscore the role of turbulence in early accretion variability and offer new insights into the physical and magnetic structure of young protostellar discs.</description>

      <title>Numerical and Physical Challenges to Nebular Spectroscopy in Thermonuclear Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamical explosions of White Dwarfs (WD)are one of the keys to high precision cosmology. Nebular spectra, namely mid-infrared (MIR) with JWST are an effective tool to probe for the multi-dimensional imprints of the explosion physics of WDs and their progenitor systems but also pose a challenge for simulations. What we observe as SNe Ia are low-energy photons, namely light curves, and spectra detected some days to years after the explosion. The light is emitted from a rapidly expanding envelope consisting of a low-density and low-temperature plasma with atomic population numbers far from thermodynamical equilibrium. SNe Ia are powered radioactive decays which produce hard X- and gamma-rays and MeV leptons which are converted within the ejecta to low-energy photons. We find that the optical and IR nebular spectra depend sensitively on the proper treatment of the physical conversion of high to low energies. The low-energy photons produced by forbidden line transitions originate from a mostly optically thin envelope. However, the UV is optically thick because of a quasi-continuum formed by allowed lines and bound-free transitions even several years after the explosion. We find that stimulated recombination limits the over-ionization of high ions with populations governed by the far UV. The requirements to simulate nebular spectra are well beyond both classical stellar atmospheres and nebulae. Using our full non-LTE HYDrodynamical RAdiation code (HYDRA) as a test-bed, the sensitivity on the physics on synthetic spectra are demonstrated using observations as a benchmark. At some examples, we establish the power of high-precision nebular spectroscopy as quantitative tool. Centrally ignited, off-center delayed-detonation near Chandrasekhar-mass models can reproduce line-ratios and line profiles of Branch-normal and underluminous SNe Ia observed with JWST.</description>

      <title>Towards a self-consistent hydrodynamical model of the solar tachocline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar tachocline is an internal boundary layer in the Sun located between the differentially-rotating convection zone and the uniformly-rotating radiative interior beneath. Spiegel and Zahn (1992) proposed the first hydrodynamical model, which here we call SZ92, arguing that the tachocline is essentially in a steady state of thermal-wind balance, angular-momentum balance, and thermal equilibrium. Angular momentum transport in their model is assumed to be dominated by strongly anisotropic turbulence, primarily horizontal owing to the strong stable stratification of the radiative interior. By contrast, the heat transport is assumed to be dominated by a predominantly vertical diffusive heat flux owing to the thinness of the tachocline. In this paper, we demonstrate that these assumptions are not consistent with the new model of stratified turbulence recently proposed by Chini et al. (2022) and Shah et al. (2024), which has been numerically validated by Garaud et al. (2024). We then propose a simple self-consistent alternative to the SZ92 model, namely, a scenario wherein angular momentum and heat transport are both dominated by horizontal turbulent diffusion. The thickness of the tachocline in the new model scales as $\Omega_\odot / N_m$, where $\Omega_\odot$ is the mean angular velocity of the Sun, and $N_m$ the buoyancy frequency in the tachocline region. We discuss other properties of the model, and show that it has several desirable features, but does not resolve some of the other well-known problems of the SZ92 model.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae are formed by the matter ejected by low-to-intermediate mass stars (~0.8-8 times the mass of the Sun) towards the end of their lives. As hydrogen and then helium fuel sources run out, stars expand. During these giant phases stars also lose sizable amounts of mass. During the second giant phase, after the exhaustion of core helium, the mass loss is so great that stars lose a large fraction of their mass (50 - 90%), leaving behind a small, hot core, known as a white dwarf, surrounded by a nebula. Planetary nebulae are the result of many processes that shape and alter their ionization structure and chemical composition. The resulting nebula, illuminated by the ultraviolet-rich spectrum of the remnant very hot stellar core, is a spectacle of beauty and science. In this chapter, we show that these objects are invaluable laboratories for astrophysics, astrochemistry, and astromineralogy studies, with impact in many areas of Astronomy.</description>

      <title>Improving Our Knowledge of the Solar Near-Surface Shear Layer: The Special Case of the Leptocline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the solar activity cycle was linked from the outset to the observation of the temporal variability of sunspots, which we know to be the result of complex processes associated with the dynamics of inner layers. Numerous recent studies have highlighted changes in the Sun's Near-Surface Shear Layer (NSSL), pointing to the role of the leptocline, a shallow and sharp rotational shear layer in the top around 8 Mm. The leptocline, mainly characterized by a strong radial rotational gradient at middle latitudes and self-organized meridional flows, is the cradle of numerous phenomena: opacity, superadiabaticity, and turbulent pressure changes; the hydrogen and helium ionization processes; a sharp decrease in the sound speed; and, probably, variations of the seismic radius associated with a nonmonotonic expansion of subsurface layers with depth. In addition, the leptocline may play a key role in forming the magnetic butterfly diagram. Such results are a starting point for further systematic investigations of the structure and dynamics of this layer, which will lead to a better understanding of solar activity.</description>

      <title>On the features of great Forbush effect during May 2024 extreme geomagnetic storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work investigates the features of galactic cosmic ray density and anisotropy behavior and their relation to solar sources, interplanetary and geomagnetic disturbances from May 8 to May 13, 2024. During this time, powerful solar flares and fast CMEs were recorded, leading to registration of an extreme geomagnetic storm along with one of the most significant Forbush effects for the entire observation period. All the calculations of cosmic ray characteristics are made using the data of global neutron monitor network and unique methods maintained at IZMIRAN: the Global Survey Method and the Ring of Stations Method. It is determined that the magnitude of Forbush effect under study was 15.7% (for particles with 10 GV rigidity) and as an extreme geomagnetic storm was recorded there was a significant magnetospheric effect observed in the data of neutron monitors (~4%).</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic study of the late B-type eclipsing binary system AR Aurigae A and B: Towards clarifying the differences in atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AR Aur A+B is a close binary of astrophysical interest, because dissimilar surface compositions are reported between similar late B-type dwarfs. A new spectroscopic study on this system was carried out based on the disentangled spectra, in order to determine their atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances, The effective temperature and microturbulence (determined from the equivalent widths of Fe II lines) turned out (11150K, 0.9km/s) and (10650K, 0.1km/s) for A and B. The chemical abundances of 28 elements were derived while taking into account the non-LTE effect for Z&lt;=15 elements (Z: atomic number). The following trends were elucidated for [X/H] (abundance of X relative to the Sun): (1) Qualitatively, [X/H] shows a rough global tendency of increasing with Z, with the gradient steeper for A than for B. (2) However, considerable dispersion is involved for A, since prominently large peculiarities are seen in specific elements reflecting the characteristics of HgMn stars (e.g., very deficient N, Al, Sc, Ni; markedly overabundant P, Mn). (3) In contrast, the Z-dependence of [X/H] for B tends to be nearly linear with only a small dispersion. These observational facts may serve as a key to understanding the critical condition for the emergence of chemical anomaly.</description>

      <title>Global 3-D Simulations of Magnetospheric Accretion: II. Hot Spots, Equilibrium Torque, Episodic Wind, and Midplane Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global 3-D magnetohydrodynamical simulations have been conducted to study magnetospheric accretion around stars with various spin rates. For slow rotators, characterized by a fastness parameter $\omega_s\lesssim 0.78$, the disk's inner edge at the magnetospheric truncation radius becomes unstable to the interchange instability, leading to intruding filaments which produce hot spots closer to the stellar equator. Depending on spin rate, slow rotators can be in ``chaotic'' or ``ordered'' unstable regimes. For fast rotators, the interchange instability is suppressed by the super-Keplerian rotation beyond the corotation radius, and hot spots are generated only through polar accretion. Low- and mid-energy flux hot spots cover $\lesssim20\%$ and $\lesssim3\%$ of the surface, with faster rotators tending to produce hotter spots. Beyond the truncation radius, angular momentum transfers from the disk surface to the midplane, resulting in surface accretion and midplane outflow. The midplane outflow may transport thermally processed materials (e.g. those in chondrites) to the outer disk. Field inflation generates episodic winds with mass-loss rates $\sim 1\%-40\%$ of the accretion rate, depending on stellar spin. Frequent magnetic reconnections lead to efficient star-disk coupling. We derive the torque exerted by the disk on the star as a function of stellar spin. For fast rotators/propellers, both spin-down torque and disk wind rate increase dramatically with stellar spin. The equilibrium spin state occurs at $\omega_s\sim0.7$, with wind/jet speeds ($\sim$500 km/s) and mass loss rates ($\sim10\%$ accretion rate) aligning with observations. Most results are insensitive to disk thickness. Finally, we present testable predictions for how observables vary with stellar spin.</description>

      <title>Farside helioseismology with Sun-as-a-star data: the solar cycle as seen with 7-day-long BiSON timeseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from fitting $p$-mode spectra derived from 7-d segments of Sun-as-a-star helioseismic observations from the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network covering 32 yr. The results show a clear dependence of the mode frequencies on solar activity, and the frequency dependence of the sensitivity to activity can also be seen. Because we use data segments that cover less than half of a solar rotation, we are able to test for the effect of activity on the solar far side. By fitting with a model that takes into account activity on the far side of the Sun, we show that the frequency shifts are sensitive to activity from the whole Sun, not just the side facing the observer. Our results suggest that there is potential to investigate activity-related asteroseismic frequency shifts in solar-like oscillators using short time series of observations.</description>

      <title>Parallel Electric Fields And Electron Heating Observed In The Young Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The largest electric fields between 18 and 30 solar radii are in narrow band waves simultaneously observed at a few Hz (somewhat above the local proton gyrofrequency) and a few hundred Hz (far below the lower hybrid frequency), with the higher frequency wave triggered at specific phases of the lower frequency wave. This wave pair, called triggered ion acoustic waves (TIAW), has been shown to both be physical and to occur at times of electron heating. A theory of electron heating and acceleration by the low frequency wave has been presented. While this theory and the TIAW results strongly suggest the presence of low frequency electric fields that are parallel to the local magnetic field, such fields have not been directly observed. In this paper, such parallel electric field observations are reported and TIAW are further described to conclude that they occur during about 75 percent of the Parker Solar Probe passes through 18 to 30 solar radii and, when present, they are the dominant wave signal, lasting for hours. In the presence of these parallel electric fields, electrons are heated while, in their absence, there is no electron heating. That there is no heating between 18 and 30 solar radii in the absence of TIAW is a most significant result because it invalidates other proposed mechanisms that predict heating in this radial range all of the time.</description>

      <title>Helical Magnetic Field in a Massive Protostellar Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly collimated outflows (jets) are observed across a wide range of astrophysical systems involving the accretion of material onto central objects, from supermassive black holes in active galaxies to proto-brown dwarfs and stellar-mass black holes. Despite the diversity of their driving sources, it is believed that all jets are different manifestations of a single universal phenomenon. However, a unified explanation for their ejection and collimation remains elusive. In this study we present the first rotation measure analysis of the polarized synchrotron emission ever performed in a protostellar radio jet, which allows us to reveal its true 3D magnetic structure. Unlike extragalactic radio jets, which often exhibit faint counterjets, protostellar radio jets allow both the jet and the counterjet to be analyzed. This exceptional circumstance allows us to unveil the magnetic field structure of both components. Our findings provide the first solid evidence for a helical magnetic field within a protostellar jet, supporting the universality of the jet collimation mechanism.</description>

      <title>The PLATO field selection process. II. Characterization of LOPS2, the first long-pointing field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is an ESA M-class mission to be launched by the end of 2026 to discover and characterize transiting planets around bright and nearby stars, and in particular habitable rocky planets hosted by solar-like stars. Over the mission lifetime, an average of 8% of the science data rate will be allocated to Guest Observer programs (GOs) selected by ESA through public calls, hence it is essential for the community to know in advance where the observing fields will be located. In a previous paper, we identified two preliminary long-pointing fields (LOPN1 and LOPS1) for PLATO, respectively in the northern and southern hemisphere. Here we present LOPS2, a slightly adjusted version of the southern field that has recently been selected by the PLATO Science Working Team as the first field to be observed by PLATO for at least two continuous years, following the scientific requirements. In this paper, we describe the astrophysical content of LOPS2 in detail, including known planetary systems, bright/variable/binary stars, clusters and synergies with other current and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Role of injection parameters in jet propagation through realistic binary neutron star merger environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the first multi-messenger observation of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger powering a short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB), GW170817-GRB 170817A, remarkable effort is ongoing to unravel the evolution of the collimated, relativistic outflow (or jet) that was launched during the merger and fed the GRB event, imprinting its angular structure onto the follow-up afterglow signal. Current theoretical models, based on relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations, offer detailed insights into the launch and propagation processes that govern jet evolution. Notably, these simulations point out that jet injection parameters, such as luminosity, magnetization, power decay time scale, and launch time relative to merger, play a crucial role. However, the impact of these parameters is typically investigated within simplified jet propagation environments, lacking a direct connection with a realistic BNS merger aftermath. In this work, we present the first suite of 3D RMHD simulations exploring the influence of such parameters on the propagation of magnetized incipient GRB jets injected into magnetized environments directly imported from the outcome of a general-relativistic MHD BNS merger simulation. Our results demonstrate that, alongside the injection parameters, the BNS merger environment has a central role in shaping the overall jet evolution. Specifically, under identical jet parameters, the fate of an incipient jet (whether it successfully breaks out or becomes choked) depends strongly on the properties of such environment. Further quantitative comparison between realistic and simplified environments reveals major differences, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the former for accurate modeling.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters with Euclid: A Theoretical Overview and Insights from NGC 6397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08135</link>

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) using photometric diagrams constructed with Euclid photometry. By employing synthetic spectra and isochrones that incorporate the chemical differences between first-population (1P) stars, resembling field stars, and second-population (2P) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but depleted in carbon and oxygen, we identify, from a theoretical perspective, the color-magnitude diagrams and the chromosome maps most effective at distinguishing these populations within GCs. Euclid photometry proves to be a powerful tool for identifying multiple populations among M-dwarfs, as 1P and 2P stars form distinct sequences in well-chosen photometric diagrams, driven by differences in the strength of oxygen-based molecular features, such as water vapor. To validate our theoretical findings, we analyzed Euclid photometry and astrometry of the GC NGC 6397, complemented by photometric and astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope, enabling a comprehensive study of its stellar populations across a wide field of view. We find that the 1P constitutes about 30% of the M-dwarfs in NGC 6397, with the fraction of 1P stars remaining consistent across different stellar masses and throughout the entire field of view. 2P stars exhibit an [O/Fe] depletion of about 0.3 dex relative to 1P stars, and both populations display isotropic proper motions. This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of multiple populations among M-dwarfs across a wide field of view, demonstrating that Euclid photometry is a powerful instrument for investigating multiple populations in GCs.</description>

      <title>MINDS. JWST-MIRI Observations of a Spatially Resolved Atomic Jet and Polychromatic Molecular Wind Toward SY Cha</title>

Abstract: The removal of angular momentum from protostellar systems drives accretion onto the central star and may drive the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Winds and jets can contribute to removing angular momentum from the disk, though the dominant process remain unclear. To date, observational studies of resolved disk winds have mostly targeted highly inclined disks. We report the detection of extended H2 and [Ne II] emission toward the young stellar object SY Cha with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS). This is one of the first polychromatic detections of extended H2 toward a moderately inclined, i=51.1 degrees, Class II source. We measure the semi-opening angle of the H2 emission as well as build a rotation diagram to determine the H2 excitation temperature and abundance. We find a wide semi-opening angle, high temperature, and low column density for the H2 emission, all of which are characteristic of a disk wind. We derive a molecular wind mass loss rate of 3+-2e-9 Msun/yr, which is high compared to the previously derived stellar accretion rate of 6.6e-10 Msun/yr. This suggests either that the stellar accretion and the disk wind are driven by different mechanisms or that accretion onto the star is highly variable. These observations demonstrate MIRI-MRS's utility in expanding studies of resolved disk winds beyond edge-on sources.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing the Properties of Solar Super Active Region 13664 in the Context of the Historic Geomagnetic Storm of 2024 May 10-11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of solar-stellar activity on planetary environments is a topic of great interest within the Sun-Earth system as well as exoplanetary systems. In particular, extreme events such as flares and coronal mass ejections have a profound effect on planetary atmospheres. In May this year, a magnetic active region on the Sun (AR 13664) -- with a size exceeding hundred times that of Earth -- unleashed a large number of high energy X-class flares and associated mass ejections. The resulting Earth impact (geomagnetic storm) on May 10-11 was the strongest in the last two decades. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of the magnetic properties of the active region that spawned these flares and identify this to be a super active region with very rare physical characteristics. We also demonstrate how the rate of energization of the system is related to the flaring process. Our work illuminates how flare productive super active regions on the Sun and stars can be identified and what are their salient physical properties. Specifically, we put AR 13664 in historical context over the cumulative period of 1874 May-2024 June. We find that AR 13664 stands at 99.95 percentile in the distribution of area over 1874 May-2024 June, and at 99.10 percentile in terms of flux content among all ARs over the period 1996 April-2024 June. Our analysis indicates that five of its magnetic properties rank highest among all ARs recorded in SHARP data series during 2010 May-2024 June by the Solar Dynamic Observatory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AR 13664 reached its most dynamic flare productive state following a rapid rate of rise of its flare-relevant parameters and that the X-class flares it spawned were more frequent near their peak values. Our analyses establish AR 13644 to be solar super active region and provide a paradigm for investigating their flare-relevant physical characteristics.</description>

      <title>Binary Evolution Pathways to Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators: Insights from HD 133729</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) represent a recently identified class of pulsating stars distinguished by their short pulsation periods ($2 - 60$ minutes) and asymmetric light curves. This study investigated the evolutionary channel of HD 133729 which is the first confirmed BLAP in a binary system. Using the binary evolution code MESA, we explored various mass ratios and initial orbital periods. Our simulations suggest that a system with a mass ratio $q = 0.30$ undergoing non-conservative mass transfer ($\beta=0.15$) can reproduce the observed characteristics through the pre-white dwarf Roche lobe overflow channel. Meanwhile, we predict that there are significant helium and nitrogen enhancements on the surface of the main sequence (MS) star. The system will eventually undergo the common envelope phase, leading to a stellar merger. HD 133729 is a unique case as a benchmark, providing crucial insights into the formation mechanism and evolutionary fate of BLAPs with MS companions. This work constrains the elemental abundances of the MS star and has helped our understanding of non-conservative mass transfer in binary evolution.</description>

      <title>The Energy Sharing Timescale in an Analytic Framework for Common Envelope Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new predictive theory for the analysis of common envelope (CE) events which incorporates the effects of relevant hydrodynamical processes into a simple analytical framework. We introduce the ejection and dynamical parameters $\xi$ and $\beta$, which define if envelope ejection is energetically or hydrodynamically favorable, respectively, during CE inspiral. When combined, these parameters offer a detailed narrative of how inspiral begins, proceeds, and ends that is consistent with preliminary comparisons to 3D hydrodynamical models. This physically-motivated framework impacts predictions for CE outcomes, especially for systems that have energy excess, and offers promise as a potential alternative for the treatment of CE in binary population synthesis.</description>
