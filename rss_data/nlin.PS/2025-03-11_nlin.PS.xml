      <title>Data-driven continuation of patterns and their bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patterns and nonlinear waves, such as spots, stripes, and rotating spirals, arise prominently in many natural processes and in reaction-diffusion models. Our goal is to compute boundaries between parameter regions with different prevailing patterns and waves. We accomplish this by evolving randomized initial data to full patterns and evaluate feature functions, such as the number of connected components or their area distribution, on their sublevel sets. The resulting probability measure on the feature space, which we refer to as pattern statistics, can then be compared at different parameter values using the Wasserstein distance. We show that arclength predictor-corrector continuation can be used to trace out transition and bifurcation curves in parameter space by maximizing the distance of the pattern statistics. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through a range of examples involving homogeneous states, spots, stripes, and spiral waves.</description>

      <title>Spring-mass behavior of solitons under the influence of an external force field within the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction of solitons with an external periodic field within the framework of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation. In the case of small perturbation a simple dynamical system is used to describe the soliton behaviour. Equilibrium points of this dynamical system are computed when the external force travels at a constant speed. Assuming that the external force moves with sinusoidal speed, we demonstrate that the soliton behavior is qualitatively similar to the constant-speed case. Besides, a resonant frequency is derived from the asymptotic theory without using the classical broad force approximation. The results obtained from the dynamical system are compared with fully direct numerical simulations, which reveal that the soliton solution exhibits spiral-like behavior in the soliton amplitude versus soliton phase space. Moreover, when the external force oscillates at the resonant frequency, the trajectories in the soliton phase versus soliton amplitude exhibit chaotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interplay between fractionality and PT symmetry in magnetic metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a nonlinear magnetic metamaterial modeled as a split-ring resonator array, where the standard discrete laplacian is replaced by its fractional form. We find a closed-form expression for the dispersion relation as a function of the fractional exponent s and the gain/loss parameter {\gamma} and examine the conditions under which stable magneto-inductive waves exist. The density of states is computed in closed form and suggests that the main effect of fractionality is the flattening of the bands, while gain/loss increase tends to reduce the bandgaps. The spatial extent of the modes for a finite array is computed by means of the participation ratio R, which is also obtained in closed form. For a fixed fractionality exponent, an increase in gain/loss {\gamma} decreases the overall R, from the number of sites N towards N/2 at large {\gamma}. The nonlinear dynamics of the average magnetic energy on an initial ring during a cycle shows a monotonic increase with {\gamma}, and it is qualitatively similar for all fractional exponents. This is explained as mainly due to the interplay of nonlinearity and PT symmetry.</description>

      <title>Peakons and pseudo-peakons of higher order b-family equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the rich structure of peakon and pseudo-peakon solutions for a class of higher-order $b$-family equations, referred to as the $J$-th $b$-family ($J$-bF) equations. We propose several conjectures concerning the weak solutions of these equations, including a $b$-independent pseudo-peakon solution, a $b$-independent peakon solution, and a $b$-dependent peakon solution. These conjectures are analytically verified for $J \leq 14$ and/or $J \leq 9$ using the computer algebra software MAPLE. The $b$-independent pseudo-peakon solution is a 3rd-order pseudo-peakon for general arbitrary constants, with higher-order pseudo-peakons derived under specific parameter constraints. Additionally, we identify both $b$-independent and $b$-dependent peakon solutions, highlighting their distinct properties and the nuanced relationship between the parameters $b$ and $J$. The existence of these solutions underscores the rich dynamical structure of the $J$-bF equations and generalizes previous results for lower-order equations. Future research directions include higher-order generalizations, rigorous proofs of the conjectures, interactions between different types of peakons and pseudo-peakons, stability analysis, and potential physical applications. These advancements significantly contribute to the understanding of peakon systems and their broader implications in mathematics and physics.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of soliton gases for the defocusing NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we derive Nonlinear Dispersion Relations (NDR) for the defocusing NLS (dark) soliton gas using the idea of thermodynamic limit of quasimomentum and quasienergy differentials on the underlying family of Riemann surfaces. It turns out that the obtained NDR are closely connected with the recently studied NDR for circular soliton gas for the focusing NLS. We find solutions for the kinetic equation for the defocusing NLS soliton condensate, which is defined by the endpoints of the spectral support $\Gamma$ for the NDR. It turns out that, similarly to KdV soliton condensates (\cite{CERT}), the evolution of these endpoints is governed by the defocusing NLS-Whitham equations (\cite{Kodama}). We also study the Riemann problem for step initial data and the kurtosis of genus zero and one defNLS condensates, where we proved that the kurtosis of genus one condensate can not exceed 3/2, whereas for genus zero condensate the kurtosis is always 1.</description>

      <title>Propelling Ferrimagnetic Domain Walls by Dynamical Frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-particle systems driven out of thermal equilibrium can show properties qualitatively different from any thermal state. Here, we study a ferrimagnet in a weak oscillating magnetic field. In this model, domain walls are not static, but are shown to move actively in a direction chosen by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Thus they act like self-propelling units. Their collective behaviour is reminiscent of other systems with actively moving units studied in the field of 'active matter', where, e.g., flocks of birds are investigated. The active motion of the domain walls emerges from 'dynamical frustration'. The antiferromagnetic xy-order rotates clockwise or anticlockwise, determined by the sign of the ferromagnetic component. This necessarily leads to frustration at a domain wall, which gets resolved by propelling the domain wall with a velocity proportional to the square root of the driving power across large parameter regimes. This motion and strong hydrodynamic interactions lead to a linear growth of the magnetic correlation length over time, much faster than in equilibrium. The dynamical frustration furthermore makes the system highly resilient to noise. The correlation length of the weakly driven one-dimensional system can be orders of magnitude larger than in the corresponding equilibrium system with the same noise level.</description>
