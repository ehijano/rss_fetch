      <title>Effects of cell-cell communication on bacterial chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria track chemical gradients using a biased random walk, a process called chemotaxis. Experiments suggest that bacteria also communicate during this process. Using a mathematical model, we find that sufficiently strong communication succeeds in keeping a population of bacteria together but slows down chemotaxis. However, if the secretion of the communication molecule is coupled to the detection of the external chemoattractant, chemotaxis can be faster than without communication. Intriguingly, in this regime we predict that, even though blocking the communication receptors should slow down chemotaxis, partially blocking or underexpressing them should speed it up. Our work provides physical insights on how communication and chemotaxis are connected and may help explain why chemotaxing bacteria communicate.</description>

      <title>Uncovering hidden protein conformations with high bandwidth nanopore measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced nanopore measurements allow structural probing of molecules with high spatial and temporal resolution. We report high signal-to-noise, 1-10 MHz bandwidth, translocation measurements of the multi-state folding of heme protein cytochrome c in KCl solution through optimally designed silicon nitride pores of 2.3-3.3 nm diameter and 3.6-3.8 nm effective thickness, and an optimal concentration of a denaturant (Gdm-Cl). The pore diameter is slightly smaller than the protein size, forcing the protein to squeeze through the pore. The sufficiently large pore thickness allows enough time for protein probing at an applied field of approximately 250 kV/cm. Through Bayesian Information Criterion score analysis, current blockades reveal six distinct levels, attributed to specific protein states. We calculate the transition probabilities between the states and the conditional probabilities of the protein leaving the pore from each state. We validate the model by simulating events and comparing them to experimental data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics of a Nanorotor Driven by a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A molecular rotor mechanism is proposed to explain weak magnetic field effects in biology. Despite being nanoscale (1 nm), this rotor exhibits quantum superposition and interference. Analytical modeling shows its quantum dynamics are highly sensitive to weak, but not strong, magnetic fields. Due to its enhanced moment of inertia, the rotor maintains quantum coherence relatively long, even in a noisy cellular environment. Operating at the mesoscopic boundary between quantum and classical behavior, such a rotor embedded in cyclical biological processes could exert significant and observable biological influence.</description>

      <title>Modeling Plant Action Potentials under Photoperiod Stress via Hodgkin-Huxley Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plants exhibit dynamic bioelectric properties that facilitate information transfer across tissues. This study investigates action potentials (APs) in Nicotiana tabacum recorded within a custom-designed growth chamber using a biosignal amplifier and environmental sensors. Consistent light- and dark-induced APs were observed during photoperiod transitions under controlled 12-hour artificial illumination cycles. To understand these bioelectric responses, a mathematical model based on the Hodgkin-Huxley framework is used. Electrophysiological measurements from Solanum lycopersicum revealed that under natural light conditions, only light-induced APs are observed, while light- and dark-induced APs coupled dynamics is exclusively elicited during rapid transitions in artificial photoperiods. These distinct phenomena are characterized as Prolonged Oscillatory Climatic Engagement (POCE) and Nimble Environmental Transition Oscillation (NETO), respectively. The model successfully reproduces the key features in both frameworks while maintaining computational efficiency through voltage-independent rate parameters.</description>

      <title>Is the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation universally true?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: No. Eighty years ago, the two seminal works by Goldman [J. Gen. Phys. 27, 37 (1943)] and by Hodgkin-Katz [J. of Physio 108, 37 (1949)] derived the foundational framework for interpreting electro-physiological measurements in what is commonly termed the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) theory for the membrane potential. Both seminal papers postulate a constant/uniform electric field within the ion channel. Using a uniform electric field allows for a simple, straightforward calculation of the ionic fluxes and the transmembrane potential, which yields the famous GHK potential. The use of this framework is so widely accepted that one can find a plethora of works that no longer cite the original works and GHK has perhaps become the universal and indisputable descriptor of the underlying physics and biology. In recent works [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 228401 (2025) and Phys. Rev. E 111, 064408 (2025)], we revisited GHK and its assumption of a uniform field. Non-approximated numerical simulations showed that the electric field is not always uniform. To understand this discrepancy, it is important to understand that the governing equations can be solved using two different approaches: the GHK approach of assuming a constant electric field or postulating that the system is electroneutral. Each approach yields drastically different non-commutative results. The purpose of this report is to provide a non-mathematical summary of the results and to inform the broader community that GHK is not as universal as previously thought. We will discuss these two newer works, with some emphasis on how they can potentially revolutionize the interpretation of electro-physiological measurements. Importantly, we show that this new framework, which utilizes the mathematical tools developed by the electrodialysis community, also serves as a bridge linking the electrophysiology community and the electrodialysis community.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Bacterial Flagellar Motor's Energy Landscape, Viscous Load, and Torque Generation Across Diffusion Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) converts transmembrane ion flux into directed mechanical rotation, driving bacterial motility. Despite extensive study, the frictional forces and energetics governing its torque generation remain poorly understood. Here, we combine single-molecule rotation measurements with stochastic thermodynamics to quantitatively estimate its effective torque, viscous drag and activation energy barriers. We present three complementary methods based on solutions to the Smoluchowski equation for overdamped diffusion in a tilted periodic potential, which use as input the steady-state angular velocity and rotational diffusion data from individual \textit{E. coli} motors spanning different dynamical regimes. Crucially, these three methods require neither active external torque control, nor prior knowledge of the system's viscous drag or the motor's torque output. The first method assumes as input a model-dependent sinusoidal potential (single Fourier mode), albeit with unknown periodicity, yielding closed-form results in the low- and high-tilt limits, whereas the last two methods use a full Fourier-based reconstruction to output the now model-independent potential landscape. These approaches yield consistent estimates of the potential periodicity ($\approx$ 26-fold symmetry), energy barrier height ($\approx 2\!-\!4 k_{\rm B}T$), and internal friction coefficient ($\approx 0.1$ pN nm s rad$^{-2}$). Our results reveal that the BFM's torque-velocity relationship deviates significantly from the linear approximation near the critical tilt, where angular diffusion is maximized. More broadly, our framework provides a coherent strategy for reconstructing nanoscale energy landscapes from single-molecule data and is generalizable to other stepping molecular motors operating in cyclic conditions.</description>

      <title>Motility-Driven Viscoelastic Control of Tissue Morphology in Presomitic Mesoderm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embryonic tissues deform across broad spatial and temporal scales and relax stress through active rearrangements. A quantitative link between cell-scale activity, spatial forcing, and emergent tissue-scale mechanics remains incomplete. Here, we use a vertex-based tissue model with active force fluctuations to study how motility controls viscoelastic response. After validation against experimental presomitic mesoderm relaxation dynamics, we extract intrinsic mechanical timescales using stress relaxation and oscillatory shear. The model captures motility-dependent shifts between elastic and viscous behavior and the coexistence of fast relaxation with long-lived residual stress. When subjected to spatially patterned, temporally pulsed forcing, tissues behave as mechanical filters: long-wavelength inputs are accumulated, whereas short-wavelength, cell-scale perturbations are rapidly erased, largely independent of motility. Simulations with localized motility hotspots, motivated by spatially confined FGF signaling reported in vertebrate limb development, produce sustained protrusive tissue deformations consistent with experimentally observed early bud-like morphologies. Together, these results establish a minimal framework linking motility-driven activity to wavelength-selective mechanical memory and emergent tissue patterning.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Heterogeneity and the Nuclear Mechanome: Towards an Omics-Level Understanding of Nuclear Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cell nucleus is increasingly recognized as a mechanosensitive organelle whose mesoscale mechanical heterogeneity (100 nm 10 um) is inseparable from genome regulation yet remains weakly integrated into systems biology and omics frameworks. Here we synthesize experimental and theoretical advances that define a nuclear mechanome: a multidimensional state of mechanical observables spanning lamins, chromatin, nucleoplasm and condensates, and varying across space, time, and cells. We review how intranuclear gradients, chromatin domains and phase-separated bodies generate viscoelastic, poroelastic and plastic niches that shape transcription, replication, DNA repair, epigenetic metabolism, and clonal selection, with particular emphasis on cancer, laminopathies and ageing. We survey invasive, optical and high throughput mechanophenotyping techniques, together with continuum, shell polymer, mesoscopic and non-equilibrium models, as a toolkit for mechanomic mapping. Finally, we outline a research agenda towards standardized mechanical descriptors, tissue-level mechano multi omic atlases and mechanotherapeutic strategies that explicitly target nuclear mechanotypes as potential biomarkers that can define cellular identity, explain plasticity, and help predict pathological states or the evolution of several diseases.</description>

      <title>Dynamic optical coherence tomography algorithm for label-free assessment of swiftness and occupancy of intratissue moving scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) statistically analyzes fluctuations in time-sequential OCT signals, enabling label-free and three-dimensional visualization of intratissue and intracellular activities. Current DOCT methods, such as logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) and OCT correlation decay speed (OCDS) have several limitations.Namely, the DOCT values and intratissue motions are not directly related, and hence DOCT values are not interpretable in the context of the tissue motility. We introduce a new DOCT algorithm that provides more direct interpretation of DOCT in the contexts of dynamic scatterer ratio and scatterer speed in the tissue.The detailed properties of the new and conventional DOCT methods are investigated by numerical simulations, and the experimental validation with in vitro and ex vivo samples demonstrates the feasibility of the new method.</description>
