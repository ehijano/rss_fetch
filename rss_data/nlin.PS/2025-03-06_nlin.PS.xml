      <title>On shallow water non-convex dispersive hydrodynamics: the extended KdV model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate non-classical wavetrain formations, and particularly dispersive shock waves (DSWs), or undular bores, in systems exhibiting non-convex dispersion. Our prototypical model, which arises in shallow water wave theory, is the extended Korteweg-de Vries (eKdV) equation. The higher-order dispersive and nonlinear terms of the latter, lead to resonance between dispersive radiation and solitary waves, and notably, the individual waves comprising DSWs, due to non-convex dispersion. This resonance manifests as a resonant wavetrain propagating ahead of the dispersive shock wave. We present a succinct overview of the fundamental principles and characteristics of DSWs and explore analytical methods for their analysis. Wherever applicable, we demonstrate these concepts and techniques using both the classical KdV equation and its higher-order eKdV counterpart. We extend the application of the dispersive shock fitting method and the equal amplitude approximation to investigate radiating DSWs governed by the eKdV equation. We also introduce Whitham shock solutions for the regime of traveling DSWs of the eKdV model. Theoretical predictions are subsequently validated against direct numerical solutions, revealing a high degree of agreement.</description>

      <title>Configurational Information Measures, Phase Transitions, and an Upper Bound on Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Configurational entropy (CE) and configurational complexity (CC) are recently popularized information theoretic measures used to study the stability of solitons. This paper examines their behavior for 2D and 3D lattice Ising Models, where the quasi-stability of fluctuating domains is controlled by proximity to the critical temperature. Scaling analysis lends support to an unproven conjecture that these configurational information measures (CIMs) can detect (in)stability in field theories. The primary results herein are the derivation of a model dependent CC-CE relationship, as well as a model independent upper bound on CC. CIM phenomenology in the Ising universality class reveals multiple avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Emptiness Instanton in Quantum Polytropic Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emptiness formation problem is addressed for a one-dimensional quantum polytropic gas characterized by an arbitrary polytropic index $\gamma$, which defines the equation of state $P \sim \rho^\gamma$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\rho$ is the density. The problem involves determining the probability of the spontaneous formation of an empty interval in the ground state of the gas. In the limit of a macroscopically large interval, this probability is dominated by an instanton configuration. By solving the hydrodynamic equations in imaginary time, we derive the analytic form of the emptiness instanton. This solution is expressed as an integral representation analogous to those used for correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. Prominent features of the spatiotemporal profile of the instanton are obtained directly from this representation.</description>
