      <title>On the Hardness of Approximation of the Fair k-Center Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the hardness of approximation of the fair $k$-center problem. Here the data points are partitioned into groups and the task is to choose a prescribed number of data points from each group, called centers, while minimizing the maximum distance from any point to its closest center. Although a polynomial-time $3$-approximation is known for this problem in general metrics, it has remained open whether this approximation guarantee is tight or could be further improved, especially since the unconstrained $k$-center problem admits a polynomial-time factor-$2$ approximation. We resolve this open question by proving that, for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, achieving a $(3-\epsilon)$-approximation is NP-hard, assuming $\text{P} \neq \text{NP}$.
  Our inapproximability results hold even when only two disjoint groups are present and at least one center must be chosen from each group. Further, it extends to the canonical one-per-group setting with $k$-groups (for arbitrary $k$), where exactly one center must be selected from each group. Consequently, the factor-$3$ barrier for fair $k$-center in general metric spaces is inherent, and existing $3$-approximation algorithms are optimal up to lower-order terms even in these restricted regimes. This result stands in sharp contrast to the $k$-supplier formulation, where both the unconstrained and fair variants admit factor-$3$ approximation in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Nash-convergence of Game Dynamics and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Does the failure of learning dynamics to converge globally to Nash equilibria stem from the geometry of the game or the complexity of computation? Previous impossibility results relied on game degeneracy, leaving open the case for generic, nondegenerate games. We resolve this by proving that while Nash-convergent dynamics theoretically exist for all nondegenerate games, computing them is likely intractable. We formulate the Impossibility Conjecture: if a locally efficient Nash-convergent dynamic exists for nondegenerate games, then $P=PPAD$. We validate this for three specific families of dynamics, showing their tractability would imply collapses such as $NP=RP$ or $CLS=PPAD$. En route, we settle the complexity of finding Nash equilibria of a given game that lie on a given affine subspace. Finally, we explain why the general conjecture remains open: we introduce a Proving Game to demonstrate that black-box reductions cannot distinguish between convergent and non-convergent dynamics in polynomial time. Our results suggest the barrier to Nash learning is not the non-existence of a vector field, but the intractability of computing it.</description>

      <title>Submodular Maximization under Supermodular Constraint: Greedy Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a wide range of applications in data mining and machine learning, we consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function subject to supermodular cost constraints. In contrast to the well-understood setting of cardinality and matroid constraints, where greedy algorithms admit strong guarantees, the supermodular constraint regime remains poorly understood -- guarantees for greedy methods and other efficient algorithmic paradigms are largely open. We study this family of fundamental optimization problems under an upper-bound constraint on a supermodular cost function with curvature parameter $\gamma$. Our notion of supermodular curvature is less restrictive than prior definitions, substantially expanding the class of admissible cost functions. We show that our greedy algorithm that iteratively includes elements maximizing the ratio of the objective and constraint functions, achieves a $\left(1 - e^{-(1-\gamma)}\right)$-approximation before stopping. We prove that this approximation is indeed tight for this algorithm. Further, if the objective function has a submodular curvature $c$, then we show that the bound further improves to $\left(1 - (1- (1-c)(1-\gamma))^{1/(1-c)}\right)$, which can be further improved by continuing to violate the constraint. Finally, we show that the Greedy-Ratio-Marginal in conjunction with binary search leads to a bicriteria approximation for the dual problem -- minimizing a supermodular function under a lower bound constraint on a submodular function. We conduct a number of experiments on a simulation of LLM agents debating over multiple rounds -- the task is to select a subset of agents to maximize correctly answered questions. Our algorithm outperforms all other greedy heuristics, and on smaller problems, it achieves the same performance as the optimal set found by exhaustive search.</description>

      <title>A Tight Double-Exponentially Lower Bound for High-Multiplicity Bin Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a high-multiplicity Bin Packing instance $I$ with $d$ distinct item types. In 2014, Goemans and Rothvoss gave an algorithm with runtime ${{|I|}^2}^{O(d)}$ for this problem~[SODA'14], where $|I|$ denotes the encoding length of the instance $I$. Although Jansen and Klein~[SODA'17] later developed an algorithm that improves upon this runtime in a special case, it has remained a major open problem by Goemans and Rothvoss~[J.ACM'20] whether the doubly exponential dependency on $d$ is necessary.
  We solve this open problem by showing that unless the ETH fails, there is no algorithm solving the high-multiplicity Bin Packing problem in time ${{|I|}^2}^{o(d)}$. To prove this, we introduce a novel reduction from 3-SAT. The core of our construction is efficiently encoding all information from a 3-SAT instance with $n$ variables into an ILP with $O(\log(n))$ variables and constraints.
  This result confirms that the Goemans and Rothvoss algorithm is essentially best-possible for Bin Packing parameterized by the number $d$ of item sizes in the context of XP time algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Regular Expression Matching with Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The regular expression matching problem asks whether a given regular expression of length $m$ matches a given string of length $n$. As is well known, the problem can be solved in $O(nm)$ time using Thompson's algorithm. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the matching problem for regular expressions extended with a practical extension called lookaround can be solved in the same time complexity. In this work, we consider four well-known extensions to regular expressions called backreference, squaring, intersection and complement, and we show that, unlike in the case of lookaround, the matching problem for regular expressions extended with any of the four (for backreference, even when restricted to one capturing group) cannot be solved in $O(n^{2-\varepsilon} \mathrm{poly}(m))$ time for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ under the Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture. Moreover, we study the matching problem for regular expressions extended with complement in more detail, which is also known as extended regular expression (ERE) matching. We show that there is no ERE matching algorithm that runs in $O(n^{\omega-\varepsilon} \mathrm{poly}(m))$ time ($2 \le \omega &lt; 2.3714$ is the exponent of square matrix multiplication) for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ under the $k$-Clique Hypothesis, and there is no combinatorial ERE matching algorithm that runs in $O(n^{3-\varepsilon} \mathrm{poly}(m))$ time for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ under the Combinatorial $k$-Clique Hypothesis. This shows that the $O(n^3 m)$-time algorithm introduced by Hopcroft and Ullman in 1979 and recently improved by Bille et al. to run in $O(n^\omega m)$ time using fast matrix multiplication was already optimal in a sense, and sheds light on why the theoretical computer science community has struggled to improve the time complexity of ERE matching with respect to $n$ and $m$ for more than 45 years.</description>

      <title>Minimum Selective Subset on Unit Disk Graphs and Circle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01931v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a connected simple graph G = (V(G),E(G)), each vertex is assigned one of c colors, where V(G) can be written as a union of a total of c subsets V_{1},...,V_{c} and V_{i} denotes the set of vertices of color i. A subset S of V(G) is called a selective subset if, for every i, every vertex v in V_{i} has at least one nearest neighbor in $S \cup (V(G) \setminus V_{i})$ that also lies in V_{i}. The Minimum Selective Subset (MSS) problem asks for a selective subset of minimum size.
  We show that the MSS problem is log-APX-hard on general graphs, even when c=2. As a consequence, the problem does not admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) unless P = NP. On the positive side, we present a PTAS for unit disk graphs, which works without requiring a geometric representation and applies for arbitrary c. We further prove that MSS remains NP-complete in unit disk graphs for arbitrary c. In addition, we show that the MSS problem is log-APX-hard on circle graphs, even when c=2.</description>
