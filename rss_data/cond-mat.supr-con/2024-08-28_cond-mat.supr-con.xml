      <title>Superconducting flip-chip devices using indium microspheres on Au-passivated Nb or NbN as under-bump metallization layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting flip-chip interconnects are crucial for the three-dimensional integration of superconducting circuits in sensing and quantum technology applications. We demonstrate a simplified approach for a superconducting flip chip using commercially available indium microspheres and an in-house-built transfer stage for bonding two chips patterned with superconducting thin films. We use a gold-passivated niobium or niobium nitride layer as an under-bump metallization (UBM) layer between an aluminum-based superconducting layer and the indium interconnect. At millikelvin temperatures, our flip-chip assembly can transport a supercurrent with tens of milliamperes, limited by the smallest geometric feature size and critical current density of the UBM layer. We also show that the indium interconnect itself can carry a supercurrent exceeding 1\,A. Our flip-chip assembly does not require patterning and electroplating of indium, nor does it need a flip-chip bonder. Thus, the presented flip-chip devices can be utilized in applications that require few superconducting interconnects carrying large currents at millikelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>Irrelevance of 1H composition to the superconductivity in the infinite-layer nickelates: judging from the MeV energy scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the superconductivity in the infinite-layer nickelates, as topotactically reduced from their respective perovskite percussors via co-annealing with CaH2, extends the understanding in superconductivity. Nevertheless, whether the incorporated 1H composition is critical to the infinite-layer superconductivity recently arouses considerable debates, while the central challenge lies in the quantification of 1H that is easily interfered by the conventional electron or orbital associated processes. Herein, we demonstrate the irrelevance between the superconductivity in the infinite-layer nickelates and their incorporated 1H composition, assisted by nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) and heavy ion energy recoil detection analysis (HIERDA) based on the nuclear interactions at MeV energy scale. These approaches completely overwhelm the conventional interferes, such as ionization, activation and chemical bonds, and achieves the 1H quantification within superconducting La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 (or Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2). A large diversity of 1H composition far beyond the previously expected critical dome was observed, while their TC were not changed significantly. Furthermore, the superconductivity was demonstrated to be achievable for La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 reduced by Al without any hydrogen associated process, while the superconducting properties for the CaH2 reduced La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 is rather stable after long term exposure in air, despite the high volatility of 1H within oxides. All these results indicate that the 1H incorporation composition is not critical to the superconductivity of the infinite-layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile magneto-thermal switching driven by vortex trapping in commercial In-Sn solder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-thermal switching (MTS) is a key technology for efficient thermal management. Recently, large MTS with nonvolatility has been observed in Sn-Pb solders [H. Arima et al., Commun. Mater. 5, 34 (2024)] where phase separation, different superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of Sn and Pb, and magnetic-flux trapping are the causes of the nonvolatile MTS. To further understand the mechanism and to obtain the strategy for enhancing switching ratio, exploration of new phase-separated superconductors with nonvolatile MTS is needed. Here, we show that the In52-Sn48 commercial solder is a phase-separated superconducting composite with two Tc and traps vortices after field cooling. A clear signature of nonvolatile MTS was observed at T = 2.5 K. From specific heat analyses, we conclude that the vortices are mainly trapped in the lower-Tc phase ({\gamma}-phase) after field cooling, which is the evidence that vortex trapping also works on achieving nonvolatile MTS in phase-separated superconducting composites.</description>

      <title>Fragile-to-strong glass transition in two-dimensional vortex liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fragile-to-strong glass transition is a fascinating phenomenon that still presents many theoretical and experimental challenges. A major one is how to tune the fragility of a glass-forming liquid. Here, we study a two-dimensional (2D) system composed of vortices in a superconducting film, which effectively behaves as a 2D glass-forming liquid. We show that the kinetic fragility in this system can be experimentally varied by tuning a single parameter: the external magnetic field $H$ applied transversely to the film. This conclusion is supported by the direct comparison between the analysis of experimental measurements in an amorphous MoGe superconducting film and Monte Carlo simulations in a disordered XY model, that captures the universality class of the two-step melting transition. We show that by increasing disorder strength a fragile-to-strong transition is induced, in close similarity with the experimental findings in a magnetic field. Our numerical results shed light on the evolution of the dynamical heterogeneity from a fragile to strong glass, as due to the subtle interplay between caging effects arising from hexatic order and strong random pinning.</description>

      <title>Shock waves in nonlinear transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01463v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first half of the paper we consider interaction between the small amplitude travelling waves ("sound") and the shock waves in the transmission line containing both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors. We calculate the "sound" wave coefficient of reflection from (coefficient of transmission through) the shock wave. These coefficients are expressed in terms of the speeds of the "sound" waves relative to the shock and the wave impedances. In the second half of the paper we explicitly include into consideration the dissipation in the system, introducing ohmic resistors shunting the inductors and also in series with the capacitors. This allows us to justify the conditions on the shocks, postulated in the first half of the paper. This also allows us to describe the shocks as physical objects of finite width and study their profiles. In some particular cases the profiles were obtained in terms of elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Connection between f-electron correlations and magnetic excitations in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detailed anisotropy of the low-temperature, low-energy magnetic excitations of the candidate spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ is revealed using inelastic neutron scattering. The magnetic excitations emerge from the Brillouin zone boundary at the high symmetry $Y$ and $T$ points and disperse along the crystallographic $\hat{b}$-axis. In applied magnetic fields to at least $\mu_0 H=11$~T along the $\hat{c}-$axis, the magnetism is found to be field-independent in the $(hk0)$ plane. The scattering intensity is consistent with that expected from U$^{3+}$/U$^{4+}$ $f$-electron spins with preferential orientation along the crystallographic $\hat{a}$-axis, and a fluctuating magnetic moment of 2.3(7) $\mu_B$. These characteristics indicate that the excitations are due to intraband spin excitons arising from $f$-electron hybridization.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid over extended range at zero temperature without quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strange metal state appears in many strongly correlated materials from the cuprates, pnictides, and twisted bilayer graphenes to even bosonic systems. Enormous efforts are being made to unravel the nature of the non-Fermi liquid (NFL) which underlies the strange metallicity, yet progress is rather slow. Understanding the NFL behavior is crucial, in addition to its importance in replacing the Fermi liquid paradigm, in that NFL is the normal state from which new states of matter emerge like high temperature superconductivity. Here, we report the appearance of an NFL phase in a discontinuous metal-NFL-insulator transition in a ``non-engineered'' Hamiltonian of the Holstein model away from half-filling. The discontinuity of the phase transition between NFL and Fermi liquid metal renders the ground state at the phase boundary a mixture between them over an extended range like the extended criticality observed in cuprates and other quantum materials. The dynamical mean-field theory was employed in combination with Wilson's numerical renormalization group technique. We identify the origin of the NFL metal phase as the opening of a spin gap in the absence of a charge gap. Also, strong lattice fluctuations emerge at the boundary which should enhance superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Numerical modelling of a vortex-based superconducting memory cell: dynamics and geometrical optimization of a fluxonic quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of dense random-access memory is one of the main obstacles to the development of digital superconducting computers. It has been suggested that AVRAM cells, based on the storage of a single Abrikosov vortex, the smallest quantized object in superconductors, can enable drastic miniaturization to the nanometer scale. In this work, we present numerical modeling of such cells using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. The cell represents a fluxonic quantum dot containing a small superconducting island, an asymmetric notch for vortex entrance, a guiding track, and a vortex trap. We determine the optimal geometrical parameters for operation at zero magnetic field and the conditions for controllable vortex manipulation by short current pulses. We report ultra-fast vortex motion with velocities more than an order of magnitude faster than those expected for macroscopic superconductors. This phenomenon is attributed to strong interactions with the edges of a mesoscopic island, combined with the nonlinear reduction of flux-flow viscosity due to nonequilibrium effects in the track. Our results show that such cells can be scaled down to sizes comparable to the London penetration depth, 100 nm, and can enable ultrafast switching on the picosecond scale with ultra-low energy per operation, 0.1 aJ.</description>

      <title>Squeezed state protection of fine structure in "Poor Man's Majorana" via quantum spin coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "Poor Man's Majorana" [Phys. Rev. B 86, 134528 (2012)] devoid of topological protection has been theoretically predicted to rely on the minimal Kitaev chain. Afterward, a pair of superconducting and spinless quantum dots turned the proposal practicable and differential conductance pinpointed consistent fingerprints with such a scenario [Nature 614, 445 (2023) and Nature 630, 329 (2024)]. In this work, we propose a model wherein the "Poor Man's Majorana" presents protection when one of the dots is exchange coupled to a quantum spin. If this quantum dot is perturbed by tuning the exchange coupling, the well-known spill over-like behavior of this Majorana surprisingly remains unchanged, and solely half of the fine structure is unexpectedly viewed. As a matter of fact, the "Poor Man's Majorana" zero mode consists in squeezing of the other half at zero frequency, which imposes its pinning there and prevents the mixing of the mode with the explicit fine structure. We claim that if the supposed unavoidable split of the zero mode by the fine structure is unexpectedly absent, then the "Poor Man's Majorana" can be considered robust against the quantum spin. In this way, it becomes protected and the lack of topological protection paradigm of the "Poor Man's Majorana" has been revisited, pushing this seemingly well-established issue into a new direction.</description>

      <title>Post-experiment coincidence detection techniques for direct detection of two-body correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is one challenge to develop experimental techniques for direct detection of the many-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons, which exhibit a variety of unsolved mysteries. In this article, we present a post-experiment coincidence counting method and propose two post-experiment coincidence detection techniques, post-experiment coincidence angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (cARPES) and post-experiment coincidence inelastic neutron scattering (cINS). By coincidence detection of two photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes, the post-experiment coincidence detection techniques can detect directly the two-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons in particle-particle channel or two-spin channel. The post-experiment coincidence detection techniques can be implemented upon the pulse-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experimental apparatus with pulse photon or neutron source. When implemented experimentally, they will be powerful techniques to study the highly esoteric high-temperature superconductivity and the highly coveted quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Inverse Faraday effect in superconductors with potential impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I consider a nonlinear response of conventional superconductors contaminated with potential impurities or imperfections to a circular polarized light. I focus on dc contributions to the induced current density which describe the emergence of the static magnetization in a superconductor. This effect is known as inverse Faraday effect. By employing quasiclassical theory of superconductivity I derive an expression for the induced static magnetization as a function of frequency of an external ac field and disorder scattering rate. The scattering of electrons off potential impurities is taken into account within the framework of the self-consistent Born approximation. It is found that the magnitude of the inverse Faraday effect decreases with an increase in disorder scattering rate. I have also discovered that the value of the induced magnetization has a characteristic minimum at a frequency which approximately equals twice the value of the pairing gap in a clean superconductor and shifts to higher values with an increase in disorder scattering rate.</description>

      <title>The Phase Diagram of High-Tc Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detailed structure of the $T \times doping$ phase diagram of hole doped High-Tc superconducting cuprates is investigated from the perspective of a recently proposed comprehensive theory for these materials. Our theory is compared to Anderson's RVB theory for High-$T_c$ cuprates and it is demonstrated that the ground-eigenstate of our theory's Hamiltonian is a RVB-like state. From the Hamiltonian we derive the thermodynamic potential, as a function of convenient order parameters, through a method whose stability is carefully demonstrated. From this, we obtain analytic expressions for the transition lines delimiting the N\'eel phase, $T_N(x)$, the Spin-Glass phase, $T_{g}(x)$ and the CDW Charge Ordered phase, $T_{co}(x)$. These results, along with the previously derived expressions for the transition lines delimiting the Superconducting phase, $T_C(x)$, the Pseudogap and Strange Metal phases, $T^*(x)$ and the Fermi Liquid phase, $T_{FL}(x)$ are in excellent agreement with the experimental data from the cuprates. Our study reveals, in particular, the complementary role, which is played by the mechanisms responsible for the onset of superconducting (SC) and Spin-Glass (SG) phases in these materials. The absence of SG phases in electron doped High-Tc superconducting cuprates, strongly suggests a different SC mechanism should operate in those materials</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity emerging along with the strange-metal behavior in UAs2 under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently discovered spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 with Tc = 2 K has attracted enormous attention because it possesses many interesting properties, such as the extremely high upper critical field Hc2(0), chiral superconductivity and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, etc., all these suggest that it may be the long-sought spin-triplet superconductor. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity up to Tc = 4K in one of its siblings, i.e., UAs2 under high pressures. Interestingly, the UAs2 shows metallic behavior with an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at about 274 K under ambient pressure. Upon applying pressure, this transition is pushed down to lower temperatures with improved electric conductivity. When the pressure rises to about 20-22 GPa, superconductivity occurs together with the emergence of a linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance, the latter is a hallmark of the strange-metal state. The superconductivity with the highest Tc = 4 K is reached under a pressure of about 26.8 GPa, and it is robust against magnetic field with the upper critical field {\mu}0Hc2(0) ~ 12 T, far beyond the Pauli limit. Higher pressures will suppress the superconductivity and bring back the Fermi liquid behavior, showing a clear signature of quantum criticality. Our results open a new avenue for investigating the unconventional superconductivity concerning the mysterious 5f-band electrons in this uranium-based system.</description>
