      <title>Temporal scaling theory for bursty time series with clusters of arbitrarily many events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term temporal correlations in time series in a form of an event sequence have been characterized using an autocorrelation function (ACF) that often shows a power-law decaying behavior. Such scaling behavior has been mainly accounted for by the heavy-tailed distribution of interevent times (IETs), i.e., the time interval between two consecutive events. Yet little is known about how correlations between consecutive IETs systematically affect the decaying behavior of the ACF. Empirical distributions of the burst size, which is the number of events in a cluster of events occurring in a short time window, often show heavy tails, implying that arbitrarily many consecutive IETs may be correlated with each other. In the present study, we propose a model for generating a time series with arbitrary functional forms of IET and burst size distributions. Then, we analytically derive the ACF for the model time series. In particular, by assuming that the IET and burst size are power-law distributed, we derive scaling relations between power-law exponents of the ACF decay, IET distribution, and burst size distribution. These analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations. Our approach helps to rigorously and analytically understand the effects of correlations between arbitrarily many consecutive IETs on the decaying behavior of the ACF.</description>

      <title>PHYSTAT Informal Review: Marginalizing versus Profiling of Nuisance Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a writeup, with some elaboration, of the talks by the two authors (a physicist and a statistician) at the first PHYSTAT Informal review on January 24, 2024. We discuss Bayesian and frequentist approaches to dealing with nuisance parameters, in particular, integrated versus profiled likelihood methods. In regular models, with finitely many parameters and large sample sizes, the two approaches are asymptotically equivalent. But, outside this setting, the two methods can lead to different tests and confidence intervals. Assessing which approach is better generally requires comparing the power of the tests or the length of the confidence intervals. This analysis has to be conducted on a case-by-case basis. In the extreme case where the number of nuisance parameters is very large, possibly infinite, neither approach may be useful. Part I provides an informal history of usage in high energy particle physics, including a simple illustrative example. Part II includes an overview of some more recently developed methods in the statistics literature, including methods applicable when the use of the likelihood function is problematic.</description>

      <title>Assessing frustration in real-world signed networks: traditional or relaxed balance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to traditional balance theory, individual social actors avoid establishing triads with an odd number of negative links. Generalising, mesoscopic balance is realised when the nodes of a signed graph can be grouped into positively connected subsets, mutually connected by negative links. If this prescription is interpreted rigidly without allowing for statistical noise, it quickly dismisses most real graphs as frustrated. As an alternative, a relaxed, yet qualitative, definition of balance has been advanced. After rephrasing both variants in statistically testable terms, we propose an inference scheme to unambiguously assess if a signed graph is traditionally or relaxedly balanced.</description>

Abstract: We show how to train an autoencoder to reconstruct an attractor from recorded footage, preserving the topology of the underlying phase space. This is explicitly demonstrated for the classic finite-amplitude Lorenz atmospheric convection problem.</description>

      <title>Quantum walk on simplicial complexes for simplicial community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks have emerged as a transformative paradigm in quantum information processing and can be applied to various graph problems. This study explores discrete-time quantum walks on simplicial complexes, a higher-order generalization of graph structures. Simplicial complexes, encoding higher-order interactions through simplices, offer a richer topological representation of complex systems. Since the conventional classical random walk cannot directly detect community structures, we present a quantum walk algorithm to detect higher-order community structures called simplicial communities. We utilize the Fourier coin to produce entangled translation states among adjacent simplices in a simplicial complex. The potential of our quantum algorithm is tested on Zachary's karate club network. This study may contribute to understanding complex systems at the intersection of algebraic topology and quantum walk algorithms.</description>
