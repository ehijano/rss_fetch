      <title>Real toric manifolds associated with chordal nestohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the rational Betti numbers of real toric manifolds associated with chordal nestohedra. We consider the poset topology of a specific poset induced from a chordal building set, and show its EL-shellability. Based on this, we present an explicit description using alternating $\mathcal{B}$-permutations for a chordal building set $\mathcal{B}$, transforming the computing Betti numbers into a counting problem. This approach allows us to compute the $a$-number of a finite simple graph through permutation counting when the graph is chordal. In addition, we provide detailed computations for specific cases such as real Hochschild varieties corresponding to Hochschild polytopes.</description>

      <title>Functors on the category of finite sets revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of the category of representations of $\mathbf{FA}$, the category of finite sets and all maps, mostly working over a field of characteristic zero. This category is not semi-simple and exhibits interesting features.
  We first construct the simple representations, recovering the classification given by Wiltshire-Gordon. The construction given here also yields explicit descriptions of the indecomposable projectives.
  These results are used to give a convenient set of projective generators of the category of representations of $\mathbf{FA}$ and hence a Morita equivalence result. This is used to explain how to calculate the multiplicities of the composition factors of an arbitrary object, based only on its underlying $\mathbf{FB}$-representation, where $\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections.
  This is applied to show how to calculate the morphism spaces between projectives in our chosen set of generators, as well as for a closely related family of objects (the significance of which can be shown by relative nonhomogeneous Koszul duality theory).</description>

      <title>Classifying smashing ideals in derived categories of valuation domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on results of Bazzoni-\v{S}\v{t}ov\'{\i}\v{c}ek, we give a complete classification of the frame of smashing ideals for the derived category of a finite dimensional valuation domain. In particular, we give an explicit construction of an infinite family of commutative rings such that the telescope conjecture fails and which generalise an example of Keller. As a consequence, we deduce that the Krull dimension of the Balmer spectrum and the Krull dimension of the smashing spectrum can differ arbitrarily for rigidly-compactly generated tensor-triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>The Action of GT-Shadows on Child's Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.06645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GT-shadows are tantalizing objects that can be thought of as approximations of elements of the mysterious Grothendieck-Teichmueller group $\widehat{GT}$ introduced by V. Drinfeld in 1990. GT-shadows form a groupoid GTSh whose objects are finite index subgroups of the pure braid group PB_4, that are normal in B_4. The goal of this paper is to describe the action of GT-shadows on Grothendieck's child's drawings and show that this action agrees with that of $\widehat{GT}$. We discuss the hierarchy of orbits of child's drawings with respect to the actions of GTSh, $\widehat{GT}$, and the absolute Galois group G_Q of rationals. We prove that the monodromy group and the passport of a child's drawing are invariant with respect to the action of the subgroupoid of charming GT-shadows. We use the action of GT-shadows on child's drawings to prove that every Abelian child's drawing admits a Belyi pair defined over rationals. Finally, we describe selected examples of non-Abelian child's drawings.</description>

      <title>The cohomology rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript is a contributed chapter in the forthcoming CRC Press volume, titled the Handbook of Combinatorial Algebraic Geometry: Subvarieties of the Flag Variety. The book, as a whole, is aimed at a diverse audience of researchers and graduate students seeking an expository introduction to the area. In our chapter, we give an overview of some of the past research on the cohomology rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties, with no claim to being exhaustive. For the purposes of this manuscript, we focus mainly on the case of Lie type A, with some brief remarks on the general Lie types. We end the chapter with a selection of topics currently active in this area.</description>
