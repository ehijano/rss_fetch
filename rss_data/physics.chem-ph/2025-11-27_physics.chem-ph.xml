      <title>Bridging Atomistic and Mesoscale Lithium Transport via Machine-Learned Force Fields and Markov State Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium diffusion in solid-state battery anodes occurs through thermally activated hops between metastable sites often separated by large energy barriers, making such events rare on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) timescales. Here, we present a bottom-up multiscale workflow that integrates AIMD, machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), and Markov state models (MSMs) to establish a quantitatively consistent link between atomistic hopping mechanisms and mesoscale transport. MLFFs fine-tuned on AIMD reference data retain near-DFT accuracy while enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations extending to tens of nanoseconds. These extended trajectories remove the strong finite-size bias present in AIMD and yield diffusion coefficients in excellent agreement with experiment. Furthermore, from these long MLFF trajectories, we obtain statistically converged lithium jump networks and construct MSMs that remain Markovian across more than two orders of magnitude in the lag times used for their construction. The resulting MSMs faithfully reproduce mean-square displacements and recover rare diffusion processes that do not occur on AIMD timescales. In addition to propagating lithium distributions, the MSM transition matrices provide mechanistic insight: their eigenvalues and eigenvectors encode characteristic relaxation timescales and dominant transport pathways. Although demonstrated for defect-free crystalline Li$_x$Si$_y$ phases, the AIMD$\rightarrow$MLFF$\rightarrow$MSM framework is general and provides a transferable approach for describing lithium transport in amorphous materials, defect-mediated diffusion, and next-generation solid-state anodes.</description>

      <title>Different Rise Times of Atomic Br M$_{4,5}$ 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ Core Level Absorptions during Br$_{2}$ C $^{1}\Pi_{u}$ $1_{u}$ State Dissociation via Extreme Ultraviolet Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reported ''dissociation times'' for the Br$_{2}$ C ($^{1}\Pi_{u}$ $1_{u}$) state by various measurement methods differ widely across the literature (30 to 340 fs). We consider this issue by investigating attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy at the Br M4,5 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ edges (66 to 80 eV), tracking core-to-valence (3d to 4p) and core-to-Rydberg (3d to ns, np, n $\geq$ 5) transitions from the molecular to atomic limit. The progress of dissociation can be ascertained by the buildup of the atomic absorption in time. Notably, the measured rise times of the 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ to 4p transitions depend on the probed core level final state, 38 $\pm$ 1 and 20 $\pm$ 5 fs for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ and $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ at 64.31 and 65.34 eV, respectively. Simulations by the nuclear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation reproduce the rise-time difference of the 3d to 4p transitions, and the theory suggests several important factors. One is the transition dipole moments of each probe transition have different molecular and atomic values for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ versus $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ that depend on the bond length. The other is the merger of multiple molecular absorptions into the same atomic absorption, creating multiple timescales even for a single probe transition. Unfortunately, the core-to-Rydberg absorptions did not allow accurate atomic Br buildup times to be extracted due to spectral overlaps with ground state bleaching, otherwise an even more comprehensive picture of the role of the probe state transition would be possible. This work shows that the measured probe signals accurately contain the dissociative wavepacket dynamics but also reveal how the specific probe transition affects the apparent progress toward dissociation with bond length. Such potential probe-transition-dependent effects need to be considered when interpreting measured signals and their timescales.</description>

      <title>Design of a Plastic Inorganic Semiconductor GaPS4-Based Gas Sensor for Conformal Monitoring of Gas Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports the first gas sensor based on the plastic inorganic semiconductor GaPS4, pioneering the application of plastic inorganic semiconductors in the field of gas sensing. Unlike traditional rigid sensors, this device leverages the unique layered structure and ultra-wide bandgap of GaPS4 to achieve high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting NO2. The intrinsic plastic deformability of the material enables it to conform tightly to complex curved pipelines like an "electronic bandage," completely eliminating monitoring blind spots. Nanoindentation tests reveal that its extremely low hardness (0.20 GPa) confers exceptional flexibility while maintaining stable electrical characteristics even under bent states. The device exhibits a linear response to NO2 concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 ppm at room temperature. Although the limited defects in the single-crystal material result in pA-level response currents, defect engineering offers a viable pathway for performance enhancement. This study breaks through the conventional boundaries of plastic inorganic semiconductors confined to photoelectric and thermoelectric applications, opening new avenues for their use in gas sensing and advancing gas monitoring technology toward "conformal integration."</description>

      <title>Diffusion-controlled reaction rate to an active site in a spherical cavity: Extension of Berg's theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is due to various applications in physics, chemistry and especially in biology, where both bounded configuration domain and chemical anisotropy could play a great part. In fact we generalize the well-known Berg theory, which describes diffusion-controlled reactions occurring within a spherically symmetric absorber-cavity system. The trapping probability and the reaction rate at which a small diffusing particle is captured by an axially symmetric one reactive patch absorber inside a spherical cavity were found semi-analytically and numerically by means of the dual series relations method. This approach leads to such incredibly fast convergence, that it may rightly be referred to as exact one. The results obtained can be used to test numerical programmes that describe diffusion-controlled reactions in real physical systems for reactants with arbitrary anisotropic reactivity, which are located inside of various cavities as well as in the unbounded domains. Moreover, we managed to find a close connection between the dual series relations method and the generalized method of separation of variables.</description>

      <title>A Low Cost Relativistic Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Method Based on Cholesky Decomposition and Frozen Natural Spinors for Electronic Ionization, Attachment and Excitation Energy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient relativistic implementation of the algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) theory up to third order, incorporating Cholesky decomposition (CD) and frozen natural spinor (FNS) techniques to address electronic ionization, attachment, and excitation problems in heavy-element systems. The exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian has been employed to balance accuracy with computational efficiency, and a state-specific frozen natural spinor (SS-FNS) extension has been developed to improve excited-state descriptions. The present implementation accurately reproduces canonical four-component third-order ADC results while significantly lowering computational demands. The efficiency and performance of the present implementation are demonstrated through calculations on larger systems, with the largest system successfully treated comprising more than 2600 basis functions.</description>

      <title>Towards superior van der Waals density functionals for molecular crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ubiquitous van der Waals (vdW) interactions play a subtle yet crucial role in determining the precise atomic arrangements in solids, particularly in molecular crystals where these weak forces are the primary link between constituent building blocks. Within density functional (DF) theory, the most natural approach for addressing vdW forces is the use of vdW-inclusive density functionals. Through a detailed analysis of the underlying formalism, we have developed a computational scheme that combines vdW functionals of type DF1 and DF2 and serves as a well optimizable tool to improve the theoretical description and prediction of molecular crystals and other sparse materials. The proof of principle is demonstrated by our consideration of the molecular crystals from the X23 dataset.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Inter-system Crossing of the Nitrogen-Vacancy Center up to Megabar Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers into diamond anvil cells has opened the door to quantum sensing at megabar pressures. Despite a multitude of experimental demonstrations and applications ranging from quantum materials to geophysics, a detailed microscopic understanding of how stress affects the NV center remains lacking. In this work, using a combination of first principles calculations as well as high-pressure NV experiments, we develop a complete description of the NV's optical properties under general stress conditions. In particular, our ab initio calculations reveal the complex behavior of the NV's inter-system crossing rates under stresses that both preserve and break the defect's symmetry. Crucially, our proposed framework immediately resolves a number of open questions in the field, including: (i) the microscopic origin of the observed contrast-enhancement in (111)-oriented anvils, and (ii) the surprising observation of NV contrast-inversion in certain high-pressure regimes. Our work lays the foundation for optimizing the performance of NV high-pressure sensors by controlling the local stress environment, and more generally, suggests that symmetry-breaking stresses can be utilized as a novel tuning knob for generic solid-state spin defects.</description>

      <title>AI4X Roadmap: Artificial Intelligence for the advancement of scientific pursuit and its future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are reshaping how we approach scientific discovery, not by replacing established methods but by extending what researchers can probe, predict, and design. In this roadmap we provide a forward-looking view of AI-enabled science across biology, chemistry, climate science, mathematics, materials science, physics, self-driving laboratories and unconventional computing. Several shared themes emerge: the need for diverse and trustworthy data, transferable electronic-structure and interatomic models, AI systems integrated into end-to-end scientific workflows that connect simulations to experiments and generative systems grounded in synthesisability rather than purely idealised phases. Across domains, we highlight how large foundation models, active learning and self-driving laboratories can close loops between prediction and validation while maintaining reproducibility and physical interpretability. Taken together, these perspectives outline where AI-enabled science stands today, identify bottlenecks in data, methods and infrastructure, and chart concrete directions for building AI systems that are not only more powerful but also more transparent and capable of accelerating discovery in complex real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Cost-effective scalable quantum error mitigation for tiled Ans\"atze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a cost-effective quantum error mitigation technique that builds on the recent Ansatz-based gate and readout error mitigation method (M0). The technique, tiled M0, leverages the unique structure of tiled Ans\"atze (e.g., tUPS, QNP, hardware-efficient circuits) to apply a locality approximation to M0 that results in an exponential reduction in the QPU cost of the noise characterization. We validate the technique for molecular ground state energy calculations with the tUPS Ansatz on LiH, molecular hydrogen, water, butadiene, and benzene ($4-12$ qubits), demonstrating little to no loss in accuracy compared to M0 in noisy simulations. We also show the performance of the technique in quantum experiments, highlighting its potential use in near-term applications.</description>

      <title>Rapid ground state energy estimation with a Sparse Pauli Dynamics-enabled Variational Double Bracket Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground state energy estimation for strongly correlated quantum systems remains a central challenge in computational physics and chemistry. While tensor network methods like DMRG provide efficient solutions for one-dimensional systems, higher-dimensional problems remain difficult. Here we present a variational double bracket flow (vDBF) algorithm that leverages Sparse Pauli Dynamics, a technique originally developed for classical simulation of quantum circuits, to efficiently approximate ground state energies. By combining greedy operator selection with coefficient truncation and energy-variance extrapolation, the method achieves less than 1% error relative to DMRG benchmarks for both Heisenberg and Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. For a 10x10 Heisenberg lattice (100 qubits), vDBF obtains accurate results in approximately 10 minutes on a single CPU thread, compared to over 50 hours on 64 threads for DMRG. For an 8x8 Hubbard model (128 qubits), the speedup is even more pronounced. These results demonstrate that classical simulation techniques developed in the context of quantum advantage benchmarking can provide practical tools for many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Freeze-and-release direct optimization method for variational calculations of excited electronic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational optimization of orbitals in time-independent density functional calculations of excited electronic states presents a significant challenge, as excited states typically correspond to saddle points on the electronic energy landscape. The optimization can be particularly difficult if the excitation involves significant rearrangement of the electron density, as for charge transfer excitations. A simple strategy for variational orbital optimization of excited states is presented. The approach involves minimizing the energy while freezing the orbitals directly involved in the excitation, followed by a fully unconstrained saddle point optimization. Both steps of this freeze-and-release strategy are carried out using direct optimization algorithms with the same computational scaling as ground state calculations. The performance of the method is extensively assessed in calculations of intramolecular and intermolecular charge transfer excited states of organic molecules and molecular dimers using a generalized gradient approximation functional. It is found that the freeze-and-release direct optimization approach can avoid variational collapse to spurious, charge-delocalized solutions for cases where conventional algorithms based on the maximum overlap method fail. For intermolecular charge transfer, the orbital-optimized calculations are found to provide the correct dependency of the energy on the donor-acceptor separation without requiring long-range exact exchange, something common time-dependent density functional theory approaches fail to achieve.</description>

      <title>Simulating the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions in NMR by spin dynamic mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17720v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is a notoriously difficult task, if many spins participate in the dynamics. The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We obtain a remarkable agreement with experimental data for an aluminium nitride monocrystal, which strongly suggests the use of spinDMFT as a prediction tool. Furthermore, we draw a comparison between a quantum-mechanical and a classical version of spinDMFT showing that local quantum effects are of great importance for the studied type of system.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Born-Oppenheimer Corrections in Condensed-Phase Ring Polymer Surface Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ring polymer surface hopping (RPSH) is a mixed quantum-classical dynamics method for incorporating nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) into nonadiabatic dynamics simulations via the extended phase-space of a classical ring polymer. Here, we systematically investigate several variants of RPSH in the frameworks of centroid and bead approximations (RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA) in modeling the dynamics of the spin-boson system across different reaction regimes, reorganization energies, and temperatures. Moreover, the effects of including the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) on the performance of the RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA methods are investigated. Our simulations of symmetric potentials, i.e., without energy bias, show that the RPSH-CA method, where nonadiabatic transitions are handled at the centroid level, is satisfactorily accurate and robust across different reaction regimes. Adding DBOC improves the method's accuracy in specific intermediate and nonadiabatic reaction regimes at low temperature. Overall, the effect of DBOC in RPSH-CA is in moderation compared to conventional fewest-switches surface hopping method where DBOC over-damps the dynamics significantly and reduces accuracy considerably, especially at low temperatures. However, the RPSH-CA and its DBOC variant struggle in simulations of asymmetric potentials specially at low temperatures. On the other hand, RPSH-BA results, where nonadiabatic transitions are handled at the level of individual beads of the ring polymers, are generally unreliable unless in the high temperature adiabatic reaction regimes with symmetric potentials. The inclusion of DBOC is not particularly helpful in remedying this erratic behavior. Our findings clarify when geometric corrections are beneficial or detrimental to nonadiabatic simulations using RPSH, providing practical guidance for atomistic condensed-phase applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum-electrodynamical time-dependent density functional theory description of molecules in optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum electrodynamical time-dependent density functional theory framework is applied to describe strongly coupled light--matter interactions in cavity environments. The formalism utilizes a tensor product approach, coupling real-space electronic wave functions with Fock space photonic states. Various molecular systems serve as test cases to examine how coupling parameters and cavity frequencies affect molecular geometry, polaritonic spectra, and intermolecular binding.</description>

      <title>Scalable Reactive Atomistic Dynamics with GAIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Groundbreaking advances in materials and chemical research have been driven by the development of atomistic simulations. However, the broader applicability of atomistic simulations remains limited, as they inherently depend on energy models that are either approximate or computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have recently emerged as a promising class of energy models, but their deployment also remains challenging due to the scarcity of systematic protocols for generating training data spanning diverse structural regimes. Here we introduce GAIA, an end-to-end automated framework that streamlines dataset construction for the development of general-purpose reactive MLIPs. GAIA combines a metadynamics-based exploration scheme with closed-loop data expansion for the efficient sampling of a broad spectrum of atomic arrangements, thereby addressing the reliance on heuristics in conventional dataset generation. Using GAIA, we constructed Titan25, a benchmark-scale dataset, and trained an MLIP that closely matches both static and dynamic density functional theory results. The resulting model reproduces key experimental observations across distinct modes of reactivity, including detonation, coalescence, and catalytic processes. GAIA thus helps bridge the gap between simulation and experiment, paving the way toward scalable and general MLIPs capable of describing a wide range of materials and chemical processes.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Foundation Neural Network Models using Multiple Time-Step and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a distilled multi-time-step (DMTS) strategy to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations using foundation neural network models. DMTS uses a dual-level neural network where the target accurate potential is coupled to a simpler but faster model obtained via a distillation process. The 3.5 \r{A}-cutoff distilled model is sufficient to capture the fast-varying forces, i.e., mainly bonded interactions, from the accurate potential allowing its use in a reversible reference system propagator algorithms (RESPA)-like formalism. The approach conserves accuracy, preserving both static and dynamical properties, while enabling to evaluate the costly model only every 3 to 6 fs depending on the system. Consequently, large simulation speedups over standard 1 fs integration are observed: nearly 4-fold in homogeneous systems and 3-fold in large solvated proteins through leveraging active learning for enhanced stability. Such a strategy is applicable to any neural network potential and reduces their performance gap with classical force fields.</description>

      <title>Orbital-Optimized Unitary Coupled Cluster for Indirect Nuclear Spin-Spin Coupling Constants within a Quantum Linear Response Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum linear response (qLR) approach within an active-space framework for computing indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants, a key ingredient in NMR spectra predictions. The method employs the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz and its orbital-optimized variant (ooUCC), both suitable for quantum computing implementations, to evaluate spin-spin coupling constants via qLR. Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods. We further examine the role of orbital optimization and find that ooUCC markedly affects the computed couplings; orbital-optimized results show better agreement with CCSD. These findings indicate that orbital optimization is important for accurate NMR coupling predictions within quantum-computing-friendly correlated methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11576v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Witnesses of Condensation for Enhanced Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phenomena such as entanglement provide powerful resources for enhancing classical sensing. Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.</description>
