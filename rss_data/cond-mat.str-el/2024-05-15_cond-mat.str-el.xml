      <title>Global anomalies of Green's function zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies in systems with symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy, described by nonlocal effective theories. We view the nonlocal effective theories as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomalies, we discuss the simplest Lagrangian describing a gapless Dirac zero and a two-pole variant, their global anomalies, and the bulk-boundary correspondence. We then consider the constraints on possible phases with Green's function zeros of Dirac type, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory discussed by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Antiferromagnetic Resonance: A Comprehensive Analysis via the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) has demonstrated efficacy in discerning phase transitions and, more recently, in elucidating coherent phenomena within ferromagnetic systems. However, a notable gap in understanding arises when extending this framework to antiferromagnetic models. In this investigation, we employ the SCHA formalism to conduct an in-depth exploration of the Antiferromagnetic Resonance (AFMR) within both Antiferromagnetic (AF) and Spin-Flop (SF) phases. Our analysis includes thermodynamic considerations from both semiclassical and quantum perspectives, with comparisons drawn against contemporary experimental and theoretical data. By incorporating a treatment utilizing coherent states, we investigate the dynamics of magnetization precession, a fundamental aspect in comprehending various spintronic experiments. Notably, the SCHA demonstrates excellent agreement with existing literature, showcasing its simplicity and efficiency in describing AFMR characteristics, even close to the transition temperature.</description>

      <title>A thorough investigation of the Antiferromagnetic Resonance and their properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AF) compounds possess distinct characteristics that render them promising candidates for advancing the application of spin degrees of freedom in computational devices. For instance, AF materials exhibit minimal susceptibility to external magnetic fields while operating at frequencies significantly higher than their ferromagnetic counterparts. However, despite their potential, there remains a dearth of understanding, particularly concerning certain aspects of AF spintronics. In particular, the properties of coherent states in AF materials have received insufficient investigation, with many features extrapolated directly from the ferromagnetic scenario. Addressing this gap, this study offers a comprehensive examination of AF coherent states, shedding new light on both AF and Spin-Flop phases. Employing the Holstein-Primakoff formalism, we conduct an in-depth analysis of resonating-driven coherent phases. Subsequently, we apply this formalism to characterize antiferromagnetic resonance, a pivotal phenomenon in spin-pumping experiments, and extract crucial insights therefrom.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hertz action and quantum criticality of two-dimensional Fermi systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reassess the structure of the effective action and quantum critical singularities of two-dimensional Fermi systems characterized by the ordering wavevector $\vec{Q}= \vec{0}$. By employing infrared cutoffs on all the massless degrees of freedom, we derive a generalized form of the Hertz action, which does not suffer from problems of singular effective interactions. We demonstrate that the Wilsonian momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) theory capturing the infrared scaling should be formulated keeping $\vec{Q}$ as a flowing, scale-dependent quantity. At the quantum critical point, scaling controlled by the dynamical exponent $z=3$ is overshadowed by a broad scaling regime characterized by a lower value of $z \approx 2$. This in particular offers an explanation of the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations pertinent to the electronic nematic quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of the quasi-XY Shastry-Sutherland magnet Er$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycrystalline and single crystal samples of the insulating Shastry-Sutherland compound Er$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$ were synthesized via a solid-state reaction and the floating zone method respectively. The crystal structure, Er single ion anisotropy, zero-field magnetic ground state, and magnetic phase diagrams along high-symmetry crystallographic directions were investigated by bulk measurement techniques, x-ray and neutron diffraction, and neutron spectroscopy. We establish that Er$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$ crystallizes in a tetragonal space group with planes of orthogonal Er dimers and a strong preference for the Er moments to lie in the local plane perpendicular to each dimer bond. We also find that this system has a non-collinear ordered ground state in zero field with a transition temperature of 0.841 K consisting of antiferromagnetic dimers and in-plane moments. Finally, we mapped out the $H-T$ phase diagrams for Er$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$ along the directions $H \parallel$ [001], [100], and [110]. While an increasing in-plane field simply induces a phase transition to a field-polarized phase, we identify three metamagnetic transitions before the field-polarized phase is established in the $H \parallel$ [001] case. This complex behavior establishes insulating Er$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$ and other isostructural family members as promising candidates for uncovering exotic magnetic properties and phenomena that can be readily compared to theoretical predictions of the exactly soluble Shastry-Sutherland model.</description>

      <title>From the Quantum Breakdown Model to the Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional quantum breakdown model, which features spatially asymmetric fermionic interactions simulating the electrical breakdown phenomenon, exhibits an exponential U(1) symmetry and a variety of dynamical phases including many-body localization and quantum chaos with quantum scar states. We investigate the minimal quantum breakdown model with the minimal number of on-site fermion orbitals required for the interaction, and identify a large number of local conserved charges in the model. We then reveal a mapping between the minimal quantum breakdown model in certain charge sectors and a quantum link model which simulates the $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, and show that the local conserved charges map to the gauge symmetry generators. A special charge sector of the model further maps to the PXP model, which shows quantum many-body scars. This mapping unveils the rich dynamics in different Krylov subspaces characterized by different gauge configurations in the quantum breakdown model.</description>

      <title>Bulk-like Mott-Transition in ultrathin Cr-doped V2O3 films and the influence of its variability on scaled devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pressure driven Mott-transition in Chromium doped V2O3 films is investigated by direct electrical measurements on polycrystalline films with thicknesses down to 10 nm, and doping concentrations of 2%, 5% and 15%. A change in resistivity of nearly two orders of magnitude is found for 2% doping. A simulation model based on a scaling law description of the phase transition and percolative behavior in a resistor lattice is developed. This is used to show that despite significant deviations in the film structure from single crystals, the transition behavior is very similar. Finally, the influence of the variability between grains on the characteristics of scaled devices is investigated and found to allow for scaling down to at least 50 nm device width.</description>

      <title>Field Dispersion and Strong Coupling of Nuclear-Electron Spin Excitation in MnCO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybridized nuclear and electron spin excitation in a MnCO$_3$ crystal, a weakly-anisotropic antiferromagnet, has been investigated. In this material, the hyperfine interaction is strong enough to form a nuclear spin wave. We measure the microwave absorption by a bulk MnCO$_3$ and observe the dispersion representing strong frequency repulsion between electron and nuclear modes due to their hybridization, the signature of nuclear spin wave. Additionally, we observe that the nuclear spin resonance enters a nonlinear regime above a certain excitation power, attributed to the excitation of finite wavenumber nuclear spin waves.</description>

      <title>Robust non-Abelian even-denominator fractional Chern insulator in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experiment observes a series of quantum Hall effects in transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e MoTe$_2$ [K. Kang, et. al, Nature 628, 522-526 (2024)]. Among them, the filling $\nu$ = 3 state points to a time-reversal pair of edge states resembling those of the even-denominator fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Inspired by this discovery, we investigate whether a robust incompressible quantum Hall liquid can be stabilized in the half-filled Chern band of twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers. We use the continuum model with parameters relevant to twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers and obtain three consecutive nearly flat Chern bands that resemble the experimental plateaus at filling $\nu$ = 2, 4, 6. Crucially, when the second moir\'e miniband is half-filled, signatures of non-Abelian states are found via exact diagonalization calculations, including the stable six-fold ground state degeneracy which grows more robust for larger lattice sizes in consistency with an even-denominator FCI state. We further perform flux insertion simulations to reveal a 1/2 quantized many-body Chern number. Furthermore, the ground state density structure factors show no sharp peak, which excludes the charge density wave order. These evidences signal the potential of realizing the non-Abelian state at zero magnetic field in twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers at the fractional hole filling 3/2.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fluctuation and dominant superconducting pairing symmetry near the tunable Van Hove singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetism and pairing correlations of the triangular lattice based on the Hubbard model using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method and the constrained path Monte Carlo. The results show that the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping integral $t^{\prime}$ introduces an additional energy scale to the system, and through $t^{\prime}$, one can regulate the shape of the density of states and thus the position of the van Hove singularity point. Increasing inverse temperature $\beta$ and on-site interaction $U$ favor the formation of ferromagnetic correlation in a rather large filling region, and the calculations for different lattice sizes show that the range of the ferromagnetic correlations is smaller than the smallest lattice simulated at the investigated temperatures. We study the different pairing correlations of the triangular lattice near several typical fillings and show that the $f$-wave pairing dominates the system in the filling region near the van Hove singularity point with a high density of states, where the ferromagnetic correlation is also enhanced. When the filling is close to half-filling, the pairing susceptibility with $f$ wave is suppressed and the pairing susceptibility of $f_n$ wave is enhanced, however, both the effective pairing interaction with $f$ wave and $f_n$ wave are negative, which indicates that neither $f$-wave nor $f_n$-wave superconductivity may exist. Finally, we find that the pairing channel of different symmetry in the system maybe closely related to the magnetic properties. Ferromagnetic fluctuation favors the formation of $f$-wave pairing, while antiferromagnetic fluctuation tends to promote $f_n$-wave pairing.</description>

      <title>Synthesis, disorder and Ising anisotropy in a new spin liquid candidate PrMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report the successful synthesis of large single crystals of triangular frustrated PrMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ using the optical floating zone technique. Single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements unveiled the presence of quenched disorder within the mirror plane, specifically $\sim$7\% of Pr ions deviating from the ideal 2\textit{d} site towards the 6\textit{h} site. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed an Ising anisotropy with the \textit{c}-axis being the easy axis. Despite a large spin-spin interaction that develops below $\sim$10~K and considerable site disorder, the spins do not order or freeze down to at least 50 mK. The availability of large single crystals offers a distinct opportunity to investigate the exotic magnetic state on a triangular lattice with an easy axis out of the plane.</description>

      <title>Dynamic exchange-correlation effects in the strongly coupled electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first quasi-exact \textit{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the dynamic local field correction $\widetilde{G}(\mathbf{q},z_l;r_s,\Theta)$ in the imaginary Matsubara frequency domain, focusing on the strongly coupled finite temperature uniform electron gas. These allow us to investigate the impact of dynamic exchange--correlation effects onto the static structure factor. Our results provide a straightforward explanation for previously reported spurious effects in the so-called \textit{static approximation} [Dornheim \textit{et al.}, \textit{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{125}, 235001 (2020)], where the frequency-dependence of the local field correction is neglected. Our findings hint at the intriguing possibility of constructing an analytical four-parameter representation of $\widetilde{G}(\mathbf{q},z_l;r_s,\Theta)$ valid for a substantial part of the phase diagram, which would constitute key input for thermal density functional theory simulations.</description>

      <title>$Z_{2}$ order fractionalization, topological phase transition, and odd frequency pairing in an exactly solvable spin-charge ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the order fractionalization in Kitaev-Kondo model, we propose an exactly solvable spin-charge ladder model to study the order fractionalization with discrete symmetry. The spin-charge ladder is composed of a spin chain and a superconducting wire coupled via an Ising-type interaction, and we obtain the exact solution in the flat band limit. The exact solution reveals the $Z_{2}$ order fractionalization with dual symmetry breaking and intertwined order parameters. We investigate the topological phase transition of the spin-charge ladder via the spectral chiral index, and identify the correlated topological superconductor (TSC*) phase with gapped $Z_{2}$ Kondo flux excitations. We demonstrate Majorana spinons generated odd frequency pairing in the superconducting wire. We also discuss the order fractionalization in the perspective of $Z_{2}$ lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Unconventional surface phase transitions in a (1+1)D $SU(2)_1$ CFT edge coupled to a (2+1)D $Z_2$ bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a (2+1)D quantum spin model in which spin-1/2 ladders are coupled through antiferromagnetic Ising interactions. The model hosts a quantum phase transition in the (2+1)D $Z_2$ universality class from the Haldane phase to the antiferromagnetic Ising ordered phase. We focus on studying the surface properties of three different surface configurations when the Ising couplings are tuned. Different behaviors are found on different surfaces. We find ordinary and two different extraordinary surface critical behaviors (SCBs) at the bulk critical point. The ordinary SCBs belong to the surface universality class of the classical 3D Ising bulk transition. One extraordinary SCBs is induced by the topological properties of the Haldane phase. Another extraordinary SCBs at the bulk critical point is induced by an unconventional surface phase transition where the surface develops an Ising order before the bulk. This surface transition is realized by coupling a (1+1)D $SU(2)_1$ CFT boundary to a (2+1)D bulk with $Z_2$ symmetry. We find that the transition is neither a (1+1)D $Z_2$ transition, expected based on symmetry consideration, nor a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition, violating the previous theoretical prediction. This new surface phase transition and related extraordinary SCBs deserve further analytical and numerical exploration.</description>

      <title>Quantitative description of long-range order in the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantitative description of long-range order remains a challenge in quantum many-body physics. We provide zero-temperature results from two complementary methods for the ground-state energy per site, the sublattice magnetization, the spin gap, and the transverse spin correlation length for the spin-1/2 anisotropic quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. On the one hand, we use exact, large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. On the other hand, we use the semi-analytic approach based on continuous similarity transformations in terms of elementary magnon excitations. Our findings confirm the applicability and quantitative validity of both approaches along the full parameter axis from the Ising point to the symmetry-restoring phase transition at the Heisenberg point and further provide quantitative reference results in the thermodynamic limit. In addition, we analytically derive the relation between the dispersion and the correlation length at zero temperature in arbitrary dimension, and discuss improved second-moment QMC estimators.</description>

Abstract: In this work we demonstrate that accurate ground state wave functions may be constructed for polarons in a fully ab initio setting across the wide range of couplings associated with both the large and small polaron limits. We present a single general unitary transformation approach which encompasses an ab initio version of the Lee-Low-Pines theory at weak coupling and the coherent state Landau-Pekar framework at strong coupling while interpolating between these limits in general cases. We show that perturbation theory around these limits may be performed in a facile manner to assess the accuracy of the approach, as well as provide an independent route to the ab initio properties of polarons. We test these ideas on the case of LiF, where the electron-polaron is expected to be large and relatively weakly coupled, while the hole-polaron is expected to be a strongly coupled small polaron.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of electron-phonon coupled systems using neural quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use neural quantum states (NQS) to describe the high-dimensional wave functions of electron-phonon coupled systems. We demonstrate that NQS can accurately and systematically learn the underlying physics of such problems through a variational Monte Carlo optimization of the energy with minimal incorporation of physical information even in highly challenging cases. We assess the ability of our approach across various lattice model examples featuring different types of couplings. The flexibility of our NQS formulation is demonstrated via application to ab initio models parametrized by density functional perturbation theory consisting of electron or hole bands coupled linearly to dispersive phonons. We compute accurate real-frequency spectral properties of electron-phonon systems via a novel formalism based on NQS. Our work establishes a general framework for exploring diverse ground state and dynamical phenomena arising in electron-phonon systems, including the non-perturbative interplay of correlated electronic and electron-phonon effects in systems ranging from simple lattice models to realistic models of materials parametrized by ab initio calculations.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations in the hole-doped cuprates and the confinement of spinons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long standing problem in the study of the under-hole-doped cuprates has been the description of the Fermi surfaces underlying the high magnetic field quantum oscillations. Harrison and Sebastian (arXiv:1103.4181) proposed that the higher temperature pseudogap 'Fermi arcs' are reconstructed into an electron pocket by field-induced charge density wave order. But computations on such a model (Zhang and Mei, arXiv:1411.2098) show an unobserved additional oscillation frequency from a Fermi surface arising from the backsides of the hole pockets completing the Fermi arcs. We describe a transition from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) model of the pseudogap metal, to a metal with bi-directional charge density wave order without fractionalization. We show that the confinement of the fermionic spinon excitations of the FL* across this transition can eliminate the unobserved oscillation frequency, and also account for the excess observed linear-in-temperature specific heat (C. Girod et al., arXiv:2004.03650).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a Frobenius algebra over fusion categories of the form Rep$(G)\boxtimes$Rep$(G)$ which generalizes the diagonal subgroup of $G\times G$. This allows us to extend field theoretical constructions which depend on the existence of a diagonal subgroup to non-invertible symmetries. We give explicit calculations for theories with Rep$(S_3)\boxtimes$Rep$(S_3)$ symmetry, applying the results to gauging topological quantum field theories which carry this non-invertible symmetry. Along the way, we also discuss how Morita equivalence is implemented for algebras in symmetry categories.</description>

      <title>Optical Imaging of Flavor Order in Flat Band Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin and valley flavor polarization plays a central role in the many-body physics of flat band graphene, with fermi surface reconstructions often accompanied by quantized anomalous Hall and superconducting state observed in a variety of experimental systems. Here we describe an optical technique that sensitively and selectively detects flavor textures via the exciton response of a proximal transition metal dichalcogenide layer. Through a systematic study of rhombohedral and rotationally faulted graphene bilayers and trilayers, we show that when the semiconducting dichalcogenide is in direct contact with the graphene, the exciton response is most sensitive to the large momentum rearrangement of the Fermi surface, providing information that is distinct from and complementary to electrical compressibility measurements. The wide-field imaging capability of optical probes allows us to obtain spatial maps of flavor orders with high throughput, and with broad temperature and device compatibility. Our work paves the way for optical probing and imaging of flavor orders in flat band graphene systems.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum phase transitions driven by displacement fields in the twisted MoTe2 bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ systems at fractional fillings of the lowest hole band under applied out-of-plane displacement fields. By employing exact diagonalization in finite-size systems, we systematically map out the ground state quantum phase diagram for two filling fractions, $\nu=1/3$ and $2/3$, and provide a detailed characterization of each phase. We identify the phase transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a layer-polarized charge density wave (CDW) at a filling fraction of $\nu=1/3$, denoted as CDW-$1$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the competition between the displacement field and twist angle leads to another phase transition from a layer-polarized CDW-$1$ to a layer-hybridized CDW-$2$, identified as a first-order phase transition. Furthermore, at $\nu=2/3$ filling of the lowest hole band, we observe that the FCI remains stable against the displacement field until it approaches proximity to a transition in single-particle band topology at a smaller twist angle.</description>

      <title>Crossover between Anomalous Peak Effects Induced by Splayed and Tilted Columnar Defects in Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetic field dependence of the critical current density (Jc) in Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 with various configurations of columnar defects (CDs) introduced by 2.6 GeV U or 320 MeV Au irradiations. Splayed CDs are introduced by crossing CDs at a specific angle with respect to the c-axis, while tilted CDs are introduced by irradiating the sample from the direction tilted from the !-axis. We also prepared samples with asymmetric splayed CDs, which bridge the splayed CDs and the tilted CDs, by starting from the tilted CDs and adding CDs along the symmetric direction with respect to the !-axis. In all cases, non-monotonic magnetic field dependence of Jc, which we call anomalous peak effect, is observed at some fraction of the matching field when the magnetic field is applied along the specific direction depending on the configuration of CDs. We propose a model that explains the behavior of the anomalous peak effect in samples with different configuration of CDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides (cuprate) remains elusive, with the pseudogap phase considered a potential factor. Recent attention has focused on a long-range symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) order in the underdoped regime, induced by strong magnetic fields. Here by $^{63,65}$Cu-nuclear magnetic resonance, we report the discovery of a long-range CDW order in the optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_6$ superconductor, induced by in-plane strain exceeding $|$$\varepsilon$$|$ = 0.15 %, which deliberately breaks the crystal symmetry of the CuO$_2$ plane. We find that compressive/tensile strains reduce superconductivity but enhance CDW, leaving superconductivity to coexist with CDW. The findings show that a long-range CDW order is an underlying hidden order in the pseudogap state, not limited to the underdoped regime, becoming apparent under strain. Our result sheds light on the intertwining of various orders in the cuprates.</description>

Abstract: Adjusting chemical pressure through doping is a highly effective method for customizing the chemical and physical properties of materials, along with their respective phase diagrams, thereby uncovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we successfully synthesized Sr-doped Eu$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$AgP $(x = 0.0-0.6)$ and conducted a comprehensive investigation involving crystallography, magnetization, heat capacity, and magnetoresistance. Utilizing X-ray diffraction and PPMS DynaCool measurements, we studied Eu$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$AgP in detail. The hexagonal structure of parent EuAgP at room temperature, with the $P6_3/mmc$ space group, remains unaltered, while the lattice constants expand. The magnetic phase transition from paramagnetism to ferromagnetism, as temperature decreases, is suppressed through the gradual introduction of strontium doping. Heat capacity measurements reveal a shift from magnon-dominated to predominantly phonon and electron contributions near the ferromagnetic phase with increasing doping levels. The resistivity-temperature relationship displays distinct characteristics, emphasizing the impact of Sr doping on modifying charge transport. Magnetoresistance measurements uncover novel phenomena, illustrating the adjustability of magnetoresistance through Sr doping. Notably, Sr doping results in both positive magnetoresistance (up to 20\%) and negative magnetoresistance (approximately -60\%). The resistivity and magnetic phase diagram were established for the first time, revealing the pronounced feasibility of Sr doping in modulating EuAgP's resistivity. This study has provided valuable insights into the intricate interplay between structural modifications and diverse physical properties. The potential for technological advancements and the exploration of novel quantum states make Sr-doped Eu$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$AgP a compelling subject for continued research in the field of applied physics.</description>

      <title>On the superconducting gap structure of the miassite Rh17S15: Nodal or nodeless?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent penetration depth measurement claimed the observation of unconventional superconductivity in the miassite Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$ single crystals, evidenced by the linear-in-temperature penetration depth at low temperatures, thereby arguing for the presence of the lines of node in its superconducting gap structure. Here we measure the thermal conductivity of Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$ single crystals down to 110 mK and up to a field of 8 T ($\simeq 0.4H{\rm_{c2}}$). In marked contrast to the penetration depth measurement, we observe a negligible residual linear term $\kappa_0/T$ in zero field, in line with the nodeless gap structure. The field dependence of $\kappa_0(H)/T$ shows a profile that is more consistent with either a highly anisotropic gap structure or multiple nodeless gaps with significantly different magnitudes. Moreover, first-principles calculations give two electronic bands with complex shape of Fermi surfaces. These results suggest multigap nodeless superconductivity in this multiband Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$ superconductor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium Green's function gives access to one-body observables for quantum systems. Of particular interest are quantities such as density, currents, and absorption spectra which are important for interpreting experimental results in quantum transport and spectroscopy. We present an integration scheme for the Green's function's equations of motion, the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBE), which is both adaptive in the time integrator step size and method order as well as the history integration order. We analyze the importance of solving the KBE self-consistently and show that adapting the order of history integral evaluation is important for obtaining accurate results. To examine the efficiency of our method, we compare runtimes to a state of the art fixed time step integrator for several test systems and show an order of magnitude speedup at similar levels of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Performance of wave function and Green's functions based methods for non equilibrium many-body dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical descriptions of non equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems essentially employ either (i) explicit treatments, relying on truncation of the expansion of the many-body wave function, (ii) compressed representations of the many-body wave function, or (iii) evolution of an effective (downfolded) representation through Green's functions. In this work, we select representative cases of each of the methods and address how these complementary approaches capture the dynamics driven by intense field perturbations to non equilibrium states. Under strong driving, the systems are characterized by strong entanglement of the single particle density matrix and natural populations approaching those of a strongly interacting equilibrium system. We generate a representative set of results that are numerically exact and form a basis for critical comparison of the distinct families of methods. We demonstrate that the compressed formulation based on similarity transformed Hamiltonians (coupled cluster approach) is practically exact in weak fields and, hence, weakly or moderately correlated systems. Coupled cluster, however, struggles for strong driving fields, under which the system exhibits strongly correlated behavior, as measured by the von Neumann entropy of the single particle density matrix. The dynamics predicted by Green's functions in the (widely popular) GW approximation are less accurate by improve significantly upon the mean-field results in the strongly driven regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarons - fermionic charge carriers bearing a strong companion lattice deformation - exhibit a natural tendency for self-localization due to the recursive interaction between electrons and the lattice. While polarons are ubiquitous in insulators, how they evolve in transitions to metallic and superconducting states in quantum materials remains an open question. Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to track the electron-lattice coupling in the colossal magneto-resistive bi-layer manganite La$_{1.2}$Sr$_{1.8}$Mn$_2$O$_7$ across its metal-to-insulator transition. The response in the insulating high-temperature state features harmonic emissions of a dispersionless oxygen phonon at small energy transfer. Upon cooling into the metallic state, we observe a drastic redistribution of spectral weight from the region of these harmonic emissions to a broad high energy continuum. In concert with theoretical calculations, we show that this evolution implies a shift in electron-lattice coupling from static to dynamic lattice distortions that leads to a distinct polaronic ground state in the low temperature metallic phase - a dynamic polaron liquid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unprecedented phenomenon that a charge density wave (CDW) emerges inside the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase indicates an unusual CDW mechanism associated with magnetism in FeGe. Here, we demonstrate that both the CDW and magnetism of FeGe can be effectively tuned through post-growth annealing treatments. Instead of the short-range CDW reported earlier, a long-range CDW order is realized below 110 K in single crystals annealed at \SI{320}{\degreeCelsius} for over 48 h. The CDW and AFM transition temperatures appear to be inversely correlated with each other. The entrance of the CDW phase significantly reduces the critical field of the spin-flop transition, whereas the CDW transition remains stable against minor variations in magnetic orders such as annealing-induced magnetic clusters and spin-canting transitions. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements reveal substantial disorder on the Ge1 site, which is characterized by displacement of the Ge1 atom from Fe$_3$Ge layer along the $c$ axis and can be reversibly modified by the annealing process. The observed annealing-tunable CDW and magnetic orders can be well understood in terms of disorder on the Ge1 site. Our study provides a vital starting point for the exploration of the unconventional CDW mechanism in FeGe and of kagome materials in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study magnetic properties of CrO$_2$ within the density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) approach in the paramagnetic phase. We consider the 3-orbital (per Cr site) model, containing only $t_{2g}$ states, the $5$-orbital model, including all $d$-states, as well as the model including also the oxygen $p$-states. Using the recently proposed approach of calculation of exchange interactions in paramagnetic phase, we extract exchange interaction parameters and magnon dispersions for these models. While the magnon dispersion in the 3-orbital model possesses negative branches in accordance with previous studies in ferromagnetic phase, this drawback is removed in the $5$-orbital model. The model including oxygen states (with purely local interaction at chromium sites) overestimates the exchange interactions and spin wave stiffness. While this overestimate is partly corrected by including non-local interaction between chromium and oxygen states within mean-field approximation, the $5$-orbital model appears as most adequate for describing magnetic properties of CrO$_2$ with local Coulomb interaction. The possibility of describing magnetic properties of this material starting from paramagnetic phase points to the correspondence of magnetic properties in this phase and ferromagnetic phase and possible important contributions of RKKY exchange interactions in paramagnetic phase of CrO$_2$.</description>

Abstract: Perovskites with Bi or Pb on the A-site host a number of interesting and yet to be understood phenomena such as negative thermal expansion in BiNiO$_3$. We employ hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy of Ni 2$p$ core-level as well as valence band to probe the electronic structure of BiNiO$_3$ and PbNiO$_3$. The experimental results supported by theoretical calculations using dynamical mean-field theory reveal essentially identical electronic structure of the Ni-O subsystem typical of Ni$^{2+}$ charge-transfer insulators. The two materials are distinguished by filling of the Bi(Pb)-O antibonding states in the vicinity of the Fermi level, which is responsible for the Bi disproportionation in BiNiO$_3$ at ambient pressure and absence of similar behavior in PbNiO$_3$. The present experiments provide evidence for this conclusion by revealing the presence/absence of Bi/Pb $6s$ states at the top of the valence band in the two materials.</description>

      <title>Topological Solitons in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with periodic hopping modulation, domain walls and disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A chiral symmetric Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain features topological end states in one of its dimerized configurations. Those mid-gap zero energy states show interesting modifications upon a periodic tuning of the hopping modulations. Besides, more and more in-gap end modes appear at nonzero energies for further partitioning of the Brillouin zone (BZ) due to increased hopping periodicity. The new topological phases are identified with a detailed analysis of the topological invariants namely, winding number and Zak phases. The spectra and topology of these systems with periodically modulated hopping are studied also in the presence of a single static domain wall, separating two topologically inequivalent dimerized structures. The domain wall causes additional in-gap modes in the spectrum as well as zero energy domain wall solitonic states for specific hopping periodicities. We also study the effect of disorder, particularly the chirality breaking onsite ones, on the edge and domain wall states. Other than the SSH type we also consider random, Rice-Mele or AI type disorder to do a comparative analysis of the evolution of chirality and zero energy states as the strength of disorder and hopping periodicity is varied. Our findings can add important feedback in utilizing topological phases in various fields including quantum computations while the results can be easily verified in a cold atom set up within optical lattices.</description>

      <title>A new twist on the Majorana surface code: Bosonic and fermionic defects for fault-tolerant quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are promising candidates for topologically-protected quantum computing hardware, however their large-scale use will likely require quantum error correction. Majorana surface codes (MSCs) have been proposed to achieve this. However, many MSC properties remain unexplored. We present a unified framework for MSC "twist defects" $\unicode{x2013}$ anyon-like objects encoding quantum information. We show that twist defects in MSCs can encode twice the amount of topologically protected information as in qubit-based codes or other MSC encoding schemes. This is due to twists encoding both logical qubits and "logical MZMs," with the latter enhancing the protection microscopic MZMs can offer. We explain how to perform universal computation with logical qubits and logical MZMs while potentially using far fewer resources than in other MSC schemes. All Clifford gates can be implemented on logical qubits by braiding twist defects. We introduce lattice-surgery-based techniques for computing with logical MZMs and logical qubits, achieving the effect of Clifford gates with zero time overhead. We also show that logical MZMs may result in improved spatial overheads for sufficiently low rates of quasi-particle poisoning. Finally, we introduce a novel MSC analogue of transversal gates that achieves encoded Clifford gates in small codes by braiding microscopic MZMs. MSC twist defects thus open new paths towards fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Can Neural Quantum States Learn Volume-Law Ground States?"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11534</link>

Abstract: Passetti et al. [Physical Review Letters 131, 036502 (2023)] recently assessed the potential of neural quantum states (NQS) in learning ground-state wave functions with volume-law entanglement scaling. They focused on NQS using feedforward neural networks, specifically applied to the complex SYK Hamiltonian for fermions. Their numerical results hint at an exponential increase in the required variational parameters as the system size grows, apparently tied to the entanglement growth within the SYK ground state. This challenges the general utility of NQS for highly entangled wavefunctions, contrasting with established analytical and numerical findings. Based on our experiments, we show that suitably chosen NQS can learn ground states with volume-law entanglement both for spin and fermionic problems. We argue that the setup utilized in the aforementioned letter reveals the inefficiency of non-fermionic NQS to learn fermionic states, rather than a general connection between entanglement content and learnability hardness.</description>

      <title>Toward a classification of PT-symmetric quantum systems: From dissipative dynamics to topology and wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of many-body non-Hermitian parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems are attracting a lot of interest due to their relevance in research areas ranging from quantum optics and continuously monitored dynamics to Euclidean wormholes in quantum gravity and dissipative quantum chaos. While a symmetry classification of non-Hermitian systems leads to 38 universality classes, we show that, under certain conditions, PT-symmetric systems are grouped into 24 universality classes. We identify 14 of them in a coupled two-site Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and confirm the classification by spectral analysis using exact diagonalization techniques. Intriguingly, in 4 of these 14 universality classes, AIII$_\nu$, BDI$^\dagger_\nu$, BDI$_{++\nu}$, and CI$_{--\nu}$, we identify a basis in which the SYK Hamiltonian has a block structure in which some blocks are rectangular, with $\nu \in \mathbb{N}$ the difference between the number of rows and columns. We show analytically that this feature leads to the existence of $\nu$ robust purely \emph{real} eigenvalues, whose level statistics follow the predictions of Hermitian random matrix theory for classes A, AI, BDI, and CI, respectively. We have recently found that this $\nu$ is a topological invariant, so these classes are topological. By contrast, nontopological real eigenvalues display a crossover between Hermitian and non-Hermitian level statistics. Similarly to the case of Lindbladian dynamics, the reduction of universality classes leads to unexpected results, such as the absence of Kramers degeneracy in a given sector of the theory. Another novel feature of the classification scheme is that different sectors of the PT-symmetric Hamiltonian may have different symmetries.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and dynamics of coupled complex SYK models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known that the large-$q$ complex SYK model falls under the same universality class as that of van der Waals (mean-field) and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, both features shared by various black holes. This makes the SYK model a useful tool in probing the fundamental nature of quantum chaos and holographic duality. This work establishes the robustness of this shared universality class and chaotic properties for SYK-like models by extending to a system of coupled large-$q$ complex SYK models of different orders. We provide a detailed derivation of thermodynamic properties, specifically the critical exponents for an observed phase transition, as well as dynamical properties, in particular the Lyapunov exponent, via the out-of-time correlator calculations. Our analysis reveals that, despite the introduction of an additional scaling parameter through interaction strength ratios, the system undergoes a continuous phase transition at low temperatures, similar to that of the single SYK model. The critical exponents align with the Landau-Ginzburg (mean-field) universality class, shared with van der Waals gases and various AdS black holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the coupled SYK system remains maximally chaotic in the large-$q$ limit at low temperatures, adhering to the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, a feature consistent with the single SYK model. These findings establish robustness and open avenues for broader inquiries into the universality and chaos in complex quantum systems. We provide a detailed outlook for future work by considering the ``very" low-temperature regime, where we discuss relations with the Hawking-Page phase transition observed in the holographic dual black holes. We present preliminary calculations and discuss the possible follow-ups that might be be taken to make the connection robust.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf symmetry and tube algebra of the generalized multifusion string-net model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multifusion generalization of string-net ground states and lattice Hamiltonians, delving into its associated weak Hopf symmetry. For the multifusion string-net, the gauge symmetry manifests as a general weak Hopf algebra, leading to a reducible vacuum string label; the charge symmetry, serving as a quantum double of gauge symmetry, constitutes a connected weak Hopf algebra. This implies that the associated topological phase retains its characterization by a unitary modular tensor category (UMTC). The bulk charge symmetry can also be captured by a weak Hopf tube algebra. We offer an explicit construction of the weak Hopf tube algebra structure and thoroughly discuss its properties. The gapped boundary and domain wall models are extensively discussed, with these $1d$ phases characterized by unitary multifusion categories (UMFCs). We delve into the gauge and charge symmetries of these $1d$ phases, as well as the construction of the boundary and domain wall tube algebras. Additionally, we illustrate that the domain wall tube algebra can be regarded as a cross product of two boundary tube algebras. As an application of our model, we elucidate how to interpret the defective string-net as a restricted multifusion string-net.</description>
