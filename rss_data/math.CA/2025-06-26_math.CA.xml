      <title>Simplified Airy function Asymptotic expansions for Reverse Generalised Bessel Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniform asymptotic expansions are derived for reverse generalised Bessel polynomials of large degree $n$, real parameter $a$, and complex argument $z$, which are simpler than previously known results. The defining differential equation is analysed; for large $n$ and $\frac{3}{2} - n &lt; a &lt; \infty$, it possesses two turning points in the complex $z$ plane. Away from the turning points Liouville-Green expansions are obtained for the polynomials and two companion solutions of the differential equation, where asymptotic series appear in the exponent. Then representations involving Airy functions and two slowly-varying coefficient functions are constructed. Using the Liouville-Green representations, asymptotic expansions are obtained for the coefficient functions that involve coefficients that can be easily and explicitly computed recursively. In conjunction with a suitable re-expansion, or Cauchy's integral formula, near the turning point, the expansions are valid for $\frac{3}{2} - n &lt; a \leq \mathcal{O}(n)$, uniformly for all unbounded complex values of $z$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Boundary Layer Solutions to Poisson-Boltzmann Type Equations in General Bounded Smooth Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary layer solution to singular perturbation problems involving Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) type equations with a small parameter $\epsilon$ in general bounded smooth domains (including multiply connected domains) under the Robin boundary condition. The PB type equations include the classical PB, modified PB and charge-conserving PB (CCPB) equations, which are mathematical models for the electric potential and ion distributions. The CCPB equations present particular analytical challenges due to their nonlocal nonlinearity introduced through integral terms enforcing charge conservation. Using the principal coordinate system, exponential-type estimates and the moving plane agruments, we rigorously prove asymptotic expansions of boundary layer solutions throughout the whole domain. The solution domain is partitioned into three characteristic regions based on the distance from the boundary: Region I, where the distance from the boundary is at most $T\sqrt\epsilon$, Region II, where the distance ranges between $T\sqrt\epsilon$ and $\epsilon^\beta$, and Region III, where the distance is at least $\epsilon^\beta$, for given parameters $T&gt;0$ and $0&lt;\beta&lt;1/2$. In Region I, we derive second-order asymptotic formulas explicitly incorporating the effects of boundary mean curvature, while exponential decay estimates are established for Regions II and III. Furthermore, we obtain asymptotic expansions for key physical quantities, including the electric potential, electric field, total ionic charge density and total ionic charge, revealing how domain geometry regulates electrostatic interactions.</description>

      <title>Fourier restriction and well-approximable numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a deterministic construction to prove the optimality of the exponent in the Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seeger Fourier restriction theorem for dimension $d=1$ and parameter range $0 &lt; a,b \leq d$ and $b\leq 2a$. Previous constructions by Hambrook and {\L}aba \cite{HL2013} and Chen \cite{chen} required randomness and only covered the range $0 &lt; b \leq a \leq d=1$. We also resolve a question of Seeger \cite{seeger-private} about the Fourier restriction inequality on the sets of well-approximable numbers.</description>

      <title>A family of orthogonal functions on the unit circle and a new multilateral matrix inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Bailey's very-well-poised $_6\psi_6$ summation, we show that a specific sequence of well-poised bilateral basic hypergeometric $_3\psi_3$ series form a family of orthogonal functions on the unit circle. We further extract a bilateral matrix inverse from Dougall's ${}_2H_2$ summation which we use, in combination with the Pfaff--Saalsch\"utz summation, to derive a summation for a particular bilateral hypergeometric $_3H_3$ series. We finally provide multivariate extensions of the bilateral matrix inverse and the $_3H_3$ summation in the setting of hypergeometric series associated to the root system $A_r$.</description>

      <title>A novel and application-oriented inverse nodal problem for Sturm-Liouville operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a methodological framework for addressing a novel and application-oriented inverse nodal problem in Sturm-Liouville operators, having significant applications in seismic wave analysis and submarine underwater radar (sonar) detection. By utilizing a given finite set of nodal data, we propose an optimization framework to find the potential $\hat q$ that is most closely approximating a predefined target potential $q_0$. The inverse nodal optimization problem is reformulated as a solvability problem for a class of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, enabling systematic investigation of the inverse nodal problem. {As an example, when the constant target potential $q_0$ is considered, we find that the Schr\"odinger equations are completely integrable and conclude that the potential $\hat q$ is `periodic' in a certain sense. Furthermore, the reconstruction of $\hat q$ is reduced to solving a system of three featured parameters, thereby establishing an explicit quantitative relationship between $\|\hat q\|_{Lp}$ and $T_*$. Of importance, we prove the uniqueness of the potential $\hat q$ when $p&gt;3/2$. These new findings represent a substantial advancement in this field of study. Our methodology also bridges theoretical rigor with practical applicability, addressing scenarios where only partial nodal information is available.</description>
