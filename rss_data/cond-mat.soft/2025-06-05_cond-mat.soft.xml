      <title>polyBART: A Chemical Linguist for Polymer Property Prediction and Generative Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing polymers for targeted applications and accurately predicting their properties is a key challenge in materials science owing to the vast and complex polymer chemical space. While molecular language models have proven effective in solving analogous problems for molecular discovery, similar advancements for polymers are limited. To address this gap, we propose polyBART, a language model-driven polymer discovery capability that enables rapid and accurate exploration of the polymer design space. Central to our approach is Pseudo-polymer SELFIES (PSELFIES), a novel representation that allows for the transfer of molecular language models to the polymer space. polyBART is, to the best of our knowledge, the first language model capable of bidirectional translation between polymer structures and properties, achieving state-of-the-art results in property prediction and design of novel polymers for electrostatic energy storage. Further, polyBART is validated through a combination of both computational and laboratory experiments. We report what we believe is the first successful synthesis and validation of a polymer designed by a language model, predicted to exhibit high thermal degradation temperature and confirmed by our laboratory measurements. Our work presents a generalizable strategy for adapting molecular language models to the polymer space and introduces a polymer foundation model, advancing generative polymer design that may be adapted for a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Wound Closure in Living Nematic Epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically the closure of a wound in a layer of epithelial cells in a living tissue after damage. Our analysis is informed by our recent experiments observing re-epithelialisation in vivo of Drosophila pupae. On time and length-scales such that the evolution of the epithelial tissue near the wound is well captured by that of a 2D active fluid with local nematic order, we consider the free-surface problem of a hole in a bounded region of tissue, and study the role that active stresses far from the hole play in the closure of the hole. For parallel anchored nematic order at the wound boundary (as we observe in our experiments), we find that closure is accelerated when the active stresses are contractile and slowed down when the stresses are extensile. Parallel anchoring also leads to the appearance of topological defects which annihilate upon wound closure.</description>

      <title>Complexity reduction of physical models: an equation-free approach by means of scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of complex physical phenomena often involves sophisticated models that rely on a large number of parameters, with many dimensions and scales. One practical way to simplify that kind of models is to discard some of the parameters, or terms of underlying equations, thus giving rise to reduced models. Here, we propose a general approach to obtaining such reduced models. The method is independent of the model in use, i.e., equation-free, depends only on the interplay between the scales and dimensions involved in the description of the phenomena, and controls over-parametrization. It also quantifies conditions for asymptotic models by providing explicitly computable thresholds on values of parameters that allow for reducing complexity of a model, while preserving essential predictive properties. Although our focus is on complexity reduction, this approach may also help with calibration by mitigating the risks of over-parameterization and instability in parameter estimation. The benefits of this approach are discussed in the context of the classical projectile model.</description>

      <title>Chirality Amplification and Deracemization in Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystal mesophases of achiral molecules are normally achiral, yet in a few materials they spontaneously deracemize and form right- and left-handed chiral domains. One mechanism that drives deracemization is molecular shape fluctuations between axial chiral conformations, where molecular interactions favor matching chirality and promote helical twist. Cooperative chiral ordering may also play a role in chirality amplification, as when a tiny fraction of chiral dopant drives a nematic phase to become cholesteric. We present a model of cooperative chiral ordering in liquid crystals using Maier-Saupe theory, and predict a phase diagram with a deracemized cholesteric phase as well as racemic nematic and isotropic phases. Our model also predicts chirality amplification in the nematic phase, which may be observed even in materials where the deracemization transition is preempted by a transition to another phase. We compare these results with Monte Carlo simulation studies of the switchable chiral Lebwohl-Lasher model, where each spin switches between right- and left-handed chiral states. Simulation results validate the predicted phase diagram, demonstrate chiral amplification in the racemic nematic phase, and reveal coarsening dynamics in the deracemized phase. Our results suggest that cooperative chiral ordering via molecular shape transitions is a common mechanism in liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Modelling the evolution of flow-induced anisotropy of concentrated suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspensions, which exhibit complex behaviors such as shear thickening, thinning, and jamming, are prevalent in nature and industry. However, predicting the mechanical properties of concentrated suspensions, in both steady state and the transient regime, remains a significant challenge, impacting product quality and process efficiency. In this study, we focus on developing a robust theoretical framework to explain how flow history governs the anisotropy of mechanical responses in suspensions of hard particles under unsteady flow conditions. Our starting point is the Gillissen-Wilson constitutive model, which we confront to DEM simulation data of the micro-structure during steady shear, and shear rotations where the shear axis is rotated by a specific angle around the flow gradient direction. We introduce a simple modification to the Gillissen-Wilson model which leads to a model with higher predictive power in steady state and during shear rotations.</description>

      <title>Tuning Shear Rheology through Active Dopants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the shear rheology of mixtures of active and passive Brownian particles, with varying fractions of active components. We find that even a small fraction of active dopants triggers fluidization with comparable efficiency to fully active systems. A combined parameter, active energy, given by dopant fraction multiplied by propulsion speed squared controls the shear rheology and glass transition of the active-passive mixtures. These results together provide a quantitative strategy for fine-tuning the mechanical properties of a soft material with small amounts of active dopants.</description>

      <title>Phase separation in a mixture of proliferating and motile active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proliferation and motility are ubiquitous drivers of activity in biological systems. Here, we study a dense binary mixture of motile and proliferating particles with exclusively repulsive interactions, where homeostasis in the proliferating subpopulation is maintained by pressure-induced removal. Using computer simulations, we show that phase separation emerges naturally in this system at high density and weak enough self-propulsion. We show that condensation is caused by interactions between motile particles induced by the growing phase, and recapitulate this behavior in an effective model of only motile particles with attractive interactions. Our results establish a new type of phase transition and pave a way to reinterpret the physics of dense cellular populations, such as bacterial colonies or tumors, as systems of mixed active matter.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous response and non-Markovianity in the microrheology of semisolid viscoelastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works indicate that heterogeneous response and non-Markovianity may yield recognizable hallmarks in the microrheology of semisolid viscoelastic materials. Here we perform numerical simulations using a non-Markovian overdamped Langevin approach to explore how the microrheology experienced by probe particles immersed in an effective semisolid material can be influenced by its micro-heterogeneities. Our results show that, besides affecting the mean squared displacement, the time-dependent diffusion coefficient, and the shear moduli, the micro-heterogeneities lead to displacement distributions that deviate from the usual Gaussian behavior. In addition, our study provides an analytical way to characterize the micro-heterogeneities of semisolid viscoelastic materials through their microrheology.</description>

      <title>Sedimentation of particulate suspensions under stagnant conditions in horizontal pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sedimentation of particulate suspensions in horizontal pipes can lead to formation, growth and consolidation of a solid-like bed which can severely retard pipeline performance. As stagnant flow conditions frequently arise during industrial processes, critical operational questions are: (i) at what rate and extent does sedimentation proceed, and (ii) can the sedimentation dynamics be predicted from conventional suspension characterisation methods? We address these questions by characterising the sedimentation properties of an aqueous Kaolin suspension via batch settling tests and comparing predictions from 1D sedimentation theory with experiments in a horizontally oriented cylindrical pipe. We show that particulate sedimentation can be accurately predicted, indicating that the estimated sedimentation properties are representative material properties, and that transient effects such as gravity currents are not significant. Conversely, we find that the consolidation of the sediment is not well predicted by 1D theory, suggesting that the stress state is not 1D and likely involves contributions from the pipe walls. These stagnant cylindrical pipe results provide a basis for the development of methods to predict pipeline sedimentation under more general (laminar and turbulent) flow conditions.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Ostwald ripening by chemical activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation of biomolecular condensates is ubiquitous in living cells, promoting colocalization of enzymes and their substrates as well as achieving membrane-free compartmentalization. Energy-consuming processes are routinely used to regulate biocondensate growth by opposing the thermodynamic tendency toward coarsening. At the same time, cells often use energy to instead accelerate thermodynamic processes. Here, we theoretically explore the possibility of utilizing chemical reactions to accelerate biocondensate coarsening. We combine Lifshitz-Slyozov theory with a reaction-diffusion approach, wherein particles interconvert between phase-separating and inert forms. We find that mass conservation restricts the volume growth to be linear in time (as in the passive case) despite activity, though if reactions are restricted to occur only outside droplets, the rate of Ostwald ripening can be increased by an arbitrarily large factor. Our acceleration theory is quantitatively supported by recent experiments on ripening in the presence of fueled interconversion reactions, under precisely the predicted conditions. We posit that the ability to induce rapid biocondensate coarsening can be advantageous in synthetic-biological contexts as a regulator of metabolic channeling.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian process approach for rapid evaluation of skin tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skin tension plays a pivotal role in clinical settings, it affects scarring, wound healing and skin necrosis. Despite its importance, there is no widely accepted method for assessing in vivo skin tension or its natural pre-stretch. This study aims to utilise modern machine learning (ML) methods to develop a model that uses non-invasive measurements of surface wave speed to predict clinically useful skin properties such as stress and natural pre-stretch. A large dataset consisting of simulated wave propagation experiments was created using a simplified two-dimensional finite element (FE) model. Using this dataset, a sensitivity analysis was performed, highlighting the effect of the material parameters and material model on the Rayleigh and supersonic shear wave speeds. Then, a Gaussian process regression model was trained to solve the ill-posed inverse problem of predicting stress and pre-stretch of skin using measurements of surface wave speed. This model had good predictive performance (R2 = 0.9570) and it was possible to interpolate simplified parametric equations to calculate the stress and pre-stretch. To demonstrate that wave speed measurements could be obtained cheaply and easily, a simple experiment was devised to obtain wave speed measurements from synthetic skin at different values of pre-stretch. These experimental wave speeds agree well with the FE simulations and a model trained solely on the FE data provided accurate predictions of synthetic skin stiffness. Both the simulated and experimental results provide further evidence that elastic wave measurements coupled with ML models are a viable non-invasive method to determine in vivo skin tension.</description>

      <title>One-way catalysis in a solvable lattice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Catalysts speed up chemical reactions with no energy input and without being transformed in the process, therefore leaving equilibrium constants unchanged. Some catalysts, however, are much more efficient at accelerating one direction of a reaction. Is it possible for catalysis to be strictly unidirectional, accelerating only one direction of a reaction? Can we observe directional catalysis by analyzing the microscopic trajectory of a single reactant undergoing conversions between a substrate and a product state? We use the framework of a simple but exactly solvable lattice model to study these questions. The model provides examples of strictly one-way catalysts and illustrates a mathematical relationship between the asymmetric transition rates that underlie directional catalysis and the symmetric transition fluxes that underlie chemical equilibrium. The degree of directionality generally depends on the catalytic mechanism and we compare different mechanisms to show how they can obey different scaling laws.</description>
