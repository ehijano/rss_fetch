      <title>Evolution of Coordination Through Institutional Incentives: An Evolutionary Game Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a broad recognition that commitment-based mechanisms can promote coordination and cooperative behaviours in both biological populations and self-organised multi-agent systems by making individuals' intentions explicit prior to engagement. Yet their effectiveness depends on sustained compliance supported by institutions, especially in one-off interactions. Despite advances in quantitative studies of cooperation and commitment, most applied analyses and policy debates remain largely qualitative, with limited attention to the allocation of scarce institutional resources between enhancing participation and ensuring commitment compliance. Herein, we develop an evolutionary game-theoretic model that explicitly examines the strategic distribution of a limited budget for institutional incentives, namely rewards or punishments, aimed at these two critical objectives within pre-commitment frameworks. Our findings reveal that a reward-based incentive approach consistently yields greater coordination success than a punishment-based approach, with optimal outcomes arising when resources are appropriately distributed between participation promotion and compliance assurance. These findings offer novel insights for designing institutional incentives to promote broad, coordinated adoption of new technologies.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Budget-Feasible Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In budget-feasible mechanism design, a buyer wishes to procure a set of items of maximum value from self-interested players. We have a valuation function $v:2^U \to \mathbb{R}_+$, where $U$ is the set of all items, where $v(S)$ specifies the value obtained from set $S$ of items. The entirety of current work on budget-feasible mechanisms has focused on the single-dimensional setting, wherein each player holds a single item $e$ and incurs a private cost $c_e$ for supplying item $e$.
  We introduce multidimensional budget feasible mechanism design: the universe $U$ is now partitioned into item-sets $\{G_i\}$ held by the different players, and each player $i$ incurs a private cost $c_i(S_i)$ for supplying the set $S_i\subseteq G_i$ of items. A budget-feasible mechanism is a mechanism that is truthful, and where the total payment made to the players is at most some given budget $B$. The goal is to devise a budget-feasible mechanism that procures a set of items of large value. We obtain the first approximation guarantees for multidimensional budget feasible mechanism design.
  Our contributions are threefold. First, we prove an impossibility result showing that the standard benchmark used in single-dimensional budget-feasible mechanism design, namely the algorithmic optimum is inadequate in that no budget-feasible mechanism can achieve good approximation relative to this. We identify that the chief underlying issue here is that there could be a monopolist which prevents a budget-feasible mechanism from obtaining good guarantees. Second, we devise an alternate benchmark, $OPT_{Bench}$, that allows for meaningful approximation guarantees, thereby yielding a metric for comparing mechanisms. Third, we devise budget-feasible mechanisms that achieve constant-factor approximation guarantees with respect to this benchmark for XOS valuations.</description>

      <title>CyGym: A Simulation-Based Game-Theoretic Analysis Framework for Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel cybersecurity encounter simulator between a network defender and an attacker designed to facilitate game-theoretic modeling and analysis while maintaining many significant features of real cyber defense. Our simulator, built within the OpenAI Gym framework, incorporates realistic network topologies, vulnerabilities, exploits (including-zero-days), and defensive mechanisms. Additionally, we provide a formal simulation-based game-theoretic model of cyberdefense using this simulator, which features a novel approach to modeling zero-days exploits, and a PSRO-style approach for approximately computing equilibria in this game. We use our simulator and associated game-theoretic framework to analyze the Volt Typhoon advanced persistent threat (APT). Volt Typhoon represents a sophisticated cyber attack strategy employed by state-sponsored actors, characterized by stealthy, prolonged infiltration and exploitation of network vulnerabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of game-theoretic strategies in understanding network resilience against APTs and zero-days, such as Volt Typhoon, providing valuable insight into optimal defensive posture and proactive threat mitigation.</description>
