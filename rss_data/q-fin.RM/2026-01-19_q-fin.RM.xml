      <title>Regime-Dependent Predictive Structure Between Equity Factors: Evidence from Granger Causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We document regime-dependent predictive structure between equity factors using 35 years of Fama-French data (1990-2024). We find that Value (HML) Granger-causes Size (SMB) during crisis regimes (p &lt; 1e-4, 9-day lag) but not during normal conditions, validating across 5 of 6 historical stress events (2008, 2011, 2015, 2018, 2020). Regimes are identified via a Student-t HMM, which detects moderate crises such as 2011 (69%) that Gaussian models miss entirely (0%). Although the relationship does not yield trading profits, the 9-day lead time may support risk management decisions. We note that Granger causality implies temporal precedence, not structural causality, and that common drivers could explain the pattern; our economic interpretation is a hypothesis rather than a verified mechanism.</description>

      <title>Event-Driven Market Co-Movement Dynamics in Critical Mineral Equities: An Empirical Framework Using Change Point Detection and Cross-Sectional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines market behavior in critical mineral investments using a novel analytical framework that combines change-point detection (PELT algorithm) with cross-sectional analysis. This research analyzes ESG-ranked critical mineral ETFs from March 31, 2014, to April 19, 2024, using the S&amp;P 500 as a benchmark to evaluate market co-movements. The findings demonstrate that different critical mineral investments experienced change points at distinct times, but three major dates, July 23, 2015; March 17, 2020; and December 1, 2020, were common and aligned with global events such as the oil market shock, the COVID-19 pandemic, and later market adjustments. Herding behavior among investors increased after these shocks, following the 2015 and 2020 crises, but shifted to anti-herding after positive vaccine news in late 2020 and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The sensitivity analysis shows that investor coordination is strongest during market downturns but exhibits greater variation during stable periods or after major developments, with these dynamics sensitive to the length of the observation period. Additionally, anti-herding became more apparent during crises, suggesting investors reacted to specific risks rather than moving in lockstep, especially in response to geopolitical shocks.</description>

      <title>FSL-BDP: Federated Survival Learning with Bayesian Differential Privacy for Credit Risk Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit risk models are a critical decision-support tool for financial institutions, yet tightening data-protection rules (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) increasingly prohibit cross-border sharing of borrower data, even as these models benefit from cross-institution learning. Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\% vs +1.4\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks. These findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments.</description>

      <title>Fast Times, Slow Times: Timescale Separation in Financial Timeseries Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial time series exhibit multiscale behavior, with interaction between multiple processes operating on different timescales. This paper introduces a method for separating these processes using variance and tail stationarity criteria, framed as generalized eigenvalue problems. The approach allows for the identification of slow and fast components in asset returns and prices, with applications to parameter drift, mean reversion, and tail risk management. Empirical examples using currencies, equity ETFs and treasury yields illustrate the practical utility of the method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Abatement Schedules for Excess Carbon Emissions Towards a Net-Zero Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving net-zero carbon emissions requires a transformation of energy systems, industrial processes, and consumption patterns. In particular, a transition towards that goal involves a gradual reduction of excess carbon emissions that are not essential for the well-functioning of society. In this paper we study this problem from a stochastic control perspective to identify the optimal gradual reduction of the emission rate, when an allocated excess carbon budget is used up over time. Assuming that updates of the available carbon budget follow a diffusion process, we identify the emission strategy that maximizes expected discounted emissions under the constraint of a non-increasing emission rate, with an additional term rewarding the amount of time for which the budget is not yet depleted. We establish a link of this topic to optimal dividend problems in insurance risk theory under ratcheting constraints and show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We provide numerical illustrations of the resulting optimal abatement schedule of emissions and a quantitative evaluation of the effect of the non-increasing rate constraint on the value function.</description>
