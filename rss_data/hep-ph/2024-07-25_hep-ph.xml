      <title>Quantum coherence in neutrino spin-flavor oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence, which represents the superposition of orthogonal states, is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and can also be precisely defined within quantum resource theory. Thus exploring quantum coherence in neutrino oscillations can not only help in examining the intrinsic quantum nature but can also explore their potential applications in quantum information technologies. Previous studies on quantum coherence have focused on neutrino flavor oscillations (FO). However, FO imply that neutrinos have mass and this can lead to the generation of a tiny but finite magnetic dipole moment of neutrinos through quantum loop diagrams at higher orders of perturbative expansion of the interaction. This electromagnetic property of neutrinos can induce spin flavor oscillations (SFO) in the presence of an external magnetic field and hence is expected to enrich the study of coherence. In this work, we investigate quantum coherence in neutrino SFO with three flavor mixing within the interstellar as well as intergalactic magnetic fields, quantified by the $l_1$ norm and the relative entropy of coherence, and express these measures in terms of neutrino SFO probabilities. For FO, coherence measures can sustain higher values (say, within 50% of the maximum) over distances of several kilometers, which are relevant for terrestrial experiments like reactor and accelerator neutrinos. However, for SFO, we find that the coherence scale can extend to astrophysical distances, spanning from kiloparsecs to gigaparsecs.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis via Bubble Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel realization of leptogenesis from the decays of sterile (right-handed) neutrinos (RHNs) produced from runaway bubble collisions at a first order phase transition. Such configurations can produce heavy RHNs with mass many orders of magnitude above the scale of symmetry breaking as well as the temperature of the plasma, thereby enabling high scale leptogenesis without the need for high reheat temperatures while also naturally suppressing washout effects. This mechanism also extends the window of viability to RHN masses $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, the natural scale for type-I seesaw with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ couplings, where standard thermal leptogenesis cannot produce the observed baryon asymmetry. The corresponding phase transitions are at scales $\gtrsim\!10^9$ GeV and produce gravitational wave signals that could be detected by future experiments.</description>

      <title>Yukawa contributions to the $\nu$SMEFT Renormalization Group Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the Standard Model Effective Field Theory extended with right-handed neutrinos, the $\nu$SMEFT, and calculate the one-loop anomalous dimensions that are proportional to Yukawa couplings. These contributions are particularly relevant when symmetry-protected low scale seesaw models are embeded in the SMEFT, since large neutrino Yukawa couplings are expected. By combining our results with the already available gauge anomalous dimensions, we provide the complete set of one-loop renormalization group evolution equations for the dimension six $\nu$SMEFT. As a possible phenomenological implication of our results, we discuss the sensitivity of lepton flavor-violating observables to $\nu$SMEFT operators, focusing on the more sensitive $\mu\to e$ transitions.</description>

      <title>The Observation of a 95 GeV Scalar at Future Electron-Positron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Electron Positron collider observed an indication for a new Higgs boson with a mass around $95$ GeV-$100$ GeV in 2003. The interest in this excess re-emerged with di-photon ($\approx$95 GeV), $WW$ and $\tau\tau$ signatures obtained by the Large Hadron Collider, leading to a combined global significance of $3.8\sigma$. We perform a feasibility study for discovering such a new scalar at future electron-positron colliders using the recoil-mass method applied to $e^{+} e^{-} \to ZS$ with $Z \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ and $S \to b \bar{b}$. We employ a Deep Neural Network to enhance the separation between the Standard Model background and the signal, reducing the required integrated luminosity for a discovery by a factor of two to three. As a result, a $SU(2)_L$ singlet Higgs can be observed at a 250 GeV centre-of-mass energy collider and $5~{\rm ab}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity if it has a mixing angle of at least $0.2$ with the Standard Model Higgs. This further strengthens the physics case for future $e^+e^-$ accelerators, like CEPC, CLIC, FCC-ee and ILC.</description>

      <title>Spinodal decomposition in rapidly expanding quark gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is expected to have a first order phase transition between the confined hadron gas and the deconfined quark gluon plasma at high baryon densities. This will result in phase boundary effects in the metastable and unstable regions. It is important to include these effects in phenomenological models of heavy ion collisions to identify experimental signatures of a phase transition. This requires building intuition on phase separation in rapidly expanding fluids. In this work we present the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics with a phase boundary, provide prescriptions to extend the equation of state to metastable and unstable regions, and show the effects of spinodal separation in a Bjorken flow.</description>

      <title>Evolution of coupled scalar perturbations through smooth reheating. I. Dissipative regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the inflaton is a heavy scalar field, it may equilibrate slower than some other degrees of freedom, e.g. non-Abelian gauge bosons. In this case, perturbations in the inflaton field and in a thermal plasma coexist from a given moment onwards. We derive a gauge-invariant set of three coupled equations governing the time evolution of such a system. Despite singular coefficients, a reliable numerical solution can be obtained for a long time period, starting from phase oscillations inside the Hubble horizon, and extending until acoustic oscillations in a radiation-dominated universe. Benchmarks are illustrated from a ``weak regime'', where perturbations have a quantum-mechanical origin but get dissipated by interactions with the plasma. Among applications of our formalism could be inhomogeneity-induced nucleations in post-inflationary phase transitions, and the production of scalar-induced gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Phase Conventions in Hadron Physics from the Perspective of the Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convenient and consistent phase convention is important in the construction of the hadronic Lagrangian. However, the importance of phase convention has been overlooked for a long time and the sources of different conventions are never explicitly addressed. This obscure situation can cause mistakes and misinterpretations in hadron physics. In this paper, we systematically analyze and compare the flavor $SU_3$ phase conventions from the perspective of the quark model. All sources which could lead to different conventions are pointed out and carefully studied. With the tool of the quark model, we also clarify some misconceptions and demonstrate a consistent way to incorporate different conventions.</description>

      <title>The case for adopting the sequential Jacobi's diagonalization algorithm in neutrino oscillation physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino flavor oscillations and conversion in the presence of an interacting background may offer the missing evidence for charge-parity violation in the leptonic sector of the Standard Model, as well as yet undiscovered new interactions. The usual approach for simulating these effects is by numerically integrating the Schrodinger equation over the neutrino trajectory, arriving at the conversion and survival probabilities for each flavor. From these, the neutrino mixing matrix and its parameters are recovered. This work makes the case for a different numerical approach, which starts by recognizing how Jacobi's diagonalization algorithm is the most suitable for neutrino oscillations in general. By switching from physical space to a parameter space of choice, Jacobi's algorithm results in both eigenvalues and eigenvectors simultaneously, with only local round-off errors. This approach is trivially parallelizable, making it a suitable choice for concurrent computation. Moreover, the freedom to build a parameter space allows for quasi-model-independent solutions, which in turn eliminates the necessity of repeating the simulation for every change in the model's parameters. Benchmarks and efficiency analyses are discussed, as well as a concrete neutrino oscillation example.</description>

      <title>Multi-Field Effects on Scalar Production in Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the dynamics of scalar particle production, focusing on the presence of multiple fields and couplings in the medium. The interplay of various fields and couplings can influence the production rate, potentially overshadowing the effect of electrons alone. The plasma mixing, which induces the resonance and screening of scalar processes, is shown to be modified by the in-medium effects depending on the type of processes and field contents. Incorporating these in-medium effects into the analysis of stellar cooling via scalar emission allows for the emergence of various features of multi-field effects given in several types of scalar models.</description>

      <title>Exploring new physics with DUNE high energy flux: the case of Lorentz Invariance Violation, Large Extra Dimensions and Long Range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DUNE is a next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. It is expected to measure with an unprecedent precision the atmospheric oscillation parameters, including the CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$. Moreover, several studies have suggested that its unique features should allow DUNE to probe several new physics scenarios. In this work, we explore the performances of the DUNE far detector in constraining new physics if a high-energy neutrino flux is employed (HE-DUNE). We take into account three different scenarios: Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV), Long Range Forces (LRF) and Large Extra Dimensions (LED). Our results show that HE-DUNE should be able to set bounds competitive to the current ones and, in particular, it can outperform the standard DUNE capabilities in constraining CPT-even LIV parameters and the compactification radius $R_{ED}$ of the LED model.</description>

      <title>Three-loop contributions to $b\to s\gamma$ associated with the current-current operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, we calculated all three-loop diagrams contributing to the decay amplitude for $b \to s \gamma$ where none of the gluons touch the $b$-leg. In the present paper, we complete the calculation by working out all remaining three-loop diagrams (of order $\alpha_s^2$) associated with the current-current operators $O_1$ and $O_2$ at the physical value of the charm-quark mass $m_c$. Using the programs AMFlow and DiffExp to solve the differential equations for the master integrals, we obtained precise numerical results at 23 values for $z=m_c^2/m_b^2$, ranging from $z=1/1000$ to $z=1/5$, along with asymptotic expansions around $z=0$. For certain diagrams, the asymptotic expansion breaks down in the physical $z$-range, necessitating a Taylor expansion (which we do around $z=1/10$). In all expansions, we retained power terms up to $z^{20}$ and included the accompanying $\log(z)$ terms to all powers for asymptotic expansions. Numerical results for the sum of all diagrams (including those calculated in the previous paper) are presented in tabular form, while the mentioned expansions of individual diagram classes are provided electronically. We note that our results for the asymptotic expansions around $z=0$ are in good agreement with those recently published by Fael et al. and Czaja et al..</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate high and low energy implications of a gauge dual description of the Standard Model. The high energy electric theory features gauge dynamics involving only fermionic matter fields, while the low energy magnetic description features a quasi-supersymmetric spectrum testable at colliders. The flavour theory is constructed via operators generated at the Planck scale. We further show that duality opens novel avenues for theories of grand unification.</description>

      <title>$\tau$-lepton pair spin in proton-proton LHC collisions for anomalous dipole moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin correlations in the pair of $\tau$ leptons produced in the high-energy proton-proton collisions are studied. The invariant mass of the $\tau$-lepton pair is chosen close to $Z$-boson mass, in these conditions $Z$-boson exchange gives the dominant contribution to the Drell-Yan mechanism. The interaction of $Z$ boson with $\tau$ lepton, in addition to the Standard Model couplings, can include weak anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments (or form-factors) of the $\tau$ lepton. Dependence of elements of the $pp$ spin-correlation matrix on the weak anomalous moments is determined for various regions of the rapidity of the $\tau$-lepton pair. Based on this calculation, we construct a semi-realistic observable built on the momenta of pions in the $\tau^\mp \to \pi^\mp \nu_\tau$ and $\tau^\pm \to \rho^\pm \nu_\tau \to \pi^\pm \pi^0 \nu_\tau$ decay channels, and show that this observable can be sensitive to the weak anomalous dipole moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay behavior of an exotic state can be used to probe its internal structure. We note that the hidden-charm pentaquark states, $P_{\psi}^{N}(4312)$, $P_{\psi}^{N}(4440)$, and $P_{\psi}^{N}(4457)$, have only been observed in the $J/\psi p$ channel. In this work, we employ the effective Lagrangian approach to systematically investigate the two-body and three-body decays of the heavy quark spin symmetry multiplet of hadronic molecules $\bar{D}^{(*)}\Sigma_c^{(*)}$. Our results show that the partial decay widths of the hidden-charm pentaquark molecules into $\bar{D}^{(*)}\Lambda_c \pi$ are sizable so that $\bar{D}^{(*)}\Lambda_c \pi$ are promising channels to search for them, which can help clarify their molecular nature.</description>

      <title>Far-from-equilibrium attractors in kinetic theory for a mixture of quark and gluon fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exactly solve a Boltzmann equation that describes the dynamics of coupled massless quark and gluon fluids undergoing transversally homogeneous longitudinal boost-invariant expansion. We include a fugacity parameter that allows quarks to be out of chemical equilibrium and we account for the different collision rates of quarks and gluons, which are related by Casimir scaling. Based on these assumptions, we numerically determine the evolution of a large set of moments of the quark and gluon distribution functions and reconstruct their entire distribution functions. We find that both late and early-time attractors exist for all moments of the distribution functions containing more than one power of the squared longitudinal momentum. These attractors emerge long before the system reaches the regime where hydrodynamic approximations apply. In addition, we discuss how the shear viscous corrections and entropy density of the fluid mixture evolve and consider the properties of their respective attractors. Finally, the entropy production is also investigated for different initial values of momentum anisotropy and quark abundance.</description>

      <title>A soft-hard framework with exact four momentum conservation for small systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new framework, called x-scape, for the combined study of both hard and soft transverse momentum sectors in high energy proton-proton ($p$-$p$) and proton-nucleus ($p$-$A$) collisions is set up. A dynamical initial state is set up using the 3d-Glauber model with transverse locations of hotspots within each incoming nucleon. A hard scattering that emanates from two colliding hotspots is carried out using the Pythia generator. Initial state radiation from the incoming hard partons is carried out in a new module called I-matter, which includes the longitudinal location of initial splits. The energy-momentum of both the initial hard partons and their associated beam remnants is removed from the hot spots, depleting the energy-momentum available for the formation of the bulk medium. Outgoing showers are simulated using the matter generator, and results are presented for both cases, allowing for and not allowing for energy loss. First comparisons between this hard-soft model and single inclusive hadron and jet data from $p$-$p$ and minimum bias $p$-$Pb$ collisions are presented. Single hadron spectra in $p$-$p$ are used to carry out a limited (in number of parameters) Bayesian calibration of the model. Fair comparisons with data are indicative of the utility of this new framework. Theoretical studies of the correlation between jet $p_T$ and event activity at mid and forward rapidity are carried out.</description>

      <title>Chiral-even twist-3 GPDs for the proton in a spectator diquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the chiral-even twist-3 generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of valence quarks in the proton at nonzero skewness $\xi$, using a spectator model with scalar and axial-vector diquarks. We consider the exponential form factor for the nucleon-quark-diquark vertex and the axial-vector diquark with light-cone transverse polarization. We analyze the dependence of GPDs on the longitudinal momentum fraction $x$ at different $\xi$, and on the square of the transverse momentum transfer $\Delta^2_T$ at different $x$. Our numerical results reveal distinct discontinuities in all twist-3 GPDs except $G_1$ and $\tilde{G}_1$. By taking the forward limit, we obtain the twist-3 parton distribution function $g_T$, which encodes the transverse spin distribution of quarks. We also compare the kinetic orbital angular momentum and the spin-orbit correlations of quarks defined by the twist-2 and twist-3 GPDs, respectively.</description>

      <title>The stellar distribution in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies suggests deviations from the collision-less cold dark matter paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the nature of dark matter (DM) stands as a primary objective in modern physics. Here we present evidence suggesting deviations from the collisionless Cold DM (CDM) paradigm. It arises from the radial distribution of stars in six Ultra Faint Dwarf (UFD) galaxies measured with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). After a trivial renormalization in size and central density, the six UFDs show the same stellar distribution, which happens to have a central plateau or core. Assuming spherical symmetry and isotropic velocities, the Eddington inversion method proves the observed distribution to be inconsistent with potentials characteristic of CDM particles. Under such assumptions, the observed innermost slope of the stellar profile discards the UFDs to reside in a CDM potential at a &gt; 97% confidence level. The extremely low stellar mass of these galaxies, 10**3-10**4 Msun , prevents stellar feedback from modifying the shape of a CDM potential. Other conceivable explanations for the observed cores, like deviations from spherical symmetry and isotropy, tidal forces, and the exact form of the used CDM potential, are disfavored by simulations and/or observations. Thus, the evidence suggests that collisions among DM particles or other alternatives to CDM are likely shaping these galaxies. Many of these alternatives produce cored gravitational potentials, shown here to be consistent with the observed stellar distribution.</description>

      <title>SU(3) Gauge Symmetry: An Experimental Review of Diffractive Physics in e+p, p+p, p+A, and A+A Collision Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review focuses on diffractive physics, which involves the long-range interactions of the strong nuclear force at high energies described by SU(3) gauge symmetry. It is expected that diffractive processes account for nearly 40% of the total cross-section at LHC energies. These processes consist of soft-scale physics where perturbation theory cannot be applied. Although highly successful and often described as a perfect theory, quantum chromodynamics relies heavily on perturbation theory, a model best suited for hard-scale physics. The study of pomerons could help bridge the soft and hard processes and provide a complete description of the theory of the strong interaction across the full momentum spectrum. Here, we will discuss some of the features of diffractive physics, experimental results from SPS, HERA, and the LHC, and where the field could potentially lead. With the recent publication of the odderon discovery in 2021 by the D0 and TOTEM collaborations and the new horizon of physics that lies ahead with the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, interest is seemingly piquing in high energy diffractive physics.</description>

      <title>The mass effect -- Variations of masses and their impact on cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize and explain the current status of variations of fundamental masses in cosmology, with a particular focus on variations of the electron mass. We show that electron mass variations not only allow for significant easing of the Hubble tension but are also preferred at a decent level of significance using the latest DESI data (between $2\sigma$ and $3.6\sigma$ depending on the model and the data). This extreme success of the model is neither tightly constrained from light element abundances generated during big bang nucleosynthesis nor from post-recombination observations using quasars and atomic clocks, though future data is expected to give strong evidence in favor of or against this model. Models of baryon mass variations, on the other hand, are shown to generally not be cosmologically interesting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) is a mission concept proposed to detect gamma-ray photons through both the Compton scattering and electron-positron pair production mechanisms, enabling the detection of photons with energies ranging from MeV to TeV. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive survey of the gamma-ray sky from a low Earth orbit using an anti-coincidence detector, a tracker detector that also serves as a low energy calorimeter, and a high energy imaging calorimeter. We developed a Monte Carlo simulation application of the detector with the GEANT4 toolkit to evaluate the instrument performance including the effective area, angular resolution and energy resolution, as well as explored specific optimizations of the detector configuration. Our simulation-based analysis indicates that the VLAST's current design is physically feasible, with an acceptance larger than 10~$\rm m^2\ sr$ which is four times larger than Fermi-LAT, an energy resolution better than 2\% at 10~GeV, and an angular resolution better than 0.2 degrees at 10~GeV. The VLAST project is expected to make significant contribution to the field of gamma-ray astronomy and to enhance our understanding of the cosmos.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from black hole emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using adiabatic point-particle black hole perturbation theory, we simulate plausible gravitational wave~(GW) signatures in two exotic scenarios (i) where a small black hole is emitted by a larger one ('black hole emission') and (ii) where a small black hole is emitted by a larger one and subsequently absorbed back ('black hole absorption'). While such scenarios are forbidden in general relativity!(GR), alternative theories (such as certain quantum gravity scenarios obeying the weak gravity conjecture, white holes, and Hawking radiation) may allow them. By leveraging the phenomenology of black hole emission and absorption signals, we introduce straightforward modifications to existing gravitational waveform models to mimic gravitational radiation associated with these exotic events. We anticipate that these (incomplete but) initial simulations, coupled with the adjusted waveform models, will aid in the development of null tests for GR using GWs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we review in detail different mechanisms of generation of large primordial fluctuations and their implications for the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced secondary gravity waves (SIGW), with the ultimate aim of understanding the impact of loop correction on quantum correlations and the power spectrum. To accomplish the goal, we provide a concise, comprehensive, but in depth review of conceptual and technical details of the standard model of the universe, namely, causal structure and inflation, quantization of primordial perturbations and field theoretic techniques such as "in-in" formalism needed for the estimation of loop correction to the power spectrum. We discuss at length the severe constraints (no-go) on PBH production in single-field inflation imposed by appropriately renormalized quantum loop corrections, computed while maintaining the validity of the perturbation framework and assuming sufficient inflation to address the causality problem. Thereafter, we discuss in detail the efforts to circumvent the no-go result in Galileon inflation, multiple sharp transition (MST)-induced inflation, and stochastic single field inflation using an effective field theoretic (EFT) framework applicable to a variety of models. We provide a thorough analysis of the Dynamical Renormalization Group (DRG) resummation approach, adiabatic and late-time renormalization schemes, and their use in producing solar and sub-solar mass PBHs. Additionally, we give a summary of how scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are produced in MST setups and Galileon inflation.Finally, the PBH overproduction issue is thoroughly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are important quantities in describing nucleon structures. They are universal and process-independent. As a matter of fact, nucleon PDFs are inevitably affected by nuclear matter during nuclear scattering process. In order to study the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs), in this paper, we introduce the nucleon pair PDFs (dPDFs) to describe parton distributions in the nucleon pair which is confined to a nucleus. We first of all construct the nuclear state in terms of nucleonic Fock states and calculate the operator definition of nPDFs. Neglecting the higher order corrections or nucleon correlations, we find that nPDFs can be written as a sum of two terms which respectively correspond to PDFs and dPDFs. Nucleon pair PDFs which stem from nucleon-nucleon correlation are proportional to common nucleon PDFs but suppressed by a factor. It is naturally to obtain the slope of the EMC effect $dR_{EMC}/dx$ as long as the factor is independent of momentum fraction $x$. We further calculate the Paschos-Wolfenstein ratio to study the nuclear matter effect on the extraction of weak mixing angle or $\sin^2\theta_W$ by using dPDFs.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a class of Feynman Integrals containing hidden regions that are not straightforwardly identified using the geometric, or Newton polytope, approach to the method of regions. Using Landau singularity analysis and existing analytic results, we study the appearance of such regions in wide-angle and forward scattering and discuss how they can be exposed in both the momentum and parametric representations. We demonstrate that in the strict on-shell limit such integrals contain Landau singularities that prevent their direct numerical evaluation in parameter space and describe how they can be re-parameterised and dissected to circumvent this problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the acceleration of particles in astrophysical sources by the Fermi mechanism is revisited under the assumption of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). We calculate the energy spectrum and the acceleration time of particles leaving the source as a function of the energy beyond which the Lorentz invariance violation becomes relevant. Lorentz invariance violation causes significant changes in the acceleration of particles by the first and second-order Fermi mechanisms. The energy spectrum of particles accelerated by first-order Fermi mechanism under LIV assumption shows a strong suppression for energies above the break. The calculations presented here complete the scenario for LIV searches with astroparticles by showing, for the first time, how the benchmark acceleration mechanisms (Fermi) are modified under LIV assumption.</description>

      <title>Impact parameter dependence of anisotropic flow: Bayesian reconstruction in ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peculiar phenomena have been observed in analyses of anisotropic flow ($v_n$) fluctuations in ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions: The fourth-order cumulant of the elliptic flow ($v_2$) distribution changes sign. In addition, the ATLAS collaboration has shown that cumulants of $v_n$ fluctuations of all orders depend significantly on the centrality estimator. We show that these peculiarities are due to the fact that the impact parameter $b$ always spans a finite range for a fixed value of the centrality estimator. We provide a quantitative determination of this range through a simple Bayesian analysis. We obtain excellent fits of STAR and ATLAS data, with a few parameters, by assuming that the probability distribution of $v_n$ solely depends on $b$ at a given centrality. This probability distribution is almost Gaussian, and its parameters depend smoothly on $b$, in a way that is constrained by symmetry and scaling laws. We reconstruct, thus, the impact parameter dependence of the mean elliptic flow in the reaction plane in a model-independent manner, and assess the robustness of the extraction using Monte Carlo simulations of the collisions where the impact parameter is known. We argue that the non-Gaussianity of $v_n$ fluctuations gives direct information on the hydrodynamic response to initial anisotropies, ATLAS data being consistent with a smaller response for $n=4$ than for $n=2$ and $n=3$, in agreement with hydrodynamic calculations.</description>

      <title>Probing collectivity in heavy-ion collisions with fluctuations of the $p_T$ spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event-by-event fluctuations in the initial stages of ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions depend little on rapidity. The hydrodynamic expansion which occurs in later stages then gives rise to correlations among outgoing particles which depend weakly on their relative rapidity. Azimuthal correlations, through which anisotropic flow ($v_n(p_T)$) is defined, have been the most studied. Here we study a new observable introduced in 2020 by Schenke, Shen and Teaney and dubbed $v_0(p_T)$, which quantifies the relative change in the $p_T$ spectrum induced by a fluctuation. We describe how it can be measured. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we make quantitative predictions for $v_0(p_T)$ of charged and identified hadrons. We then discuss how $v_0(p_T)$ relates to two phenomena which have been measured: The increase of the mean transverse momentum in ultracentral collisions, and the event-by-event fluctuations of the transverse momentum per particle $[ p_T]$. We show that $v_0(p_T)$ determines the dependence of these quantities on the $p_T$ cuts implemented in the analysis. We quantitatively explain the rise of $\sigma_{p_T}$ observed by ATLAS as the upper $p_T$-cut is increased from $2$ to $5$~GeV/$c$.</description>

Abstract: In the context of TeV-scale lepton number violating (LNV) interactions, we illustrate the interplay between leptogenesis, neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, and LNV searches at proton-proton colliders. Using a concrete model for illustration, we identify the parameter space where standard thermal leptogenesis is rendered unviable due to washout processes and show how $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and $pp$ collisions provide complementary probes. We find that the new particle spectrum can have a decisive impact on the relative sensitivity of these two probes.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence of the long-debated $f_0(1370)$ resonance in the dispersive analyses of meson-meson scattering data. For this, we present a novel approach using forward dispersion relations, valid for generic inelastic resonances. We find its pole at $(1245\pm 40)- i\,(300^{+30}_{-70})$ MeV in $\pi\pi$ scattering. We also provide the couplings as well as further checks extrapolating partial-wave dispersion relations or with other continuation methods. A pole at $(1380^{+70}_{-60})-i\,(220^{+80}_{-70})$ MeV also appears in the $\pi\pi\to K\bar K$ data analysis with partial-wave dispersion relations. Despite settling its existence, our model-independent dispersive and analytic methods still show a lingering tension between pole parameters from the $\pi\pi$ and $K\bar K$ channels that should be attributed to data.</description>

Abstract: The fundamental nature of Dark Matter is a central theme of the Snowmass 2021 process, extending across all frontiers. In the last decade, advances in detector technology, analysis techniques and theoretical modeling have enabled a new generation of experiments and searches while broadening the types of candidates we can pursue. Over the next decade, there is great potential for discoveries that would transform our understanding of dark matter. In the following, we outline a road map for discovery developed in collaboration among the frontiers. A strong portfolio of experiments that delves deep, searches wide, and harnesses the complementarity between techniques is key to tackling this complicated problem, requiring expertise, results, and planning from all Frontiers of the Snowmass 2021 process.</description>

      <title>Probing the Blue Axion with Cosmic Optical Background Anisotropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A radiative decaying Big Bang relic with a mass $m_a\simeq 5-25 \,\rm eV$, which we dub "blue axion", can be probed with direct and indirect observations of the cosmic optical background (COB). The strongest bounds on blue-axion cold dark matter come from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) measurements of COB anisotropies at $606$~nm. We suggest that new HST measurements at higher frequencies ($336$~nm and $438$~nm) can improve current constraints on the lifetime up to one order of magnitude, and we show that also thermally produced and hot relic blue axions can be competitively probed by COB anisotropies. We exclude the simple interpretation of the excess in the diffuse COB detected by the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) as photons produced by a decaying hot relic. Finally, we comment on the reach of upcoming line intensity mapping experiments, that could detect blue axions with a lifetime as large as $10^{29}\,\rm s$ or $10^{27}\,\rm s$ for the cold dark matter and the hot relic case, respectively.</description>

      <title>Accretion, Evaporation and Superradiance Phase Diagram of (Primordial) Black Holes and $10^{-21}-10^{21}$ eV Scalar, Vector, Tensor Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the accretion, evaporation and superradiance phase diagram of astrophysical and primordial black holes in the mass range $10^{-33}-10^{11} \, M_\odot $. This black hole mass range corresponds to production of $10^{-21} - 10^{21}$ eV particles for superradiance (bosons) and evaporation (bosons and fermions). Only accretion and superradiance processes are relevant for heavy black holes, on the other hand for light black holes of primordial origin, all three processes can be relevant. We find that superradiance instability can happen even for black hole spin values as low as $10^{-9}-10^{-2}$. Since light black holes are very unstable to these perturbations and sensitive probes of bosonic particles, a single moderately spinning BH can probe 2-9 orders of magnitude of mass parameter space depending on the nature of the perturbations that are scalar (axion), vector (dark photon and/or photon with effective mass) and spin-2. If spinning black holes are observed, namely superradiance is not observed, due to self-interactions, we find limits on the axion decay constant and energy density.</description>

      <title>Probing Light Dark Matter through Cosmic-Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of high-energy neutrinos from active galactic nuclei (AGN), NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056, suggest that cosmic rays (CRs) are accelerated in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole and high-energy protons and electrons can cool efficiently via interactions with ambient photons and gas. The dark matter density may be significantly enhanced near the central black hole, and CRs could lose energies predominantly due to scatterings with the ambient dark matter particles. We propose CR cooling in AGN as a new probe of dark matter-proton and dark matter-electron scatterings. Under plausible astrophysical assumptions, our constraints on sub-GeV dark matter can be the strongest derived to date. Some of the parameter space favored by thermal light dark matter models might already be probed with current multimessenger observations of AGN.</description>

      <title>Negative Barnett effect, negative moment of inertia of gluon plasma and thermal evaporation of chromomagnetic condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the negativity of the moment of inertia of (quark-)gluon plasma in a window of "supervortical" range of temperatures above the deconfining phase transition, $T \simeq (1\dots 1.5) T_c $ found recently in numerical Monte Carlo simulations by two independent methods. In our work, we confirm numerically that the origin of this effect is rooted in the thermal evaporation of the non-perturbative chromomagnetic condensate. We argue that the negative moment of inertia of gluon plasma indicates the presence of a novel effect, the negative spin-vortical coupling for gluons resulting in a negative gluonic Barnett effect: the spin polarization of gluons exceeds the total angular momentum of rotating plasma, thus forcing the orbital angular momentum to take negative values in the supervortical range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>Infinite Series Solution of the Time-Dependent Radiative Transfer Equation in Anisotropically Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the radiative transfer equation (RTE) in anisotropically scattering media as an infinite series. Each series term represents a distinct number of scattering events, with analytical solutions derived for zero and single scattering. Higher-order corrections are addressed through numerical calculations or approximations.
  The RTE solution corresponds to Monte Carlo sampling of photon trajectories with fixed start and end points.
  Validated against traditional Monte Carlo simulations, featuring random end points, our solution demonstrates enhanced efficiency for both anisotropic and isotropic scattering functions, significantly reducing computational time and resources.
  The advantage of our method over Monte Carlo simulations varies with the position of interest and the asymmetry of light scattering, but it is typically orders of magnitude faster while achieving the same level of accuracy.
  The exploitation of hidden symmetries further accelerates our numerical calculations, enhancing the method's overall efficiency.
  In addition, we extend our analysis to the first and second moments of the photon's flux, elucidating the transition between transport and diffusive regimes.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the $a_0(1710)$ nature in the process $J/\psi \to {\bar{K}}^0K^+\rho^- $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the process $J/\psi \to {\bar{K}}^0K^+\rho^-$ by taking into account the $S$-wave ${K^*\bar{K}^*}$, $\rho \omega$, and $\rho \phi$ final-state interactions, where the scalar meson $a_0(1710)$ is generated. In addition, we also take into account the contributions from the scalar $a_0(980)(\to \bar{K}^0K^+)$ and the intermediate resonances $K_1(1270)^{-}(\to {\bar{K}}^0\rho^-) $ and $K_1(1270)^{0}(\to K^+\rho^-)$. Our results show that, in the ${{\bar{K}}^0K^+}$ invariant mass distribution, a clear peak structure around 1.8~GeV appears, which could be associated with the scalar $a_0(1710)$, however, no significant structure of the $a_0(980)$ is observed. On the other hand, one can find clear peaks of the $K_1(1270)$ in the ${\bar{K}}^0\rho^-$ and $K^+\rho^-$ invariant mass distributions. The future precise measurement of this process by the BESIII and Belle II Collaborations and the planned Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) in the future could shed light on the nature of $a_0(1710)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the fully differential cross sections for inclusive heavy quark production in deep-inelastic scattering. We construct proper projection operators to give all possible azimuthal angle distributions of the heavy quark for unpolarized and longitudinally polarized scatterings. These projection operators are expressed in terms of momenta of incoming hadron, virtual photon and detected heavy quark. The azimuthal angle distributions are calculated to next-to-leading order of $\alpha_s$, i.e., $O(\alpha_s^2)$, in a unified way. Analytic expressions of the hard coefficients are given. Numerical results on future electron-ion colliders are also given. It is found that at least three azimuthal angle asymmetries can be more than $1\%$ in typical kinematical regions of these colliders.</description>

      <title>Pressure and speed of sound in two-flavor color-superconducting quark matter at next-to-leading order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deconfined quark matter at asymptotically high densities is weakly coupled, due to the asymptotic freedom of Quantum Chromodynamics. In this weak-coupling regime, bulk thermodynamic properties of quark matter, assuming a trivial ground state, are currently known to partial next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order. However, the ground state at high densities is expected to be a color superconductor, in which the excitation spectrum of (at least some) quarks exhibit a gap with a non-perturbative dependence on the strong coupling. In this work, we calculate the thermodynamic properties of color-superconducting quark matter at high densities and zero temperature at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the coupling in the presence of a finite gap. We work in the limit of two massless quark flavors, which corresponds to deconfined symmetric nuclear matter, and further assume that the gap is small compared to the quark chemical potential. In these limits, we find that the NLO corrections to the pressure and speed of sound are comparable in size to the leading-order effects of the gap, and further increase both quantities above their values for non-superconducting quark matter. We also provide a parameterization of the NLO speed of sound to guide phenomenology in the high-density region, and we furthermore comment on whether our findings should be expected to extend to the case of three-flavor quark matter of relevance to neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy neutral gauge bosons arise in many motivated models of Beyond the Standard Model Physics. Experimental searches require that such gauge bosons are above the TeV scale in most models which means that the tools of effective field theories, in particular the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), are useful. We match the SMEFT to models with heavy $Z^\prime$ bosons, including effects of dimension-8 operators, and consider the restrictions on model parameters from electroweak precision measurements and from Drell Yan invariant mass distributions and forward-backward asymmetry, $A_\text{FB}$, measurements at the LHC. The results demonstrate the model dependence of the resulting limits on SMEFT coefficients and the relatively small impact of including dimension-8 matching. In all cases, the limits from invariant mass distributions are stronger than from $A_\text{FB}$ measurements in the $Z^\prime$ models we consider.</description>

      <title>Matter Asymmetries in the $Z_N$ Dark matter -companion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of $Z_{N\geq 3}$-symmetric WIMP dark matter models that are characterized by the semi-annihilation into the companion of dark matter has been proposed in Ref.~\cite{Guo:2021rre}, providing a mechanism to evade the stringent direct detection constraint. In this work, we point out that such models naturally provide the three Sakharov elements necessary for dark matter asymmetry, and moreover this asymmetry can be transferred to the visible sector with a proper link to the leptonic or quark sector. In our minimal $Z_3$ example, the migration to the leptonic sector is via the asymmetric companion decay into neutrinos, and the lepton asymmetry can be further transferred to the quark sector. The CP violation parameter is restrained in this model. Thus, we explore the thermal motion effect of dark matter and find that it gives an enhancement to the CP violation parameter, which is studied for the first time. A preliminary numerical analysis based on the Boltzmann equations shows that both correct relic density of dark matter and baryon asymmetry can be accommodated.</description>

Abstract: The rates of the $X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0\chi_{c1}$ and $X(3872)\to \pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1}$ decays are estimated in the model of the triangle loop diagrams with charmed $D^*\bar DD$ and $\bar D^*D\bar D$ mesons in the loops. There are the triangle logarithmic singularities in the physical region of the $X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0 \chi_{c1}$ decay which manifest themselves as narrow peaks in the $\pi^0\chi_{c1}$ mass spectrum near the $D^0\bar D^0$ threshold. The model predicts approximately the same branching fractions of the $X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0 \chi_{c1}$ and $X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1}$ decays at the level of about (0.8-1.7)$\times10^{-4}$. A distinct prediction of the model is the value of the ratio $\mathcal{R}= \mathcal{B}(X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1})/\mathcal{B}(X(3872) \to\pi^0\pi^0\chi_{c1})\approx1.1$. It weakly depends on the $X(3872)$ resonance parameters and indicates a significant violation of the isotopic symmetry according to which one would expect $\mathcal{R}=2$.</description>

Abstract: We propose an interpretation for the adjoint representation of the $SO(32)$ group to classify the scalars of a generic Supersymmetric Standard Model having just three generations of particles, via a flavour group $SU(5)$. We show that this same interpretation arises from a simple postulate of self-consistence of composites for these scalars. The model looks only for colour and electric charge, and it pays the cost of an additional chiral $+4/3$ quark per generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models with classical scale symmetry, which feature radiative symmetry breaking, generically lead to a supercooled first-order phase transition in the early Universe resulting in a strong gravitational-wave signal, potentially observable by LISA. This is thanks to the absence of mass terms in the potential and the resulting logarithmic structure of the zero-temperature effective potential. It is known that imposing a symmetry at classical level does not prohibit breaking it by quantum corrections. In the case of scale symmetry, a mass term can in principle appear through renormalisation. This is not the case in the commonly used $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ or Coleman-Weinberg schemes. In this work, we renormalise a scale-invariant model in the on-shell scheme to check whether parameterising it with the physical masses will introduce mass terms to the potential. We find that indeed mass terms appear for an arbitrary choice of the physical masses. However, we formulate an on-shell condition for radiative symmetry breaking, sufficient and necessary for the cancellation of mass terms in the renormalised potential, yielding a logarithmic potential needed for supercooled phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: In these proceedings, I review recent precision calculations relevant for the LHC, all related to the electroweak, Higgs or top sector of the Standard Model. These applications range from triboson production to the production of a top-antitop pair in association with a W boson and to Higgs production in association with another Higgs boson, a top-antitop pair or a W boson. These proceedings reflect a presentation given at DIS2024 and provide a snapshot of the current frontier for theoretical predictions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Triply charm and bottom tetraquarks in a constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singly, doubly and fully charmed tetraquark candidates, \emph{e.g.}, $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$, $T^+_{cc}(3875)$ and $X(6900)$ have been recently reported by the LHCb collaboration. Therefore, it is timely to implement a theoretical investigation on triply heavy tetraquark systems; herein, the S-wave triply charm and bottom tetraquarks, $\bar{Q}Q\bar{q}Q$ $(q=u,\,d,\,s;\,Q=c,\,b)$, with spin-parity $J^P=0^+$, $1^+$ and $2^+$, isospin $I=0$ and $\frac{1}{2}$, are systematically studied in a constituent quark model. Besides, all tetraquark configurations, \emph{i.e.} meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark and K-type arrangements, along with any allowed color structure, are comprehensively considered. The Gaussian expansion method (GEM), in combination with the complex-scaling method (CSM), which is quite ingenious in dealing with either bound or resonances, is the approach adopted in solving the complex scaled Schr\"odinger equation. This theoretical framework has already been applied in various tetra- and penta-quark systems. In a fully coupled-channel calculation within the GEM$+$CSM, narrow resonances are found in each $I(J^P)$ channel of the charm and bottom sector. In particular, triply charm and bottom tetraquark resonances are obtained in $5.6-5.9$ GeV and $15.3-15.7$ GeV, respectively. We provide also some insights of the compositeness of these exotic states, such as the inner quark distance, magnetic moment and dominant wave function component. All this may help to distinguish them in future high energy nuclear and particle experiments.</description>

      <title>Footprints of the QCD Crossover on Cosmological Gravitational Waves at Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) have reported evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at nHz frequencies, possibly originating in the early Universe. We show that the spectral shape of the low-frequency (causality) tail of GW signals sourced at temperatures around $T\gtrsim 1$ GeV is distinctively affected by confinement of strong interactions (QCD), due to the corresponding sharp decrease in the number of relativistic species. Bayesian analyses in the NANOGrav 15 years and the previous International PTA datasets reveal a significant improvement in the fit with respect to cubic power-law spectra, previously employed for the causality tail. This suggests that the inclusion of Standard Model effects on GWs can have a potentially decisive impact on model selection.</description>

      <title>The two-loop power spectrum in redshift space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the matter power spectrum in redshift space including two-loop corrections. We follow a strictly perturbative approach incorporating all non-linearities entering both via the redshift-space mapping and within real space up to the required (fifth) order, complemented by suitable effective field theory (EFT) corrections. This approach can a priori be viable up to scales of order $0.2h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ beyond which power suppression related to the finger-of-God effect becomes non-perturbatively strong. We extend a simplified treatment of EFT corrections at two-loop order from real to redshift space, making sure that the leading UV-sensitivity of both the single-hard and double-hard limit of the two-loop contributions to the power spectrum is accounted for, and featuring two free parameters for each multipole. Taking also infrared-resummation into account, we calibrate with and compare to Quijote $N$-body simulations for the monopole and quadrupole at redshifts $z=0$ and $z=0.5$. We find agreement within sample variance (at percent-level) up to $0.18h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at two-loop order, compared to $0.1h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at one-loop. We also investigate the role of higher-derivative corrections.</description>

      <title>Expansion of hypergeometric functions in terms of polylogarithms with nontrivial variable change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergeometric functions of one and many variables play an important role in various branches of modern physics and mathematics. Often we have hypergeometric functions with indices linear dependent on a small parameter with respect to which one needs to perform Laurent expansions. Moreover such expansions are desirable to be expressed in terms of well known functions which can be evaluated with arbitrary precision. To solve this problem we use the differential equation method and the reduction of corresponding differential systems to canonical basis. Specifically we will be interested in the generalized hypergeometric functions of one variable together with Appell and Lauricella functions and their expansions in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms. Particular attention will be given to the case of rational indices of considered hypergeometric functions when the reduction to canonical basis involves nontrivial variable change. The article comes with a Mathematica package Diogenes, which provides algorithmic implementation of the required steps.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Thresholds for the S-matrix of Unstable Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the analytic properties of S-matrix for unstable particles, which is defined as the residues on the unphysical sheets where unstable poles reside. We demonstrate that anomalous thresholds associated with UV physics are unavoidable for unstable particles. This is in contrast to stable particles, where the anomalous thresholds are due to IR physics, set by the scale of the external kinematics. As a result, any dispersive representation for the amplitude will involve contributions from these thresholds that are not computable from the IR theory, and thus invalidate the general positivity bound. Indeed using toy models, we explicitly demonstrate that the four-derivative couplings for unstable particles can become negative, violating positivity bounds even for non-gravitational theories. Along the way, we show that contributions from anomalous thresholds in a given channel can be captured by the double discontinuity of that channel.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$ polarization in very high energy heavy ion collisions as a probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14295v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>Prospects for weighing neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observations can be used to weigh neutrinos, but this method is model-dependent, with results relying on the cosmological model considered. If we consider interactions between dark energy and dark matter, the neutrino mass constraints differ from those derived under the standard model. On the contrary, gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations can measure absolute cosmological distances, helping to break parameter degeneracies inherent in traditional cosmological observations, thereby improving constraints on neutrino mass. This paper examines the constraints on neutrino mass within interacting dark energy (IDE) models and explores how future GW standard siren observations could enhance these results. For multi-messenger GW observations, we consider the joint observations of binary neutron star mergers by third-generation ground-based GW detectors and short $\gamma$-ray burst observations by missions similar to the THESEUS satellite project. Using current cosmological observations (CMB+BAO+SN), we obtain an upper limit on the neutrino mass in the IDE models of 0.15 (or 0.16) eV. With the inclusion of GW data, the upper limit on the neutrino mass improves to 0.14 eV. This indicates that in the context of IDE models, the improvement in neutrino mass constraints from GW observations is relatively limited. However, GW observations significantly enhance the constraints on other cosmological parameters, such as matter density parameter, the Hubble constant, and coupling strength between dark energy and dark matter.</description>

      <title>Three-flavor Collective Neutrino Oscillations on D-Wave's {\tt Advantage} Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In extreme environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron-star mergers, and the early Universe, neutrinos are dense enough that their self-interactions significantly affect, if not dominate, their flavor dynamics. In order to develop techniques for characterizing the resulting quantum entanglement, I present the results of simulations of Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions that include all three physical neutrino flavors and were performed on D-Wave Inc.'s {\tt Advantage} 5000+ qubit quantum annealer. These results are checked against those from exact classical simulations, which are also used to compare the Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions to neutrino-antineutrino and Majorana neutrino-neutrino interactions. The D-Wave {\tt Advantage} annealer is shown to be able to reproduce time evolution with the precision of a classical machine for small number of neutrinos and to do so without Trotter errors. However, it suffers from poor scaling in qubit-count with the number of neutrinos. Two approaches to improving the qubit-scaling are discussed, but only one of the two shows promise.</description>

      <title>Lattice study on finite density QC$_2$D towards zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure and the equation of state (EoS) for dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D) at low temperature ($T = 40$ MeV, $32^4$ lattice) for the purpose of extending our previous works~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2022hyy} at $T=80$ MeV ($16^4$ lattice). Indeed, a rich phase structure below the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of quark chemical potential $\mu$ has been revealed, but finite volume effects in a high-density regime sometimes cause a wrong understanding. Therefore, it is important to investigate the temperature dependence down to zero temperature with large-volume simulations. By performing $32^4$ simulations, we obtain essentially similar results to the previous ones, but we are now allowed to get a fine understanding of the phase structure via the temperature dependence. Most importantly, we find that the hadronic-matter phase, which is composed of thermally excited hadrons, shrinks with decreasing temperature and that the diquark condensate scales as $\langle qq \rangle \propto \mu^2$ in the BCS phase, a property missing at $T=80$ MeV. From careful analyses, furthermore, we confirm a tentative conclusion that the topological susceptibility is independent of $\mu$. We also show the temperature dependence of the pressure, internal energy, and sound velocity as a function of $\mu$. The pressure increases around the hadronic-superfluid phase transition more rapidly at the lower temperature, while the temperature dependence of the sound velocity is invisible. Breaking of the conformal bound is also confirmed thanks to the smaller statistical error.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Sneutrino Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a supersymmetric scenario where sneutrino is the inflaton in a hybrid inflationary framework. We obtain a spectral index ($n_s \simeq 0.966$), and a tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\simeq 0.0056-10^{-11}$), consistent with the current Planck data satisfying PBH as dark matter (DM) and detectable Gravitational Wave (GW) signal. Our findings show that the mass of PBH and the peak in the GW spectrum is correlated with the right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire DM candidate of the universe (with mass $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$) or a fraction of it. This can be tested in future observatories, for example, with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ and peak frequency $f\sim 0.1$ Hz in LISA and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2 \sim 10^{-11}$ and peak frequency of $\sim 10$ Hz in ET via second-order GW signals. We study two models of sneutrino inflation: Model$-1$ involves canonical sneutrino kinetic term which predicts the sub-Planckian mass parameter $M$, while the coupling between a gauge singlet and the waterfall field, $\beta$, needs to be quite large whereas, for the model$-2$ involving $\alpha-$attractor canonical sneutrino kinetic term, $\beta$ can take a natural value. Estimating explicitly, we show that both models have mild fine-tuning. We also derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum in terms of the microphysics parameters of the model like (s)neutrino mass, etc. that fits well with the numerical results. The typical reheat temperature for both the models is around $10^{7}-10^{8}$~GeV suitable for non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>
