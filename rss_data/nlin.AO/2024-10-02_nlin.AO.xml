      <title>Dynamical stability of evolutionarily stable strategy in asymmetric games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the defining concept of evolutionary game theory. It has a fairly unanimously accepted definition for the case of symmetric games which are played in a homogeneous population where all individuals are in same role. However, in asymmetric games, which are played in a population with multiple subpopulations (each of which has individuals in one particular role), situation is not as clear. Various generalizations of ESS defined for such cases differ in how they correspond to fixed points of replicator equation which models evolutionary dynamics of frequencies of strategies in the population. Moreover, some of the definitions may even be equivalent, and hence, redundant in the scheme of things. Along with reporting some new results, this paper is partly indented as a contextual mini-review of some of the most important definitions of ESS in asymmetric games. We present the definitions coherently and scrutinize them closely while establishing equivalences -- some of them hitherto unreported -- between them wherever possible. Since it is desirable that a definition of ESS should correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points of replicator dynamics, we bring forward the connections between various definitions and their dynamical stabilities. Furthermore, we find the use of principle of relative entropy to gain information-theoretic insights into the concept of ESS in asymmetric games, thereby establishing a three-fold connection between game theory, dynamical system theory, and information theory in this context. We discuss our conclusions also in the backdrop of asymmetric hypermatrix games where more than two individuals interact simultaneously in the course of getting payoffs.</description>

      <title>Dominance to egalitarian transition in diverse communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diverse communities of competing species are generally characterized by substantial niche overlap and strongly stochastic dynamics. Abundance fluctuations are proportional to population size, so the dynamics of rare populations is slower. Hence, once a population becomes rare, its abundance gets stuck at low values. Here, we analyze the effect of this phenomenon on community structure. We identify two different phases: a dominance phase, in which a tiny number of species constitute most of the community, and an egalitarian phase, where it takes a finite fraction of all species to constitute most of the community. We demonstrate the validity of the theory using empirical findings for a variety of hyperdiverse communities, and clarify the role of demographic stochasticity in shaping patterns of commonness and rarity.</description>

      <title>Collective motion using quantum-like entanglement of neighbours in perceptual space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the collective motion of self-propelled agents through the lens of quantum-like entanglement in visual perception. This approach makes the non-linear dynamics in ordinary space a derivative of dynamics in the Hilbert space of perception. By appropriate choice of operators in this quantum-inspired model, we show how the familiar Vicsek model, a well-known paradigm for flocking behaviour, naturally emerges. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to explore how different types of entangled quantum states-such as GHZ states, W states, and cluster states-affect collective motion. Each type of entanglement introduces unique coordination patterns, interaction strength, and information sharing among agents, leading to different collective behaviours.</description>
