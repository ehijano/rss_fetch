      <title>Reconciling light nuclei and nuclear matter: relativistic $ab\ initio$ calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing challenge to accurately predict the properties of light nuclei and nuclear matter simultaneously in nuclear $ab\ initio$ calculations. In this Letter, we develop the relativistic quantum Monte Carlo methods for the nuclear $ab\ initio$ problem, and calculate the ground-state energies of $A\leq4$ nuclei using the two-nucleon Bonn force with an unprecedented high accuracy. For $A=3,4$ nuclei, the present relativistic results significantly outperforms the nonrelativistic results with only two-nucleon forces. Combining the present results for light nuclei and the previous results for nuclear matter with the same Bonn force, a correlation between the properties of light $A\leq4$ nuclei and the nuclear saturation is revealed, and both systems are well described simultaneously, even without introducing three-nucleon forces. This provides a quantitative understanding of the connection between the light nuclei and nuclear matter saturation properties, which has been an outstanding problem in nuclear $ab\ initio$ calculations for decades.</description>

      <title>Absence of binding of heavy fermions by two light atoms in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By developing the mean-field theory valid for large $N$, we investigate the problem of two light fermions interacting via a zero-range potential with $N$ heavy fermions in two dimensions. We obtain numerical evidence that this system is never fully bound. It always splits into droplets containing a single light atom. This is in contrast to the one-dimensional case where any number of heavy and light fermions can be bound together.</description>

      <title>Moments of inertia in light deformed nuclei: pairing and mean-field impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dependence of the moment of inertia $\cal J$ on the pairing and axial quadrupole deformation $\beta$ in $^{24}$Mg and $^{20}$Ne was investigated. The study is based on quadrupole-constrained calculations with three cranking approaches for $\cal J$ (Inglis-Belyaev, Thouless-Valatin, adiabatic time-dependent Hartree-Fock) and a representative set of Skyrme forces (SVbas, SkM*, SLy6). At variance with macroscopic collective models, the calculations predict the specific regime $d{\cal J}/d\beta&lt;0$ at $\beta \ge 0.5$ ($^{24}$Mg) and $\beta \ge 0.6$ ($^{20}$Ne), where the pairing breaks down. This regime is explained by two effects: full break up of the pairing and specific evolution of a {\it single} dominant particle-hole (1ph) configuration with $\beta$. The analysis of experimental data for the ground-state rotational bands in $^{24}$Mg and $^{20}$Ne shows that such regime is possible at low spins.</description>

      <title>Dilepton production at next-to-leading order and intermediate invariant-mass observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal QCD dilepton production rate is calculated at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling and at finite baryon chemical potential. The two-loop virtual photon self-energy is evaluated using finite temperature field theory and combined consistently with the self-energy in the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal regime. We present new results for a dense baryonic plasma. The rates are then integrated using (3+1)-dimensional fluid-dynamical simulations calibrated to reproduce hadronic experimental results obtained at RHIC at energies ranging from those of the Beam Energy Scan to $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 200$ GeV. We elaborate on the ability for dileptons to relay information about the plasma baryonic content and temperature.</description>

      <title>Exploring the compactness of $\alpha$ cluster in $^{16}$O nuclei with relativistic $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15723v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing the $\alpha$ cluster of $^{16}$O with the relativistic $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions has raised great interest in the heavy ion community. However, the effects of the $\alpha$ cluster on the soft hadron observables vary largely among different studies. In this paper, we explain the differences by the compactness of the $\alpha$ cluster in oxygen, using iEBE-VISHNU hydrodynamic simulations with different initial state $\alpha$ cluster configurations. We also find several observables, such as the intensive skewness of the $[p_{\rm T}]$ correlator $\Gamma_{p_{\rm T}}$, the harmonic flows $v_2\{2\}$, $v_2\{4\}$, $v_3\{2\}$, and the $v_n^2-\delta[p_{\rm T}]$ correlations $\rho(v_{2}^{2}, [p_{\rm T}])$, $\rho(v_{3}^{2}, [p_{\rm T}])$ in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions are sensitive to the compactness of the $\alpha$ cluster in the colliding nuclei, which can be used to constrain the configurations of $^{16}$O in the future. Our study serves as an important step toward the quantitative exploration of the $\alpha$ cluster configuration in the light nuclei with relativistic heavy ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: We review recent theoretical developments relevant to heavy-ion experiments carried out within the Beam Energy Scan program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Our main focus is on the description of the dynamics of systems created in heavy-ion collisions and establishing the necessary connection between the experimental observables and the QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transitions in the cores of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian Processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of FOPT. I find that the previously observed peak structure of the sound speed remains stable against inclusion of FOPTs. While the current data cannot differentiate between a smooth crossover and a first-order phase transition, 95% of the total evidence consists of equations of state with some form of phase changes, such as FOPT occurring within or terminating the stable branch of neutron stars, or an indication of a crossover to quark matter.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of capture thresholds with time dependent Hartree-Fock theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the time dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory, capture thresholds $E_{\rm cap}$ for 144 fusion systems with nearly spherical nuclei are systematically studied for the first time. We find that for the reactions between doubly-magic nuclei, the calculated $E_{\rm cap}$ are very close to the extracted barrier heights from measured fusion excitation functions. For the fusion reactions with nearly spherical nuclei, an excitation energy of about 1 MeV at the capture position need to be considered to better reproduce the data due to the lower excitation threshold. The rms deviation with respect to the barrier heights is only 1.43 MeV from the TDHF calcualtions, which is smaller than the results from three empirical nuclear potentials. Together with Siwek-Wilczy\'{n}ski formula in which the three parameters are determined by the TDHF calculations, the measured fusion cross sections at energies around the barriers can be well reproduced for seven fusion reactions $^{40}$Ca+$^{48}$Ca, $^{16}$O+$^{208}$Pb, $^{40}$Ca+$^{90,96}$Zr, $^{28}$Si+$^{96}$Zr and $^{132}$Sn+$^{40,48}$Ca.</description>

      <title>Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators in gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators are constructed using local operators connected by time-like or space-like Wilson lines, which ensure gauge invariance. Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators have broad applications in various contexts. For instance, space-like Wilson-line operators play a crucial role in determining quasi-distribution functions (quasi-PDFs), while time-like Wilson-line operators are essential for understanding quarkonium decay and production within the potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) framework. In this work, we establish a systematic approach for calculating the matching from the gradient-flow scheme to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme in the limit of small flow time for off-lightcone Wilson-line operators. By employing the one-dimensional auxiliary-field formalism, we simplify the matching procedure, reducing it to the matching of local current operators. We provide one-loop level matching coefficients for these local current operators. For the case of hadronic matrix element related to the quark quasi-PDFs, we show at one-loop level that the finite flow time effect is very small as long as the flow radius is smaller than the physical distance $z$, which is usually satisfied in lattice gradient flow computations. Applications include lattice gradient flow computations of quark/gluon quasi-PDFs, gluonic correlators related to quarkonium decay and production in pNRQCD, and spin-dependent potentials in terms of chromoelectric and chromomagnetic field insertions into a Wilson loop.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature in a model with manifest confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple lattice evidences support the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD above the chiral symmetry restoration crossover at Tch ~ 155 MeV. This regime is characterised by an approximate chiral spin symmetry of the partition function, which is a symmetry of the colour charge and the confining electric part of the QCD Lagrangian. It is traditionally believed that confinement should automatically induce spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which would preclude the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD at high temperatures. We employ a well-known solvable quark model for QCD in 3+1 dimensions that is chirally symmetric and manifestly confining and argue that while confinement indeed induces dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, a chiral restoration phase transition takes place at some critical temperature Tch. Above this temperature, the spectrum of the model consists of chirally symmetric hadrons with approximate chiral spin symmetry.</description>
