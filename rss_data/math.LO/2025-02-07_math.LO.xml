      <title>An exposition on the supersimplicty of certain expansions of the additive group of the integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we present a self-contained exposition of the supersimplicity of certain expansions of the additive group of the integers, such as adding a generic predicate (due to Chatzidakis and Pillay), a predicate for the square-free integers (due to Bhardwaj and Tran) or a predicate for the prime integers (due to Kaplan and Shelah, assuming Dickson's conjecture).</description>

      <title>The uniform Kruskal theorem over RCA$_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kruskal's theorem famously states that finite trees (ordered using an infima-preserving embeddability relation) form a well partial order. Freund, Rathjen, and Weiermann extended this result to general recursive data types with their uniform Kruskal theorem. They do not only show that this principle is true but also, in the context of reverse mathematics, that their theorem is equivalent to ${\Pi^1_1}$-comprehension, the characterizing axiom of ${\Pi^1_1\textsf{-CA}_0}$.
  However, their proof is not carried out directly over ${\textsf{RCA}_0}$, the usual base system of reverse mathematics. Instead, it additionally requires a weak consequence of Ramsey's theorem for pairs and two colors: the chain antichain principle.
  In this article, we show that this additional assumption is not necessary and the considered equivalence between the uniform Kruskal theorem and $\Pi^1_1$-comprehension already holds over ${\textsf{RCA}_0}$. For this, we improve Girard's characterization of arithmetical comprehension using ordinal exponentiation by showing that his result even remains correct if only a certain subclass of well orders is considered.</description>

      <title>Infinite Games and Ramsey Properties of $F_\sigma$ Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.09088v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate various combinatorial properties of Borel ideals on countable sets. We extend a theorem presented in M. Hru\v{s}\'{a}k, D. Meza-Alc\'antara, E. Th\"ummel, and C. Uzc\'ategui, \emph{Ramsey Type Properties of Ideals}, and identify an $F_\sigma$ tall ideal in which player II has a winning strategy in the Cut and Choose Game, thereby addressing a question posed by J. Zapletal. Additionally, we explore the Ramsey properties of ideals, demonstrating that the random graph ideal is critical for the Ramsey property when considering more than two colors. The previously known result for two colors is extended to any finite number of colors. Furthermore, we comment on the Solecki ideal and identify an $F_\sigma$ tall $K$-uniform ideal that is not equivalent to $\mathcal{ED}_{\text{fin}}$, thereby addressing a question from Michael Hru\v{s}\'ak.</description>

      <title>Partitions of primitive Boolean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Boolean ring and its Stone space (Boolean space) are primitive if the ring is disjointly generated by its pseudo-indecomposable (PI) elements. Hanf showed that a primitive PI Boolean algebra can be uniquely defined by a structure diagram. In a previous paper we defined trim $P$-partitions of a Stone space, where $P$ is a PO system (poset with a distinguished subset), and showed how they provide a physical representation within the Stone space of these structure diagrams.
  In this paper we study the class of trim partitions of a fixed primitive Boolean space, which may not be compact, and show how they can be structured as a quasi-ordered set via an appropriate refinement relation. This refinement relation corresponds to a surjective morphism of the associated PO systems, and we establish a quasi-order isomorphism between the class of well-behaved partitions of a primitive space and a class of extended PO systems.
  We also define rank partitions, which generalise the rank diagrams introduced by Myers, and the ideal completion of a trim $P$-partition, whose underlying PO system is the ideal completion of $P$, and show that rank partitions are just the ideal completions of trim partitions. In the process, we extend a number of existing results regarding primitive Boolean algebras or compact primitive Boolean spaces to locally compact Boolean spaces.</description>

      <title>Models of Set Theory: Extensions and Dead-ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the study of extensions of arbitrary models of ZF (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory), with no regard to countability or well-foundedness of the models involved. We present some new constructions of certain types of extensions, and also establish the existence of models of ZF that cannot be properly end extended to a model of ZF.</description>

      <title>Models for common knowledge logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13537v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss models of the common knowledge logic. The common knowledge logic is a multi-modal logic that includes the modal operators $\mathsf{K}_{i}$ ($i\in\mathcal{I}$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is a finite set of agents) and $\mathsf{C}$ in the language. The intended meanings of $\mathsf{K}_{i}\phi$ ($i\in\mathcal{I}$) and $\mathsf{C}\phi$ are ''the agent $i$ knows $\phi$'' ($i\in\mathcal{I}$) and ''$\phi$ is common knowledge among $\mathcal{I}$'', respectively. Semantically, this can be expressed as follows: $\mathsf{C}\phi$ is true if and only if all of $\phi$, $\mathsf{E}\phi$, $\mathsf{E}^{2}\phi$, $\mathsf{E}^{3}\phi,\ldots$ are true, where $\mathsf{E}\phi=\bigwedge_{i\in\mathcal{I}}\mathsf{K}_{i}\phi$. A Kripke frame that satisfies the condition is $\langle W,R_{\mathsf{K}_{i}} (i\in\mathcal{I}), R_{\mathsf{C}}\rangle$, where $R_{\mathsf{C}}$ is the reflexive and transitive closure of $R_{\mathsf{E}}=\bigcup_{i\in\mathcal{I}}R_{\mathsf{K}_{i}}$. We refer to such Kripke frames as CKL-frames. An algebra that satisfies the condition is a modal algebra with modal operators $\mathrm{K}_{i}$ ($i\in\mathcal{I}$) and $\mathrm{C}$, which satisfies that $\mathrm{C}x\leq x$, $\mathrm{C} x\leq\mathrm{E}\mathrm{C} x$, and $\mathrm{C} x$ is the greatest lower bound of the set $\{\mathrm{E}^{n} x\mid n\in\omega\}$, where $\mathrm{E} x=\bigwedge_{i\in\mathcal{I}} \mathrm{K}_{i} x$. We refer to such modal algebras as CKL-algebras. In this paper, we show that the class of CKL-frames is modally definable, whereas the class of CKL-algebras is not. That is, the class of CKL-algebras does not form a variety, and there exists a modal algebra in which the common knowledge logic is valid, but $\mathrm{C}x$ is not the greatest lower bound of the set $\{\mathrm{E}^{n} x\mid n\in\omega\}$.</description>
