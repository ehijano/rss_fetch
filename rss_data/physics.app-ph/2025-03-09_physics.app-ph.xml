      <title>Neuromorphic Quantum Neural Networks with Tunnel-Diode Activation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematical complexity and high dimensionality of neural networks hinder the training and deployment of machine learning (ML) systems while also requiring substantial computational resources. This fundamental limitation drives ML research, particularly in the exploration of alternative neural network architectures that integrate novel building blocks, such as advanced activation functions. Tunnel diodes are well-known electronic components that utilise the physical effect of quantum tunnelling (QT). Here, we propose using the current voltage characteristic of a tunnel diode as a novel, physics-based activation function for neural networks. We demonstrate that the tunnel-diode activation function (TDAF) outperforms traditional activation functions in terms of accuracy and loss during both training and evaluation. We also highlight its potential for implementation in electronic circuits suited to developing neuromorphic, quantum-inspired AI systems capable of operating in environments not suitable for qubit-based quantum computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Selective Photothermal Eradication of Glioblastoma Cells Coexisting with Astrocytes by anti-EGFR Coated Raman Tags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and fatal tumor. The infiltrative spread of GBM cells hinders the gross total resection. The residual GBM cells are significantly associated with survival and recurrence. Therefore, a theranostic method that can enhance the contrast between residual GBM and normal astrocyte (AS) cells as well as selectively eradicate GBM cells is highly desired. In this report, GBM and normal astrocyte cells are both cultured in the same microplate well to imitate a coexistence environment and treated with Raman tags functionalized by anti-EGFR. Compared to AS cells, GBM cells show 25% higher Raman emission, and their cell death rate increases by a factor of 2. These results demonstrate potential for selective eradication of the residual GBM cells guided by robust Raman signals after the primary GBM surgery.</description>

      <title>Localized necking under global compression in two-scale metallic hierarchical solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchically structured cellular solids have attracted increasing attention for their superior mass-specific mechanical properties. Using a remeshing-based continuum finite element (FE) framework, we reveal that two-scale metallic hierarchical solids exhibit a distinct, localized deformation mode that involves necking and fracture of microscale tension members even at small global compressive strains (3-5%). The tensile failure is always preceded by plastic buckling of a complementary compression member. This combined necking-buckling (NB) mode critically underlies the collapse of hexagon-triangle (HTH) hierarchical lattices over a wide range of relative densities and length-scale ratios and is also seen in diamond-triangle (DTH) lattices. In lattices with very slender microscale members, necking is prevented by a competing failure mode that involves coordinated buckling (CB) of multiple members. Our custom remeshing FE framework is critical to resolve the localized large plastic strains, ductile failure, and complex local modes of deformation (including cusp formation) that are characteristic of the NB mode. A theoretical buckling analysis supports the inevitability of the NB and CB modes in HTH lattices. The occurrence of the NB mode has consequences for energy absorption by two-scale hierarchical solids, and hence influences their design.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Spin Transport in a Topological Insulator Thin Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are intriguing materials for advanced computing applications based on spintronics because they can host robust spin effects. For instance, TIs have intrinsically large spin generation enabled by their large spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, topological surface states (TSS) with spin-momentum locking and Dirac dispersion lead to long spin diffusion. Future spintronic device technology will require scalable film growth of high-quality material. We grow epitaxial films of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_{3-y}$Se$_y$ (BSTS, $x = 0.58, y = 1$) and confirm the gapless band structure with optimal doping using angle-resolved photoelectron spectra. The temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity shows bulk transport is suppressed as temperature is decreased, and at low temperature surface transport dominates. We evaluate the spin transport properties in BSTS without using ferromagnetic tunnel contacts via a non-local resistance experiment as a function of temperature and applied charge current. As expected, these experiments reveal the necessity of decreasing the bulk conduction to best enhance the spin transport. In the TSS, we find high efficiency of charge-to-spin conversion (spin Hall angle, $\theta_{SH} \approx 1$) and spin diffusion over several microns. Further development of high-quality TIs will make them viable candidates for efficient and lossless spintronics.pment of high-quality TIs will make them viable candidates for efficient and lossless spintronics.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays and the Askaryan Effect Reveal Subsurface Structure and Buried Ice on the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first full-wavelength numerical simulations of the electric field generated by cosmic ray impacts into the Moon. Billions of cosmic rays fall onto the Moon every year. Ultra-high energy cosmic ray impacts produce secondary particle cascades within the regolith and subsequent coherent, widebandwidth, linearly-polarized radio pulses by the Askaryan Effect. Observations of the cosmic ray particle shower radio emissions can reveal subsurface structure on the Moon and enable the broad and deep prospecting necessary to confirm or refute the existence of polar ice deposits. Our simulations show that the radio emissions and reflections could reveal ice layers as thin as 10 cm and buried under regolith as deep as 9 m. The Askaryan Effect presents a novel and untapped opportunity for characterizing buried lunar ice at unprecedented depths and spatial scales.</description>

Abstract: Scattering and absorption are fundamental processes in optical engineering and applications. This study investigates the use of the food dye tartrazine to design refractive index fluids that enhance light propagation through scattering media. The optical properties of the solutions were carefully examined using spectrometry and ellipsometry under two extreme conditions, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive understanding of dye solutions. Additionally, we demonstrated using dye molecules to control light propagation through scattering media.

      <title>An alternative application of GaAs-based light-emitting diodes: X-ray detection and imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GaAs-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are commonly employed in a variety of applications, including medical imaging, biosensing, optical communications, and night vision. In this paper, we present an alternative application of GaAs-based LED with SI-GaAs substrate for X-ray detection and imaging. The mechanism relies on the semiconductor frequency down-conversion process, where the SI-GaAs substrate acts as a photodetector (PD). Upon X-ray irradiation, the generated photocurrent by the SI-GaAs substrate drives the LED to emit NIR photons which can be detect by a low-cost CCD. We demonstrate direct X-ray detection and present preliminary imaging results, providing another example of the applicability of the PD-LED design for optical frequency conversion. The proposed LED X-ray detector leverages mature materials and fabrication processes. The application of the frequency down-conversion concept makes it possible for pixel-less imaging using a large single imaging unit, eliminating the need for readout circuits. This PD-LED architecture offers an alternative approach to direct X-ray detection and imaging, characterized by higher absorption, improved image resolution, and enhanced material stability.</description>

      <title>Revealing localised dark-exciton populations in 2D perovskites via magneto-optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The successful development of optoelectronic devices is contingent on a detailed understanding of interactions between light and excited energy states in photoactive materials. In 2D perovskites, excitons are the dominant photogenerated species and their energetic structure plays a pivotal role, governing photon absorption and emission processes. In these materials, dark exciton states can undergo photoluminescence due to the relaxation of selection rules and this process can be modulated by an external magnetic field, enabling unambiguous identification of the exciton fine structure. Previous reports of magneto-optical spectroscopy on 2D perovskites have been restricted to the macroscopic response, where key information is lost regarding the microscopic heterogeneity of the photoluminescence. Here, we use magneto-optical microscopy for the first time on perovskite materials to elucidate the spatial variation of exciton emission processes. In 2D perovskite thin films, we distinguish between regions of localised bright and dark exciton populations, correlated to the film morphology. In single crystals, we show that dark excitons become localised at the edges, where excitons can be trapped in two distinct types of sub-gap states. This work represents significant progress in understanding the properties of exciton emission in 2D perovskites, which is crucial for the development of optoelectronic technology.</description>

      <title>Neutral but Impactful: Gallium Cluster-Induced Nanopores from Beam-Blanked Gallium Ion Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atoms emitted from liquid metal ion sources are an often-overlooked source of contamination and damage in focused ion beam microscopy. Beyond ions and single atoms, these sources also emit atom clusters. While most studies have investigated charged clusters, here we demonstrate that neutral clusters are also emitted. These neutral clusters bypass the electrostatic beam blanking system, allowing them to impinge on samples even when the ion beam is blanked. We investigate this phenomenon using thin (&lt;20 nm) freestanding membranes of hexagonal boron nitride, silicon, and silicon nitride as targets. Randomly dispersed nanopores that form upon neutral cluster exposure are revealed. The average nanopore diameter is ~2 nm with a narrow size distribution, suggesting that the atom clusters emitted from the source have a preferred size. Various electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the nanopores, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, multislice ptychography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Finally, we show how electron irradiation in the transmission electron microscope can be used to both remove any amorphous material that may clog the pores and to controllably grow the pores to specific sizes. Tunable nanopores such as these are interesting for nanofluidic applications involving size-selective membranes.</description>

      <title>Lanthanide upconversion nonlinearity: a key probe feature for background-free deep-tissue imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lanthanide-based upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have attracted considerable attention in biomedical applications, largely due to their anti-Stokes shifted emission enabling autofluorescence-free signal detection. However, residual excitation light can still interfere with their relatively low brightness. While commonly used lock-in detection can distinguish weak signals from substantial random background, concurrently modulated residual excitation light is not eliminated. This remains a challenge, particularly under demanding experimental conditions.
  Here, we explore the inherent nonlinear response of UCNPs and discover that UCNPs can act as frequency mixers in response to intensity-modulated excitation. Particularly, modulated excitation with more than one base modulation frequency can generate additional low-frequency beating-signals. We show how these signals are resolvable by low-speed detectors such as cameras, are devoid of ambient and residual excitation light, and how they can be enhanced through nanoparticle engineering. Detection of beating-signals thus provides a strategy to significantly enhance signal-to-background conditions in UCNP-based bioimaging and biosensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the synchronization of propagating spin waves in a novel spin torque oscillator device layout using micromagnetic simulations. This design enables individual probing of the dc current in each oscillator, allowing precise control over the synchronization state and providing direct phase measurement. Our findings reveal that two adjacent oscillators achieve phase locking when they maintain a constant phase difference, either in phase or anti-phase, depending on their separation distance. This work offers new insights into STO synchronization mechanisms and paves the way for improved control and functionality in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Step-by-step design guide of a cryogenic three-axis vector magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tunable magnetic field at low temperatures is essential for numerous applications, including spintronics, magnetic resonance imaging, and condensed matter physics. While commercial superconducting vector magnets are available, they are complex, expensive, and often not adaptable to specific experimental needs. As a result, simple in-house designs are often being used in research environments. However, no comprehensive step-by-step guide for their construction currently exists. In this work, we provide a detailed manual for designing and building a cryogenically compatible three-axis vector magnet. The system is tested at the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator at temperatures ranging from 15 mK to 4 K, with no significant increase in base temperature. Safety measures are implemented to mitigate heating from quenching. The coils are successfully driven with DC currents as high as 3 A, generating magnetic fields of up to 2.5 T. Magnetic field measurements using Hall sensors demonstrate good agreement with the predictions of the designed performance.</description>

      <title>Electric-field sensing with driven-dissipative time crystals in room-temperature Rydberg vapor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mode competition in nonequilibrium Rydberg gases enables the exploration of emergent many-body phases. This work leverages this emergent phase for electric field detection at room temperature. Sensitive frequency-resolved electric field measurements at very low-frequencies (VLF) are of central importance in a wide range of applications where deep-penetration is required in communications, navigation and imaging or surveying. The long wavelengths on order of 10-100 km (3-30 kHz) limit the efficiency, sensitivity, and bandwidth of compact classical detectors that are constrained by the Chu limit. Rydberg-atom electrometers are an attractive approach for microwave electric-field sensors but have reduced sensitivity at lower-frequencies. Very recent efforts to advance the standard Rydberg-atoms approach is based on DC electric-field (E-field) Stark shifting and have resulted in sensitivities between 67.9-2.2 uVcm-1Hz-1/2 (0.1-10 kHz) by fine optimization of the DC E-field. A major challenge in these approaches is the need for embedded electrodes or plates due to DC E-field Stark screening effect, which can perturb coupling of VLF signals when injected from external sources. In this article, it is demonstrated that state-of-art sensitivity (~1.6-2.3 uVcm-1Hz-1/2) can instead be achieved using limit-cycle oscillations in driven-dissipative Rydberg atoms by using a magnetic field (B-field) to develop mode-competition between nearby Rydberg states. The mode-competition between nearby Rydberg-states develop an effective transition centered at the oscillation frequency capable of supporting external VLF E-field coupling in the ~10-15kHz regime without the requirement for fine optimization of the B-field magnitude.</description>

      <title>A new approach for the inversion of residual stress based on acoustoelasticity theory and full waveform inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustoelasticity theory has been widely used to evaluate the residual stress (or prestress), almost all the available ultrasonic stress detection methods are based on the relationship between the magnitude of stress and wave speed, but these measurement methods make the assumption that the stress is uniform, only one point or average stress in the direction of ultrasound propagation can be obtained. However, the real stress distribution is usually nonuniform. In order to obtain the stress distribution in the direction of ultrasound propagation, in this paper, we propose a new approach: the inversion of residual stress. In the theory part, the inversion of residual stress is transformed into an optimization problem. The objective function is established, and the gradient of the objective function to the stress is derived using the adjoint method, which has been maturely applied in full waveform inversion. In the numerical simulation part, the welding process is simulated using the finite element method to obtain a database of the residual stress field. Then the residual stress is evaluated by inversion approach and the influence of the number of sources and receivers and the frequency of the excitation wave on the inversion effect is discussed. The results show that the inversion of residual stress is still challenging with a small amount of data, but a more accurate inversion can be obtained by appropriately increasing the number of sources and receivers. This study provides an appropriate method for the evaluation of residual stress distribution and lays the theoretical and simulation foundation for the application of ultrasonic stress testing in it.</description>

Abstract: Soft X-ray experiments at synchrotron light sources are essential for a wide range of research fields. However, commercially available detectors for this energy range often cannot deliver the necessary combination of quantum efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, speed, and radiation hardness within a single system. While hybrid detectors have addressed these challenges effectively in the hard X-ray regime, specifically with single photon counting pixel detectors extensively used in high-performance synchrotron applications, similar solutions are desired for energies below 2 keV.
  In this work, we introduce the first single-photon-counting hybrid pixel detector capable of detecting X-ray energies as low as 550 eV, utilizing the internal amplification of Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) sensors. This detector is thoroughly characterized in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Detective Quantum Efficiency. We demonstrate its capabilities through ptychographic imaging at MAX IV 4th generation synchrotron light source at the Fe L$_3$-edge (707 eV), showcasing the enhanced detection performance of the system. This development sets a new benchmark for soft X-ray applications at synchrotrons, paving the way for significant advancements in imaging and analysis at lower photon energies.</description>

      <title>Surface-dominant transport in Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires for next-generation interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ongoing demands for smaller and more energy efficient electronic devices necessitate alternative interconnect materials with lower electrical resistivity at reduced dimensions. Despite the emergence of many promising candidates, synthesizing high quality nanostructures remains a major bottleneck in evaluating their performance. Here, we report the successful synthesis of Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires via thermomechanical nanomolding, achieving single crystallinity and controlled diameters as small as 40 nm. Our NbAs nanowires exhibit a remarkably low room-temperature resistivity of 9.7 +/- 1.6 microOhm-cm, which is three to four times lower than their bulk counterpart. Theoretical calculations corroborate the experimental observations, attributing this exceptional resistivity reduction to surface dominant conduction with long carrier lifetime at finite temperatures. Further characterization of NbAs nanowires and bulk single crystals reveals high breakdown current density, robust stability, and superior thermal conductivity. Collectively, these properties highlight the strong potential of NbAs nanowires as next-generation interconnects, which can surpass the limitations of current copper-based interconnects. Technologically, our findings present a practical application of topological materials, while scientifically showcasing the fundamental properties uniquely accessible in nanoscale platforms.</description>
