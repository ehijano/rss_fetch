      <title>Computational Fabrication and Assembly for In Situ Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabrication today relies on disparate, large machines spread across industrial facilities. These are operated by domain experts to construct and assemble artefacts in sequential steps from large numbers of parts. This traditional, centralized mass manufacturing paradigm is characterized by large capital costs and inflexibility to changing needs, complex global supply chains hinged on economic and political stability, and waste and over-manufacturing of uniform artefacts that fail to meet the technical and personal needs of today's diverse individuals and use cases. Today, these challenges are particularly severe at points of need, such as the space environment. The space environment is remote and unpredictable, and the ability to manufacture in situ offers unique opportunities to address new challenges as they arise. However, the challenges faced in space are often mirrored on Earth. In hospitals, disaster zones, low resource environments and laboratories, the ability to manufacture customized artefacts at points of need can significantly enhance our ability to respond rapidly to unforeseen events. In this thesis, I introduce digital fabrication platforms with co-developed hardware and software that draw on tools from robotics and human-computer interaction to automate manufacturing of customized artefacts at the point of need. Highlighting three research themes across fabrication machines, modular assembly, and programmable materials, the thesis will cover a digital fabrication platform for producing functional robots, a modular robotic platform for in-space assembly deployed in microgravity, and a method for programming magnetic material to selectively assemble.</description>

      <title>Tridiagonal matrix decomposition for Hamiltonian simulation on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of quantum circuits to simulate Hamiltonian evolution is central to many quantum algorithms. State-of-the-art circuits are based on oracles whose implementation is often omitted, and the complexity of the algorithm is estimated by counting oracle queries. However, in practical applications, an oracle implementation contributes a large constant factor to the overall complexity of the algorithm. The key finding of this work is the efficient procedure for representation of a tridiagonal matrix in the Pauli basis, which allows one to construct a Hamiltonian evolution circuit without the use of oracles. The procedure represents a general tridiagonal matrix $2^n \times 2^n$ by systematically determining all Pauli strings present in the decomposition, dividing them into commuting subsets. The efficiency is in the number of commuting subsets $O(n)$. The method is demonstrated using the one-dimensional wave equation, verifying numerically that the gate complexity as function of the number of qubits is lower than the oracle based approach for $n &lt; 15$ and requires half the number of qubits. This method is applicable to other Hamiltonians based on the tridiagonal matrices.</description>
