      <title>Monge-Amp\`ere equations with prescribed singularities on compact Hermitian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact complex manifold $X$, we study the existence and the uniqueness of weak solutions to degenerate Monge-Amp\`ere equations on $X$ with prescribed singularities when the reference form is semipositive and big, while the right hand side is a non-pluripolar positive Radon measure. This generalizes our previous work to more general hermitian manifolds and also to the case of solutions with prescribed singularities.</description>

      <title>Variation of geodesic length functions over Teichm\"uller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2966</link>
      <description>arXiv:1006.2966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a family of compact, canonically polarized, complex manifolds equipped with K\"ahler-Einstein metrics the first variation of the lengths of closed geodesics was previously shown in by the authors in [arXiv:0808.3741v2] to be the geodesic integral of the harmonic Kodaira-Spencer form. We compute the second variation. For one dimensional fibers we arrive at a formula that only depends upon the harmonic Beltrami differentials. As an application a new proof for the plurisubharmonicity of the geodesic length function and its logarithm (with new upper and lower estimates) follows, which also applies to the previously not known cases of Teichm\"uller spaces of weighted punctured Riemann surfaces, where the methods of Kleinian groups are not available.</description>

      <title>Cauchy Transforms of Colored Graphs in Two Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By designating vertices with variables, a simple undirected graph can be augmented to have an associated representing rational function in two variables taking the complex bi-upper halfplane to itself. We give relations between representing functions of certain products of such graphs by way of Schur complements. We also study the connection between the structure of the graph and the regularity of the representing function at a boundary singularity.</description>

      <title>Abelian varieties with no power isogenous to a Jacobian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a curve of genus at least four which is either very general or very general hyperelliptic, we classify all ways in which a power of its Jacobian can be isogenous to a product of Jacobians of curves. As an application, we show that, for a very general principally polarized abelian variety of dimension at least four, or the intermediate Jacobian of a very general cubic threefold, no power is isogenous to a product of Jacobians of curves. This confirms some cases of the Coleman-Oort conjecture. We further deduce from our results some progress on the question whether the integral Hodge conjecture fails for such abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Existence of Conical Higher cscK Metrics on a Minimal Ruled Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A higher extremal K\"ahler metric is defined (motivated by analogy with the definition of an extremal K\"ahler metric) as one whose top Chern form equals a smooth function multiplied by its volume form such that the gradient of the function is a holomorphic vector field. A special case of this is a higher cscK metric which is defined (again by analogy with the definition of a cscK metric) as one whose top Chern form is a constant multiple of its volume form or equivalently whose top Chern form is harmonic. In our previous paper on higher extremal K\"ahler metrics we had looked at a certain class of minimal ruled surfaces called as pseudo-Hirzebruch surfaces all of which contain two special divisors (viz. the zero and infinity divisors) and serve as example manifolds in the momentum construction which is used for producing explicit examples of the above-mentioned kinds of canonical metrics. We had proven that every K\"ahler class on such a surface admits a higher extremal K\"ahler metric which is not higher cscK and we had further proven by using the top Bando-Futaki invariant that higher cscK metrics do not exist in any K\"ahler class on the surface. In this paper we will see that if we allow our metrics to develop conical singularities along at least one of the two special divisors then we do get conical higher cscK metrics in each K\"ahler class by the momentum construction. We will show that our constructed metrics satisfy the polyhomogeneous condition for conical K\"ahler metrics and we will interpret the conical higher cscK equation globally on the surface in terms of the currents of integration along the two divisors. We will then introduce and employ the top $\log$ Bando-Futaki invariant to obtain a linear relationship between the cone angles of the conical singularities along the two divisors.</description>
