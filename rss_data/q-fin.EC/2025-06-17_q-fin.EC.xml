      <title>EconGym: A Scalable AI Testbed with Diverse Economic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a powerful tool for economic research, enabling large-scale simulation and policy optimization. However, applying AI effectively requires simulation platforms for scalable training and evaluation-yet existing environments remain limited to simplified, narrowly scoped tasks, falling short of capturing complex economic challenges such as demographic shifts, multi-government coordination, and large-scale agent interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EconGym, a scalable and modular testbed that connects diverse economic tasks with AI algorithms. Grounded in rigorous economic modeling, EconGym implements 11 heterogeneous role types (e.g., households, firms, banks, governments), their interaction mechanisms, and agent models with well-defined observations, actions, and rewards. Users can flexibly compose economic roles with diverse agent algorithms to simulate rich multi-agent trajectories across 25+ economic tasks for AI-driven policy learning and analysis. Experiments show that EconGym supports diverse and cross-domain tasks-such as coordinating fiscal, pension, and monetary policies-and enables benchmarking across AI, economic methods, and hybrids. Results indicate that richer task composition and algorithm diversity expand the policy space, while AI agents guided by classical economic methods perform best in complex settings. EconGym also scales to 10k agents with high realism and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Does the Expansion of Medicaid Lead to Income Adjustment -- Evidence from SIPP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines whether Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) led to strategic income reductions to qualify for coverage. Using monthly data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (2013 to 2019) and a regression discontinuity design, this paper finds that childless households in expansion states with earnings just above the eligibility threshold reduced their lowest monthly earnings by 39 percentage points of the Federal Poverty Level (roughly 700 dollars for a two-person household) relative to those just below. The effect intensified as the mandate penalty increased and diminished after its repeal. Evidence suggests earnings adjustments along both intensive and extensive margins. The paper reinforces the validity of using the lowest monthly earning to identify Medicaid eligibility and provides the first evidence of a substantial labor supply response to the ACA</description>

      <title>Inequality's Economic and Social Roots: the Role of Social Networks and Homophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I discuss economic and social sources of inequality and elaborate on the role of social networks in inequality, economic immobility, and economic inefficiencies. The lens of social networks clarifies how the entanglement of people's information, opportunities, and behaviors with those of their friends and family leads to persistent differences across communities, resulting in inequality in education, employment, income, health, and wealth. The key role of homophily in separating groups within the network is highlighted. A network perspective's policy implications differ substantially from a narrower economic perspective that ignores social structure. I discuss the importance of ``policy cocktails'' that include aspects that are aimed at both the economic and social forces driving inequality.</description>

      <title>Varying reference-point salience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The salience of reference points and expectations may significantly influence the loss aversion mechanism in effort provision. We exploit a natural experiment where highly professional and incentivized individuals perform their task in a setting with exogenous variation of reference-point salience. While a relevant reference point is salient in some cases, where it influences individuals' expectations, it is obscured in others. This enables us to examine the interplay between reference-point salience and expectation-based loss aversion in shaping effort provision. Exploiting quasi-random variation around the reference point, our regression discontinuity analyses reveal that individuals with positive expectations outperform those with negative expectations only when the reference point is salient.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Automation for FDI Facilitation: Optimizing Tariff Exemption Processes with OCR And Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tariff exemptions are fundamental to attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the manufacturing sector, though the associated administrative processes present areas for optimization for both investing entities and the national tax authority. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to empower tax administration by leveraging a synergistic integration of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Large Language Model (LLM) technologies. The proposed system is designed to first utilize OCR for intelligent digitization, precisely extracting data from diverse application documents and key regulatory texts such as tariff orders. Subsequently, the LLM would enhance the capabilities of administrative officers by automating the critical and time-intensive task of verifying submitted HS Tariff Codes for machinery, equipment, and raw materials against official exemption lists. By enhancing the speed and precision of these initial assessments, this AI-driven approach systematically reduces potential for non-alignment and non-optimized exemption utilization, thereby streamlining the investment journey for FDI companies. For the national administration, the benefits include a significant boost in operational capacity, reduced administrative load, and a strengthened control environment, ultimately improving the ease of doing business and solidifying the nation's appeal as a premier destination for high-value manufacturing FDI.</description>

      <title>Prosocial Design in Trust and Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter presents an overview of Prosocial Design, an approach to platform design and governance that recognizes design choices influence behavior and that those choices can or should be made toward supporting healthy interactions and other prosocial outcomes. The authors discuss several core principles of Prosocial Design and its relationship to Trust and Safety and other related fields. As a primary contribution, the chapter reviews relevant research to demonstrate how Prosocial Design can be an effective approach to reducing rule-breaking and other harmful behavior and how it can help to stem the spread of harmful misinformation. Prosocial Design is a nascent and evolving field and research is still limited. The authors hope this chapter will not only inspire more research and the adoption of a prosocial design approach, but that it will also provoke discussion about the principles of Prosocial Design and its potential to support Trust and Safety.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Reinsurance Treaty Bidding via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for reinsurance treaty bidding, addressing long-standing inefficiencies in traditional broker-mediated placement processes. We pose the core research question: Can autonomous, learning-based bidding systems improve risk transfer efficiency and outperform conventional pricing approaches in reinsurance markets?
  In our model, each reinsurer is represented by an adaptive agent that iteratively refines its bidding strategy within a competitive, partially observable environment. The simulation explicitly incorporates institutional frictions including broker intermediation, incumbent advantages, last-look privileges, and asymmetric access to underwriting information.
  Empirical analysis demonstrates that MARL agents achieve up to 15% higher underwriting profit, 20% lower tail risk (CVaR), and over 25% improvement in Sharpe ratios relative to actuarial and heuristic baselines. Sensitivity tests confirm robustness across hyperparameter settings, and stress testing reveals strong resilience under simulated catastrophe shocks and capital constraints.
  These findings suggest that MARL offers a viable path toward more transparent, adaptive, and risk-sensitive reinsurance markets. The proposed framework contributes to emerging literature at the intersection of algorithmic market design, strategic bidding, and AI-enabled financial decision-making.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as 'Hidden Persuaders': Fake Product Reviews are Indistinguishable to Humans and Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reading and evaluating product reviews is central to how most people decide what to buy and consume online. However, the recent emergence of Large Language Models and Generative Artificial Intelligence now means writing fraudulent or fake reviews is potentially easier than ever. Through three studies we demonstrate that (1) humans are no longer able to distinguish between real and fake product reviews generated by machines, averaging only 50.8% accuracy overall - essentially the same that would be expected by chance alone; (2) that LLMs are likewise unable to distinguish between fake and real reviews and perform equivalently bad or even worse than humans; and (3) that humans and LLMs pursue different strategies for evaluating authenticity which lead to equivalently bad accuracy, but different precision, recall and F1 scores - indicating they perform worse at different aspects of judgment. The results reveal that review systems everywhere are now susceptible to mechanised fraud if they do not depend on trustworthy purchase verification to guarantee the authenticity of reviewers. Furthermore, the results provide insight into the consumer psychology of how humans judge authenticity, demonstrating there is an inherent 'scepticism bias' towards positive reviews and a special vulnerability to misjudge the authenticity of fake negative reviews. Additionally, results provide a first insight into the 'machine psychology' of judging fake reviews, revealing that the strategies LLMs take to evaluate authenticity radically differ from humans, in ways that are equally wrong in terms of accuracy, but different in their misjudgments.</description>

      <title>Why do we need to complement the European Union Regional Innovation Scoreboard with an artificial intelligence tool for what-if policy analysis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European Union Regional Innovation Scoreboard (EURIS) is currently and broadly used for the definition of regional innovation policies by European policymakers; it is a regional innovation measuring tool for the analysis of each specific innovation indicator, from which it is possible to analyze the overtime evolution of each regional innovation indicator; according to the importance of the European Union Regional Innovation Scoreboard for innovation policy purposes, we state that European regional policymakers need integrative and synergistic methodological tools, with respect to the EURIS one, for innovation policy purposes. We state the need to integrate the current methodology of the European Regional Innovation Scoreboard with a Factorial K-means (FKM) tool for grouping purposes, and with a neural network (NN) tool for performing what-if policy analyses. Experimental results suggested that our proposed grouping/labeling methodologies are able to develop more compact groups, resulting in regions having better similarities, than the ones developed by the EURIS methodology. Experimental simulations, within the framework of our proposed what-if tool, highlight the potential usefulness of our methodological tool (neural network-based) for the understanding of the potential effectiveness of each possible and specific regional innovation policy to be implemented. We claim that our proposed FKM-NN tool could be used, by regional innovation policymakers, as a very effective synergistic instrument of the European Union Regional Innovation Scoreboard.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Adoption and Higher Order Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how Generative AI (GenAI) adoption is reshaping work. While prior studies show that GenAI enhances role-level productivity and task composition, its influence on skills - the fundamental enablers of task execution, and the ultimate basis for employability - is less understood. Using job postings from 596 US public firms that recruited explicitly for GenAI skills (2022-2024), we analyze how GenAI adoption shifts the demand for workers' domain-specific as well as higher-order (domain-agnostic) skills. Our findings reveal that roles with higher demand for cognitive skills are also more likely to explicitly advertise GenAI tool requirements such as ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Further, a difference-in-differences analysis shows that the demand for social skills within GenAI adopting roles decreases by 4.5 percent post-ChatGPT launch. As cognitive and social skills are both meta-skills - i.e., they support the acquisition of future task-specific skills - our results suggest that the adoption of GenAI may be altering the trajectories of feasible upskilling.</description>

      <title>How Election Shocks Impact Markets: Evidence from Sectoral Stock Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of U.S. presidential election cycles on sectoral stock markets. Using a high-frequency identification approach, I construct a novel "election shock'' series, which captures exogenous surprises in election probabilities. Aside from election outcomes, the largest shocks are associated with events that are orthogonal to innovations in the macroeconomy, e.g., scandals and debates. These shocks have immediate effects on asset prices in sectors that are differentially impacted by the policy platforms of the two major U.S. political parties. In particular, shocks favoring Republican (Democratic) candidates increase (decrease) the asset prices in the energy and defense sectors, while decreasing (increasing) prices in the clean energy sector. These effects persist overtime.</description>

Abstract: There is growing enthusiasm about the potential for humans and AI to collaborate by leveraging their respective strengths. Yet in practice, this promise often falls short. This paper uses an online experiment to identify non-instrumental image concerns as a key reason individuals underutilize AI recommendations. I show that concerns about how one is perceived, even when those perceptions carry no monetary consequences, lead participants to disregard AI advice and reduce task performance.</description>

      <title>Generative AI at the Crossroads: Light Bulb, Dynamo, or Microscope?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of generative AI (genAI), the potential scope of artificial intelligence has increased dramatically, but the future effect of genAI on productivity remains uncertain with the effect of the technology on the innovation process a crucial open question. Some inventions, such as the light bulb, temporarily raise productivity growth as adoption spreads, but the effect fades when the market is saturated; that is, the level of output per hour is permanently higher but the growth rate is not. In contrast, two types of technologies stand out as having longer-lived effects on productivity growth. First, there are technologies known as general-purpose technologies (GPTs). GPTs (1) are widely adopted, (2) spur abundant knock-on innovations (new goods and services, process efficiencies, and business reorganization), and (3) show continual improvement, refreshing this innovation cycle; the electric dynamo is an example. Second, there are inventions of methods of invention (IMIs). IMIs increase the efficiency of the research and development process via improvements to observation, analysis, communication, or organization; the compound microscope is an example. We show that GenAI has the characteristics of both a GPT and an IMI -- an encouraging sign. Even so, for genAI to boost productivity growth, its contribution will have to exceed the fading growth effects of the past IT innovations baked into the trend, including predecessor AI technologies.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Analysis of Tiff's Impact on American Business Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines whether the tariff policies delivered on promises to revitalize American manufacturing and create jobs. Using county-level business application data from 2018-2025, we analyze the relationship between tariff implementation and new business formation through linear regression analysis. Our findings reveal a statistically significant positive association between US tariffs on China and American business applications. However, when Chinese retaliatory tariffs are included in the analysis, their negative coefficient substantially exceeds the positive US tariff effect, suggesting that retaliatory measures largely offset the benefits of protectionist policies. Control variables including inflation rate, federal funds rate, and government spending show significant positive effects on business formation. These results indicate that while protectionist trade policies may stimulate domestic business formation, their effectiveness is significantly diminished by retaliatory responses from trading partners. The study provides evidence that unilateral tariff measures without diplomatic coordination produce limited net benefits, confirming that trade wars create scenarios where potential gains are neutralized by counteractions.</description>
