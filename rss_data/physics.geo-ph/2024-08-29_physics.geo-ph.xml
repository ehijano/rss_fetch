      <title>On the elastoplastic behavior in collisional compression of spherical dust aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aggregates consisting of submicron-sized cohesive dust grains are ubiquitous, and understanding the collisional behavior of dust aggregates is essential. It is known that low-speed collisions of dust aggregates result in either sticking or bouncing, and local and permanent compaction occurs near the contact area upon collision. In this study, we perform numerical simulations of collisions between two aggregates and investigate their compressive behavior. We find that the maximum compression length is proportional to the radius of aggregates and increases with the collision velocity. We also reveal that a theoretical model of contact between two elastoplastic spheres successfully reproduces the size- and velocity-dependence of the maximum compression length observed in our numerical simulations. Our findings on the plastic deformation of aggregates during collisional compression provide a clue to understanding the collisional growth process of aggregates.</description>

      <title>Weakly nonlinear analysis of the onset of convection in rotating spherical shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A weakly nonlinear study is numerically conducted to determine the behaviour near the onset of convection in rotating spherical shells. The mathematical and numerical procedure is described in generality, with the results presented for an Earth-like radius ratio. Through the weakly nonlinear analysis a Stuart--Landau equation is obtained for the amplitude of the convective instability, valid in the vicinity of its onset. Using this amplitude equation we derive a reduced order model for the saturation of the instability via nonlinear effects and can completely describe the resultant limit cycle without the need to solve initial value problems. In particular the weakly nonlinear analysis is able to determine whether convection onsets as a supercritical or subcritical Hopf bifurcation through solving only linear 2D problems, specifically one eigenvalue and two linear boundary value problems. Using this, we efficiently determine that convection can onset subcritically in a spherical shell for a range of Prandtl numbers if the shell is heated internally, confirming previous predictions. Furthermore, by examining the weakly nonlinear coefficients we show that it is the strong zonal flow created through Reynolds and thermal stresses that determines whether convection is supercritical or subcritical.</description>

      <title>Learned frequency-domain scattered wavefield solutions using neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving the wave equation is essential to seismic imaging and inversion. The numerical solution of the Helmholtz equation, fundamental to this process, often encounters significant computational and memory challenges. We propose an innovative frequency-domain scattered wavefield modeling method employing neural operators adaptable to diverse seismic velocities. The source location and frequency information are embedded within the input background wavefield, enhancing the neural operator's ability to process source configurations effectively. In addition, we utilize a single reference frequency, which enables scaling from larger-domain forward modeling to higher-frequency scenarios, thereby improving our method's accuracy and generalization capabilities for larger-domain applications. Several tests on the OpenFWI datasets and realistic velocity models validate the accuracy and efficacy of our method as a surrogate model, demonstrating its potential to address the computational and memory limitations of numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Twist, turn and encounter: the trajectories of small atmospheric particles unravelled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every solid particle in the atmosphere, from ice crystals and pollen to dust, ash, and microplastics, is non-spherical. These particles play significant roles in Earth's climate system, influencing temperature, weather patterns, natural ecosystems, human health, and pollution levels. However, our understanding of these particles is largely based on the theories for extremely small particles and experiments conducted in liquid mediums. In this study, we used an innovative experimental setup and particle-resolved numerical simulations to investigate the behaviour of sub-millimetre ellipsoids of varying shapes in the air. Our results revealed complex decaying oscillation patterns involving numerous twists and turns in these particles, starkly contrasting their dynamics in liquid mediums. We found that the frequency and decay rate of these oscillations have a strong dependence on the particle shape. Interestingly, disk-shaped particles oscillated at nearly twice the frequency of rod-shaped particles, though their oscillations also decayed more rapidly. During oscillation, even subtly non-spherical particles can drift laterally up to ten times their volume-equivalent spherical diameter. This behaviour enables particles to sweep through four times more air both vertically and laterally compared to a volume-equivalent sphere, significantly increasing their encounter rate and aggregation possibility. Our findings provide an explanation for the long-range transport and naturally occurring aggregate formation of highly non-spherical particles such as snowflakes and volcanic ash.</description>
