      <title>H-infinity Optimization for Active Seismic Isolation Systems in Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-frequency seismic noise poses a significant challenge in gravitational-wave detectors, prompting the use of active seismic isolation systems. These systems employ advanced control configurations, including feedback control, sensor correction, and sensor fusion, to mitigate seismic disturbances. Optimal performance of these systems is achieved through the application of the H-infinity method, which optimizes control filters. The H-infinity method was employed to optimize a sensor correction filter and complementary filters for sensor fusion for a KAGRA Type-B suspension, resulting in the development of an instrumentation-optimal ``super sensor''. The super sensor exhibits comparable overall displacement noise RMS performance to a relative sensor, yet offers significantly better band-limited RMS performance around the secondary microseism frequency, making it highly robust to seismic noise. This highlights the efficacy of the H-infinity method in generating seismic isolation filters tailored to instrument limitations, thereby transforming the system into a fully functional active seismic isolation system.</description>

      <title>Single photon performance characterisation of a Generation I Large Area Picosecond PhotoDetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single photoelectron performance characteristics of a Large Area Picosecond PhotoDetector (LAPPD) were studied using a picosecond optical laser source. We verify that the LAPPD is capable of achieving transit time spreads of less than 70 ps and spatial resolutions on the order of millimetres when illuminated with single photons. Isolation of the single photoelectron peak is easily possible in the pulse height distribution and the mean single photoelectron gain is measured to be greater than $10^{6}$ with gains above $10^{7}$ possible in certain voltage configurations. We judge the performance of the LAPPD sufficient for application in large-scale water or scintillator-based neutrino experiments, with additional work required to develop the digital signal processing algorithms necessary for processing photon hits in high photon occupancy environments.</description>

      <title>Application of Optical Stochastic Cooling in Future Accelerator Light Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to combine two promising research topics in accelerator physics, i.e., optical stochastic cooling (OSC) and steady-state microbunching (SSMB). The motivation is to provide a powerful radiation source which could benefit fundamental science research and industry applications. Our study shows that such a compact OSC-SSMB storage ring using present technology can deliver EUV light with an average power of kilowatt, and spectral flux $&gt;10^{20}$ phs/s/0.1\%b.w., which is four orders of magnitude higher than existing synchrotron sources. It is expected that the presented work is of value for the development of both OSC and SSMB.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary-phase locking of fiber Mach-Zehnder interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical interferometers are extensively used in fundamental physics test, gravitational wave detection, quantum metrology, topological photonics, and quantum information processing. Fiber-based interferometers are compact, robust and cheap, thus are ubiquitously deployed. However, the optical phase in fiber interferometers is sensitive to ambient perturbation, resulting in compromised phase sensing precision. Therefore, phase control, shifting and stabilization of fiber interferometers is essential. Methods to create stable interference patterns and to lock a fiber interferometer at arbitrary phase have been shown, which however are sophisticated, bulky and delicate, preventing wider application in harsh environment outside laboratories or in space. Here we demonstrate a new method for arbitrary-phase locking of fiber unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Compared to existing method, our method is simpler, more robust and more compact. We showcase the preparation and characterization of narrow-band energy-time-entanglement photon state generated in integrated nonlinear microresonators, where two-photon interference visibility reaching 0.993(6) is enabled. Our method constitutes a critical building block for photonic quantum network, and is useful to emerging single-photon interference in curved space-time that facilitates exploration of the interface of quantum mechanics and general relativity.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of atomic vapor magnetization for in situ calibration of tri-axial time-dependent magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a methodology to calibrate in situ a set of coils generating bi- or tri-axial magnetic fields, at frequencies where a calibration performed under static conditions would be inaccurate. The coil constants are determined in a two-step procedure. Considering the presence of a static and a time-dependent field, firstly, the static one is oriented perpendicularly to the polarization plane of a time-dependent one; secondly, the polarization of the latter is made accurately circular. The methodology uses harmonic analysis of one component of the magnetization of an atomic sample whose spins adiabatically follow the time-dependent field.</description>

      <title>Burn-in Test and Thermal Performance Evaluation of Silicon Photomultipliers for the JUNO-TAO Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates more than 4,000 tiles made of Hamamatsu visual-sensitive silicon photomultipier (SiPM), each with dimensions of 5 $\times$ 5 cm$^2$, intended for the central detector of the Taishan Anti-neutrino Observatory (TAO), a satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) aimed at measuring the reactor anti-neutrino energy spectrum with unprecedented energy resolution. All SiPM tiles underwent a room temperature burn-in test in the dark for two weeks, while cryogenic testing analyzed the thermal dependence of parameters for some sampled SiPMs. Results from these comprehensive tests provide crucial insights into the long-term performance and stability of the 10 square meters of SiPMs operating at -50{\deg}C to detect scintillation photons in the TAO detector. Despite some anomalies awaiting further inspection, all SiPMs successfully passed the burn-in test over two weeks at room temperature, which is equivalent to 6.7 years at -50{\deg}C. Results are also used to guide optimal SiPM selection, configuration, and operation, ensuring reliability and sustainability in reactor neutrino measurements. This work also provides insights for a rapid and robust quality assessment in future experiments that employ large-scale SiPMs as detection systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance Mass Spectrometry with the Canadian Penning Trap at CARIBU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer (CPT) has conducted precision mass measurements of neutron-rich nuclides from the CAlifornia Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) of the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) facility at Argonne National Laboratory for over a decade, first using Time-Of-Flight Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance (TOF-ICR) and later using Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance (PI-ICR) techniques. Here we give an overview of the CPT system as it was operated for PI-ICR measurements at CARIBU for over half a decade, along with some recently studied systematic effects.</description>
