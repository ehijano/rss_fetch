      <title>Spectral theory of non-Markovian dissipative phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative phase transitions in quantum systems have been largely studied under the so-called Markovian approximation, where the environments to which the systems are coupled are memoryless. Here, we present a generalization of the spectral theory of dissipative phase transitions to non-Markovian systems, encompassing a much broader class of quantum materials and experiments and opening many possibilities for non-Markovian engineering of matter phases such as, as explored in the companion Letter [Debecker et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 140403 (2024)], reshaping of phase boundaries and triggering of phase transitions. We first prove several statements about the connections between the spectrum of the generator of the non-Markovian dynamics of general systems and dissipative phase transitions. Then, as a benchmark, we show that our framework can capture all the expected signatures of the superradiant phase transition appearing in a challenging $U(1)$-symmetric two-mode Dicke model from a reduced description of the dynamics of the atoms only, a task for which all other methods have failed so far.</description>

      <title>Circuit Quantisation in Hamiltonian Framework: A Constraint Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we apply Dirac's Constraint Analysis (DCA) to solve Superconducting Quantum Circuits (SQC). The Lagrangian of a SQC reveals the constraints, that are classified in a Hamiltonian framework, such that redundant variables can be removed to isolate the canonical degrees of freedom for subsequent quantization of the Dirac Brackets. We demonstrate the robustness of DCA unlike certain other set of ideas like null vector and loop charge which are each applicable only to specific types of quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Tomography of Photonic Qubits with Realistic Coherent Light Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an essential technique for characterizing quantum states. However, practical implementations of QST are significantly challenged by factors such as shot noise, attenuation, and Raman scattering, especially when photonic qubits are transmitted through optical fibers alongside classical signals. In this paper, we present a numerical framework to simulate and evaluate the efficiency of QST under these realistic conditions. The results reveal how the efficiency of QST is influenced by the power of the classical signal. By analyzing the fidelity of reconstructed states, we provide insights into the limitations and potential improvements for QST in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>The complexity of entanglement embezzlement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement is the counterintuitive process in which entanglement is extracted from a resource system using local unitary operations, with almost no detectable change in the resource's state. It has recently been argued that any state of a relativistic quantum field theory can serve as a resource for perfect embezzlement. We study the circuit complexity of embezzlement, using sequences of states that enable arbitrary precision for the process, commonly called universal embezzling families. In addition, we argue that this approach provides a well-defined model for the complexity of embezzlement from quantum field theories. Our results show that, under fairly general assumptions, lower bounds on the complexity increase with the precision of the process or embezzled entanglement, diverging as these become infinite. Consequently, the findings imply that circuit complexity acts as a physical obstruction to perfect embezzlement. Supplementary to the main results, we derive lower bounds for common models of circuit complexity for state preparation, based on the difference between the Schatten norms of the initial and final states.</description>

      <title>1D Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in thermal equilibrium via Non-Hermitian Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking generally circumvents one-dimensional systems with local interactions in thermal equilibrium. Here, we analyze a category of one-dimensional Hermitian models via local non-Hermitian constructions. Notably, spontaneous symmetry breaking and long-range order may emerge at finite temperatures in such systems under periodic boundary conditions, in sharp contrast to Hermitian constructions. We demonstrate clear numerical evidence, such as order parameters and specific heat, supporting phase diagrams with robust ordered phases. Non-Hermitian physics plays a vital role in prohibiting domain-wall proliferation and promoting spontaneous symmetry breaking. The fermions exhibit an exotic topological nature in their path-integral windings, which uphold nonzero integers -- commonly a non-Hermitian signature -- in the ordered phases, thus offering a novel and spontaneous origin for both symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Oracle Separations for the Quantum-Classical Polynomial Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum-classical polynomial hierarchy, QCPH, which is the class of languages solvable by a constant number of alternating classical quantifiers followed by a quantum verifier. Our main result is that QCPH is infinite relative to a random oracle (previously, this was not even known relative to any oracle). We further prove that higher levels of PH are not contained in lower levels of QCPH relative to a random oracle; this is a strengthening of the somewhat recent result that PH is infinite relative to a random oracle (Rossman, Servedio, and Tan 2016).
  The oracle separation requires lower bounding a certain type of low-depth alternating circuit with some quantum gates. To establish this, we give a new switching lemma for quantum algorithms which may be of independent interest. Our lemma says that for any $d$, if we apply a random restriction to a function $f$ with quantum query complexity $\mathrm{Q}(f)\le n^{1/3}$, the restricted function becomes exponentially close (in terms of $d$) to a depth-$d$ decision tree. Our switching lemma works even in a "worst-case" sense, in that only the indices to be restricted are random; the values they are restricted to are chosen adversarially. Moreover, the switching lemma also works for polynomial degree in place of quantum query complexity.</description>

      <title>SU($N$) symmetry with ultracold alkali dimers: weak dependence of scattering properties on hyperfine state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of using ultracold alkali diatomic molecules to implement many-body quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry. Experimentally accessible molecules offer large $N$ for both bosonic and fermionic systems, with both attractive and repulsive interactions. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations on pairs of NaK, NaRb and NaCs molecules that are shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields. We develop new methods to handle the very large basis sets required to include nuclear spins. We show that all the molecules studied have the properties required for SU($N$) symmetry: the collisions are principally elastic, and the scattering lengths depend only weakly on the spin states of the molecules. The rates of spin-changing inelastic collisions are very low. We develop and test a semiclassical model of the spin dependence and find that it performs well.</description>

      <title>The advent of fully variational quantum eigensolvers using a hybrid multiresolution approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In electronic structure theory, variational computing offers a valuable paradigm for the approximation of electronic ground states. However, for historical reasons, this principle is mostly restricted to model-chemistries in pre-defined fixed basis sets. Especially in quantum computation, these model-chemistries are far from an accurate description of the initial electronic Hamiltonian. Throwing down the gauntlet, we here demonstrate a fully variational approach to the electronic structure problem by variationally optimizing the orbitals representing the second quantized Hamiltonian alongside a quantum circuit that generates the many-electron wavefunction. To this end, the orbitals are represented within an adaptive multi-wavelet format, guaranteeing numerical precision. We then showcase explicit numerical protocols and highlight the quantum circuit's effects on determining the optimal orbital basis.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the effects of quantum deformation in the undeformed Jaynes-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model, the time dependence in the coupling parameter allows changes in the forms of the Rabi oscillations. In the inverse problem approach (IPA), the time-dependent coupling parameter is obtained from the resulting population inversion. In this work, we employ the IPA to obtain a time-dependent coupling that reproduces the effects of $\kappa$-deformation in an undeformed JC. This is relevant because it may pave the way for interpreting quantum deformation in the $\kappa$-JC and possibly enables an experimental verification in a setting where the coupling can be precisely controlled. We also propose a generalized IPA, which includes the cavity with a distribution of photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a modification to QMA where having one quantum proof is strictly less powerful than having two unentangled proofs, assuming EXP $\ne$ NEXP. This gives a new route to prove QMA(2) = NEXP that overcomes the primary drawback of a recent approach [arXiv:2402.18790 , arXiv:2306.13247] (QIP 2024). Our modification endows each proof with a form of *multipartite* unentanglement: after tracing out one register, a small number of qubits are separable from the rest of the state.</description>

      <title>Role of Quantum Coherence in Chirped Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) is transforming NMR and MRI by significantly enhancing sensitivity through the transfer of polarization from electron spins to nuclear spins via microwave irradiation. However, the use of monochromatic continuous-wave (CW) irradiation limits the efficiency of DNP for systems with heterogeneous broad EPR lines. Broad-band techniques such as chirp irradiation offer a solution, particularly for Solid Effect (SE) DNP in such cases. Despite its widespread use, the role of quantum coherence generated during chirp irradiation remains unclear, even though it is a key factor in determining the maximum achievable DNP efficiency. In this work, we use density matrix formalism to provide a comprehensive understanding of the quantum coherence generated during electron-nucleus double-quantum (DQ) and zero-quantum (ZQ) SE transitions and their impact on Integrated Solid Effect (ISE) DNP under chirp irradiation. Our analysis employs fictitious product-operator bases to trace the evolution of electron-nucleus coherence leading to integrated or differentiated SE. We also explore the previously unexamined role of decoherence in optimizing chirped DNP. These findings provide new insights into low-temperature DNP and triplet DNP using photoexcited electrons.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Representation of Commutative Quantum Circuit Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In commuting parametric quantum circuits, the Fourier series of the pairwise fidelity can be expressed as the characteristic function of random variables. Furthermore, expressiveness can be cast as the recurrence probability of a random walk on a lattice. This construction has been successfully applied to the group composed only of Pauli-Z rotations, and we generalize this probabilistic strategy to any commuting set of Pauli operators. We utilize an efficient algorithm by van den Berg and Temme (2020) using the tableau representation of Pauli strings to yield a unitary from the Clifford group that, under conjugation, simultaneously diagonalizes our commuting set of Pauli rotations. Furthermore, we fully characterize the underlying distribution of the random walk using stabilizer states and their basis state representations. This would allow us to tractably compute the lattice volume and variance matrix used to express the frame potential. Together, this demonstrates a scalable strategy to calculate the expressiveness of parametric quantum models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decomposition from the group theory-based methods of Sasao and Saraivanov is extended to design binary quantum cascades, using the quantum rotational gates by the X-axis (CNOT and RX), Y-axis (RY), and Z-axis (controlled-Z) of the Bloch sphere. A class of local transformations is also presented to simplify the final canonical cascade circuits. Our proposed methodology is well suited for quantum layouts, as each single-qubit gate has one target qubit and each double-qubit gate has one control qubit and one target qubit, thereby never creating a graph of triangular connectivity.</description>

      <title>Performance advantage of discriminating one-versus-two incoherent sources based on quantum hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting the presence of multiple incoherent sources is a fundamental and challenging task for quantum imaging, especially within sub-Rayleigh region. In this paper, the discrimination of one-versus-two point-like incoherent sources in symmetric and asymmetric scenarios is studied. We calculate the quantum lower bounds on error probabilities of making a decision after one-shot and multi-shot tests. The results are compared with the error probability of prior-based direct guess, and the minimal number of tests required to make a decision outperforming direct guess is discussed. We also show the asymptotic quantum lower bound for a large number of tests. For practical purposes, we propose a specific strategy along with decision rule of which can work without any prior knowledge. With respect to each of two scenarios, the error probability can approach the quantum lower bound in one-shot test as well as multi-shot test. In addition, the potential challenges and solutions in a realistic scenario are analyzed. Our results may contribute to real-world quantum imaging such as microscopy and astronomy.</description>

      <title>An Evidence of Addressing Coherence Errors in VQE Observables by Pulse-level VQE Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an advanced area of computing that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics. Quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize various fields by handling problems that are currently intractable for classical computers. This research focuses on Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. We introduce and evaluate over-rotation and under-rotation errors in the measurement process, which are critical for obtaining accurate expectation values of Hamiltonians. Our study aims to determine the extent to which these errors affect the estimated ground state energy and the computational cost in terms of optimization iterations. We conducted experiments on H2 and HeH+ molecules, varying the rotation angle, and recorded the estimated energy and optimization iterations. Our findings indicate that the pulse-level VQE algorithm exhibits resilience to quantum errors in terms of accuracy. Additionally, our results suggest that less frequent calibration of measurement rotation pulses may be sufficient, thereby saving substantial time and computational resources. However, it is important to note that while accuracy remains stable, the iteration count may still vary, necessitating a trade-off between calibration frequency and computational cost. Our work complements previous research by focusing on the observable aspect of VQEs, which has been largely overlooked. This detailed analysis contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of VQE performance in the NISQ era and supports the design and implementation of more efficient quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient charging of multiple open quantum batteries through dissipation and pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a protocol that efficiently charges multiple open quantum batteries in parallel using a single charger. This protocol shows super-extensive charging through collective coupling of the charger and the battery to the same thermal reservoir. When applied to multiple quantum batteries, each coupled to different thermal reservoirs, the energy cannot be efficiently transferred from the charger to the battery via collective dissipation alone. We show that the counter-intuitive act of incorporating both dissipation and incoherent collective pumping on the charger enables efficient parallel charging of many quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandomness in the (Inverseless) Haar Random Oracle Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the (in)feasibility of quantum pseudorandom notions in a quantum analog of the random oracle model, where all the parties, including the adversary, have oracle access to the same Haar random unitary. In this model, we show the following:
  - (Unbounded-query secure) pseudorandom unitaries (PRU) exist. Moreover, the PRU construction makes two calls to the Haar oracle.
  - We consider constructions of PRUs making a single call to the Haar oracle. In this setting, we show that unbounded-query security is impossible to achieve. We complement this result by showing that bounded-query secure PRUs do exist with a single query to the Haar oracle.
  - We show that multi-copy pseudorandom state generators and function-like state generators (with classical query access), making a single call to the Haar oracle, exist.
  Our results have two consequences: (a) when the Haar random unitary is instantiated suitably, our results present viable approaches for building quantum pseudorandom objects without relying upon one-way functions and, (b) for the first time, we show that the key length in pseudorandom unitaries can be generically shrunk (relative to the output length). Our results are also some of the first usecases of the new "path recording" formalism for Haar random unitaries, introduced in the recent breakthrough work of Ma and Huang.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Key Distribution with Entanglement Distillation and Classical Advantage Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing secure communication between distant parties is one of quantum technology's main goals. Although quantum key distribution promises information-theoretic security for sharing a secret key, the key rate heavily depends on the level of noise in the quantum channel. To overcome the noise, both quantum and classical techniques exist, i.e., entanglement distillation and classical advantage distillation. So far, these techniques have only been used separately from each other. Herein, we present a two-stage distillation scheme concatenating entanglement distillation with classical advantage distillation. While for the advantage distillation, we use a fixed protocol, i.e., the repetition code, in the case of entanglement distillation, we employ an enumeration algorithm to find the optimal protocol. We test our scheme for different noisy entangled states and demonstrate its quantitative advantage: our two-stage distillation scheme achieves finite key rates even in the high-noise regime where entanglement distillation or advantage distillation alone cannot afford key sharing. Since the advantage distillation part does not introduce further requirements on quantum resources, the proposed scheme is well-suited for near-term quantum key distribution tasks.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner-Smith analysis of resonance perturbations in low $Q$ non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbing resonant systems causes shifts in their associated scattering poles in the complex plane. In a previous study [arXiv: 2408.11360], we demonstrated that these shifts can be calculated numerically by analyzing the residue of a generalized Wigner-Smith operator associated with the perturbation parameter. In this work, we extend this approach by connecting the Wigner-Smith formalism with results from standard electromagnetic perturbation theory applicable to open systems with resonances of arbitrary quality factors. We further demonstrate the utility of the method through several numerical examples, including the inverse design of a multi-layered nanoresonator sensor and an analysis of the enhanced sensitivity of scattering zeros to perturbations.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Boundaries: Interferometric Mass Photometry at the Quantum Limit of Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an innovative optical imaging system for measuring parameters of a small particle such as a macromolecule or nanoparticle at the quantum limit of sensitivity. In comparison to the conventional confocal interferometric scattering (iSCAT) approach, our setup adds a second arm to form a Michelson interferometer that allows us to tune a relative phase. We evaluate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) for different quantum states, including single-mode coherent states, multi-frequency coherent states, and phase-averaged coherent states. Our results show that the proposed setup can achieve the QCRB of sensitivity and outperform iSCAT for all considered quantum states for mass and phase estimation of a particle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We defined and used a pair of Hermitian annihilation and creation operators which generate the generalized coherent states, defined in the Barut-Girardello manner, whose normalization function is just the four-parameter generalized Mittag-Leffler function. We examined the characteristic properties for these pure, as well as mixed (thermal) coherent states. All calculations are made using the rules of the technique of diagonal ordering of operators. Finally, the integral counterpart of the Mittag-Leffler coherent states are examined which is connected with nu-function. The paper is an example of the application of a mathematical entity (Mittag-Leffler function) in quantum mechanics (coherent states formalism).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo particle transport codes are well established on classical hardware and are considered as the reference tool for nuclear applications. In a growing number of domains, the design of algorithms is progressively shifting towards the field of quantum computing, where theoretical speedups over their classical counterparts are expected. In some of these domains, Monte Carlo methods have already been converted to a quantum computing friendly setup where the expected and observed gain in complexity is quadratic. Surprisingly, particle transport has been left aside along the path and lacks an implementation on these new architectures. In this work, a numerical scheme for particle transport based on discrete-time quantum walks and its combination with the amplitude amplification routine are proposed to catch up with the promised speedups.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of approximations for describing quantum light from high-harmonic generation: A Fermi-Hubbard model study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum optical description of high-order harmonic generation where both the electrons of the generating medium and the driving and generated light fields are described quantum mechanically has been of significant interest in the past years. The quantum optical formulation leads to equations of motion for the generated light field in which the quantum optical field couples to the time-dependent current of the electronic medium irrespectively of the specifics of the electronic system being an atom, molecule, or solid. These equations of motion are not solvable for any realistic system and accurate and verified approximations are hence needed. In this work, we present a hierarchy of approximations for the equations of motion for the photonic state. At each level in this hierarchy, we compare it to the previous level justifying the validity using the Fermi-Hubbard model as an example of an electronic system with correlations. This model allows us to perform an accurate simulation of the electron motion of all the required states. We find that for the typical experimental situation of weak quantized-light-matter-coupling constant and at intensities well below the damage threshold, an explicit expression for the generated quantum light, referred to as the Markov-state approximation (MSA), captures the high-harmonic spectrum quantitatively and describes the single-mode quantum properties of the generated light as characterized by the Mandel-Q parameter and the degree of squeezing qualitatively.</description>

      <title>The product structure of MPS-under-permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network methods have proved to be highly effective in addressing a wide variety of physical scenarios, including those lacking an intrinsic one-dimensional geometry. In such contexts, it is possible for the problem to exhibit a weak form of permutational symmetry, in the sense that entanglement behaves similarly across any arbitrary bipartition. In this paper, we show that translationally-invariant (TI) matrix product states (MPS) with this property are trivial, meaning that they are either product states or superpositions of a few of them. The results also apply to non-TI generic MPS, as well as further relevant examples of MPS including the W state and the Dicke states in an approximate sense. Our findings motivate the usage of ans\"atze simpler than tensor networks in systems whose structure is invariant under permutations.</description>

      <title>Topological bosonic Bogoliubov excitations with sublattice symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we investigate the internal sublattice symmetry, and thus the enriched topological classification of bosonic Bogoliubov excitations of thermodynamically stable free-boson systems with non-vanishing particle-number-nonconserving terms. Specifically, we show that such systems well described by the bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian can be in general reduced to particle-number-conserving (single-particle) ones. Building upon this observation, the sublattice symmetry is uncovered with respect to an excitation energy, which is usually hidden in the bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian. Thus, we obtain an additional topological class, i.e., class AIII, which enriches the framework for the topological threefold way of free-boson systems. Moreover, a construction is proposed to show a category of systems respecting such a symmetry. For illustration, we resort to a one-dimensional (1D) prototypical model to demonstrate the topological excitation characterized by a winding number or symplectic polarization. By introducing the correlation function, we present an approach to measure the topological invariant. In addition, the edge excitation together with its robustness to symmetry-preserving disorders is also discussed.</description>

      <title>High-impedance resonators for strong coupling to an electron on helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in-plane motion of an electron on helium can couple to superconducting microwave resonators via electrical dipole coupling, offering a robust and rapid readout scheme. In previous efforts, microwave resonator designs for electrons on helium have lacked the coupling strength to reach the strong coupling regime, where coherent quantum effects outlast both electron and resonator decoherence rates. High-impedance superconducting microwave resonators offer a path to strong coupling, but integrating such resonators with electrons on helium remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we introduce a high-impedance resonator design compatible with strong coupling to electrons on helium. We fabricate and measure titanium nitride resonators with median internal quality factors of $3.9\times 10^5$ and average impedance of 2.5 k$\Omega$, promising a seven-fold increase in coupling strength compared with standard 50$\Omega$ resonators. Additionally, we develop a simplified resonator model from the capacitance matrix and sheet inductance that accurately predicts the mode frequencies, significantly simplifying the design process of future resonators for investigating quantum effects with electrons on helium.</description>

Abstract: Recently, it has been proposed a new method [arXiv:2405.21029] to detect quantum gravity effects, based on generating gravitational entanglement between two nano-diamonds with Nitrogen-Vacancy defects, in a magnetically trapped configuration. Here we analyse in detail the proposed experimental setup, with a particular focus on implementing the detection of the gravitationally-induced entanglement using an optical readout based on measuring the position of the nano-diamonds and its complementary basis. We also summarise some of the key theoretical and experimental ideas on which this proposed scheme is based.</description>

      <title>The complexity of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of state complexity for continuous-variable quantum systems. Concretely, we consider a setup with bosonic modes and auxiliary qubits, where available operations include Gaussian one- and two-mode operations, single- and two-qubit operations, as well as qubit-controlled phase-space displacements. We define the (approximate) complexity of a bosonic state by the minimum size of a circuit that prepares an $L^1$-norm approximation to the state. We propose a new circuit which prepares an approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state $|\mathsf{GKP}_{\kappa,\Delta}\rangle$. Here $\kappa^{-2}$ is the variance of the envelope and $\Delta^2$ is the variance of the individual peaks. We show that the circuit accepts with constant probability and -- conditioned on acceptance -- the output state is polynomially close in $(\kappa,\Delta)$ to the state $|\mathsf{GKP}_{\kappa,\Delta}\rangle$. The size of our circuit is linear in $(\log 1/\kappa,\log 1/\Delta)$. To our knowledge, this is the first protocol for GKP-state preparation with fidelity guarantees for the prepared state. We also show converse bounds, establishing that the linear circuit-size dependence of our construction is optimal. This fully characterizes the complexity of GKP states.</description>

      <title>Fast Scrambling in Classically Simulable Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study operator scrambling in quantum circuits built from `super-Clifford' gates. For such circuits it was established in arXiv:2002.12824 that the time evolution of operator entanglement for a large class of many-body operators can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, including for operators with volume-law entanglement. Here we extend the scope of this formalism in two key ways. Firstly we provide evidence that these classically simulable circuits include examples of fast scramblers, by constructing a circuit for which operator entanglement is numerically found to saturate in a time $t_* \sim \mathrm{ln}(N)$ (with $N$ the number of qubits). Secondly we demonstrate that, in addition to operator entanglement, certain out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs) can be classically simulated within the same formalism. As a consequence such OTOCs can be computed numerically in super-Clifford circuits with thousands of qubits, and we study several explicit examples in the aforementioned fast scrambling circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum information processing tasks are important subroutines in quantum information science because they are robust against any type of measurement imperfections. In this work, we propose a framework of MDI resource characterization protocols that unifies and generalizes these tasks. We show that resources that do not increase under local operation and shared randomness can be characterized with any untrusted measurement, and we provide a general procedure to convert such resource characterization tasks into MDI protocols. We then focus on applying our framework to two cases that satisfy the criteria: the resource theory of bipartite and multipartite entanglement, and the resource theory of quantum memories. We demonstrate several MDI characterization protocols for these resources. These protocols are either novel or generalize existing ones from the literature. We also show that MDI quantum key distribution can be viewed as an MDI quantification protocol for quantum memory.</description>

      <title>Design nearly optimal quantum algorithm for linear differential equations via Lindbladians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving linear ordinary differential equations (ODE) is one of the most promising applications for quantum computers to demonstrate exponential advantages. The challenge of designing a quantum ODE algorithm is how to embed non-unitary dynamics into intrinsically unitary quantum circuits. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm for ODEs by harnessing open quantum systems. Specifically, we utilize the natural non-unitary dynamics of Lindbladians with the aid of a new technique called the non-diagonal density matrix encoding to encode general linear ODEs into non-diagonal blocks of density matrices. This framework enables us to design a quantum algorithm that has both theoretical simplicity and good performance. Combined with the state-of-the-art quantum Lindbladian simulation algorithms, our algorithm, under a plausible input model, can outperform all existing quantum ODE algorithms and achieve near-optimal dependence on all parameters. We also give applications of our algorithm including the Gibbs state preparations and the partition function estimations.</description>

      <title>Automated generation of photonic circuits for Bell tests with homodyne measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal quantum realizations, certified by the violation of a Bell inequality, are core resources for device-independent quantum information processing. Although proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating device-independent quantum information processing have already been reported, identifying physical platforms that are realistically closer to practical, viable devices remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present an automated framework for designing photonic implementations of nonlocal realizations using homodyne detections and quantum state heralding. Combining deep reinforcement learning and efficient simulations of quantum optical processes, our method generates photonic circuits that achieve significant violations of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. In particular, we find an experimental setup, robust to losses, that yields a CHSH violation of \boldsymbol{$2.068$} with \boldsymbol{$3.9$}~dB and \boldsymbol{$0.008$}~dB squeezed light sources and two beam splitters.</description>

      <title>Coherent and incoherent light scattering by single-atom wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study light scattering of single atoms in free space and discuss the results in terms of atom-photon entanglement and which-way information. Using ultracold atoms released from an optical lattice, we realize a Gedanken experiment which interferes single photons scattering off of Heisenberg uncertainty-limited wavepackets. We unify the free-space and trapped-atom pictures by measuring the light scattered during wavepacket expansion and show the coherence properties of the scattered light is independent of the presence of the trap. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of using atomic Mott insulators to create single-atom wavepackets for fundamental studies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Online Exp-concave Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore whether quantum advantages can be found for the zeroth-order feedback online exp-concave optimization problem, which is also known as bandit exp-concave optimization with multi-point feedback. We present quantum online quasi-Newton methods to tackle the problem and show that there exists quantum advantages for such problems. Our method approximates the Hessian by quantum estimated inexact gradient and can achieve $O(n\log T)$ regret with $O(1)$ queries at each round, where $n$ is the dimension of the decision set and $T$ is the total decision rounds. Such regret improves the optimal classical algorithm by a factor of $T^{2/3}$.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study vortex solutions in the 2+1 dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations. These solutions include the regularized long-wave (RLW) equation and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, which are toy models of the geostrophic shallow water model in the planetary atmosphere. PINNs successfully solve these equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper equations can be successfully derived from a given training data. Since these equations have a lot in common, there are situations when substantial misidentification arises during the inverse analysis. We consider PINNs with conservation laws (referred to as cPINNs), deformations of the initial profiles, and a friction approach that provides excellent discrimination of the equations to improve the identification's resolution.</description>

      <title>Edge state behavior of interacting Bosons in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the low momentum regime, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model's key characteristics are encapsulated by a Dirac-type Hamiltonian in continuum space, i.e., the localized states emerge at the boundaries. Building on this, we have developed an effective Hamiltonian to model ultra cold interacting Bosons on an SSH like lattice through variational minimization under the mean field approximation. To pinpoint the boundary states, we have developed an algorithm by generalizing the imaginary time propagator, where a initial state evolves under the squared Hamiltonian to converge to the targeted state. This algorithm has broader applicability, enabling the identification of specific eigenstates in various contexts. Furthermore, we draw a parallel to an experimentally physical setup involving a gas of ultra cold Bosons confined to an array of potential wells with alternating depths. By establishing the system's analogy with the SSH system, we apply our algorithm to investigate boundary states in the presence of interaction, demonstrating how these findings align with those of the continuous system.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for fermionic symmetry-enriched topological phases and fermionic 't Hooft anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry and topological properties plays a very important role in modern physics. In the past decade, the concept of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases was proposed and their classifications have been systematically studied for bosonic systems. Very recently, the concept of SET phases has been generalized into fermionic systems and their corresponding classification schemes are also proposed. Nevertheless, how to realize all these fermionic SET (fSET) phases in lattice models remains to be a difficult open problem. In this paper, we first construct exactly solvable models for non-anomalous non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases, namely, the symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net models, which are described by commuting-projector Hamiltonians whose ground states are the fixed-point wavefunctions of each fSET phase. Mathematically, we provide a partial definition to $G$-graded super fusion category, which is the input data of a symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net model. Next, we construct exactly solvable models for non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases with 't Hooft anomaly, especially the $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly which is different from the well known bosonic $H^4(G,U(1)_T)$ anomaly. In our construction, this $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly is characterized by a violation of fermion-parity conservation in some of the surface $\mathcal{F}$-moves (a kind of renormalization moves for the ground state wavefunctions of surface SET phases), and also by a new fermionic obstruction $\Theta$ in the surface pentagon equation. We demonstrate this construction in a concrete example that the surface topological order is a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory embedded into a fermion system and the total symmetry $G^f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$.</description>

      <title>Ultra precise determination of Cs($nS_{1/2}$) and Cs($nD_J$) quantum defects for sensing and computing: Evaluation of core contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make absolute frequency measurements of Cs Rydberg transitions, $\vert 6S_{1/2}, F=3 \rangle \rightarrow \vert nS_{1/2}~(n=23\rm{-}90)\rangle$ and $\vert nD_{3/2,5/2}~(n=21\rm{-}90)\rangle$, with an accuracy of less than $ 72\,\rm kHz$. The quantum defect parameters for the measured Rydberg series are the most precise obtained to date. The quantum defect series is terminated at $\delta_4$, showing that prior fits requiring higher order quantum defects reflect uncertainties in the observations. The precision of the measured quantum defects allow for the calculation of Rydberg electric-dipole transitions and fine-structure intervals extrapolated from high principal quantum numbers, to rival that of sophisticated many-body relativistic calculations carried out at low Rydberg principal quantum numbers. We quantitatively predict the contributions to the quantum defect parameters from core polarization and core penetration of Cs inner shell electrons. A new value for the ionization energy, consistent across the $ nS_{1/2}$ and $ nD_{3/2,5/2}$ Rydberg series, is reported at $31406.467 751 48 (14)~\rm{cm}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale magnetic ordering dynamics in a high Curie temperature ferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermally driven transitions between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases are characterized by critical behavior with divergent susceptibilities, long-range correlations, and spin dynamics that can span kHz to GHz scales as the material approaches the critical temperature $\mathrm{T_c}$, but it has proven technically challenging to probe the relevant length and time scales with most conventional measurement techniques. In this study, we employ scanning nitrogen-vacancy center based magnetometry and relaxometry to reveal the critical behavior of a high-$\mathrm{T_c}$ ferromagnetic oxide near its Curie temperature. Cluster analysis of the measured temperature-dependent nanoscale magnetic textures points to a 3D universality class with a correlation length that diverges near $\mathrm{T_c}$. Meanwhile, the temperature-dependent spin dynamics, measured through all optical relaxometry suggest that the phase transition is in the XY universality class. Our results capture both static and dynamic aspects of critical behavior, providing insights into universal properties that govern phase transitions in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Absorption of a twisted photon by an electron in strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work investigates absorption of a twisted photon, which possesses quantized total angular momentum (TAM), by a relativistic electron with the Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 1-10$ in a strong magnetic field up to the Schwinger limit, $H_c = 4.4\cdot 10^{13}$ G. We examine the absorption cross sections and their dependence on the parameters of the incident photon and the initial Landau electron. It is found that total absorption cross sections decrease as angular momentum of the incident photon increases and increase as angular momentum of the initial electron grows. The process is also compared across different magnetic field strengths, and the contribution of various electron spin transitions to total absorption cross section is analyzed. We also find that the processes without an electron spin flip dominate and, on top of that, an asymmetry in the ``spin-down'' $\rightarrow$ ``spin-up'' and the ``spin-up'' $\rightarrow$ ``spin-down'' transitions is observed. Specifically, the cross sections for the ``spin-down'' $\rightarrow$ ``spin-up'' transition are larger, which can be interpreted as an analogy of the Sokolov-Ternov effect present for photon emission. Finally, the cross sections are found to be almost constant as the transverse momentum of the photon varies from $0.1$ eV to $100$ keV. Our findings can help to improve the understanding of the QED processes in critical fields, typical for astrophysical environments, e.g. magnetospheres of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Quantum Probabilities Are Objective Degrees of Epistemic Justification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QBism is currently one of the most widely discussed 'subjective' interpretations of quantum mechanics. Its key move is to say that quantum probabilities are personalist Bayesian probabilities and that the quantum state represents subjective degrees of belief. Even probability-one predictions are considered subjective assignments expressing the agent's highest possible degree of certainty about what they will experience next. For most philosophers and physicists this means that QBism is simply too subjective. Even those who agree with QBism that the wave function should not be reified and that we should look for alternatives to standard Psi-ontic interpretations often argue that QBism must be abandoned because it detaches science from objectivity. The problem is that from the QBist perspective it is hard to see how objectivity could enter science. In this paper, I introduce and motivate an interpretation of quantum mechanics that takes QBism as a starting point, is consistent with all its virtues, but allows objectivity to enter from the get-go. This is the view that quantum probabilities should be understood as objective degrees of epistemic justification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement breaking (EB) channels, as completely positive and trace-preserving linear operators, sever the entanglement between the input system and other systems. In the realm of infinite-dimensional systems, a related concept known as strongly entanglement breaking (SEB) channels emerges. This paper delves into characterizations of SEB channels, delineating necessary and sufficient conditions for a channel to be classified as SEB, especially with respect to the commutativity of its range. Moreover, we demonstrate that every closed self-adjoint subspace of trace-zero operators, with the trace norm, is the null space of a SEB channel.</description>

      <title>Finite Temperature Casimir Effect of Scalar Field: Revisit and New Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For both the one-dimensional and three-dimensional scalar fields at finite temperature, we find the analytic expressions of Gibbs free energy, Casimir force, and Casimir entropy. These results show that the widely used low-temperature approximation of thermal correction of Casimir force, $\pi{T}e^{-\pi{v}\hbar/aT}/2a^3$, have large errors with the exact solution. For three-dimensional scalar field, we find the leading order thermal correction of Gibbs free energy density, $F(a,T)=3\zeta(7/2)aT^4/8\pi^{3/2}(v\hbar)^3$, where $\zeta(.)$ represents the Riemann $\zeta$ function. This thermal correction can not be cancelled by the blackbody radiation density, $\pi^2{a}T^4/90(v\hbar)^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the development of a high-power ultraviolet laser system operating at a wavelength of 325 nm for Rydberg excitation from the ${}^3\mathrm{P}_2$ state of ytterbium. Utilizing a two-stage frequency doubling scheme, we achieved an output power exceeding 800 mW. The system effectively suppresses frequency noise in the MHz range, which is critical for achieving high Rydberg excitation fidelity, through the use of a filtering cavity. Using this system, we demonstrated coherent excitation of the $(6s71s){}^3\mathrm{S}_1$ Rydberg state with a Rabi frequency of 2.13(3) MHz. Combined with our successful manipulations on the ${}^1\mathrm{S}_0-{}^3\mathrm{P}_2$ transition, this work represents a foundational step toward achieving high-fidelity Rydberg excitation, enabling advancements in quantum simulation and computing with neutral atom arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic electric environment surrounding a spin defect in a wide-bandgap semiconductor plays a determining role in the spin coherence and charge stability of a given qubit and has an equally important role in defining the electrical properties of the host material. Here, we use electrometry of quantum defects embedded within a diamond to observe stable, micron-scale space charge distributions formed from trapped photogenerated charges. These space charges grow under optical illumination in the presence of an applied electric field, eventually screening the applied electric field entirely over a spatial extent of tens of microns due to charge carrier drift and capture. Our measurements suggest that these space charge fields originate from widely-dispersed spatial configurations of nitrogen charges. Our results have important consequences for electrometry and photoelectric detection using qubits in wide-bandgap semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimization for Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a general and flexible control approach, used in many industrial contexts, and is based on the online solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. This operation requires in general a high computational cost, which may compromise the NMPC implementation in ``fast'' applications, especially if a large number variables is involved. To overcome this issue, we propose a quantum computing approach for the solution of the NMPC optimization problem. Assuming the availability of an efficient quantum computer, the approach has the potential to considerably decrease the computational time and/or enhance the solution quality compared to classical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Resonances, mobility edges and gap-protected Anderson localization in generalized disordered mosaic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mosaic lattice models have been recently introduced as a special class of disordered systems displaying resonance energies, multiple mobility edges and anomalous transport properties. In such systems on-site potential disorder, either uncorrelated or incommensurate, is introduced solely at every equally-spaced sites within the lattice, with a spacing $M \geq 2$. A remarkable property of disordered mosaic lattices is the persistence of extended states at some resonance frequencies that prevent complete Anderson localization, even in the strong disorder regime. Here we introduce a broader class of mosaic lattices and derive general expressions of mobility edges and localization length for incommensurate sinusoidal disorder, which generalize previous results [Y. Wang {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 125}, 196604 (2020)]. For both incommensurate and uncorrelated disorder, we prove that Anderson localization is protected by the open gaps of the disorder-free lattice, and derive some general criteria for complete Anderson localization. The results are illustrated by considering a few models, such as the mosaic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the trimer mosaic lattice.</description>

      <title>Coherent spectroscopy of a single Mn-doped InGaAs quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doping a self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) with a single Mn atom, a magnetic acceptor impurity, provides a quantum system with discrete energy levels and original spin-dependent optical selection rules, which thus has large potential in quantum photonics, notably as a source of multi-entangled photons. To investigate this potential further, we perform coherent optical spectroscopy under continuous wave excitation of the 3-level V-like system formed in such a Mn-doped QD when charged by a single hole. In spite of a large inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions, we demonstrate Autler-Townes splitting both by resonant Raman scattering and by probe absorption spectroscopy for different saturation powers. Analysing these data with a comprehensive model based on optical Bloch equations, we show evidence for quantum interference within the V-like system and assess the pure dephasing rate between the corresponding spin states.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Room-Temperature Ferroelectricity in Metal Oxide Monolayers for Advanced Logic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional ferroelectric materials are beneficial for power-efficient memory devices and transistor applications. Here, we predict out-of-plane ferroelectricity in a new family of buckled metal oxide (MO; M: Ge, Sn, Pb) monolayers with significant spontaneous polarization. Additionally, these monolayers have a narrow valence band, which is energetically separated from the rest of the low-lying valence bands. Such a unique band structure limits the long thermal tail of the hot carriers, mitigating subthreshold thermionic leakage and allowing field-effect transistors (FETs) to function beyond the bounds imposed on conventional FETs by thermodynamics. Our quantum transport simulations reveal that the FETs based on these MO monolayers exhibit a large ON/OFF ratio with an average subthreshold swing of less than 60 mV/decade at room temperature, even for short gate lengths. Our work motivates further exploration of the MO monolayers for developing advanced, high-performance memory and logic devices.</description>

      <title>The game of metaphysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaphysics is traditionally conceived as aiming at the truth -- indeed, the most fundamental truths about the most general features of reality. Philosophical naturalists, urging that philosophical claims be grounded on science, have often assumed an eliminativist attitude towards metaphysics, consequently paying little attention to such a definition. In the more recent literature, however, naturalism has instead been taken to entail that the traditional conception of metaphysics can be accepted if and only if one is a scientific realist (and puts the right constraints on acceptable metaphysical claims). Here, we want to suggest that naturalists can, and perhaps should, pick a third option, based on a significant yet acceptable revision of the established understanding of metaphysics. More particularly, we will claim that a fictionalist approach to metaphysics is compatible with both the idea that the discipline inquires into the fundamental features of reality and naturalistic methodology; at the same time, it meshes well with both scientific realism and instrumentalism</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.02867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics is based on probabilities as fundamental entities of a mathematical description. Expectation values of observables are computed according to the classical statistical rule. The overall probability distribution for one world covers all times. The quantum formalism arises once one focuses on the evolution of the time-local probabilistic information. Wave functions or the density matrix allow the formulation of a general linear evolution law for classical statistics. The quantum formalism for classical statistics is a powerful tool which allows us to implement for generalized Ising models the momentum observable with the associated Fourier representation. The association of operators to observables permits the computation of expectation values in terms of the density matrix by the usual quantum rule. We show that probabilistic cellular automata are quantum systems in a formulation with discrete time steps and real wave functions. With a complex structure the evolution operator for automata can be expressed in terms of a Hamiltonian involving fermionic creation and annihilation operators. The time-local probabilistic information amounts to a subsystem of the overall probabilistic system which is correlated with its environment consisting of the past and future. Such subsystems typically involve probabilistic observables for which only a probability distribution for their possible measurement values is available. Incomplete statistics does not permit to compute classical correlation functions for arbitrary subsystem-observables. Bell's inequalities are not generally applicable.</description>

      <title>Atomic clock locking with Bayesian quantum parameter estimation: scheme and experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06608v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic clocks are crucial for science and technology, but their sensitivity is often restricted by the standard quantum limit. To surpass this limit, correlations between particles or interrogation times must be leveraged. Although the sensitivity can be enhanced to the Heisenberg limit using quantum entanglement, it remains unclear whether the scaling of sensitivity with total interrogation time can achieve the Heisenberg scaling. Here, we design an adaptive Bayesian quantum frequency estimation protocol that approaches the Heisenberg scaling and experimentally demonstrate its validity with a cold-atom coherent-population-trapping (CPT) clock. In further, we achieve robust and high-precision closed-loop locking of the cold-atom CPT clock by utilizing our Bayesian quantum frequency estimation protocol. In comparison to the conventional proportional-integral-differential locking, our Bayesian locking scheme not only yields an improvement of 5.1(4) dB in fractional frequency stability, but also exhibits better robustness against technical noises. Our findings not only provide a robust and high-precision approach to lock atomic clocks, but also hold promising applications in various interferometry-based quantum sensors, such as quantum magnetometers and atomic interferometers.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Geometry of Entanglement in Many-Body Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new framework is formulated to study entanglement dynamics in many-body quantum systems along with an associated geometric description. In this formulation, called the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF), the system's wave function or density matrix is transformed into a new space of complex functions with isolated singularities. Accordingly, entanglement dynamics is encoded in specific residues of the QCTF, and importantly, the explicit evaluation of the system's time dependence is avoided. Notably, the QCTF formulation allows for various algebraic simplifications and approximations to address the normally encountered complications due to the exponential growth of the many-body Hilbert space with the number of bodies. These simplifications are facilitated through considering the patterns, in lieu of the elements, lying within the system's state. Consequently, a main finding of this paper is the exterior (Grassmannian) algebraic expression of many-body entanglement as the collective areas of regions in the Hilbert space spanned by pairs of projections of the wave function onto an arbitrary basis. This latter geometric measure is shown to be equivalent to the second-order R\'enyi entropy. Additionally, the geometric description of the QCTF shows that characterizing features of the reduced density matrix can be related to experimentally observable quantities. The QCTF-based geometric description offers the prospect of theoretically revealing aspects of many-body entanglement, by drawing on the vast scope of methods from geometry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Graph-State Synthesis with SAT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum computing and quantum information processing, graph states are a specific type of quantum states which are commonly used in quantum networking and quantum error correction. A recurring problem is finding a transformation from a given source graph state to a desired target graph state using only local operations. Recently it has been shown that deciding transformability is already NP-hard. In this paper, we present a CNF encoding for both local and non-local graph state operations, corresponding to one- and two-qubit Clifford gates and single-qubit Pauli measurements. We use this encoding in a bounded-model-checking set-up to synthesize the desired transformation. Additionally, for a completeness threshold on local transformations, we provide an upper bound on the length of the transformation if it exists. We evaluate the approach in two settings: the first is the synthesis of the ubiquitous GHZ state from a random graph state where we can vary the number of qubits, while the second is based on a proposed 14 node quantum network. We find that the approach is able to synthesize transformations for graphs up to 17 qubits in under 30 minutes.</description>

Abstract: High control in the preparation and manipulation of states is an experimental and theoretical important task in many quantum protocols. Shortcuts to adiabaticity methods allow to obtain desirable states of a adiabatic dynamics but in short time scales. In this work, the problem of considering this technique for two-coupled bosonic modes is addressed. By using symplectic transformations it is possible to decouple the modes and find the driving Hamiltonian that drives the system through a transitionless dynamics in a finite-time regime. Two paradigmatic interactions are discussed, the position-position and the magnetic field couplings. We also illustrate the finding in a concrete example where the nonadiabaticity degree is quantified in terms of the residual energy. Finally, it is shown that the driving Hamiltonian for each case contains local and global contributions, accounting for coherence in the energy basis and entanglement effects, respectively.</description>

      <title>Realistic Cost to Execute Practical Quantum Circuits using Direct Clifford+T Lattice Surgery Compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a resource estimation pipeline that explicitly compiles quantum circuits expressed using the Clifford+T gate set into a surface code lattice surgery instruction set. The cadence of magic state requests from the compiled circuit enables the optimization of magic state distillation and storage requirements in a post-hoc analysis. To compile logical circuits into lattice surgery operations, we build upon the open-source Lattice Surgery Compiler. The revised compiler operates in two stages: the first translates logical gates into an abstract, layout-independent instruction set; the second compiles these into local lattice surgery instructions that are allocated to hardware tiles according to a specified resource layout. The second stage retains logical parallelism while avoiding resource contention in the fault-tolerant layer, aiding realism. Additionally, users can specify dedicated tiles at which magic states are replenished, enabling resource costs from the logical computation to be considered independently from magic state distillation and storage. We demonstrate the applicability of our pipeline to large, practical quantum circuits by providing resource estimates for the ground state estimation of molecules. We find that variable magic state consumption rates in real circuits can cause the resource costs of magic state storage to dominate unless production is varied to suit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) has recently been put forward as a routine to break quantum ergodicity. Although HSF exists widely in models with dynamical constraints, it is still challenging to tune it. Here, we propose a scheme to tune the HSF in a one-dimensional tilted lattice of interacting spinless fermions with periodically driven tunneling. For weak tunneling strength, the dynamics for a long range of time is governed by effective Hamiltonians with kinetic constraints, which appear as density-dependent tunneling. Through a Floquet time-dependent perturbation theory, we analytically derive two different resonance frequencies, at which some particular tunneling processes are resonant. At the nonresonance frequencies, the system is strongly constrained and exhibits a strong HSF. At the two different resonance frequencies, the kinetic constraints are partly released and the system exhibits another two different strong HSFs. We can tune the HSF by changing the driving frequency. We support the perturbation analysis with exact numerical simulation of the entanglement entropy, the density correlation functions, and the saturated local density profiles. Our result provides a promising way to control HSF through Floquet engineering.</description>

Abstract: Many problems in linear algebra -- such as those arising from non-Hermitian physics and differential equations -- can be solved on a quantum computer by processing eigenvalues of the non-normal input matrices. However, the existing Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) framework is ill-suited to this task, as eigenvalues and singular values are different in general. We present a Quantum EigenValue Transformation (QEVT) framework for applying arbitrary polynomial transformations on eigenvalues of block-encoded non-normal operators, and a related Quantum EigenValue Estimation (QEVE) algorithm for operators with real spectra. QEVT has query complexity to the block encoding nearly recovering that of the QSVT for a Hermitian input, and QEVE achieves the Heisenberg-limited scaling for diagonalizable input matrices. As applications, we develop a linear differential equation solver with strictly linear time query complexity for average-case diagonalizable operators, as well as a ground state preparation algorithm that upgrades previous nearly optimal results for Hermitian Hamiltonians to diagonalizable matrices with real spectra. Underpinning our algorithms is an efficient method to prepare a quantum superposition of Faber polynomials, which generalize the nearly-best uniform approximation properties of Chebyshev polynomials to the complex plane. Of independent interest, we also develop techniques to generate $n$ Fourier coefficients with $\mathbf{O}(\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ gates compared to prior approaches with linear cost.</description>

Abstract: We explore the uncertainty relation for unitary operators in a new way and find two uncertainty equalities for unitary operators, which are minimized by any pure states. Additionally, we derive two sets of uncertainty inequalities that unveil hierarchical structures within the realm of unitary operator uncertainty. Furthermore, we examine and compare our method for unitary uncertainty relations to other prevailing formulations. We provide explicit examples for better understanding and clarity. Results show that the hierarchical unitary uncertainty relations establish strong bounds. Moreover, we investigate the higher-dimensional limit of the unitary uncertainty equalities.</description>

Abstract: High-coherence superconducting cavities offer a hardware-efficient platform for quantum information processing. To achieve universal operations of these bosonic modes, the requisite nonlinearity is realized by coupling them to a transmon ancilla. However, this configuration is susceptible to crosstalk errors in the dispersive regime, where the ancilla frequency is Stark-shifted by the state of each coupled bosonic mode. This leads to a frequency mismatch of the ancilla drive, lowering the gate fidelities. To mitigate such coherent errors, we employ quantum optimal control to engineer ancilla pulses that are robust to the frequency shifts. These optimized pulses are subsequently integrated into a recently developed echoed conditional displacement (ECD) protocol for executing single- and two-mode operations. Through numerical simulations, we examine two representative scenarios: the preparation of single-mode Fock states in the presence of spectator modes and the generation of two-mode entangled Bell-cat states. Our approach markedly suppresses crosstalk errors, outperforming conventional ancilla control methods by orders of magnitude. These results provide guidance for experimentally achieving high-fidelity multimode operations and pave the way for developing high-performance bosonic quantum information processors.</description>

      <title>Robust teleportation of a surface code and cascade of topological quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teleportation is a facet where quantum measurements can act as a powerful resource in quantum physics, as local measurements allow to steer quantum information in a non-local way. While this has long been established for a single Bell pair, the teleportation of a many-qubit entangled state using non-maximally entangled resources presents a fundamentally different challenge. Here we investigate a tangible protocol for teleporting a long-range entangled surface code state using elementary Bell measurements and its stability in the presence of coherent errors that weaken the Bell entanglement. We relate the underlying threshold problem to the physics of anyon condensation under weak measurements and map it to a variant of the Ashkin-Teller model of statistical mechanics with Nishimori type disorder, which gives rise to a cascade of phase transitions. Tuning the angle of the local Bell measurements, we find a continuously varying threshold. Notably, the threshold moves to infinity for the $X+Z$ angle along the self-dual line -- indicating that infinitesimally weak entanglement is sufficient in teleporting a self-dual topological surface code. Our teleportation protocol, which can be readily implemented in dynamically configurable Rydberg atom arrays, thereby gives guidance for a practical demonstration of the power of quantum measurements.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing the Stern-Gerlach apparatus to create matter-wave superposition states is a long-sought-after goal, not only due to its potential applications in the quantum realm but also because of its fundamental implications for studying the quantum properties of gravity. The main challenge in creating a macroscopic quantum interferometer arises from the loss of coherence, primarily through two channels. One channel involves strong coupling with the environment for macroscopic matter, leading to decoherence. The other channel relates to the precision of wave packet overlap, which can occur due to external and internal fluctuations of various sources. The latter introduces a unique challenge for larger-scale masses by perturbing the centre of mass motion of the macroscopic object. Here, we study a particular challenge, namely, the issue of internal degrees of freedom, specifically phonon fluctuations and contrast reduction. This work will investigate the contrast reduction caused by spin-magnetic field and diamagnetic interactions at the phonon occupation level in the quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol configuration.</description>

Abstract: We report measurements of counting statistics, average and variance, of microwave photons of ill-defined frequency : bichromatic photons, i.e. photons involving two well separated frequencies, and "white" broadband photons. Our setup allows for the analysis of single photonic modes of arbitrary waveform over the 1-10 GHz frequency range. The photon statistics are obtained by on-the-fly numerical calculation from the sampled time-dependent voltage. Using an ac+dc biased tunnel junction as a source of quantum microwave, we report an ultra-wide squeezing spectrum representing a competitive source for entanglement generation (up to 0.9 billion measured entangled bits per second) easily achievable experimentally. We also report the observation of quantum steering by the tunnel junction, and show how the presence of squeezing of a broadband mode implies the existence of entanglement between two modes it encompasses.</description>

      <title>Identifying non-Hermitian critical points with quantum metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric properties of quantum states is fully encoded by the quantum geometric tensor. The real and imaginary parts of the quantum geometric tensor are the quantum metric and Berry curvature, which characterize the distance and phase difference between two nearby quantum states in Hilbert space, respectively. For conventional Hermitian quantum systems, the quantum metric corresponds to the fidelity susceptibility and has already been used to specify quantum phase transitions from the geometric perspective. In this work, we extend this wisdom to the non-Hermitian systems for revealing non-Hermitian critical points. To be concrete, by employing numerical exact diagonalization and analytical methods, we calculate the quantum metric and corresponding order parameters in various non-Hermitian models, which include two non-Hermitian generalized Aubry-Andre models and non-Hermitian cluster and mixed-field Ising models. We demonstrate that the quantum metric of eigenstates in these non-Hermitian models exactly identifies the localization transitions, mobility edges, and many-body quantum phase transitions with gap closings, respectively. We further show that this strategy is robust against the finite-size effect and different boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum thermometry scheme based collision model with Gaussian systems. A key open question of these schemes concerns the scaling of the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) with the number of ancillae. In qubit-based implementations this question is difficult to assess, due to the exponentially growing size of the Hilbert space. Here we focus on Gaussian collision models, which allow for the scaling of the QFI to be evaluated for arbitrarily large sizes. This numerical flexibility enables us to explore the thermometric properties of the model for a wide range of configurations. Despite the infinite Markov order of the stochastic process of the model, we provide a simple phenomenological analysis for the behavior of the QFI, estimating the asymptotic Fisher information density and how the transient effects of correlations for an increasing number of ancillae depend on the physical parameters of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-boson model, involving spins interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems. Trapped ions present a natural platform for simulating the quantum dynamics of such models, thanks to the presence of both high quality internal qubit states and the motional modes of the ions that can simulate the relevant quantum degrees of freedom. In our work, we extend the previous body of work that focused on coherent coupling of the spins and bosons to perform quantum simulations with structured dissipative baths using the motional states of trapped ions. We demonstrate the capability for adjusting the bath's temperature and continuous spectral density by adding randomness to fully programmable control parameters. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics of various spin-boson models with noise spectral densities constructed from coupling to several dissipative harmonic oscillator modes. The experimental outcomes closely align with theoretical predictions, indicating successful simulation of open quantum systems using a trapped-ion system.</description>

Abstract: We use the Heisenberg picture of Everettian quantum mechanics to work out the relative descriptors for the Frauchiger-Renner thought experiment. While Everettian mechanics reveals no paradox within the thought experiment, the decoherence-free setup offers an instructive branching tree. Traditionally, branching structures derived from the Schr\"odinger picture suggest that foliations are always sharply defined. However, the Heisenberg picture demonstrates that the tree contains regions with inherently non-sharp foliations, leading to the conclusion that, in Everettian mechanics, quantum agents possess a history with a non-sharp memory registry.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product unitaries: Beyond quantum cellular automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPU) are 1D tensor networks describing time evolution and unitary symmetries of quantum systems, while their action on states by construction preserves the entanglement area law. MPU which are formed by a single repeated tensor are known to coincide with 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA), i.e., unitaries with an exact light cone. However, this correspondence breaks down for MPU with open boundary conditions, even if the resulting operator is translation-invariant. Such unitaries can turn short- to long-range correlations and thus alter the underlying phase of matter. Here we make the first steps towards a theory of MPU with uniform bulk but arbitrary boundary. In particular, we study the structure of a subclass with a direct-sum form which maximally violates the QCA property. We also consider the general case of MPU formed by site-dependent (nonuniform) tensors and show a correspondence between MPU and locally maximally entanglable states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main limitations of variational quantum algorithms is the classical optimization of the highly dimensional non-convex variational parameter landscape. To simplify this optimization, we can reduce the search space using problem symmetries and typical optimal parameters as initial points if they concentrate. In this article, we consider typical values of optimal parameters of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for the MaxCut problem with d-regular tree subgraphs and reuse them in different graph instances. We prove symmetries in the optimization landscape of several kinds of weighted and unweighted graphs, which explains the existence of multiple sets of optimal parameters. However, we observe that not all optimal sets can be successfully transferred between problem instances. We find specific transferable domains in the search space and show how to translate an arbitrary set of optimal parameters into the adequate domain using the studied symmetries. Finally, we extend these results to general classical optimization problems described by Ising Hamiltonians, the Hamiltonian variational ansatz for relevant physical models, and the recursive and multi-angle quantum approximate optimization algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mechanism in long-range interacting Heisenberg spin chains at low temperatures that leads to the emergence of effective entanglement light cones. This mechanism arises from destructive interference among quantum effects that contribute to the entanglement of spins outside an identified light cone. As a result, entanglement remains suppressed in this region, facilitating the formation of effective entanglement light cones. Our analysis reveals that truncating the range of interactions weakens the destructive interference, resulting in an unexpected acceleration of entanglement transport along the chain. This prediction is proposed to be experimentally observable. Our work provides a fresh perspective on the physical mechanisms driving the emergence of light cones in long-range interacting quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: To optimize the entanglement detection, we formulate the metrologically operational entanglement condition in quantum Fisher information by maximizing the QFI on the measurement orbit. Specifically, we consider two classes of typical local observables, i.e. the local orthonormal observables and symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures. Result shows that the symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures are superior to local orthonormal observables in entanglement detection, which in some sense hints the yet unconfirmed generally superiority of symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures in quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We develop an energy calculation algorithm leveraging quantum phase difference estimation (QPDE) scheme and a tensor-network-based unitary compression method in the preparation of superposition states and time-evolution gates. Alongside its efficient implementation, this algorithm reduces depolarization noise affections exponentially. We demonstrated energy gap calculations for one-dimensional Hubbard models on IBM superconducting devices using circuits up to 32-system (plus one-ancilla) qubits, a five-fold increase over previous QPE demonstrations, at the 7242 controlled-Z gate level of standard transpilation, utilizing a Q-CTRL error suppression module. Additionally, we propose a technique towards molecular executions using spatial orbital localization and index sorting, verified by a 13- (17-)qubit hexatriene (octatetraene) simulation. Since QPDE can handle the same objectives as QPE, our algorithm represents a leap forward in quantum computing on real devices.</description>

      <title>Improved Electron-Nuclear Quantum Gates for Spin Sensing and Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to sense and control nuclear spins near solid-state defects might enable a range of quantum technologies. Dynamically Decoupled Radio-Frequency (DDRF) control offers a high degree of design flexibility and long electron-spin coherence times. However, previous studies considered simplified models and little is known about optimal gate design and fundamental limits. Here, we develop a generalised DDRF framework that has important implications for spin sensing and control. Our analytical model, which we corroborate by experiments on a single NV center in diamond, reveals the mechanisms that govern the selectivity of gates and their effective Rabi frequencies, and enables flexible detuned gate designs. We apply these insights to numerically show a 60x sensitivity enhancement for detecting weakly coupled spins and study the optimisation of quantum gates in multi-qubit registers. These results advance the understanding for a broad class of gates and provide a toolbox for application-specific design, enabling improved quantum control and sensing.</description>

Abstract: In this short Topical Review, we look at something typically considered trivial, but not given formally elsewhere -- the behaviour of first multiple fermions, then multiple bosons, at a beamsplitter. Extending from this, we then describe the behaviour of multiple fermions and multiple bosons in Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs). We hope that by showing how to go from mathematically-simple but unintuitive quantum field theory to a phenomenological description, this Review will help both researchers and students build a stronger intuition for the behaviour of quantum particles.</description>

Abstract: The most general description of quantum evolution up to a time $\tau$ is a completely positive tracing preserving map known as a dynamical map $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$. Here we consider $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ arising from suddenly coupling a system to one or more thermal baths with a strength that is neither weak nor strong. Given no clear separation of characteristic system/bath time scales $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ is generically expected to be non-Markovian, however we do assume the ensuing dynamics has a unique steady state implying the baths possess a finite memory time $\tau_{\rm m}$. By combining several techniques within a tensor network framework we directly and accurately extract $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ for a small number of interacting fermionic modes coupled to infinite non-interacting Fermi baths. We employ the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism so that $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ can be fully reconstructed from a single pure state calculation of the unitary dynamics of the system, bath and their replica auxillary modes up to time $\tau$. From $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ we also compute the time local propagator $\hat{\mathcal{L}}(\tau)$. By examining the convergence with $\tau$ of the instantaneous fixed points of these objects we establish their respective memory times $\tau^{\Lambda}_{\rm m}$ and $\tau^{\mathcal{L}}_{\rm m}$. Beyond these times, the propagator $\hat{\mathcal{L}}(\tau)$ and dynamical map $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ accurately describe all the subsequent long-time relaxation dynamics up to stationarity. Our numerical examples of interacting spinless Fermi chains and the single impurity Anderson model demonstrate regimes where our approach can offer a significant speedup in determining the stationary state compared to directly simulating the long-time limit.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Unitary Coupled Cluster Wave Functions on Quantum Hardware: Error Bound and Resource-Efficient Optimizer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the projective quantum eigensolver (PQE) approach to optimizing unitary coupled cluster wave functions on quantum hardware, as introduced in arXiv:2102.00345. The projective quantum eigensolver is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm which, by optimizing a unitary coupled cluster wave function, aims at computing the ground state of many-body systems. Instead of trying to minimize the energy of the system like in the variational quantum eigensolver, PQE uses projections of the Schr\"odinger equation to efficiently bring the trial state closer to an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we provide a mathematical study of the algorithm, which allows us to obtain a number of interesting results. We first show that one can derive a bound relating off-diagonal coefficients (residues) of the Hamiltonian to the error of the algorithm. This bound not only gives a formal motivation to the projective approach to optimizing unitary coupled cluster wavefunctions, but it also allows us to formulate a well-informed convergence criterion for residue-based optimizers. We then introduce a mathematical study of the classical optimization itself, and show that, using our results, one can derive a residue-based optimizer for which we present numerical evidence of superiority over both the optimization introduced in arXiv:2102.00345 and VQE optimized using the Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno (BFGS) method.</description>

      <title>Runtime Reduction in Linear Quantum Charge-Coupled Devices using the Parity Flow Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Parity Flow formalism, we show that physical SWAP gates can be eliminated in linear hardware architectures, without increasing the total number of two-qubit operations. This has a significant impact on the execution time of quantum circuits in linear Quantum Charge-Coupled Devices (QCCDs), where SWAP gates are implemented by physically changing the position of the ions. Because SWAP gates are one of the most time-consuming operations in QCCDs, our scheme considerably reduces the runtime of the quantum Fourier transform and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm on all-to-all spin models, compared to circuits generated with standard compilers (TKET and Qiskit). While increasing the problem size (and therefore the number of qubits) typically demands longer runtimes, which are constrained by coherence time, our runtime reduction enables a significant increase in the number of qubits at a given coherence time.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of entanglement within the Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM), focusing on the behavior of atoms in both Bell and Werner states when subjected to thermal and squeezed photons. We study the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD), atomic inversion, and how various interactions (such as Ising-type, dipole-dipole, and Kerr-nonlinearity) affect these dynamics. This work compares the effects of these interactions and photons on the atomic and field subsystems, providing insights into how thermal and quantum noise impact entanglement behavior in these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Track finding can be considered as a complex optimization problem initially introduced in particle physics involving the reconstruction of particle trajectories. A track is typically composed of several consecutive segments (track segments) that resembles a smooth curve without bifurcations. In this paper various modeling approaches are explored in order to assess both their impact and their effectiveness in solving them using quantum and classical methods. We present implementations of three classical models using CPLEX, two quantum models running on actual D-Wave quantum computers, and one quantum model on a D-Wave simulator. To facilitate a fair comparative study and encourage future research in this area, we introduce a new set of benchmark instances, categorized into small, medium, and large scales. Our evaluation of these methods on the benchmark instances indicates that D-Wave methods offer an excellent balance between computation time and result quality, outperforming CPLEX in numerous cases.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete classification of non-chiral topological phases in 2D fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.06124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, fermionic topological phases of quantum matter has attracted a lot of attention. In a pioneer work by Gu, Wang and Wen, the concept of equivalence classes of fermionic local unitary(FLU) transformations was proposed to systematically understand non-chiral topological phases in 2D fermion systems and an incomplete classification was obtained. On the other hand, the physical picture of fermion condensation and its corresponding super pivotal categories give rise to a generic mathematical framework to describe fermionic topological phases of quantum matter. In particular, it has been pointed out that in certain fermionic topological phases, there exists the so-called q-type anyon excitations, which have no analogues in bosonic theories. In this paper, we generalize the Gu, Wang and Wen construction to include those fermionic topological phases with q-type anyon excitations. We argue that all non-chiral fermionic topological phases in 2+1D are characterized by a set of tensors $(N^{ij}_{k},F^{ij}_{k},F^{ijm,\alpha\beta}_{kln,\chi\delta},n_{i},d_{i})$, which satisfy a set of nonlinear algebraic equations parameterized by phase factors $\Xi^{ijm,\alpha\beta}_{kl}$, $\Xi^{ij}_{kln,\chi\delta}$, $\Omega^{kim,\alpha\beta}_{jl}$ and $\Omega^{ki}_{jln,\chi\delta}$. Moreover, consistency conditions among algebraic equations give rise to additional constraints on these phase factors which allow us to construct a topological invariant partition for an arbitrary triangulation of 3D spin manifold. Finally, several examples with q-type anyon excitations are discussed, including the Fermionic topological phase from Tambara-Yamagami category for $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$, which can be regarded as the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$ parafermion generalization of Ising fermionic topological phase.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the interaction between two monoidal structures: a multiplicative one, for the encoding of pairing, and an additive one, for the encoding of choice. We propose a colored PROP to model computation in this framework, where the choice is parameterized by an algebraic side effect: the model can support regular tests, probabilistic and non-deterministic branching, as well as quantum branching, i.e. superposition.
  The graphical language comes equipped with a denotational semantics based on linear applications, and an equational theory. We prove the language to be universal, and the equational theory to be complete with respect to this semantics.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Magnon-Polariton spectroscopy of strongly hybridized electro-nuclear spin excitations in LiHoF4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first present a formalism that incorporates the input-output formalism and the linear response theory to employ cavity-magnon-polariton coupling as a spectroscopic tool for investigating strongly hybridized electro-nuclear spin excitations. A microscopic relation between the generalized susceptibility and the scattering parameter |S11| in strongly hybridized cavity-magnon-polariton systems has been derived without resorting to semi-classical approximations. The formalism is then applied to both analyze and simulate a specific systems comprising a model quantum Ising magnet (LiHoF4) and a high-finesse 3D re-entrant cavity resonator. Quantitative information on the electro-nuclear spin states in LiHoF4 is extracted, and the experimental observations across a broad parameter range were numerically reproduced, including an external magnetic field titraversing a quantum critical point. The method potentially opens a new avenue not only for further studies on the quantum phase transition in LiHoF4 but also for a wide range of complex magnetic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple technique for adding controlled dissipation to Rydberg atom experiments. In our experiments we excite cold rubidium atoms in a magneto-optical trap to $70$-S Rydberg states, whilst simultaneously inducing forced dissipation by resonantly coupling the Rydberg state to a hyperfine level of the short-lived $6$-P state. The resulting effective dissipation can be varied in strength and switched on and off during a single experimental cycle.</description>

      <title>Topological fingerprints in Liouvillian gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology in many-body physics usually emerges as a feature of equilibrium quantum states. We show that topological fingerprints can also appear in the relaxation rates of open quantum systems. To demonstrate this we consider one of the simplest models that has two topologically distinct phases in its ground state: the Kitaev chain model for the $p$-wave superconductor. After introducing dissipation to this model we estimate the Liouvillian gap in both strong and weak dissipative limits. Our results show that a non-zero superconducting pairing opens a Liouvillian gap that remains open in the limit of infinite system size. At strong dissipation this gap is essentially unaffected by the topology of the underlying Hamiltonian ground state. In contrast, when dissipation is weak, the topological phase of the Hamiltonian ground state plays a crucial role in determining the character of the Liouvillian gap. We find, for example, that in the topological phase this gap is completely immune to changes in the chemical potential. On the other hand, in the non-topological phase the Liouvillian gap is suppressed by a large chemical potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy within a spherical region for a free scalar field in a squeezed state in 3+1 dimensions. We show that, even for small squeezing, a volume term appears, whose coefficient is essentially independent of the field mass. This is in line with Page's argument that the entanglement entropy in an arbitrary quantum state is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom of the smaller subsystem. It follows that squeezed states can be considered as arbitrary quantum states, in contrast to the ground or coherent states that give rise to entanglement entropy that is dominated by a term proportional to the area of the entangling surface.</description>

      <title>Enhanced strong interaction effect in synthetic spin-orbit coupling with mixed spin symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic spin-orbit coupling in cold atoms couples the pseudo-spin and spatial degrees of freedom, and therefore the inherent spin symmetry of the system plays an important role. In systems of two pseudo-spin degrees, two particles contain symmetric states and anti-symmetric states, but the spin symmetry can be mixed for more particles. This mixed spin symmetry has been overlooked and has not been investigated thoroughly. We study the role of mixed spin symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and consider the system of three bosons with two hyper-fine states trapped in a harmonic potential. We investigate the ground state and the energy spectrum by implementing exact diagonalization. Similarly to two-particle systems, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and repulsive interactions between anti-aligned pseudo-spins increases the population of the unaligned spin components in the ground state. Also, the emergence of the mixed spin symmetric states compensates for the rise of the interaction energy. In contrast to two-particle systems, the pair correlation of the ground state is analogous to the Tonks-Girardeau gas even for relatively small contact interactions, and this feature is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Probing spontaneously symmetry-broken phases with spin-charge separation through noise correlation measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneously symmetry-broken (SSB) phases are locally ordered states of matter characterizing a large variety of physical systems. Because of their specific ordering, their presence is usually witnessed by means of local order parameters. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on statistical correlations of noise after the ballistic expansion of an atomic cloud. We indeed demonstrate that probing such noise correlators allows one to discriminate among different SSB phases characterized by spin-charge separation. As a particular example, we test our prediction on a 1D extended Fermi-Hubbard model, where the competition between local and nonlocal couplings gives rise to three different SSB phases: a charge density wave, a bond-ordering wave, and an antiferromagnet. Our numerical analysis shows that this approach can accurately capture the presence of these different SSB phases, thus representing an alternative and powerful strategy to characterize strongly interacting quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Controlling dephasing of coupled qubits via shared-bath coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a quantum system with its environment limits its coherence time. This, in particular, restricts the utility of qubits in quantum information processing applications. In this paper, we show that the decoherence of a coupled qubit system can be minimized, or even eliminated, by exploiting the quantum coherence of the bath itself. We investigate the dephasing in a system of two spatially separated, electronically decoupled qubits, with direct or mediated coupling, interacting with a shared bath. For illustration, we treat F\"orster or cavity-mediated coupling between semiconductor quantum dots interacting with acoustic phonons. Using the rigorous method of Trotter's decomposition with cumulant expansion, we demonstrate a reduction in the dephasing rates at specific distances between the dots. The control of dephasing with distance is a coherent effect of the shared bath and is absent for independent baths. It can be understood in terms of phonon-assisted transitions between the entangled qubit states of the coupled system.</description>

Abstract: In this reply, I point out that the comment by Cline (arXiv:2410.05826) on my manuscripts (arXiv:2407.00954 and arXiv:2410.03133) has overlooked the critical fact that the quantum entanglement between the neutrino's mass and other degrees of freedom would destroy the quantum coherence between the mass eigenstates.</description>

      <title>A 300 mm foundry silicon spin qubit unit cell exceeding 99% fidelity in all operations</title>

Abstract: Fabrication of quantum processors in advanced 300 mm wafer-scale complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) foundries provides a unique scaling pathway towards commercially viable quantum computing with potentially millions of qubits on a single chip. Here, we show precise qubit operation of a silicon two-qubit device made in a 300 mm semiconductor processing line. The key metrics including single- and two-qubit control fidelities exceed 99% and state preparation and measurement fidelity exceeds 99.9%, as evidenced by gate set tomography (GST). We report coherence and lifetimes up to $T_\mathrm{2}^{\mathrm{*}} = 30.4$ $\mu$s, $T_\mathrm{2}^{\mathrm{Hahn}} = 803$ $\mu$s, and $T_1 = 6.3$ s. Crucially, the dominant operational errors originate from residual nuclear spin carrying isotopes, solvable with further isotopic purification, rather than charge noise arising from the dielectric environment. Our results answer the longstanding question whether the favourable properties including high-fidelity operation and long coherence times can be preserved when transitioning from a tailored academic to an industrial semiconductor fabrication technology.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast single-photon detection using nanophotonic parametric amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonic quantum information processing (QIP) has advanced rapidly due to progress in various nanophotonic platforms. Single photon detectors have been the subject of intense study due to their ubiquity in QIP systems, yet many state-of-the art detectors operate at cryogenic temperatures under vacuum and suffer from long dead times. We propose and demonstrate a single photon detection scheme based on optical parametric amplification in nanophotonic lithium niobate (LN) combined with a classical photodetector. We use quantum detector tomography and experimentally demonstrate an efficiency of 26.5% with a 2.2% dark count rate. We show that by improving the nonlinearity-to-loss ratio in nanophotonics and using homodyne detection on a squeezed pump, the detector can achieve 69% efficiency with 0.9% dark count rate. The detector operates at room temperature, has no intrinsic dead time, and is readily integrated in LN nanophotonics, in which many other components of photonic QIP are available. Our results represent a step towards all-optical ultrafast photon detection for scalable nanophotonic QIP.</description>
