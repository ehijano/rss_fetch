      <title>Non-Markovain Quantum State Diffusion for the Tunneling in SARS-COVID-19 virus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of biology, unlike the comprehensively established Standard Model in physics, many biological processes lack a complete theoretical framework and are often described phenomenologically. A pertinent example is olfaction -- the process through which humans and animals distinguish various odors. The conventional biological explanation for olfaction relies on the lock and key model, which, while useful, does not fully account for all observed phenomena. As an alternative or complement to this model, vibration-assisted electron tunneling has been proposed. Drawing inspiration from the vibration-assisted electron tunneling model for olfaction, we have developed a theoretical model for electron tunneling in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection within a non-Markovian framework. We approach this by solving the non-Markovian quantum stochastic Schrodinger equation. In our model, the spike protein and the GPCR receptor are conceptualized as a dimer, utilizing the spin-Boson model to facilitate the description of electron tunneling. Our analysis demonstrates that electron tunneling in this context exhibits inherently non-Markovian characteristics, extending into the intermediate and strong coupling regimes between the dimer components. This behavior stands in stark contrast to predictions from Markovian models, which fail to accurately describe electron tunneling in the strong coupling limit. Notably, Markovian approximations often lead to unphysical negative probabilities in this regime, underscoring their limitations and highlighting the necessity of incorporating non-Markovian dynamics for a more realistic description of biological quantum processes. This approach not only broadens our understanding of viral infection mechanisms but also enhances the biological accuracy and relevance of our theoretical framework in describing complex biological interactions.</description>

      <title>Protein Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein-specific large language models (Protein LLMs) are revolutionizing protein science by enabling more efficient protein structure prediction, function annotation, and design. While existing surveys focus on specific aspects or applications, this work provides the first comprehensive overview of Protein LLMs, covering their architectures, training datasets, evaluation metrics, and diverse applications. Through a systematic analysis of over 100 articles, we propose a structured taxonomy of state-of-the-art Protein LLMs, analyze how they leverage large-scale protein sequence data for improved accuracy, and explore their potential in advancing protein engineering and biomedical research. Additionally, we discuss key challenges and future directions, positioning Protein LLMs as essential tools for scientific discovery in protein science.

      <title>Characterizing the Conformational States of G Protein Coupled Receptors Generated with AlphaFold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are integral to numerous physiological processes and are the target of approximately one-third of FDA-approved therapeutics. Despite their significance, only a limited subset of GPCRs has been successfully targeted, primarily due to challenges in accurately modeling their structures. AlphaFold, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, has demonstrated remarkable capability in predicting protein structures with high accuracy. This study conducts an evaluation of AlphaFold performance in predicting GPCR structures and their conformational states by comparing its predictions to experimentally determined structures using metrics such as average deformation between alpha carbon atoms and the Helix 3 - Helix 6 (H3-H6) distance. Our analysis reveals that both AlphaFold 2 (AF2) and AlphaFold 3 (AF3) produce more accurate predictions for GPCRs in inactive conformations, with lower activity levels correlating with smaller deformations. Conversely, higher activity levels are associated with increased variability in AlphaFold performance due to difficulties with accurately predicting conformational changes upon GPCR activation and ligand binding. Additionally, AlphaFold performance varies across different GPCR classes, influenced by the availability and quality of training data as well as the structural complexity and diversity of the receptors. These findings demonstrate the potential of AlphaFold in advancing drug discovery efforts, while also highlighting the necessity for continued refinement to enhance predictive accuracy for active conformations.</description>
