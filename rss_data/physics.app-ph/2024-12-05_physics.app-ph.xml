      <title>Proposal for Superconducting Photodiode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a concept of a superconducting photodiode - a device that transforms the energy and `spin' of an external electromagnetic field into the rectified steady-state supercurrent and develop a microscopic theory describing its properties. For this, we consider a two-dimensional thin film cooled down below the temperature of superconducting transition with the injected dc supercurrent and exposed to an external electromagnetic field with a frequency smaller than the superconducting gap. As a result, we predict the emergence of a photoexcited quasiparticle current, and, as a consequence, oppositely oriented stationary flow of Cooper pairs. The strength and direction of this photoinduced supercurrent depend on (i) such material properties as the effective impurity scattering time and the nonequilibrium quasiparticles' energy relaxation time and (ii) such electromagnetic field properties as its frequency and polarization.</description>

      <title>Measurement of electron beam induced sample heating in SEM experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) experiments provide detailed insights into material microstructures, enabling high-resolution imaging as well as crystallographic analysis through advanced techniques like Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). However, the interaction of the high-energy electron beam with the material can lead to localized heating, which may significantly impact specimen integrity, especially in applications requiring prolonged beam exposure, for instance when mapping the crystal structure using EBSD. This study examines electron-beam-induced heating effects on a model metal sample (iron), directly measuring the locally deposited electron beam energy with a MEMS-based heating device and validating these measurements through simulations, including Monte Carlo and Finite Element methods. The analysis focuses on the effects of various experimental parameters such as acceleration voltage (from 5 to 30 kV), beam current (from 0.17 nA to 22 nA), dwell time (from 1$\mu$s to 1ms) and sample tilt (0{\deg} to 70{\deg}). The findings reveal that local sample temperatures can increase by up to 70 {\deg}C during EBSD experiments, primarily affected by the choice in beam current and acceleration voltage, with beam current having the most significant impact.</description>

      <title>Diamond-defect engineering of NV- centers using ion beam irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between ion beam modification techniques in the MeV range and the controlled generation of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in nitrogen-doped synthetic diamond crystals is explored. An experimental approach employing both light (H+) and heavy (Br+6) ions was followed to assess their respective impacts on the creation of NV- centers, using different ion energies or fluences to generate varying amounts of vacancies. Photoluminescence spectroscopy was applied to characterize NV- and neutral NV0 centers. Initially, no NV centers were detected post-irradiation, despite the presence of substitutional nitrogen and vacancies. However, after annealing at 800C (and in some cases at 900C), most samples exhibited a high density of NV0 and especially NV- centers. This demonstrates that thermal treatment is essential for vacancy-nitrogen recombination and NV- formation, often through electron capture from nearby nitrogen atoms. Notably, we achieved high NV- densities without graphitization, which is essential for preserving the material's properties for quantum applications. This study underscores and quantifies the effectiveness of MeV-range ions in controlling vacancy distributions and highlights their potential for optimizing NV- center formation to enhance the sensitivity of diamond-based quantum magnetic sensors.</description>

      <title>Efficient GHz electro-optical modulation with a nonlocal lithium niobate metasurface in the linear and nonlinear regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optical modulation is widely employed for optical signal processing and in laser technology. To date, it is efficiently realized in integrated photonic systems as well as in bulk optics devices. Yet, the achievement of modulators exploiting Pockels effect in flat optics, essential to scale down the electric radiation-optical control in free space, currently lag behind bulk and on-chip integrated platforms in terms efficiency and speed. We bridge this gap realizing a metasurface based on lithium niobate (LiNbO3) on insulator that leverages on resonances with quality-factor as high as 8e3 to achieve fast electrical modulation of both linear and nonlinear optical properties. LiNbO3, well known for its high nonlinear susceptibility and wide transparency window across the infrared and visible spectrum, is employed to realize an asymmetric, one-dimensional array of nanowires, exhibiting resonances with linewidth &lt; 0.2 nm. By applying a CMOS-compatible electrical bias, the metasurface imparts a relative reflectivity modulation around 0.1, with a modulation efficiency, defined as relative modulation per applied Volt, larger than 0.01 V^-1 on a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. We also demonstrated more than one order of magnitude intensity modulation of the second harmonic seeded by a continuous-wave laser, with a modulation efficiency of about 0.12 V^-1. This dual modulation capability, rooted in the interplay between optical resonances and electric field manipulation, holds significant potential for cutting-edge applications in high-speed photonics, nonlinear optics, and reconfigurable communication systems. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of LiNbO3-based metasurfaces for integration into next-generation optical technologies that demand rapid, efficient electrical control of light.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of effective transport for discrete uniaxial polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We previously demonstrated that the bulk transport coefficients of uniaxial polycrystalline materials, including electrical and thermal conductivity, diffusivity, complex permittivity, and magnetic permeability, have Stieltjes integral representations involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random operators. The integral representations follow from resolvent representations of physical fields involving these self-adjoint operators, such as the electric field $\boldsymbol{E}$ and current density $\boldsymbol{J}$ associated with conductive media with local conductivity $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and resistivity $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ matrices. In this article, we provide a discrete matrix analysis of this mathematical framework which parallels the continuum theory. We show that discretizations of the operators yield real-symmetric random matrices which are composed of projection matrices. We derive discrete resolvent representations for $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$ involving the matrices which lead to eigenvector expansions of $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$. We derive discrete Stieltjes integral representations for the components of the effective conductivity and resistivity matrices, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^*$ and $\boldsymbol{\rho}^*$, involving spectral measures for the real-symmetric random matrices, which are given explicitly in terms of their real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors. We provide a projection method that uses properties of the projection matrices to show that the spectral measure can be computed by much smaller matrices, which leads to a more efficient and stable numerical algorithm for the computation of bulk transport coefficients and physical fields. We demonstrate this algorithm by numerically computing the spectral measure and current density for model 2D and 3D isotropic polycrystalline media with checkerboard microgeometry.</description>

      <title>Relativistic EELS scattering cross-sections for microanalysis based on Dirac solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rich information of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) comes from the complex inelastic scattering process whereby fast electrons transfer energy and momentum to atoms, exciting bound electrons from their ground states to higher unoccupied states. To quantify EELS, the common practice is to compare the cross-sections integrated within an energy window or fit the observed spectrum with theoretical differential cross-sections calculated from a generalized oscillator strength (GOS) database with experimental parameters. The previous Hartree-Fock-based and DFT-based GOS are calculated from Schr\"odinger's solution of atomic orbitals, which does not include the full relativistic effects. Here, we attempt to go beyond the limitations of the Schr\"odinger solution in the GOS tabulation by including the full relativistic effects using the Dirac equation within the local density approximation, which is particularly important for core-shell electrons of heavy elements with strong spin-orbit coupling. This has been done for all elements in the periodic table (up to Z = 118) for all possible excitation edges using modern computing capabilities and parallelization algorithms. The relativistic effects of fast incoming electrons were included to calculate cross-sections that are specific to the acceleration voltage. We make these tabulated GOS available under an open-source license to the benefit of both academic users as well as allowing integration into commercial solutions.</description>

      <title>Phase field simulations of thermal annealing for all-small molecule organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interest in organic solar cells (OSCs) is constantly rising in the field of photovoltaic devices. The device performance relies on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) nanomorphology, which develops during the drying process and additional post-treatment. This work studies the effect of thermal annealing (TA) on an all-small molecule DRCN5T: PC71 BM blend with phase field simulations. The objective is to determine the physical phenomena driving the evolution of the BHJ morphology for a better understanding of the posttreatment/morphology relationship. Phase-field simulation results are used to investigate the impact on the final BHJ morphology of the DRCN5T crystallization-related mechanisms, including nucleation, growth, crystal stability, impingement, grain coarsening, and Ostwald ripening, of the amorphous-amorphous phase separation (AAPS), and of diffusion limitations. The comparison of simulation results with experimental data shows that the morphological evolution of the BHJ under TA is dominated by dissolution of the smallest, unstable DRCN5T crystals and anisotropic growth of the largest crystals.</description>

      <title>Diamine Surface Passivation and Post-Annealing Enhance Performance of Silicon-Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the use of 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP) as a chemical modifier at the perovskite/electron-transport layer (ETL) interface enhances the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.7 eV bandgap FACs mixed-halide perovskite single-junction cells, primarily by boosting the open-circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.06 V to 1.15 V. Adding a post-processing annealing step after C60 evaporation, further improves the fill factor (FF) by 20% from the control to the DAP + post-annealing devices. Using hyperspectral photoluminescence microscopy, we demonstrate that annealing helps improve compositional homogeneity at the top and bottom interfaces of the solar cell, which prevents detrimental bandgap pinning in the devices and improves C60 adhesion. Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, we show that DAP reacts with formamidinium present near the surface of the perovskite lattice to form a larger molecular cation, 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidinium (THP) that remains at the interface. Combining the use of DAP and the annealing of C60 interface, we fabricate Si-perovskite tandems with PCE of 25.29%, compared to 23.26% for control devices. Our study underscores the critical role of chemical reactivity and thermal post-processing of the C60/Lewis-base passivator interface in minimizing device losses and advancing solar-cell performance of wide-bandgap mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite for tandem application.</description>
