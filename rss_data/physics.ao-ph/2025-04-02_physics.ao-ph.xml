      <title>Improving Predictions of Convective Storm Wind Gusts through Statistical Post-Processing of Neural Weather Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Issuing timely severe weather warnings helps mitigate potentially disastrous consequences. Recent advancements in Neural Weather Models (NWMs) offer a computationally inexpensive and fast approach for forecasting atmospheric environments on a 0.25{\deg} global grid. For thunderstorms, these environments can be empirically post-processed to predict wind gust distributions at specific locations. With the Pangu-Weather NWM, we apply a hierarchy of statistical and deep learning post-processing methods to forecast hourly wind gusts up to three days ahead. To ensure statistical robustness, we constrain our probabilistic forecasts using generalised extreme-value distributions across five regions in Switzerland. Using a convolutional neural network to post-process the predicted atmospheric environment's spatial patterns yields the best results, outperforming direct forecasting approaches across lead times and wind gust speeds. Our results confirm the added value of NWMs for extreme wind forecasting, especially for designing more responsive early-warning systems.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale Eddy -- Internal Wave Coupling. III. The End of the Enstrophy Cascade and Maintenance of Gyre Scale Potential Vorticity Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess a prognostic formulation of triple coherence relating to energy exchange between mesoscale eddies and the internal wavefield and compare with observations from the Sargasso Sea. This effort involves updates to a theory articulated in M\"uller (1976) that balances eddy induced wavefield perturbations with nonlinearity using a relaxation time scale approximation. Agreement of the prognostic formulations with data is remarkable and is consistent with eddy-wave coupling dominating the regional internal wave energy budget. The goodness of this effort reinforces a prior hypothesis that the character of the internal wavefield in the Sargasso Sea is set by this interaction, which, in turn, serves as an amplifier of tertiary energy inputs from larger vertical scales that characterize internal swell. Extraction of eddy energy happens at the horizontal and vertical scales that characterize baroclinic instability and potential vorticity fluxes. With this knowledge and confidence, we then speculate on the role that this coupling plays with regards to mesoscale eddy dynamics in the Southern Recirculation Gyre of the Gulf Stream. We argue that this nonlinear relaxation effectively provides a local eddy enstrophy damping consistent with potential vorticity flux observations from the Local Dynamics Experiment. This happens at spatial scales somewhat smaller than the energy extraction scale and locates the end of the potential enstrophy cascade in the spectral domain as the energy containing scale of the internal wavefield. The dynamical consequence is that mesoscale eddy - internal wave coupling is responsible for the maintenance of gyre scale potential vorticity gradients.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models for probabilistic precipitation generation from atmospheric variables</title>

Abstract: Improving the representation of precipitation in Earth system models (ESMs) is critical for assessing the impacts of climate change and especially of extreme events like floods and droughts. In existing ESMs, precipitation is not resolved explicitly, but represented by parameterizations. These typically rely on resolving approximated but computationally expensive column-based physics, not accounting for interactions between locations. They struggle to capture fine-scale precipitation processes and introduce significant biases. We present a novel approach, based on generative machine learning, which integrates a conditional diffusion model with a UNet architecture to generate accurate, high-resolution (0.25{\deg}) global daily precipitation fields from a small set of prognostic atmospheric variables. Unlike traditional parameterizations, our framework efficiently produces ensemble predictions, capturing uncertainties in precipitation, and does not require fine-tuning by hand. We train our model on the ERA5 reanalysis and present a method that allows us to apply it to arbitrary ESM data, enabling fast generation of probabilistic forecasts and climate scenarios. By leveraging interactions between global prognostic variables, our approach provides an alternative parameterization scheme that mitigates biases present in the ESM precipitation while maintaining consistency with its large-scale (annual) trends. This work demonstrates that complex precipitation patterns can be learned directly from large-scale atmospheric variables, offering a computationally efficient alternative to conventional schemes.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry and Dynamical Constraints in 2-Limbs Retrieval of WASP-39 b Inferring from JWST Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy has provided unprecedented insight into the makeup of exoplanet atmospheres. A transmission spectrum contains contributions from a planet's morning and evening limbs, which can differ in temperature, composition and aerosol properties due to atmospheric circulation. While high-resolution ground-based observations have identified limb asymmetry in several ultra-hot/hot exoplanets, space-based studies of limb asymmetry are still in their early stages. The prevalence of limb asymmetry across a broad range of exoplanets remains largely unexplored. We conduct a comparative analysis of retrievals on transmission spectra, including traditional 1D approaches and four 2D models that account for limb asymmetry. Two of these 2D models include our newly proposed dynamical constraints derived from shallow-water simulations to provide physically-motivated temperature differences between limbs. Our analysis of WASP-39 b using JWST observations and previous combined datasets (HST, VLT, and Spitzer) strongly favors 2D retrievals over traditional 1D approaches, confirming significant limb asymmetry in this hot Jupiter. Within our 2D framework, unconstrained models recover larger temperature contrasts than dynamically-constrained models, with improved fits to specific spectral features, although Bayesian evidence cannot definitively distinguish between these 2D approaches. Our results support the presence of homogeneous C/O in both the morning and evening atmospheres, but with temperature differences leading to variations in clouds and hazes. Using this treatment, we can study a larger sample of hot Jupiters to gain insights into atmospheric limb asymmetries on these planets.</description>

      <title>The climates and thermal emission spectra of prime nearby temperate rocky exoplanet targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the course of the past decade, advances in the radial velocity and transit techniques have enabled the detection of rocky exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. Future observations with novel methods are required to characterize this sample of planets, especially those that are non-transiting. One proposed method is the Planetary Infrared Excess (PIE) technique, which would enable the characterization of non-transiting planets by measuring the excess infrared flux from the planet relative to the star's spectral energy distribution. In this work, we predict the efficacy of future observations using the PIE technique by potential future observatories such as the MIRECLE mission concept. To do so, we conduct a broad suite of 21 General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations with ExoCAM of seven nearby habitable zone targets for three choices of atmospheric composition with varying partial pressure of CO$_2$. We then construct thermal phase curves and emission spectra by post-processing our ExoCAM GCM simulations with the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG). We find that all cases have distinguishable carbon dioxide and water features assuming a 90$^\circ$ orbital inclination. Notably, we predict that CO$_2$ is potentially detectable at 15 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ with MIRECLE for at least four nearby known non-transiting rocky planet candidate targets in the habitable zone: Proxima Cenaturi b, GJ 1061 d, GJ 1002 b, and Teegarden's Star c. Our ExoCAM GCMs and PSG post-processing demonstrate the potential to observationally characterize nearby non-transiting rocky planets and better constrain the potential for habitability in our Solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for data-driven weather models</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based data-driven weather forecasting models have experienced rapid progress over the last years. Recent studies, with models trained on reanalysis data, achieve impressive results and demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art physics-based numerical weather prediction models across a range of variables and evaluation metrics. Beyond improved predictions, the main advantages of data-driven weather models are their substantially lower computational costs and the faster generation of forecasts, once a model has been trained. However, most efforts in data-driven weather forecasting have been limited to deterministic, point-valued predictions, making it impossible to quantify forecast uncertainties, which is crucial in research and for optimal decision making in applications. Our overarching aim is to systematically study and compare uncertainty quantification methods to generate probabilistic weather forecasts from a state-of-the-art deterministic data-driven weather model, Pangu-Weather. Specifically, we compare approaches for quantifying forecast uncertainty based on generating ensemble forecasts via perturbations to the initial conditions, with the use of statistical and machine learning methods for post-hoc uncertainty quantification. In a case study on medium-range forecasts of selected weather variables over Europe, the probabilistic forecasts obtained by using the Pangu-Weather model in concert with uncertainty quantification methods show promising results and provide improvements over ensemble forecasts from the physics-based ensemble weather model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for lead times of up to 5 days.</description>

      <title>Properties and baroclinic instability of stratified thermal upper-ocean flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of, and investigate the stability of a baroclinic zonal current in, a thermal rotating shallow-water model, sometimes called \emph{Ripa's model}, featuring stratification for quasigeostrophic upper-ocean dynamics. The model has Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure. In addition to Casimirs, the model supports weak Casimirs forming the kernel of the Lie--Poisson bracket for the potential vorticity evolution independent of the details of the buoyancy as this is advected under the flow. The model sustains Rossby waves and a neutral model, whose spurious growth is prevented by a positive-definite integral, quadratic on the deviation from the motionless state. A baroclinic zonal jet with vertical curvature is found to be spectrally stable for specific configurations of the gradients of layer thickness, vertically averaged buoyancy, and buoyancy frequency. Only a subset of such states was found Lyapunov stable using the available integrals, except the weak Casimirs, whose role in constraining stratified thermal flow remains to be understood. The existence of Lyapunov-stable states enabled us to \emph{a priori} bound the nonlinear growth of perturbations to spectrally unstable states. Our results do not support the generality of earlier numerical evidence on the suppression of submesoscale wave activity as a result of the inclusion of stratification in thermal shallow-water theory, which we supported with direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Generative Data Assimilation of Sparse Weather Station Observations at Kilometer Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation of observational data into full atmospheric states is essential for weather forecast model initialization. Recently, methods for deep generative data assimilation have been proposed which allow for using new input data without retraining the model. They could also dramatically accelerate the costly data assimilation process used in operational regional weather models. Here, in a central US testbed, we demonstrate the viability of score-based data assimilation in the context of realistically complex km-scale weather. We train an unconditional diffusion model to generate snapshots of a state-of-the-art km-scale analysis product, the High Resolution Rapid Refresh. Then, using score-based data assimilation to incorporate sparse weather station data, the model produces maps of precipitation and surface winds. The generated fields display physically plausible structures, such as gust fronts, and sensitivity tests confirm learnt physics through multivariate relationships. Preliminary skill analysis shows the approach already outperforms a naive baseline of the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh system itself. By incorporating observations from 40 weather stations, 10% lower RMSEs on left-out stations are attained. Despite some lingering imperfections such as insufficiently disperse ensemble DA estimates, we find the results overall an encouraging proof of concept, and the first at km-scale. It is a ripe time to explore extensions that combine increasingly ambitious regional state generators with an increasing set of in situ, ground-based, and satellite remote sensing data streams.</description>

      <title>Entropic learning enables skilful forecasts of ENSO phase at up to two years lead time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends previous work (Groom et al., \emph{Artif. Intell. Earth Syst.}, 2024) in applying the entropy-optimal Sparse Probabilistic Approximation (eSPA) algorithm to predict ENSO phase, defined by thresholding the Ni\~no3.4 index. Only satellite-era observational datasets are used for training and validation, while retrospective forecasts from 2012 to 2022 are used to assess out-of-sample skill at lead times up to 24 months. Rather than train a single eSPA model per lead, we introduce an ensemble approach in which multiple eSPA models are aggregated via a novel meta-learning strategy. The features used include the leading principal components from a delay-embedded EOF analysis of global sea surface temperature, vertical temperature gradient (a thermocline proxy), and tropical Pacific wind stresses. Crucially, the data is processed to prevent any form of information leakage from the future, ensuring realistic real-time forecasting conditions. Despite the limited number of training instances, eSPA avoids overfitting and produces probabilistic forecasts with skill comparable to the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) ENSO prediction plume. Beyond the IRI's lead times, eSPA maintains skill out to 22 months for the ranked probability skill score and 24 months for accuracy and area under the ROC curve, all at a fraction of the computational cost of a fully-coupled dynamical model. Furthermore, eSPA successfully forecasts the 2015/16 and 2018/19 El Ni\~no events at 24 months lead, the 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2020/21 La Ni\~na events at 24 months lead and the 2021/22 and 2022/23 La Ni\~na events at 12 and 8 months lead.</description>
