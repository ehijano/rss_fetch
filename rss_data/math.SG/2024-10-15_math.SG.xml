      <title>Integrability of bi-Hamiltonian systems using Casimir functions and characteristic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that for a pencil of compatible Poisson brackets $\mathcal{P} = \left\{\mathcal{A} + \lambda\mathcal{B} \right\}$ the local Casimir functions of Poisson brackets $\mathcal{A} + \lambda \mathcal{B}$ and coefficients of the characteristic polynomial $p_{\mathcal{P}}$ commute w.r.t. all Poisson brackets of the pencil $\mathcal{P}$. We give a criterion when this family of functions is complete. These results generalize previous constructions of complete commutative subalgebras in the symmetric algebra $S(\mathfrak{g})$ of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ by A.S. Mishchenko &amp; A.T. Fomenko, A.V. Bolsinov &amp; P. Zhang and A.M. Izosimov.</description>

      <title>E-structures and almost regular Poisson manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, $b$-symplectic manifolds have become important structures in the study of symplectic geometry, serving as Poisson manifolds that retain symplectic properties away from a hypersurface. Inspired by this rich landscape, $E$-structures were introduced by Nest and Tsygan in \cite{NT2} as a comprehensive framework for exploring generalizations of $b$-structures. This paper initiates a deeper investigation into their Poisson facets, building on foundational work by \cite{MS21}. We also examine the closely related concept of almost regular Poisson manifolds, as studied in \cite{AZ17}, which reveals a natural Poisson groupoid associated with these structures.
  In this article, we investigate the intricate relationship between $E$-structures and almost regular Poisson structures. Our comparative analysis not only scrutinizes their Poisson properties but also offers explicit formulae for the Poisson structure on the Poisson groupoid associated to the $E$-structures as both Poisson manifolds and singular foliations. In doing so, we reveal an interesting link between the existence of commutative frames and Darboux-Carath\'eodory-type expressions for the relevant structures.</description>

      <title>Symplectic cuts and open/closed strings II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2306.07329 we established a connection between symplectic cuts of Calabi-Yau threefolds and open topological strings, and used this to introduce an equivariant deformation of the disk potential of toric branes. In this paper we establish a connection to higher-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometries by showing that the equivariant disk potential arises as an equivariant period of certain Calabi-Yau fourfolds and fivefolds, which encode moduli spaces of one and two symplectic cuts (the maximal case) by a construction of Braverman arXiv:alg-geom/9712024. Extended Picard-Fuchs equations for toric branes, capturing dependence on both open and closed string moduli, are derived from a suitable limit of the equivariant quantum cohomology rings of the higher Calabi-Yau geometries.</description>

      <title>Big Quantum cohomology of orbifold spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.11180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a Kodaira-Spencer map from the big quantum cohomology of a sphere with three orbifold points to the Jacobian ring of the mirror Landau-Ginzburg potential function. This is constructed via the Lagrangian Floer theory of the Seidel Lagrangian and we show that Kodaira-Spencer map is a ring isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Presymplectic geometry and Liouville sectors with corners and its monoidality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.11726v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a presymplectic characterization of Liouville sectors introduced by Ganatra-Pardon-Shende in terms of the characteristic foliation of the boundary, which we call Liouville $\sigma$-sectors. We extend this definition to the case with corners using the presymplectic geometry of null foliations of the coisotropic intersections of transverse coisotropic collection of hypersurfaces which appear in the definition of Liouville sectors with corners. We show that the set of Liouville $\sigma$-sectors with corners canonically forms a monoid which provides a natural framework of considering the K\"unneth-type functors in the wrapped Fukaya category. We identify its automorphism group which enables one to give a natural definition of bundles of Liouville sectors. As a byproduct, we affirmatively answer to a question raised in Question 2.6 in [GPS20], which asks about the optimality of their definition of Liouville sectors [GPS20].</description>

      <title>Recovering contact forms from boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact connected smooth manifold with boundary. The paper deals with contact $1$-forms $\beta$ on $X$, whose Reeb vector fields $v_\beta$ admit Lyapunov functions $f$. We prove that any odd-dimensional $X$ admits such a contact form.
  We tackle the question: how to recover $X$ and $\beta$ from the appropriate data along the boundary $\partial X$? We describe such boundary data and prove that they allow for a reconstruction of the pair $(X, \beta)$, up to a diffeomorphism of $X$. We use the term ``holography" for the reconstruction. We say that objects or structures inside $X$ are {\it holographic}, if they can be reconstructed from their $v_\beta$-flow induced ``shadows" on the boundary $\partial X$.
  We also introduce numerical invariants that measure how ``wrinkled" the boundary $\partial X$ is with respect to the $v_\beta$-flow and study their holographic properties under the contact forms preserving embeddings of equidimensional contact manifolds with boundary. We get some ``non-squeezing results" about such contact embedding, which are reminiscent of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem in symplectic geometry.</description>
