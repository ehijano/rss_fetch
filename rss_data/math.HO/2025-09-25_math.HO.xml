      <title>The strange story of an almost unknown prime number counter: The Rafael Barrett formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19324v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief article, we present the formula created by Rafael Barrett in 1903 in a note to Henri Poincar\'e, which remained unknown for decades. Once discovered in the 1930s by an Uruguayan mathematician, this formula was disseminated and analyzed in a journal published in Montevideo in 1935. In this study, we present Barrett's formula and discuss some of its challenges it may pose.</description>

      <title>The Inverse Function Fallacy: On Sign Determination and Forgotten Fundamentals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although inverse functions are introduced early in algebra, many students remain unaware that an inverse expression may legitimately involve a negative root. Instead, they default to assuming a positive root, overlooking the role of domain restrictions in determining the correct solution. This paper identifies this misconception as the "inverse function fallacy" and introduces a systematic approach, the Inverse Function Point method, that establishes sign determination to a single domain-based reference point. In a study of 69 STEM students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, only 19% solved a sign-determination problem correctly on their first attempt. Those students were not re-tested. Of the remaining 56 who answered incorrectly, I was able to re-test 40 after teaching the proposed method. In this subgroup, accuracy rose to 80%. These results highlight both the fragility of assumed mathematical knowledge and the potential of simple, intuitive procedures to reinforce conceptual understanding.</description>

      <title>Didactic analysis of the modality of study of the real numbers in the Degree in Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To conduct a didactic analysis of the current modality of study of real numbers in the Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics, we rely on the notion of didactic paradigm and employ a novel research methodology within the framework of the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic. This methodology proposes that, in general, analysing a modality of study of a field of knowledge, currently implemented in a certain didactic institution, consists of modelling, through respective didactic paradigms, not only the current modality of study but also: (1) an alternative modality of study (a possible future) whose didactic ends include attempting to avoid certain current phenomena considered ``undesirable'' from the perspective of research; and (2) an antecedent modality of study (a possible past) that allows us to explain the emergence of current phenomena as a reaction to the existence of certain antecedent phenomena.</description>
