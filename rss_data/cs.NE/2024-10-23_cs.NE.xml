      <title>Hardware-Software Co-optimised Fast and Accurate Deep Reconfigurable Spiking Inference Accelerator Architecture Design Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to improve the energy efficiency of machine learning models, as they naturally implement event-driven computations while avoiding expensive multiplication operations. In this paper, we develop a hardware-software co-optimisation strategy to port software-trained deep neural networks (DNN) to reduced-precision spiking models demonstrating fast and accurate inference in a novel event-driven CMOS reconfigurable spiking inference accelerator. Experimental results show that a reduced-precision Resnet-18 and VGG-11 SNN models achieves classification accuracy within 1% of the baseline full-precision DNN model within 8 spike timesteps. We also demonstrate an FPGA prototype implementation of the spiking inference accelerator with a throughput of 38.4 giga operations per second (GOPS) consuming 1.54 Watts on PYNQ-Z2 FPGA. This corresponds to 0.6 GOPS per processing element and 2.25,GOPS/DSP slice, which is 2x and 4.5x higher utilisation efficiency respectively compared to the state-of-the-art. Our co-optimisation strategy can be employed to develop deep reduced precision SNN models and port them to resource-efficient event-driven hardware accelerators for edge applications.</description>

      <title>In-the-loop Hyper-Parameter Optimization for LLM-Based Automated Design of Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automatically generating and optimizing (meta)heuristics, making them valuable tools in heuristic optimization tasks. However, LLMs are generally inefficient when it comes to fine-tuning hyper-parameters of the generated algorithms, often requiring excessive queries that lead to high computational and financial costs. This paper presents a novel hybrid approach, LLaMEA-HPO, which integrates the open source LLaMEA (Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm) framework with a Hyper-Parameter Optimization (HPO) procedure in the loop. By offloading hyper-parameter tuning to an HPO procedure, the LLaMEA-HPO framework allows the LLM to focus on generating novel algorithmic structures, reducing the number of required LLM queries and improving the overall efficiency of the optimization process.
  We empirically validate the proposed hybrid framework on benchmark problems, including Online Bin Packing, Black-Box Optimization, and the Traveling Salesperson Problem. Our results demonstrate that LLaMEA-HPO achieves superior or comparable performance compared to existing LLM-driven frameworks while significantly reducing computational costs. This work highlights the importance of separating algorithmic innovation and structural code search from parameter tuning in LLM-driven code optimization and offers a scalable approach to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-based code generation.</description>

      <title>Steering Large Language Models using Conceptors: Improving Addition-Based Activation Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have transformed AI, yet reliably controlling their outputs remains a challenge. This paper explores activation engineering, where outputs of pre-trained LLMs are controlled by manipulating their activations at inference time. Unlike traditional methods using a single steering vector, we introduce conceptors - mathematical constructs that represent sets of activation vectors as ellipsoidal regions. Conceptors act as soft projection matrices and offer more precise control over complex activation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that conceptors outperform traditional methods across multiple in-context learning steering tasks. We further use Boolean operations on conceptors that allows for combined steering goals that empirically outperforms combining steering vectors on a set of tasks. These results highlight conceptors as a promising tool for more effective steering of LLMs.</description>

      <title>The Neuromorphic Analog Electronic Nose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid detection of gas concentration is important in different domains like gas leakage monitoring, pollution control, and so on, for the prevention of health hazards. Out of different types of gas sensors, Metal oxide (MOx) sensors are extensively used in such applications because of their portability, low cost, and high sensitivity for specific gases. However, how to effectively sample the MOx data for the real-time detection of gas and its concentration level remains an open question. Here we introduce a simple analog front-end for one MOx sensor that encodes the gas concentration in the time difference between pulses of two separate pathways. This front-end design is inspired by the spiking output of a mammalian olfactory bulb. We show that for a gas pulse injected in a constant airflow, the time difference between pulses decreases with increasing gas concentration, similar to the spike time difference between the two principal output neurons in the olfactory bulb. The circuit design is further extended to a MOx sensor array and this sensor array front-end was tested in the same environment for gas identification and concentration estimation. Encoding of gas stimulus features in analog spikes at the sensor level itself may result in data and power-efficient real-time gas sensing systems in the future that can ultimately be used in uncontrolled and turbulent environments for longer periods without data explosion.</description>

      <title>High-Order Associative Learning Based on Memristive Circuits for Efficient Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristive associative learning has gained significant attention for its ability to mimic fundamental biological learning mechanisms while maintaining system simplicity. In this work, we introduce a high-order memristive associative learning framework with a biologically realistic structure. By utilizing memristors as synaptic modules and their state information to bridge different orders of associative learning, our design effectively establishes associations between multiple stimuli and replicates the transient nature of high-order associative learning. In Pavlov's classical conditioning experiments, our design achieves a 230% improvement in learning efficiency compared to previous works, with memristor power consumption in the synaptic modules remaining below 11 {\mu}W. In large-scale image recognition tasks, we utilize a 20*20 memristor array to represent images, enabling the system to recognize and label test images with semantic information at 100% accuracy. This scalability across different tasks highlights the framework's potential for a wide range of applications, offering enhanced learning efficiency for current memristor-based neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <title>Real-time Sub-milliwatt Epilepsy Detection Implemented on a Spiking Neural Network Edge Inference Processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect the epileptic seizure status of a subject presents a challenge to existing technologies aimed at providing timely and efficient diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to detect interictal and ictal periods of epileptic seizures using a spiking neural network (SNN). Our proposed approach provides an online and real-time preliminary diagnosis of epileptic seizures and helps to detect possible pathological conditions.To validate our approach, we conducted experiments using multiple datasets. We utilized a trained SNN to identify the presence of epileptic seizures and compared our results with those of related studies. The SNN model was deployed on Xylo, a digital SNN neuromorphic processor designed to process temporal signals. Xylo efficiently simulates spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with exponential input synapses. Xylo has much lower energy requirments than traditional approaches to signal processing, making it an ideal platform for developing low-power seizure detection systems.Our proposed method has a high test accuracy of 93.3% and 92.9% when classifying ictal and interictal periods. At the same time, the application has an average power consumption of 87.4 uW(IO power) + 287.9 uW(computational power) when deployed to Xylo. Our method demonstrates excellent low-latency performance when tested on multiple datasets. Our work provides a new solution for seizure detection, and it is expected to be widely used in portable and wearable devices in the future.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Decomposition-Based Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization: Part I-Past and Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decomposition has been the mainstream approach in classic mathematical programming for multi-objective optimization and multi-criterion decision-making. However, it was not properly studied in the context of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) until the development of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). In this two-part survey series, we use MOEA/D as the representative of decomposition-based EMO to review the up-to-date development in this area, and systematically and comprehensively analyze its research landscape. In the first part, we present a comprehensive survey of the development of MOEA/D from its origin to the current state-of-the-art approaches. In order to be self-contained, we start with a step-by-step tutorial that aims to help a novice quickly get onto the working mechanism of MOEA/D. Then, selected major developments of MOEA/D are reviewed according to its core design components including weight vector settings, subproblem formulations, selection mechanisms and reproduction operators. Besides, we also overview some selected advanced topics for constraint handling, optimization in dynamic and uncertain environments, computationally expensive objective functions, and preference incorporation. In the final part, we shed some light on emerging directions for future developments.</description>

      <title>StochGradAdam: Accelerating Neural Networks Training with Stochastic Gradient Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce StochGradAdam, a novel optimizer designed as an extension of the Adam algorithm, incorporating stochastic gradient sampling techniques to improve computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance. StochGradAdam optimizes by selectively sampling a subset of gradients during training, reducing the computational cost while preserving the advantages of adaptive learning rates and bias corrections found in Adam. Our experimental results, applied to image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrate that StochGradAdam can achieve comparable or superior performance to Adam, even when using fewer gradient updates per iteration. By focusing on key gradient updates, StochGradAdam offers stable convergence and enhanced exploration of the loss landscape, while mitigating the impact of noisy gradients. The results suggest that this approach is particularly effective for large-scale models and datasets, providing a promising alternative to traditional optimization techniques for deep learning applications.</description>

      <title>A Self-Organizing Clustering System for Unsupervised Distribution Shift Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling non-stationary data is a challenging problem in the field of continual learning, and data distribution shifts may result in negative consequences on the performance of a machine learning model. Classic learning tools are often vulnerable to perturbations of the input covariates, and are sensitive to outliers and noise, and some tools are based on rigid algebraic assumptions. Distribution shifts are frequently occurring due to changes in raw materials for production, seasonality, a different user base, or even adversarial attacks. Therefore, there is a need for more effective distribution shift detection techniques. In this work, we propose a continual learning framework for monitoring and detecting distribution changes. We explore the problem in a latent space generated by a bio-inspired self-organizing clustering and statistical aspects of the latent space. In particular, we investigate the projections made by two topology-preserving maps: the Self-Organizing Map and the Scale Invariant Map. Our method can be applied in both a supervised and an unsupervised context. We construct the assessment of changes in the data distribution as a comparison of Gaussian signals, making the proposed method fast and robust. We compare it to other unsupervised techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel-PCA. Our comparison involves conducting experiments using sequences of images (based on MNIST and injected shifts with adversarial samples), chemical sensor measurements, and the environmental variable related to ozone levels. The empirical study reveals the potential of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new approach to processing complex-valued data using DNNs consisting of parallel real-valued subnetworks with coupled outputs. Our proposed class of architectures, referred to as Steinmetz Neural Networks, leverages multi-view learning to construct more interpretable representations within the latent space. Moreover, we present the Analytic Neural Network, which incorporates a consistency penalty that encourages analytic signal representations in the latent space of the Steinmetz neural network. This penalty enforces a deterministic and orthogonal relationship between the real and imaginary components. Utilizing an information-theoretic construction, we demonstrate that the generalization error upper bound posited by the analytic neural network is lower than that of the general class of Steinmetz neural networks. Our numerical experiments depict the improved performance and robustness to additive noise, afforded by these networks on benchmark datasets and synthetic examples.</description>

      <title>Advancing Training Efficiency of Deep Spiking Neural Networks through Rate-based Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent insights have revealed that rate-coding is a primary form of information representation captured by surrogate-gradient-based Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) in training deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Motivated by these findings, we propose rate-based backpropagation, a training strategy specifically designed to exploit rate-based representations to reduce the complexity of BPTT. Our method minimizes reliance on detailed temporal derivatives by focusing on averaged dynamics, streamlining the computational graph to reduce memory and computational demands of SNNs training. We substantiate the rationality of the gradient approximation between BPTT and the proposed method through both theoretical analysis and empirical observations. Comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR10-DVS validate that our method achieves comparable performance to BPTT counterparts, and surpasses state-of-the-art efficient training techniques. By leveraging the inherent benefits of rate-coding, this work sets the stage for more scalable and efficient SNNs training within resource-constrained environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/Tab-ct/rate-based-backpropagation.</description>

Abstract: We describe a proposal for increasing the effective clock speed of a thermodynamic computer, by altering the interaction scale of the units within the computer and introducing to the computer an additional source of noise. The resulting thermodynamic computer program is equivalent to the original computer program, but runs at a higher clock speed. This approach offers a way of increasing the speed of thermodynamic computing while preserving the fidelity of computation.</description>
