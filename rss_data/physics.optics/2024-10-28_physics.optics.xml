      <title>Nonlinear Shaping in the Picosecond Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightwave pulse shaping in the picosecond regime has remained unaddressed because it resides beyond the limits of state-of-the-art techniques, either due to its inherently narrow spectral content or fundamental speed limitations in electronic devices. The so-called picosecond shaping gap hampers progress in ultrafast photoelectronics, health and medical technologies, energy and material sciences, and many other fundamental sciences. We report on a novel nonlinear method to simultaneously frequency-convert and adaptably shape the envelope of light wavepackets in the picosecond regime by balancing spectral engineering and nonlinear conversion in solid-state nonlinear media, without requiring active devices. The versatility of our methodology is captured computationally by generating a multitude of temporally shaped pulses via various nonlinear conversion chains and initial conditions. Additionally, we experimentally demonstrate this framework by producing picosecond-shaped, ultra-narrowband, near-transform limited pulses from broadband, femtosecond input pulses. Our proofs provide an avenue toward arbitrary and programmable lightwave shaping for GHz-to-THz photoelectronic sciences and technologies.</description>

      <title>Engineering optical forces through Maxwell stress tensor inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise spatial manipulation of particles via optical forces is essential in many research areas, ranging from biophysics to atomic physics. Central to this effort is the challenge of designing optical systems that are optimized for specific applications. Traditional design methods often rely on trial-and-error methods, or on models that approximate the particle as a point dipole, which only works for particles much smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic field. In this work, we present a general inverse design framework based on the Maxwell stress tensor formalism capable of simultaneously designing all components of the system, while being applicable to particles of arbitrary sizes and shapes. Notably, we show that with small modifications to the baseline formulation, it is possible to engineer systems capable of attracting, repelling, accelerating, oscillating, and trapping particles. We demonstrate our method using various case studies where we simultaneously design the particle and its environment, with particular focus on free-space particles and particle-metalens systems.</description>

      <title>Large-area multiwavelength and polarization-insensitive metalenses via multilayer Huygens metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metalenses, advanced nanostructured alternatives to conventional lenses, significantly enhance the compactness and functionality of optical systems. Despite progress in monochromatic applications, scaling metalenses to centimeter-sized apertures for broadband or multiwavelength use remains challenging due to limitations in achieving the necessary group delay (GD) with current materials. In this study, we introduce a novel multiwavelength, polarization-insensitive metalens design operating in the near-infrared (NIR). Our approach employs multiple Huygens' metasurface layers, each optimized to modulate a specific wavelength while maintaining high transmittance and minimal phase disturbance at other wavelengths. We demonstrate a metalens operating at 2000 and 2340 nm with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.11. In simulation, the metalens achieves a normalized modulation transfer function (MTF) that is nearly exactly diffraction-limited. The absolute focusing efficiencies are 65% and 56%, corresponding to relative efficiencies of 76% and 65% compared to an ideal lens of the same dimensions. The meta-atoms are designed using an inverse shape-optimization method that ensures polarization insensitivity and high tolerance to layer misalignment. The proposed design is compatible with large-area nanofabrication techniques, allowing metasurface layers to be fabricated individually and assembled into the final device. This innovative approach is also generalizable to any arbitrary multiwavelength phase profile beyond that of simple lensing.</description>

      <title>Terahertz semiconductor laser chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaos characterized by its irregularity and high sensitivity to initial conditions finds various applications in secure optical communications, random number generations, light detection and ranging systems, etc. Semiconductor lasers serve as ideal light platforms for chaos generations owing to the advantages in on-chip integration and complex nonlinear effects. In near-infrared wavelengths, semiconductor laser based chaotic light sources have been extensively studied and experimentally demonstrated. However, in the terahertz (THz) spectral range, due to the lack of effective THz light sources and high-speed detectors, chaos generation in THz semiconductor lasers, e.g., quantum cascade lasers (QCLs), is particularly challenging. Due to the fast intersubband carrier transitions, single mode THz QCLs resemble Class A lasers, where chaos can be hardly excited, even with external perturbations. In this work, we experimentally show a THz chaos source based on a sole multimode THz QCL without any external perturbations. Such a dynamical regime is characterized by the largest Lyapunov exponent associated to the temporal traces of the measured radio frequency (intermode beatnote) signal of the laser. The experimental results and chaos validation are confirmed by simulations of our model based on effective semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch Equations. To further understand the physical mechanism of the chaos generation in THz QCLs, a reduced model based on two coupled complex Ginzburg-Landau equations is derived from the full model cited above to systematically investigate the effects of the linewidth enhancement factor and group velocity dispersion on the chaotic regime. This model allows us to show that the chaos generation in the THz QCL can be ascribed to the system attaining the defect mediated turbulence regime.</description>

      <title>Chaos from a free-running broad-area VCSEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally report on the detection of chaos from a free-running commercial broad-area VCSEL without the need for external perturbation such as optical feedback, injection or current modulation. The evolution of nonlinear dynamics leading to chaotic behavior is studied, and the system's complexity is characterized using chaos titration and correlation dimension. We link the occurence of chaos with the complex interplay between the spatial laser modes competition and polarization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Engineered Dual BIC Resonances in Hybrid Metasurfaces for Controlled Photoluminescence Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of miniaturized light sources with tunable functionality is crucial for advancing integrated photonic devices, enabling applications in quantum computing, communications, and sensing. Achieving tunable light emission after device fabrication remains a significant challenge, particularly when efficient amplification is required. Hybrid metasurfaces, which integrate several nanostructured materials to form optical resonators, have emerged as promising candidates to overcome these limitations by providing a high degree of flexibility in emission control and enhanced amplification. In this work, we demonstrate tunable amplified photoluminescence (PL) in nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) quantum dots (QDs) embedded in a hybrid metasurface consisting of amorphous silicon (a-Si) and a low-loss phase change material (PCM) antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3). The nc-Si QDs maintain a high PL efficiency and stability at elevated temperatures, offering reliable and tunable phase transitions in the PCM. The hybrid metasurface supports dual quasi-bound states in the continuum (BICs) to achieve Q-factors up to 225. The dual BIC cavity enables tunable amplified PL by a factor of 15 with a wavelength shift of up to 105 nm via dimensional modulation. Meanwhile, all-optical tunable PL emission across a 24 nm wavelength range has been achieved when PCMs are tuned from the amorphous to crystalline phase. Furthermore, we propose a high Q-factor metalens to focus the tunable amplified PL, extending the diffraction-limited focusing tunability into the near infrared (NIR). This work paves the way for highly efficient quantum light sources using reconfigurable nanophotonic devices in next-generation photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Large-area photonic circuits for terahertz detection and beam profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deployment of terahertz communication and spectroscopy systems relies on the availability of low-noise and fast detectors, with plug-and-play capabilities. However, most currently available technologies are stand-alone, discrete components, either slow or susceptible to temperature drifts. Moreover, phase-sensitive schemes are mainly based on bulk crystals and require tight beam focusing. Here, we demonstrate an integrated photonic architecture in thin-film lithium niobate that addresses these challenges by exploiting the electro-optic modulation induced by a terahertz signal onto an optical beam at telecom frequencies. Leveraging on the low optical losses provided by this platform, we integrate a double array of up to 18 terahertz antennas within a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, considerably extending the device collection area and boosting the interaction efficiency between the terahertz signal and the optical beam. We show that the double array coherently builds up the probe modulation through a mechanism of quasi-phase-matching, driven by a periodic terahertz near-field pattern, without physical inversion of the crystallographic domains. The array periodicity controls the detection bandwidth and its central frequency, while the large detection area ensures correct operation with diverse terahertz beam settings. Furthermore, we show that the antennas act as pixels that allow reconstruction of the terahertz beam profile impinging on the detector area. Our on-chip design in thin-film lithium niobate overcomes the detrimental effects of two-photon absorption and fixed phase-matching conditions, which have plagued previously explored electro-optic detection systems, especially in the telecom band, paving the way for more advanced on-chip terahertz systems.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on epitaxial InGaP for quantum and nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical materials are essential for the development of both nonlinear and quantum optics and have advanced recently from bulk crystals to integrated material platforms. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the emerging InGaP $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear integrated photonics platform and its experimental achievements. With its exceptional $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity and low optical losses, the epitaxial InGaP platform significantly enhances a wide range of second-order nonlinear optical effects, from second-harmonic generation to entangled photon pair sources, achieving efficiencies several orders of magnitude beyond the current state of the art. Moreover, the InGaP platform enables quantum nonlinear optics at the few- and single-photon levels via passive nonlinearities, which has broad implications for quantum information processing and quantum networking. We also examine the current limitations of the InGaP platform and propose potential solutions to fully unlock its capabilities.</description>

      <title>A simple accurate way to model noise-seeded ultrafast nonlinear processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise can play an important role in nonlinear pulse propagation. It is not only the origin of fluctuations in supercontinuum but can also determine the generated signal amplitude and phase, as seen in phenomena such as noise-seeded four-wave mixing and spontaneous Raman scattering. Current models rely on input-pulse shot noise and Raman Langevin term to simulate noise-seeded Kerr effects and spontaneous Raman scattering, respectively. However, they cannot accurately simulate any nonlinear effects exhibiting asymmetries, for example, between spontaneous Stokes and anti-Stokes generation, or in amplification with emission and absorption cross sections. Moreover, combining these two techniques does not lead to accurate modeling of both effects simultaneously, especially in unsaturated Raman operational regimes or supercontinuum where spontaneous Raman emission noise plays a crucial role. To resolve this issue, we propose a new modified shot-noise model by directly introducing noise into the pulse propagation equation. It minimally modifies current models that contain only stimulated terms.</description>

      <title>Micromotors Driven by Spin-Orbit Interaction of Light: Mimicking Planetary Motion at the Microscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of optical micromotors driven by the spin-orbit interaction of light and spin-driven fluid flows leading to simultaneous rotation and revolution of the micromotors. The micromotors are essentially birefringent liquid crystal particles (LC) that can efficiently convert the angular momentum of light into high-frequency rotational motion. By tightly focusing circularly polarized Gaussian beams through a high numerical aperture objective into a refractive index stratified medium, we create a spherically aberrated intensity profile where the spinning motion of a micromotor optically trapped at the centre of the profile induces fluid flows that causes orbiting motion of the off-axially trapped surrounding particles (secondary micromotors). In addition, the interaction between the helicity of light and the anisotropic properties of the LC medium leads to the breaking of the input helicity and drives the conversion of right to left-circular polarization and vice-versa. This spin-to-spin conversion, causes the orbiting secondary micromotors to spin in certain cases as well so that the entire system of spinning primary micromotor and revolving and spinning secondary micromotors is reminiscent of planetary motion at mesoscopic scales. Our findings, supported by both theoretical modeling and experimental validation, advance the understanding of light-matter interactions at the microscale.</description>

      <title>Superposition- and interference-induced optical spectrum distortion in the figure-9 fiber laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of the output pulses from the figure-9 laser typically exhibits more distortion than the spectra from mode-locked lasers based on other saturable absorbers and the spectrum of its intracavity pulses. Here, we demonstrate two figure-9 lasers with repetition rates of 190.6 MHz and 92.4 MHz and introduce the self-designed beam splitter with little spectral impact in the fiber loop to output two interference-free pulses. By numerically processing the spectra of these two pulses, the formation mechanisms of specific spectral features are determined, and the features are consistent with the experimental spectral features of the pulses from the other two ports. Furthermore, by analyzing the pulse propagation of lasers through the interference theory of the figure-9 laser, it is found that the superposition and interference of spectra at the two output ports of the linear arm are the reasons for the severe spectral distortion, rather than the commonly believed nonlinear effects. On the beam splitter where interference occurs, the $p$-components of the two intracavity light beams always interferes with equal intensity, while the $s$-components usually interfere with non-equal intensity, resulting in a large but stable spectral difference between the pulses inside the cavity and the output pulses. These findings can provide new perspectives for simulating spectra that closely resemble experimental results and deepen our understanding of spectral evolution and pulse dynamics of the figure-9 laser.</description>

      <title>A Breakthrough in Resonance Analysis for Complex Multilayered Structures in Small, High-Contrast Nonlinear Media with Kerr Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering resonances play a crucial role in understanding wave behavior in various physical systems. While significant progress has been made in analyzing resonances in high-contrast and nonlinear media, a general characterization of resonances in small, high-contrast nonlinear media with the Kerr effect, particularly in layered configurations, has remained an open problem. In this paper, we present a novel asymptotic approach that addresses this gap by providing an approximation for resonances in terms of material properties, geometry, and nonlinearity. Our results offer new insights into the dependence of resonances on these factors, particularly for complex multilayered structures, making this the first general characterization of its kind.</description>

      <title>Routing Light Emission from Monolayer MoS$_2$ by Mie Resonances of Crystalline Silicon Nanospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dielectric Mie-resonant nanoantenna is capable of controlling the directionality of the emission from nearby quantum emitters through the excitation of multiple degenerate Mie resonances. A crystalline silicon nanosphere (Si NS) is a promising candidate for a dielectric nanoantenna because crystalline Si has a large refractive index (3.8 at 650 nm) and the small imaginary part of a complex refractive index (0.015 at 650 nm) as an optical material. In this work, we control the emission directionality of excitons supported by monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (1L-TMDCs) using a Si NS. We first discuss the condition to extract the emission preferentially towards the Si NS side from the analytical calculations. We then study the photoluminescence (PL) of 1L-TMDCs on which differently sized single Si NSs are placed. We show that the PL spectral shape strongly depends on the emission direction, and that the emission toward the Si NS side (top) with respect to the opposite side (bottom) is the largest at wavelengths between the magnetic dipole and electric dipole Mie resonances of a Si NS. Finally, we quantitatively discuss the spectral shape of the top-to-bottom ratio from numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Modelling resonant transmission in a Fabry-Perot/Surface-Plasmon microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled surface plasmons arise in the surfaces of a dielectric layer between two metallic media when a dim wave propagating in the dielectric generates resonant free charge oscillations at the interfaces. Here, we consider surface plasmon resonance in a Fabry-Perot type cavity with plane metallic mirrors and an inner dielectric medium, optically less dense than the outer surrounding dielectric medium. The experimentally observed transmission as a function of both the angle of incidence of light and the wavelength is well modelled by an elementary transmittance function from which resonance conditions are obtained both in the Fabry-Perot and Surface-Plasmon regime.</description>

      <title>Observation of the magic angle and flat band physics in dipolar photonic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evanescently coupled waveguide arrays provide a tabletop platform to realize a variety of Hamiltonians, where physical waveguides correspond to the individual sites of a tight-binding lattice. Nontrivial spatial structure of the waveguide modes enriches this picture and uncovers further possibilities. Here, we demonstrate that the effective coupling between $p$-like modes of adjacent photonic waveguides changes its sign depending on their relative orientation vanishing for a proper alignment at a so-called magic angle. Using femtosecond laser-written waveguides, we demonstrate this experimentally for $p$-mode dimers and graphene-like photonic lattices exhibiting quasi-flat bands at this angle. We observe diffraction-free propagation of corner and bulk states providing a robust experimental evidence of a two-dimensional Aharonov-Bohm-like caging in an optically switchable system.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin 3R-MoS$_2$ metasurfaces with atomically precise edges for efficient nonlinear nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces that combine high-index materials with optical nonlinearities are widely recognized for their potential in various quantum and classical nanophotonic applications. However, the fabrication of high-quality metasurfaces poses significant material-dependent challenges, as their designs are often susceptible to disorder, defects, and scattering losses, which are particularly prone to occur at the edges of nanostructured features. Additionally, the choice of the material platforms featuring second-order optical nonlinearities, $\chi^{(2)}$, is limited to broken-inversion symmetry crystals such as GaAs, GaP, LiNbO$_3$, and various bulk van der Waals materials, including GaSe and NbOCl$_2$. Here, we use a combination of top-down lithography and anisotropic wet etching of a specially stacked van der Waals crystal -- 3R-MoS$_2$, which exhibits both a high refractive index and exceptional $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity, to produce metasurfaces consisting of perfect equilateral triangle nanoholes with atomically precise zigzag edges. Due to the geometry of the triangle, the etching process is accompanied by a transition from an in-plane $C_4$ symmetric structure to a broken-in-plane symmetry configuration, thereby allowing for the realization of the quasi-bound-state-in-the-continuum (q-BIC) concept. The resulting ultrathin metasurface ($\sim$ 20-25 nm) demonstrates a remarkable enhancement in second-harmonic generation (SHG) -- over three orders of magnitude at specific wavelengths and linear polarization directions compared to a host flake.</description>

      <title>Temporal localization of optical waves supported by a copropagating quasiperiodic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on time crystals concerns the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in time, as well as the realization of phenomena and phases known from solid-state physics in the time domain. Periodically driven systems of massive particles are widely used in these studies. In the present work, we consider a photonic system and demonstrate that stable nonlinear propagation of a strong optical wave in a fiber leads to the establishment of quasi-periodic oscillations in the electromagnetic field intensity. A second, weaker signal optical wave propagating in the fiber senses these oscillations and, as a result, undergoes exponential localization in time. This is a temporal analogue of Aubry-Andre localization. If an optical detector is placed at a certain position in the fiber, the temporal localization of the probe wave will be observed in the form of the signal which emerges and then decays as a function of time.</description>

      <title>Terahertz chiral photonic-crystal cavities with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling between matter and vacuum electromagnetic fields in a cavity can induce novel quantum phases in thermal equilibrium via symmetry breaking. Particularly, coupling with circularly polarized fields can break time-reversal symmetry, leading to topological modifications in the band structure. Therefore, chiral optical cavities that host chiral vacuum fields are being sought, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a novel approach to achieving THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) with high-quality factors (&gt;400) using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. Numerical simulations of an optimized structure based on InSb in a small perpendicular magnetic field (~0.2 T) show chiral cavity resonances with near-perfect ellipticity at the surfaces of the central dielectric layer, where one can place atomically thin materials like monolayer graphene. We theoretically estimate an energy gap on the order of 1 meV in graphene when coupled to our proposed chiral cavity, which is potentially measurable in experiments. These THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring new phases in cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Cavity dark mode mediated by atom array without atomic scattering loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize a ring cavity strongly interacting with an atom array with configurable spatial structures. By preparing the atom array with a maximized structure factor, we observe the emergence of a cavity dark mode, where the standing-wave nodes are dynamically locked to the positions of the atoms. The dark mode is decoupled from the atoms, protecting the system from dissipation through atomic scattering, but still mediates strong coupling and enables efficient conversion between two optical modes. Moreover, we impart an arbitrary large phase shift on the converted optical fields by translating the atom array. This strongly interacting ring cavity system with single-atom addressability opens ways to quantum optical engineering and the generation of photonic quantum states based on the geometrical structure of atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Lensing point-spread function of coherent astrophysical sources and non-trivial wave effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most research on astrophysical lensing has been conducted using the geometric optics framework, where there exists a clear concept of lensing images. However, wave optics effects can be important for coherent sources, e.g. pulsars, fast raio bursts, and gravitational waves observed at long wavelengths. There, the concept of lensing images needs an extension. We introduce the concept of the `lensing point-spread function' (LPSF), the smoothed flux density distribution of a coherent point source after being lensed, as a generalization of the lensing image concept at finite frequencies. The frequency-dependent LPSF captures the gradual change of the flux density distribution of the source from discrete geometric images at high frequencies to a smooth distribution at low frequencies. It complements other generalizations of lensing images, notably the imaginary images and the Lefschetz thimbles. Being a footprint of a lensing system, the LPSF is useful for theoretical studies of lensing. Using the LPSF, we identify a frequency range with non-trivial wave effects, where both geometric optics and perturbative wave optics fail, and determine this range to be $|\kappa|^{-1} \lesssim \nu \lesssim 10$, with $\kappa$ and $\nu$ being the dimensionless lens amplitude and the reduced observing frequency, respectively. Observation of LPSFs with non-trivial wave effects requires either very close-by lenses or very large observing wavelengths. The potential possibilities are the lensing of gravitational waves, the plasma lensing of Milky Way pulsars, and lensing by the solar gravitational lens.</description>

      <title>3D Distance-color-coded Assessment of PCI Stent Apposition via Deep-learning-based Three-dimensional Multi-object Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronary artery disease poses a significant global health challenge, often necessitating percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation. Assessing stent apposition holds pivotal importance in averting and identifying PCI complications that lead to in-stent restenosis. Here we proposed a novel three-dimensional (3D) distance-color-coded assessment (DccA)for PCI stent apposition via deep-learning-based 3D multi-object segmentation in intravascular optical coherence tomography (IV-OCT). Our proposed 3D DccA accurately segments 3D vessel lumens and stents in IV-OCT images, using a spatial matching network and dual-layer training with style transfer. It quantifies and maps stent-lumen distances into a 3D color space, facilitating 3D visual assessment of PCI stent apposition. Achieving over 95% segmentation precision, our proposed DccA enhances clinical evaluation of PCI stent deployment and supports personalized treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Super-resolved virtual staining of label-free tissue using diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual staining of tissue offers a powerful tool for transforming label-free microscopy images of unstained tissue into equivalents of histochemically stained samples. This study presents a diffusion model-based super-resolution virtual staining approach utilizing a Brownian bridge process to enhance both the spatial resolution and fidelity of label-free virtual tissue staining, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based methods. Our approach integrates novel sampling techniques into a diffusion model-based image inference process to significantly reduce the variance in the generated virtually stained images, resulting in more stable and accurate outputs. Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution, structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images. Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential for clinical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by nonlinear interaction in a coupler supported by fractional diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a one-dimensional model of coupled fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with a double-well potential applied to one component. This study examines ground state (GS) solitons, observing spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in both the actuated field and the partner component due to linear coupling. Numerical simulations reveal symmetric and asymmetric profiles arising from a slightly asymmetric initial condition. Asymmetry is influenced by nonlinearities, potential depth, and coupling strength, with self-focusing systems favoring greater asymmetry. Fractional diffraction affects the amplitude and localization of symmetric profiles and the stability of asymmetric ones. We identify critical L\'evy index values for generating coupled GS solitons. Stability analysis of unstable, centrally asymmetric GS solitons demonstrates oscillatory dynamics, providing new insights into SSB in fractional systems and half-trapped solitons.</description>

      <title>Exact theory of edge diffraction and launching of transverse electric plasmons at two-dimensional junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact solution for electromagnetic wave diffraction at the junction of two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) is obtained and analyzed for electric field polarized along the edge. A special emphasis is paid to the metal-contacted and terminated edges. In the former case, electric field at the edge tends to zero; in the latter case, it tends to a finite value which is screened by 2d system in an anomalous fashion. For both types of edge and capacitive type of 2d conductivity, an incident wave excites transverse electric 2d plasmons. The amplitude of excited TE plasmons is maximized and becomes order of incident wave amplitude for capacitive impedance of 2DES order of free space impedance. For both large and small 2DES impedance, the amplitude of TE plasmons tends to zero according to the power laws which are explicitly derived.</description>

      <title>Upconversion of Phonon Modes into Microwave Photons in a Lithium Niobate Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonator Coupled to a Microwave Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between acoustic vibrations in a lithium niobate bulk acoustic wave resonator and microwave photons of a re-entrant microwave cavity was investigated at a temperature close to 4 K. Coupling was achieved by placing the acoustic resonator in the location of the re-entrant cavity electric field maxima, in a symmetric ``split-post'' configuration, with a large overlap between the microwave field and the acoustic mode, allowing acoustic modulations of the microwave frequency. We show that the acoustic modes in this setup retain large inherent quality factors of greater than $10^6$. A maximum optomechanical coupling rate was determined to be $g_0$ = 0.014 mHz, four orders of magnitude larger than previous results obtained using a quartz BAW at 4 K in a similar experimental setup, but using a single post-re-entrant cavity resonator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving oscillations with small dimensions, high power, high coherence, and low phase noise has been a long-standing goal in wave physics, driving innovations across classical electromagnetic theory and quantum physics. Key applications include electronic oscillators, lasers, and spin-torque oscillations. In recent decades, physicists have increasingly focused on harnessing passive oscillatory modes to manipulate these oscillations, leading to the development of diverse gain-loss coupled systems, including photon-photon, exciton-photon, photon-magnon, magnon-phonon, and magnon-magnon couplings. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these systems, exploring their fundamental physical structures, key experimental observations, and theoretical insights. By synthesizing insights from these studies, we propose future research directions to further advance the understanding and application of gain-loss coupled systems for quantum science and quantum technologies. (The field of gain-loss coupled systems is vast. The authors welcome suggestions and feedback from the community to continuously improve this review article until it is published).</description>

Abstract: We present high precision measurements of the radiative heat transfer of a glass microsphere immersed in a thermal bath in vacuum facing three different planar substrates (SiO2, SiC and Au), which exhibit very different optical behaviors in the infrared region. Using a thermoresistive probe on a cantilever, we show the non-monotonic behavior of the radiative flux between the microsphere and its environment when the microsphere is brought closer to the substrate in the far-field to near-field transition regime. We demonstrate that this unexpected behavior is related to the singularities of dressed emission mechanisms in this three-body system sphere-substrate-bath with respect to the separation distance.</description>

      <title>Lossless photon flux sensing methodology for EUV and Soft X-ray metrology systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple, lossless method for monitoring photon flux in short-wavelength metrology systems, with a particular focus on applications using high harmonic generation (HHG) light sources. In HHG-based metrology, where photon scarcity often limits precision and efficiency, the ability to monitor flux without sacrificing photons is critical. This demonstrated approach measures a photon-induced current in a metallic EUV filter, generated by primary and secondary electrons released via the photoelectric effect during exposure to high-energy photons. By integrating this current over a set exposure period, we obtain a build-up charge directly correlated with the incident photon flux. This measurement provides a reliable, real-time indicator of photon flux, allowing for precise normalization in metrology experiments without introducing additional optical losses. The method leverages any conductive component that are typically present in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) metrology setups, making it a cost-effective and straightforward addition to existing systems.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum impact on light scattering by phonons tested experimentally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarized Raman spectra of piezoelectric bismuth germanate single crystal were recorded using vortex light in order to verify the predicted symmetry selection rules for Raman scattering of photons with nonzero orbital angular momentum. At first, the phonon spectrum is fully characterized by the infrared reflectivity and Raman scattering with ordinary light. Then, vortex light Raman spectra were compared with the ordinary ones, but no influence of the orbital momentum on the Raman spectra of Bi$_4$Ge$_3$O$_{12}$ was observed. In particular, we experimentally negate the theoretical prediction that Raman scattering using vortex light can yield frequencies of the silent optic modes of Bi$_4$Ge$_3$O$_{12}$. We also have not seen evidence for the predicted symmetry-lowering of the Raman scattering tensors of $E$ modes. We propose that the orbital momentum effects are inaccessible to the ordinary Raman spectroscopy experiments because of the tiny magnitudes of typical phonon coherence lengths.</description>

      <title>All-optical Saddle Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superposition of frequency-shifted Laguerre-Gauss modes can produce a rotating saddle-like intensity profile. When spinning fast enough, the optical forces produced by this structured light saddle generate a dynamically stable equilibrium point capable of trapping nanoparticles in a high vacuum, akin to a Paul trap but with its unique characteristics. We analyze the stability conditions and center-of-mass motion, dynamics and cooling of a nanoparticle levitated in the optical saddle trap. We expect the optical saddle to find applications in levitated optomechanics experiments requiring fast parametric modulation and inverted squeezing potential landscapes.</description>

      <title>Digital stabilization of an IQ modulator in the carrier suppressed single side-band (CS-SSB) mode for atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an all-digital method for stabilising the phase biases in an electro-optic I/Q modulator for carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation. Building on the method presented in S. Wald \ea, Appl. Opt. \textbf{62}, 1-7 (2023), we use the Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14 platform to digitally generate and demodulate an auxiliary radio-frequency tone whose beat with the optical carrier probes the I/Q modulator's phase imbalances. We implement a multiple-input, multiple-output integral feedback controller which accounts for unavoidable cross-couplings in the phase biases to lock the error signals at exactly zero where optical power fluctuations have no impact on phase stability. We demonstrate $&gt;23\,\rm dB$ suppression of the optical carrier relative to the desired sideband at $+3.4\,\rm GHz$ over a period of $15$ hours and over temperature variations of $20^\circ\rm C$.</description>

      <title>High-resolution direct phase control in the spectral domain in ultrashort pulse lasers for pulse-shaping applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast laser systems, those with a pulse duration on the order of picoseconds or less, have enabled advancements in a wide variety of fields. Of particular interest to this work, these laser systems are the key component to many High Energy Density (HED) physics experiments. Despite this, previous studies on the shape of the laser pulse within the HED community have focused primarily on pulse duration due to the relationship between pulse duration and peak intensity, while leaving the femtosecond scale structure of the pulse shape largely unstudied. To broaden the variety of potential pulses available for study, a method of reliably adjusting the pulse shape at the femtosecond scale using sub-nanometer resolution Direct Phase Control has been developed. This paper examines the capabilities of this new method compared to more commonplace dispersion-based pulse shaping methods. It also will detail the capabilities of the core algorithm driving this technique when used in conjunction with the WIZZLER and DAZZLER instruments that are common in high intensity laser labs. Finally, some discussion is given to possible applications on how the Direct Phase Control pulse shaping technique will be implemented in the future.</description>

      <title>A tuneable frequency comb via dual-beam laser-solid harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high-power laser pulse at normal incidence onto a plane solid target will generate odd harmonics of its frequency. However, the spacing of the harmonic lines in this configuration is fixed. Here, we study harmonic generation using two laser beams incident on a plane target at small, opposite angles to the target normal, via particle-in-cell simulations. When looking at the harmonic radiation in a specific direction via a narrow slit or pinhole, we select an angle-dependent subset of the harmonic spectrum. This way, we obtain a harmonic frequency comb that we control via the observation angle and the input laser frequency. The divergence of the harmonic radiation will be reduced by using wider laser spots, thus increasing the efficacy of the scheme. We will discuss extensions to this scheme, such as using beams with unequal frequencies, a slight tilt of the target, or employing more than two beams.</description>

      <title>Extending the FDTD GVADE method nonlinear polarization vector to include anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the finite-difference time-domain general vector auxiliary differential equation method [Greene, J. H. and A. Taflove, Opt. Express 14, 8305 (2006)], nonlinear polarization vector, the nonlinear electric dipole moment per unit volume, is extended to include anisotropy, in nonlinear isotropic media at optical frequencies. The theory is presented for extending the method in 3D Cartesian coordinates, and then simulation results are presented for the simplified 2D transverse magnetic case, revisiting the fused silica example introduced in the 2006 paper including the anisotropic part of the nonlinear polarization vector. The simulation results including the anisotropic part of the polarization vector were compared with isotropic polarization vector simulation results.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Electromagnetic Surface Waves at the Interface Between Perfect Electric Conductor and Perfect Magnetic Conductor Parallel-Plate Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new electromagnetic surface waves at the interface formed by connecting a perfect electric conductor (PEC) and a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) parallel plate waveguides containing materials with positive permittivities and permeabilities. This challenges the conventional understanding that surface waves require materials with negative permittivity or permeability. Theoretical mode analysis and numerical simulations have confirmed the existence of surface waves at the PEC-PMC interface. Additionally, a simulated prism coupling experiment validated the excitation of the surface wave at the PEC-PMC interface. The resonant response of the localized surface waves on the enclosed PEC-PMC surface of a cylinder also closely resembles that of a Drude cylinder. Our finding broadens the understanding of the conditions for generating electromagnetic surface waves and deepens our comprehension of electromagnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hypermultiplexed Integrated-Photonics-based Tensor Optical Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18050v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating data volume and complexity resulting from the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT) and 5G/6G mobile networks is creating an urgent need for energy-efficient, scalable computing hardware. Here we demonstrate a hypermultiplexed integratedphotonics-based tensor optical processor (HITOP) that can perform trillions of operations per second (TOPS) at the energy efficiency of 40 TOPS/W. Space-time-wavelength three-dimensional (3D) optical parallelism enables O($N^{2}$) operations per clock-cycle using O($N$) modulator devices. The system is built with wafer-fabricated III/V micron-scale lasers and high-speed thin-film Lithium-Niobate electro-optics for encoding at 10s femtojoule/symbol. Lasing threshold incorporates analog inline rectifier (ReLu) nonlinearity for low-latency activation. The system scalability is verified with machine learning models of 405,000 parameters. A combination of high clockrates, energy-efficient processing and programmability unlocks the potential of light for large-scale AI accelerators in applications ranging from training of large AI models to real-time decision making in edge deployment.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Mpemba effect with non-classical states of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect refers to the surprising observation where, under certain conditions, a far-from-equilibrium state can relax toward equilibrium faster than a state closer to equilibrium. A paradigmatic example is provided by the curious fact that hot water can sometimes freeze faster than cold water. The Mpemba effect has intrigued scientists since long time and has been predicted and observed in a variety of classical and quantum systems. Recently, the search for Mpemba-like effects of purely quantum nature has raised a major interest. Here we predict the emergence of Mpemba effect in the quantum optics context exploiting non-classical states of light. By analyzing the decay dynamics of photon fields in a leaky optical resonator or waveguide, it is demonstrated that bosonic Mpemba effect emerges in the context of the quantum nature of light. Specifically, the relaxation dynamics is strongly influenced by the photon statistics of the initially trapped light field. The Mpemba effect is observed when comparing the decay dynamics of classical light fields (coherent states) with certain non-classical states, such as Fock states, squeezed states and Schr\"odinger cat states.</description>
