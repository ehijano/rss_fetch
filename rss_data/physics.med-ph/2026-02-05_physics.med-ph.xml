      <title>Angle dependent dose transformer algorithm for fast proton therapy dose calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D dose calculation for Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Therapy (PBSPT) is typically performed with Monte Carlo (MC) engines, but their runtimes limit adaptive workflows and repeated evaluations. Current deep-learning proton dose engines often require orthogonality between proton rays and the CT grid, forcing computationally expensive beamlet-wise 3D reinterpolation. We propose the Angle-dependent Dose Transformer Algorithm (ADoTA), which eliminates grid rotation by augmenting the model input with a fast analytical beamlet-shape projection that explicitly encodes beam direction. The model was trained on CT data from 108 patients to predict beamlet dose distributions for initial energies of $70$--$270\,\mathrm{MeV}$ over an $80\times110\,\mathrm{mm}^2$ field, and tested on an independent cohort of 50 patients. On the test set, gamma pass rates $(1\%,3\,\mathrm{mm})$ were $99.40\pm0.86\%$ (thorax) and $99.87\pm0.23\%$ (abdomen/pelvis). Single-beamlet inference took $1.72\pm0.8\,\mathrm{ms}$. By avoiding reinterpolation, end-to-end 3D dose computation was reduced by $\approx86\%$ relative to the fastest published reinterpolation-based methods. For full treatment plans, gamma pass rates $\Gamma(2\%,2\,\mathrm{mm})$ with a 10\% dose cut-off reached $98.4\%$ (lung) and $98.9\%$ (prostate). ADoTA provides an angle-aware deep-learning proton dose engine that preserves MC-level accuracy across heterogeneous anatomies while substantially reducing computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Human-organ-scale x-ray fluorescence ghost imaging for radioisotope-free diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of diagnostic information in medicine is currently obtained using radioactive tracers. While central to nuclear medicine, these methods are inherently constrained: radiation dose limits repeat examinations, short tracer half-lives and complex logistics restrict access and raise costs, and their relatively poor spatial resolution often necessitates complementary CT or MRI. Here we present a first proof-of-concept demonstration of a non-radioactive alternative based on x-ray fluorescence (XRF) computational ghost imaging (CGI) at the human-organ scale. Using a thyroid phantom filled with iodine solution as a model system, we show that structured illuminations combined with fluorescence detection reconstruct the iodine distribution with high fidelity. This approach eliminates the need for radioactive tracers while preserving image quality, and in principle can reach spatial resolution comparable to CT. Beyond this demonstration, XRF-CGI establishes a generalizable framework for non-radioactive tracer imaging, opening a route toward safer, repeatable, and more accessible diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Object independent scatter sensitivities for PET, applied to scatter estimation through fast Monte Carlo simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattered coincidences introduce quantitative bias in positron emission tomography (PET) and must be compensated during reconstruction. Conventional scatter estimates typically rely on simplified cylindrical scanner models that omit detector physics. Incorporating detector sensitivities for scatter is challenging because scattered events exhibit less constrained properties, such as incidence angles, compared to true coincidences. We integrated a 5D single-photon detection probability lookup table (LUT) accounting for photon energy, incidence angle, and detector location into the simulator logic. The resulting scatter sinogram is scaled by a precomputed, LUT-specific scatter sensitivity sinogram. Scatter was simulated using MCGPU-PET, a fast Monte Carlo (MC) simulator with a simplified scanner model, and applied to phantom data from a simulated GE Signa PET/MR in GATE. We evaluated three scenarios: (1) high-count MC simulations from a known activity distribution; (2) limited-count simulations; and (3) joint estimation of activity and scatter under low-count conditions. The method was also tested on two real Signa PET/MR acquisitions. In scenario 1, scatter-compensated reconstructions achieved &lt;1% global bias in all active regions. In scenario 2, noisy scatter estimates caused positive bias, but Gaussian smoothing restored accuracy to scenario 1 levels. In scenario 3, joint estimation maintained &lt;1% bias in nearly all regions. For real scans, the MC-based scatter estimate closely matched the vendor-provided scatter estimate. This proof-of-concept demonstrates that scatter sensitivity modeling can enhance simulators by incorporating detector physics. It supports the feasibility of using fast MC simulations for real scans, offering improved accuracy and robustness to acquisition noise in clinical PET reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Axonal microstructure and compartmentalization impact the orientation and time dependence of mesoscopic transverse relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26267v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In biological tissue, MR transverse relaxation stems from mechanisms spanning multiple scales, from molecular dipole-dipole interactions to mesoscopic field variations driven by tissue microstructure. While mesoscopic relaxation reflects cellular organization, its dynamics in white matter, specifically its dependence on axonal orientation and echo time, remain less investigated. This study employs theoretical frameworks and Monte-Carlo simulations using 3D EM-based white matter (WM) geometries to investigate how compartmentalization and realistic morphology drive these effects. Specifically, we simulate intra-axonal relaxation driven by magnetic fields induced by realistic axonal myelin sheaths and intra-axonal spheres as a model of iron-containing mitochondria. Our results confirm that orientation dependence of mesoscopic relaxation in WM is detectable and agrees with experimental observations. The time-dependence aligns with 1-dimensional short-range structural disorder, but at clinical echo times, this signature may be masked by dominant molecular relaxation. This work moves beyond idealized models to aid the development of more specific biophysical models of mesoscopic relaxation to achieve better biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease.</description>

      <title>Reducing acquisition time and radiation damage: data-driven subsampling for spectro-microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectro-microscopy is an experimental technique which can be used to observe spatial variations in chemical state and changes in chemical state over time or under experimental conditions. As a result it has broad applications across areas such as energy materials, catalysis, environmental science and biological samples. However, the technique is often limited by factors such as long acquisition times and radiation damage. We present two measurement strategies that allow for significantly shorter experiment times and total doses applied. The strategies are based on taking only a small subset of all the measurements (e.g. sparse acquisition or subsampling), and then computationally reconstructing all unobserved measurements using mathematical techniques. The methods are data-driven, using spectral and spatial importance subsampling distributions to identify important measurements. As a result, taking as little as 4-6\% of the measurements is sufficient to capture the same information as in a conventional scan.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale tissue properties and electric fields in brain stimulation: Bridging the macroscopic and microscopic scales using layer-specific cortical conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16465v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in neural stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link underlying microscopic tissue structure with macroscopic assumptions. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Conductivity variations within the cortex are expected given the differences in cell density and volume fraction across layers. We review recent efforts modeling microscopic and mesoscopic E-fields and outline approaches that bridge micro- and macroscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions. Using simplified microscopic models, effective tissue conductivity was estimated as a function of volume fraction of extracellular space, and the conductivities of different cortical layers were interpolated based on experimental volume fraction. The effective tissue conductivities were monotonically decreasing convex functions of the cell volume fraction. With decreasing cell volume fraction, the conductivity of cortical layers increased with depth from layer 2 to 6. Although the variation of conductivity within the cortex was small when compared to the conductivity of extracellular fluid (9% to 15%), the conductivity difference was considerably larger when compared between layers, e.g., with layer 3 and 6 being 20% and 50% more conductive than layer 2, respectively. The review and analysis provide a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural stimulation. Using layer-specific conductivity values within the cortex could improve the accuracy of estimations of thresholds and distributions of neural activation in E-field models of brain stimulation.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Learning of the Wave Speed Landscape in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave velocity is a key parameter for imaging complex media, but in vivo measurements are typically limited to reflection geometries, where only backscattered waves from short-scale heterogeneities are accessible. As a result, conventional reflection imaging fails to recover large-scale variations of the wave velocity landscape. Here we show that matrix imaging overcomes this limitation by exploiting the quality of wave focusing as an intrinsic guide star. We model wave propagation as a trainable multi-layer network that leverages optimization and deep learning tools to infer the wave velocity distribution. We validate this approach through ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms and human breast tissues, demonstrating its potential for tumour detection and characterization. Our method is broadly applicable to any kind of waves and media for which a reflection matrix can be measured.</description>
