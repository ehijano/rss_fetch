      <title>Subdivision of Simplicial Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained exploration of subdivisions of simplicial complexes, with emphasis on barycentric subdivision. We present formal definitions of subdivisions, show how the realization of a complex is preserved under subdivision, and illustrate these concepts with explicit examples and detailed diagrams. The paper develops the general method of constructing subdivisions by starring from interior points, leading to the standard barycentric and derived subdivisions. We give precise statements and proofs demonstrating that repeated barycentric subdivision reduces the mesh below any prescribed scale, ensuring compatibility with given metrics and enabling applications such as simplicial approximation and homological analysis. Examples and TikZ illustrations clarify the structure of iterated subdivisions for finite complexes, highlighting their geometric and topological properties.</description>

      <title>On \tilde{Spec}(M) Topology of Module M over Commutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let R be a commutative ring with unity and M be an R-module. In this study, we construct the \tilde{Spec}(M) topology using the prime spectrum of module M and multiplicatively closed subsets of R with the closed sets \tilde{V}(S)={P \in Spec(M) : (P : M) \cap S_i \neq \emptyset for all i \in I} with the open sets \tilde{D}(S_i):={P \in Spec(M) : (P : M) \cap S_i = \emptyset} where S = {S_i}_{i \in I} is a family of multiplicatively closed subsets of R. We investigate connections between the algebraic properties of R-module M and the topological properties of \tilde{Spec}(M). We examine specifically the separation axioms, connectivity, nested and Lindel\"of property together with quasi-compactness as well as the isolated, closure, interior and limit points of tilde{Spec}(M). Moreover, in the last section, we provide an example of a Lindel\"of space which is not quasi-compact by means of \tilde{Spec}(M).</description>

      <title>Enveloping semigroups as compactifications of topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ellis's "functional approach" allows one to obtain proper compactifications of a topological group $G$ if $G$ can be represented as a subgroup of the homeomorphism group of a space $X$ in the topology of pointwise convergence and $G$-space $X$ is $G$-Tychonoff. These compactifications, called Ellis compactifications, are right topological monoids and $G$-compactifications of the group $G$ with its action by multiplication on the left on itself. A comparison is made between Ellis compactifications of $G$ and the Roelcke compactification of $G$. Uniformity corresponding to the Ellis compactification of $G$ for its representation in a compact space $X$ is established.
  Proper Ellis semigroup compactifications are described for groups ${\rm S}(X)$ (the permutation group of a discrete space $X$) and ${\rm Aut} (X)$ (automorphism group of an ultrahomogeneous chain $X$) in the permutation topology and ${\rm Aut} (X)$ of LOTS $X$ in the topology of pointwise convergence.</description>
