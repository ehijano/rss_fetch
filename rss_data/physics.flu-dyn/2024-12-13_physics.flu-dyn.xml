      <title>Critical nanoparticle formation in iron combustion: single particle experiments with in-situ multi-parameter diagnostics aided by multi-scale simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) presents challenges such as efficiency losses and fine dust emissions in practical iron combustion systems, highlighting the need for deeper understanding of the formation mechanisms and thermochemical conditions. This study combines experiments and multi-scale simulations to analyze NP clouds generated by single iron particles burning in high-temperature oxidizing environments. The ambient gas conditions were provided by a laminar flat flame burner, with post-flame oxygen mole fractions varied between 20, 30, and 40 vol% at a constant temperature of ~1800K. High-speed in-situ diagnostics were used to measure particle size, NP initiation, NP cloud evolution, and microparticle surface temperature history. The experimental setup utilized three 10kHz imaging systems: one for two-color pyrometry and two for diffusive-backlight illumination (DBI), targeting particle size and NP measurements. The findings showcase the powerful capabilities of multi-physics diagnostics in quantifying NP initiation time and temperature, which depend on particle size and ambient oxygen concentration. CFD simulations revealed enhanced convection velocity driven by increased Stefan flow, which transported NPs toward parent iron particles under high-oxygen conditions. This delayed the detection of NP clouds, leading to higher microparticle temperatures at NP initiation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations uncovered FeO2(g) as a key NP precursor, forming when Fe atoms dissociate from the liquid phase. The initial temperature significantly influenced the resulting nanocluster composition, with Fe(II) dominating at higher temperatures and Fe(III) at lower temperatures. This integrated approach enhances understanding of NP formation in iron combustion, offering insights into the conditions affecting nanoparticle characteristics.</description>

      <title>Extreme low submergence in deep-canopy flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates converged statistics in three-dimensional deep-canopy-dominated flows under two low relative submergence conditions: $h/k=1.5$ and $h/k=1.2$. Using a multi-plane telecentric PIV setup, time-averaged velocity fields were obtained across nine planes. For $h/k=1.5$, the flow structure exhibited a classical three-region behavior: a uniform emergent zone, a mixing zone and a logarithmic free-flow zone. In contrast, the extreme low submergence case ($h/k=1.2$) revealed significant flow modifications, including seiching - a periodic free-surface oscillation typically associated with emergent flows. Local double-averaged velocity profiles showed a unique undershoot near $z/k=0.8$, reflecting enhanced momentum transfer from cavity flows to alleys of the canopy. These findings highlight the transition mechanisms from submerged to emergent flow regimes, providing insights into canopy hydrodynamics and the influence of submergence on momentum transport.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Model Uncertainty of Neural Network-based Turbulence Closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing computational demand, Neural-Network (NN) based models are being developed as pre-trained surrogates for different thermohydraulics phenomena. An area where this approach has shown promise is in developing higher-fidelity turbulence closures for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The primary bottleneck to the widespread adaptation of these NN-based closures for nuclear-engineering applications is the uncertainties associated with them. The current paper illustrates three commonly used methods that can be used to quantify model uncertainty in NN-based turbulence closures. The NN model used for the current study is trained on data from an algebraic turbulence closure model. The uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods explored are Deep Ensembles, Monte-Carlo Dropout, and Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI). The paper ends with a discussion on the relative performance of the three methods for quantifying epistemic uncertainties of NN-based turbulence closures, and potentially how they could be further extended to quantify out-of-training uncertainties. For accuracy in turbulence modeling, paper finds Deep Ensembles have the best prediction accuracy with an RMSE of $4.31\cdot10^{-4}$ on the testing inputs followed by Monte-Carlo Dropout and Stochastic Variational Inference. For uncertainty quantification, this paper finds each method produces unique Epistemic uncertainty estimates with Deep Ensembles being overconfident in regions, MC-Dropout being under-confident, and SVI producing principled uncertainty at the cost of function diversity.</description>

      <title>Predicting Performance of Microfluidic-Based Alginate Microfibers with Feature-Supplemented Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selection of solution concentrations and flow rates for the fabrication of microfibers using a microfluidic device is a largely empirical endeavor of trial-and-error, largely due to the difficulty of modeling such a multiphysics process. Machine learning, including deep neural networks, provides the potential for allowing the determination of flow rates and solution characteristics by using past fabrication data to train and validate a model. Unfortunately, microfluidics suffers from low amounts of data, which can lead to inaccuracies and overtraining. To reduce the errors inherent with developing predictive and design models using a deep neural network, two approaches are investigated: dataset expansion using the statistical properties of available samples and model enhancement through introduction of physics-related parameters, specifically dimensionless numbers such as the Reynolds, capillary, Weber, and Peclet numbers. Results show that introduction of these parameters provides enhanced predictive capability leading to increased accuracy, while no such improvements are yet observed for design parameter selection.</description>

      <title>Topological Entropy of Two Dimensional Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deformation of the material lines drives transport and dissipation in many industrial and natural flows. Here we report an exact Eulerian formula for the stretching rate of a material line, also known as the topological entropy, in a prototype two-dimensional fluid. The only requirement is a distribution of eigenvalues of the strain rate tensor and their decorrelation time. This eliminates the need for Lagrangian tracking in experimental turbulence where particle trajectories are entangled, and thus poorly resolved. Numerical simulations reveal an excellent agreement between our Eulerian estimate and the stretching rate of a Lagrangian material line, over a wide range of Reynolds number.</description>

      <title>Supersonic Shear and Wall-Bounded Flows With Body-Fitted Meshes Using the Semi-Lagrangian Lattice Boltzmann Method: Boundary Schemes and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) simulations of incompressible flows are nowadays common and well-established. However, for compressible turbulent flows with strong variable density and intrinsic compressibility effects, results are relatively scarce. Only recently, progress was made regarding compressible LBM, usually applied to simple one and two-dimensional test cases due to the increased computational expense. The recently developed semi-Lagrangian lattice Boltzmann method (SLLBM) is capable of simulating two- and three-dimensional viscous compressible flows. This paper presents bounce-back, thermal, inlet, and outlet boundary conditions new to the method and their application to problems including heated or cooled walls, often required for supersonic flow cases. Using these boundary conditions, the SLLBM's capabilities are demonstrated in various test cases, including a supersonic 2D NACA-0012 airfoil, flow around a 3D sphere, and, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, the 3D simulation of a supersonic turbulent channel flow at a bulk Mach number of Ma=1.5 and a 3D temporal supersonic compressible mixing layer at convective Mach numbers ranging from Ma=0.3 to Ma=1.2. The results show that the compressible SLLBM is able to adequately capture intrinsic and variable density compressibility effects.</description>

      <title>Explicit formulas for forced convection in a shrouded longitudinal-fin heat sink with clearance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider laminar forced convection in a shrouded longitudinal-fin heat sink (LFHS) with tip clearance, as described by the pioneering study of Sparrow, Baliga and Patankar [1978, J. Heat Trans, 100(4)]. The base of the LFHS is isothermal but the fins, while thin, are not isothermal, i.e., the conjugate heat transfer problem is of interest. Whereas Sparrow et al. solved the fully developed flow and thermal problems numerically for a range of geometries and fin conductivities, we consider here the physically realistic asymptotic limit where the fins are closely spaced, i.e. the spacing is small relative to their height and the clearance above them. The flow problem in this limit was considered by Miyoshi et al. [2024, J. Fluid Mech, 991, A2], and here we consider the corresponding thermal problem. Using matched asymptotic expansions, we find explicit solutions for the temperature field (in both the fluid and fins) and conjugate Nusselt numbers (local and average). The structure of the asymptotic solutions provides insight into the results of Sparrow et al.: the flow is highest in the gap above the fins, hence heat transfer predominantly occurs close to the fin tips. The new formulas are compared to numerical solutions and are found to be accurate for practical LFHSs. Significantly, existing analytical results for ducts are for boundaries that are either wholly isothermal, wholly isoflux or with one of these conditions on each wall. Consequently, this study provides the first analytical results for conjugate Nusselt numbers for flow through ducts.</description>

      <title>Thermal effects on the lifetime of evaporating drops on fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on the evaporation of drops on fibers. More specifically, we focus on the droplet lifetime both in quiescent air and in an air flow of constant velocity. We propose a model to describe the evaporation rate and lifetime in a purely diffusive regime, which includes the liquid cooling associated with evaporation and the thermal conductivity of the atmosphere and the fiber. Our model effectively captures the primary physical behaviors, demonstrating a semi-quantiative agreement with our measurements across various liquids and fiber materials. Finally, the model is generalized to a convective air flow, which also rationalizes our experimental data.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron X-Ray Multi-Projection Imaging for Multiphase Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphase flows, characterized by the presence of particles, bubbles, or droplets dispersed within a fluid, are ubiquitous in natural and industrial processes. Studying densely dispersed flows in 4D (3D + time) at very small scales without introducing perturbations is challenging, but crucial to understand their macroscopic behavior. The penetration power of X-rays and the flux provided by advanced X-ray sources, such as synchrotron-radiation facilities, offer an opportunity to address this need. However, current X-ray methods at these facilities require the rotation of the sample to obtain 4D information, thus disturbing the flow. Here, we demonstrate the potential of using X-ray Multi-Projection Imaging (XMPI), a novel technique to temporally resolve any dense particle suspension flows in 4D, while eliminating the need of sample rotation. By acquiring images of a microparticle-seeded flow from multiple viewing directions simultaneously, we can determine their instantaneous three-dimensional positions, both when flowing in a simple liquid and a highly dense and opaque complex fluid (e.g. blood). Along with the recent progress in AI-supported 4D reconstruction from sparse projections, this approach creates new opportunities for high-speed rotation-free 4D microtomography, opening a new spatiotemporal frontier. With XMPI, it is now feasible to track the movement of individual microparticles within dense suspensions, extending even to the chaotic realms of turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Identification of structures driving trailing-edge noise. Part I -- Experimental investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trailing-edge (TE) noise is the main contributor to the acoustic signature of flows over airfoils. It originates from the interaction of turbulent structures in the airfoil boundary layer with the TE. This study experimentally identifies the flow structures responsible for TE noise by decomposing the data into spanwise modes and examining the impact of spanwise coherent structures on sound emission. We analyse a NACA0012 airfoil at moderate Reynolds numbers, ensuring broadband TE noise, and use synchronous measurements of surface and far-field acoustic pressure fluctuations with custom spanwise microphone arrays. Our results demonstrate the key role of coherent structures with large spanwise wavelengths in generating broadband TE noise. Spanwise modal decomposition of the acoustic field shows that only waves with spanwise wavenumbers below the acoustic wavenumber contribute to the radiated acoustic spectrum, consistent with theoretical scattering conditions. Moreover, a strong correlation is found between spanwise-coherent (zero wavenumber) flow structures and radiated acoustics. At frequencies corresponding to peak TE noise emission, the turbulent structures responsible for radiation exhibit strikingly large spanwise wavelengths, exceeding $60\%$ of the airfoil chord length. These findings have implications for numerical and experimental TE noise analysis and flow control. The correlation between spectrally decomposed turbulent fluctuations and TE noise paves the way for future aeroacoustic modelling through linearized mean field analysis. A companion paper further explores the nature of the spanwise-coherent structures using high-resolution numerical simulations of the same setup.</description>

      <title>Identification of structures driving trailing-edge noise. Part II -- Numerical investigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the present work is to investigate the mechanisms of broadband trailing-edge noise generation to improve prediction tools and control strategies. We focus on a NACA 0012 airfoil at 3 degrees angle of attack and chord Reynolds number Re = 200,000. A high-fidelity wall-resolved compressible implicit large eddy simulation (LES) is performed to collect data for our analysis. The simulation is designed in close alignment with the experiment described in detail in the companion paper (Demange et al. 2024b). Zig-zag geometrical tripping elements, added to generate a turbulent boundary layer, are meshed to closely follow the experimental setup. A large spanwise domain is used in the simulation to include propagative acoustic waves with low wavenumbers. An in-depth comparison with experiments is conducted showing good agreement in terms of mean flow statistics, acoustic and hydrodynamic spectra, and coherence lengths. Furthermore, a strong correlation is found between the radiated acoustics and spanwise-coherent structures. To investigate the correlation for higher wavenumbers, spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) is applied to the spanwise Fourier-transformed LES dataset. The analysis of all SPOD modes for the leading spanwise wavenumbers reveals streamwise-travelling wavepackets as the source of the radiated acoustics. This finding, confirming observations from experiments in the companion paper, leads to a new understanding of the turbulent structures driving the trailing-edge noise. By performing extended SPOD based on the acoustic region, we confirm the low rank nature of the acoustics, and a reduced-order model based on acoustic extended SPOD is proposed for the far-field acoustic reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of velocity fluctuations near a wall has long fascinated the turbulence community, because the prevalent theoretical framework of an attached-eddy hierarchy appears to predict infinite intensities as the Reynolds number tends to infinity. Although an unbounded infinite limit is not a problem in itself, it raises the possibility of unfamiliar phenomena when the Reynolds number is large, and has motivated attempts to avoid it. We review the subject and point to possible pitfalls stemming from uncritical extrapolation from low Reynolds numbers, or from an over-simplification of the multiscale nature of turbulence. It is shown that large attached eddies dominate the high-Reynolds-number regime of the near-wall layer, and that they behave differently from smaller-scale ones. In that limit, the near-wall layer is controlled by the outer flow, the large-scale fluctuations reduce to a local modulation of the near-wall flow by a variable friction velocity, and the kinetic-energy peak is substituted by a deeper structure with a secondary outer maximum. The friction velocity is then not necessarily the best velocity scale. While the near-wall energy peak probably becomes unbounded in wall units, it almost surely tends to zero when expressed in terms of the outer driving velocity.</description>

      <title>Large Airfoil Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of a "Large Airfoil Model (LAM)," a transformative approach for answering technical questions on airfoil aerodynamics, requires a vast dataset and a model to leverage it. To build this foundation, a novel probabilistic machine learning approach, A Deep Airfoil Prediction Tool (ADAPT), has been developed. ADAPT makes uncertainty-aware predictions of airfoil pressure coefficient ($C_p$) distributions by harnessing experimental data and incorporating measurement uncertainties. By employing deep kernel learning, performing Gaussian Process Regression in a ten-dimensional latent space learned by a neural network, ADAPT effectively handles unstructured experimental datasets. In tandem, Airfoil Surface Pressure Information Repository of Experiments (ASPIRE), the first large-scale, open-source repository of airfoil experimental data has been developed. ASPIRE integrates century-old historical data with modern reports, forming an unparalleled resource of real-world pressure measurements. This addresses a critical gap left by prior repositories, which relied primarily on numerical simulations. Demonstrative results for three airfoils show that ADAPT accurately predicts $C_p$ distributions and aerodynamic coefficients across varied flow conditions, achieving a mean absolute error in enclosed area ($\text{MAE}_\text{enclosed}$) of 0.029. ASPIRE and ADAPT lay the foundation for a future, more elaborate LAM that is coupled with a large language model, which will then enable users to perform design tasks based on design questions rather than explicit technical inputs.</description>

Previous work on SBM for fluid flow primarily utilized two- or three-dimensional unstructured tetrahedral grids. Recently, octree grids have become an essential component of immersed CFD solvers, and this work addresses this gap and the associated computational challenges. We leverage an optimal (approximate) surrogate boundary constructed efficiently on incomplete and adaptive octree meshes. The resulting framework enables the simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in complex geometries without requiring boundary-fitted grids. Simulations of benchmark tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate that the Octree-SBM framework is a robust, accurate, and efficient approach to simulating fluid dynamics problems with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic theory of premixed flames under Darcy's law</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical implications of applying Darcy's law to premixed flames, a topic of growing interest in research on flame propagation in porous media and confined geometries. A multiple-scale analysis is carried out treating the flame as a hydrodynamic discontinuity in density, viscosity and permeability. The analysis accounts in particular for the inner structure of the flame. A simple model is derived allowing the original conservation equations to be replaced by Laplace's equation for pressure, applicable on both sides of the flame front, subject to specific conditions across the front. Such model is useful for investigating general problems under confinement including flame instabilities in porous media or Hele-Shaw channels. In this context, two Markstein numbers are identified, for which explicit expressions are provided. In particular, our analysis reveals novel contributions to the local propagation speed arising from discontinuities in the tangential components of velocity and gravitational force, which are permissible in Darcy's flows to leading order, but not in flows obeying Euler or Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>FLRONet: Deep Operator Learning for High-Fidelity Fluid Flow Field Reconstruction from Sparse Sensor Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08009</link>

Abstract: The ability to reconstruct high-fidelity fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurement is critical for many science and engineering applications, but remains a huge challenge. This challenge is caused by the large difference between the dimensions of the state space and the observational space, making the operator that provides the mapping from the state space to the observational space ill-conditioned and non-invertible. As a result, deriving the forward map from the observational space to the state space as the inverse of the measurement operator is nearly impossible. While traditional methods, including sparse optimization, data assimilation, or machine learning based regressive reconstruction, are available, they often struggle with generalization and computational efficiency, particularly when non-uniform or varying discretization of the domain are considered. In this work, we propose FLRONet, a novel operator learning framework designed to reconstruct full-state flow fields from sparse sensor measurements in space and time. FLRONet utilizes a branch-trunk architecture, where the branch network integrates sensor observations from multiple time instances, and the trunk network encodes the entire temporal domain. This design allows FLRONet to achieve highly accurate, discretization-independent reconstructions at any time within the observation window. Although the popular three-dimensional Fourier Neural Operator offers similar functionalities, our results show that FLRONet surpasses it in both accuracy and efficiency. FLRONet not only achieves superior performance in approximating the true operator but also exhibits significantly faster inference at high-fidelity discretizations.</description>
