      <title>On the degrees of regular nut graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nut graph is a simple graph for which the adjacency matrix has a single zero eigenvalue such that all non-zero kernel eigenvectors have no zero entry. It is known that infinitely many $d$-regular nut graphs exist for $3 \leq d \leq 12$ and for $d \geq 4$ such that $d \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$. Here it is shown that infinitely many $d$-regular nut graphs exist for each degree $d \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Subdivision method in the Laplacian matching polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a bridge connecting the matching polynomial and the Laplacian matching polynomial of graphs, the subdivision method is expected to be useful for investigating the Laplacian matching polynomial. In this paper, we study applications of the method from three aspects. We prove that the zero sequence of the Laplacian matching polynomial of a graph majorizes its degree sequence, establishing a dual relation between the Laplacian matching polynomial and the characteristic polynomial of the signless Laplacian matrix of graphs. In addition, from different viewpoints, we give a new combinatorial interpretations for the coefficients of the Laplacian matching polynomial.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proof of identities involving partitions with distinct even parts and 4-regular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Andrews and Bachraoui proved identities relating certain restricted partitions into distinct even parts with restricted 4-regular partitions by the theory of basic hypergeometric series. They also posed a question regarding combinatorial proofs for these results. In this paper, we establish bijections to provide combinatorial proofs for these results.</description>

      <title>An algebraic interpretation of Eulerian polynomials, derangement polynomials, and beyond, via Gr\"obner methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of whether Chow polynomials of matroids have only real roots, this article revisits the known relationship between Eulerian polynomials and the Hilbert series of Chow rings of permutohedral varieties. This is done using a quadratic Gr\"obner basis associated to a new presentation of those rings, which is obtained by iterating the semi-small decomposition of Chow rings of matroids. This Gr\"obner basis can also be applied to compute certain principal ideals in these rings, and ultimately reestablish the known connection between derangement polynomials and the Hilbert series of Chow rings for corank 1 uniform matroids. More broadly, this approach enables us to express the Hilbert series of Chow rings for any uniform matroid as polynomials related to the ascent statistics on particular sets of inversion sequences.</description>

      <title>Pairs in Nested Steiner Quadruple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a repair problem for fractional repetition codes in distributed storage, each block of any Steiner quadruple system (SQS) of order $v$ is partitioned into two pairs. Each pair in such a partition is called a nested design pair and its multiplicity is the number of times it is a pair in this partition. Such a partition of each block is considered as a new block design called a nested Steiner quadruple system. Several related questions on this type of design are considered in this paper: What is the maximum multiplicity of the nested design pair with minimum multiplicity? What is the minimum multiplicity of the nested design pair with maximum multiplicity? Are there nested quadruple systems in which all the nested design pairs have the same multiplicity? Of special interest are nested quadruple systems in which all the $\binom{v}{2}$ pairs are nested design pairs with the same multiplicity. Several constructions of nested quadruple systems are considered and in particular classic constructions of SQS are examined.</description>

      <title>How many random edges make an almost-Dirac graph Hamiltonian?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Hamiltonicity in the union of an $n$-vertex graph $H$ with high minimum degree and a binomial random graph on the same vertex set. In particular, we consider the case when $H$ has minimum degree close to $n/2$. We determine the perturbed threshold for Hamiltonicity in this setting.
  To be precise, let $\eta:= n/2-\delta(H)$. For $\eta=\omega(1)$, we show that it suffices to add $\Theta(\eta)$ random edges to $H$ to a.a.s. obtain a Hamiltonian graph; for $\eta=\Theta(1)$, we show that $\omega(1)$ edges suffice. In fact, when $\eta=o(n)$ and $\eta=\omega(1)$, we show that $(8+o(1))\eta$ random edges suffice, which is best possible up to the error term. This determines the sharp perturbed threshold for Hamiltonicity in this range of degrees.
  We also obtain analogous results for perfect matchings, showing that, in this range of degrees, the sharp perturbed thresholds for Hamiltonicity and for perfect matchings differ by a factor of $2$.</description>

      <title>A determinantal formula for cluster variables in cluster algebras from surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For cluster algebras of surface type, Musiker, Schiffler and Williams gave a formula for cluster variables in terms of perfect matchings of snake graphs. Building on this, we provide a simple determinantal formula for cluster variables via the weighted biadjacency matrix of the associated snake graphs, thus circumventing the enumeration of their perfect matchings.</description>

      <title>Sharp bound for the Erd\H{o}s-Straus non-averaging set problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of integers $A$ is non-averaging if there is no element $a$ in $A$ which can be written as an average of a subset of $A$ not containing $a$. We show that the largest non-averaging subset of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ has size $n^{1/4+o(1)}$, thus solving the Erd\H{o}s-Straus problem. We also determine the largest size of a non-averaging set in a $d$-dimensional box for any fixed $d$. Our main tool includes the structure theorem for the set of subset sums due to Conlon, Fox and the first author, together with a result about the structure of a point set in nearly convex position.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a finite group generated by reflections of a lattice $M$. If a lattice polytope $P \subset M \otimes_{\mathbb Z}\mathbb R$ is preserved by $W$, then we show that the quotient of the projective toric variety $X_P$ by $W$ is isomorphic to the toric variety $X_{P \cap D}$, where $D$ is a fundamental domain for the action of $W$. This answers a question of Horiguchi-Masuda-Shareshian-Song, and recovers results of Blume, of the second author, and of Gui-Hu-Liu.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue systems for integer orthogonal bases of multi-matrix invariants at finite N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-matrix invariants, and in particular the scalar multi-trace operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with $U(N)$ gauge symmetry, can be described using permutation centraliser algebras (PCA), which are generalisations of the symmetric group algebras and independent of $N$. Free-field two-point functions define an $N$-dependent inner product on the PCA, and bases of operators have been constructed which are orthogonal at finite $N$. Two such bases are well-known, the restricted Schur and covariant bases, and both definitions involve representation-theoretic quantities such as Young diagram labels, multiplicity labels, branching and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for symmetric groups. The explicit computation of these coefficients grows rapidly in complexity as the operator length increases. We develop a new method for explicitly constructing all the operators with specified Young diagram labels, based on an $N$-independent integer eigensystem formulated in the PCA. The eigensystem construction naturally leads to orthogonal basis elements which are integer linear combinations of the multi-trace operators, and the $N$-dependence of their norms are simple known dimension factors. We provide examples and give computer codes in SageMath which efficiently implement the construction for operators of classical dimension up to 14. While the restricted Schur basis relies on the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of symmetric group algebras, the covariant basis relies on a variant which we refer to as the Kronecker decomposition. Analogous decompositions exist for any finite group algebra and the eigenvalue construction of integer orthogonal bases extends to the group algebra of any finite group with rational characters.</description>

      <title>A remark on modular equations involving Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction via $5$-dissections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $5$-dissections of certain Ramanujan's theta functions, particularly $\psi(q)\psi(q^2), \varphi(-q)$ and $\varphi(-q)\varphi(-q^2)$, and derive an identity for $q(q;q)_{\infty}^6/(q^5;q^5)_{\infty}^6$ in terms of certain products of the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction $R(q)$. Using this identity, we give another proof of the modular equation involving $R(q), R(q^2)$ and $R(q^4)$, which was recorded by Ramanujan in his lost notebook, and establish modular equations involving $R(q), R(q^2), R(q^4), R(q^8)$ and $R(q^{16})$.</description>

      <title>Super-regular polytopes in cyclotomic hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any odd prime $p$ and any integer $N\ge 0$, let $\mathcal{V}(p,N)$ be the set of vertices of the cyclotomic box $\mathscr{B} = \mathscr{B}(p,N)$ of edge size $2N$ and centered at the origin $O$ of the ring of integers $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ of the cyclotomic field $\mathbb{Q}(\omega)$, where $\omega=\exp\big(\frac{2\pi i}{p}\big)$. Cyclotomic boxes represented as sets of points in the complex plane prove to have counter-intuitive super-regularity properties that are known to occur in high dimensional real hypercubes.
  Employing the naturally induced Euclidean-trace metric for distance measurement and letting the prime $p$ tend to infinity, we prove the following results. 1. Almost all triangles with vertices in $\mathcal{V}(p,N)$ are almost equilateral. 2. Almost all angles $\angle VOA$, where $V$ is in $\mathcal{V}(p,N)$, $O$ is the origin, which coincides with the center of $\mathscr{B}(p,N)$, and $A$ is fixed anywhere in $\mathscr{B}(p,N)$, are right angles. 3. Almost all pyramids with base on $\mathcal{V}(p,N)$ and the apex fixed anywhere in $\mathscr{B}(p,N)$ are super-regular, meaning that the base has all edges and diagonals almost equal and the lateral faces are nearly isosceles triangles, each nearly equal to the others.</description>

      <title>Zero-sum partitions of Abelian groups and their applications to magic- and antimagic-type labelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09395v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The following problem has been known since the 80s. Let $\Gamma$ be an Abelian group of order $m$ (denoted $|\Gamma|=m$), and let $t$ and $\{m_i\}_{i=1}^{t}$, be positive integers such that $\sum_{i=1}^t m_i=m-1$. Determine when $\Gamma^*=\Gamma\setminus\{0\}$, the set of non-zero elements of $\Gamma$, can be partitioned into disjoint subsets $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^{t}$ such that $|S_i|=m_i$ and $\sum_{s\in S_i}s=0$ for every $1 \leq i \leq t$. Such a subset partition is called a \textit{zero-sum partition}. $|I(\Gamma)|\neq 1$, where $I(\Gamma)$ is the set of involutions in $\Gamma$, is a necessary condition for the existence of zero-sum partitions. In this paper, we show that the additional condition of $m_i\geq 4$ for every $1 \leq i \leq t$, is sufficient. Moreover, we present some applications of zero-sum partitions to magic- and antimagic-type labelings of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Each graphon $W:\Omega^2\rightarrow[0,1]$ yields an inhomogeneous random graph model $G(n,W)$. We show that $G(n,W)$ is asymptotically almost surely connected if and only if (i) $W$ is a connected graphon and (ii) the measure of elements of $\Omega$ of $W$-degree less than $\alpha$ is $o(\alpha)$ as $\alpha\rightarrow 0$. These two conditions encapsulate the absence of several linear-sized components, and of isolated vertices, respectively.
  We study in bigger detail the limit probability of the property that $G(n,W)$ contains an isolated vertex, and, more generally, the limit distribution of the minimum degree of $G(n,W)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theorem of Frieze from 1985 asserts that the total weight of the minimum spanning tree of the complete graph $K_n$ whose edges get independent weights from the distribution $UNIFORM[0,1]$ converges to Ap\'ery's constant in probability, as $n\to\infty$. We generalize this result to sequences of graphs $G_n$ that converge to a graphon $W$. Further, we allow the weights of the edges to be drawn from different distributions (subject to moderate conditions). The limiting total weight $\kappa(W)$ of the minimum spanning tree is expressed in terms of a certain branching process defined on $W$, which was studied previously by Bollob\'as, Janson and Riordan in connection with the giant component in inhomogeneous random graphs.</description>

Abstract: We show that the vertices of every planar graph can be partitioned into two sets, each inducing a so-called triangle-forest, i.e., a graph with no cycles of length more than three. We further discuss extensions to locally planar graphs. After finishing the paper we noticed that our main result was already proved much earlier by Carsten Thomassen [Decomposing a Planar Graph into Degenerate Graphs, JCTB 1995].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Furstenberg introduced the notion of Central sets in 1981. Later in 1990 V. Bergelson and N. Hindman proved a different but an equivalent version of the central set theorem. In 2008 D. De, N. Hindman and D. Strauss proved a stronger version of central sets theorem. Hindman and Leader first introduced the concept of near zero. Recently S. Goswami, L. Baglini and S. Patra did a polynomial extension of Stronger Central sets theorem in 2023. In this article, we proved the Polynomial stronger Central Sets Theorem near zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of R. Casals on binary invariants for matrix mutation, we study the matrix congruence relation on quasi-Cartan matrices. We obtain a classification and determine normal forms modulo 4. We also establish their mutation invariance properties. In particular, we obtain new mutation invariants, which include the one obtained by R. Casals.</description>

      <title>A logarithmic approximation of linearly-ordered colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19556v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linearly ordered (LO) $k$-colouring of a hypergraph assigns to each vertex a colour from the set $\{0,1,\ldots,k-1\}$ in such a way that each hyperedge has a unique maximum element. Barto, Batistelli, and Berg conjectured that it is NP-hard to find an LO $k$-colouring of an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph for any constant $k\geq 2$ [STACS'21] but even the case $k=3$ is still open. Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} gave polynomial-time algorithms for finding, given an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph, an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt{n})$ colours [ICALP'22] and an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt[3]{n})$ colours [ACM ToCT'23]. Very recently, Louis, Newman, and Ray gave an SDP-based algorithm with $O^*(\sqrt[5]{n})$ colours. We present two simple polynomial-time algorithms that find an LO colouring with $O(\log_2(n))$ colours, which is an exponential improvement.</description>

      <title>The Rank-Ramsey Problem and the Log-Rank Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph is called Rank-Ramsey if (i) Its clique number is small, and (ii) The adjacency matrix of its complement has small rank. We initiate a systematic study of such graphs. Our main motivation is that their constructions, as well as proofs of their non-existence, are intimately related to the famous log-rank conjecture from the field of communication complexity. These investigations also open interesting new avenues in Ramsey theory.
  We construct two families of Rank-Ramsey graphs exhibiting polynomial separation between order and complement rank. Graphs in the first family have bounded clique number (as low as $41$). These are subgraphs of certain strong products, whose building blocks are derived from triangle-free strongly-regular graphs. Graphs in the second family are obtained by applying Boolean functions to Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. Their clique number is logarithmic, but their complement rank is far smaller than in the first family, about $\mathcal{O}(n^{2/3})$. A key component of this construction is our matrix-theoretic view of lifts.
  We also consider lower bounds on the Rank-Ramsey numbers, and determine them in the range where the complement rank is $5$ or less. We consider connections between said numbers and other graph parameters, and find that the two best known explicit constructions of triangle-free Ramsey graphs turn out to be far from Rank-Ramsey.</description>

      <title>List strong and list normal edge-coloring of (sub)cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strong edge-coloring of a graph is a proper edge-coloring, in which the edges of every path of length 3 receive distinct colors; in other words, every pair of edges at distance at most 2 must be colored differently. The least number of colors needed for a strong edge-coloring of a graph is the strong chromatic index. We consider the list version of the coloring and prove that the list strong chromatic index of graphs with maximum degree 3 is at most 10. This bound is tight and improves the previous bound of 11 colors.
  We also consider the question whether the strong chromatic index and the list strong chromatic index always coincide. We answer it in negative by presenting an infinite family of graphs for which the two invariants differ. For the special case of the Petersen graph, we show that its list strong chromatic index equals 7, while its strong chromatic index is 5. Up to our best knowledge, this is the first known edge-coloring for which there are graphs with distinct values of the chromatic index and its list version.
  In relation to the above, we also initiate the study of the list version of the normal edge-coloring. A normal edge-coloring of a cubic graph is a proper edge-coloring, in which every edge is adjacent to edges colored with 4 colors or to edges colored with 2 colors. It is conjectured that 5 colors suffice for a normal edge-coloring of any bridgeless cubic graph which is equivalent to the Petersen Coloring Conjecture.
  Similarly to the strong edge-coloring, the list normal edge-coloring is much more restrictive and consequently for many graphs the list normal chromatic index is greater than the normal chromatic index. In particular, we show that there are cubic graphs with the list normal chromatic index at least 9, there are bridgeless cubic graphs with its value at least 8, and there are cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graphs with value at least 7.</description>

      <title>On The Application Of State Sum Decomposition method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the state sum decomposition method to derive a closed formula for the enumeration of lozenge tilings of the region constructed out of a regular hexagon by removing the "maximal staircase" from its alternating corners. This problem, originally proposed by Ciucu and Krattenthaler (2002), has remained unsolved. We introduce the concept of "$Fibonacci-Coloring$" for planar graphs and derive a summation formula of the enumeration in terms of powers of $2$. This formula is reminiscent of the celebrated Aztec Diamond Theorem of Elkies, Kuperberg, Larsen, and Propp (1992), which concerns domino tilings of Aztec Diamonds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09249v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a partial super analog of a result obtained by S. Sahi and G. Zhang relating Shimura operators and certain interpolation symmetric polynomials. In particular, we study the pair $(\mathfrak{gl}(2p|2q), \mathfrak{gl}(p|q)\oplus\mathfrak{gl}(p|q))$, define the super Shimura operators in $\mathfrak{U}(\mathfrak{g})^\mathfrak{k}$, and using a new method, prove that their images under the Harish-Chandra homomorphism are proportional to Sergeev and Veselov's Type $BC$ interpolation supersymmetric polynomials, under the assumption that a family of irreducible $\mathfrak{g}$-modules are spherical. We prove this conjecture using the notion of quasi-sphericity for Kac modules when $p=q=1$, and give explicit coordinates of (quasi-)spherical vectors.</description>

We say that a semigroup is representable if it can be realized in this way.

      <title>Composable Constraint Models for Permutation Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a powerful tool for modeling mathematical concepts and objects and finding both solutions or counter examples. One of the major strengths of CP is that problems can easily be combined or expanded. In this paper, we illustrate that this versatility makes CP an ideal tool for exploring problems in permutation patterns.
  We declaratively define permutation properties, permutation pattern avoidance and containment constraints using CP and show how this allows us to solve a wide range of problems. We show how this approach enables the arbitrary composition of these conditions, and also allows the easy addition of extra conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques by modelling the containment and avoidance of six permutation patterns, eight permutation properties and measuring five statistics on the resulting permutations. In addition to calculating properties and statistics for the generated permutations, we show that arbitrary additional constraints can also be easily and efficiently added.
  This approach enables mathematicians to investigate permutation pattern problems in a quick and efficient manner. We demonstrate the utility of constraint programming for permutation patterns by showing how we can easily and efficiently extend the known permutation counts for a conjecture involving the class of $1324$ avoiding permutations. For this problem, we expand the enumeration of $1324$-avoiding permutations with a fixed number of inversions to permutations of length 16 and show for the first time that in the enumeration there is a pattern occurring which follows a unique sequence on the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.</description>

      <title>Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the closed neighborhood ideal of a graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04683v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph and let $NI(G)$ denote the closed neighborhood ideal of $G$ in a polynomial ring $R$. We show that if $G$ is a forest, then the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $R/NI(G)$ is the same as the matching number of $G$, thus proving a conjecture of Sharifan and Moradi in the affirmative. We also show that the matching number of $G$ provides a lower bound for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $R/NI(G)$ for any $G$. Furthermore, we prove that, if $G$ contains a simplicial vertex, then $NI(G)$ admits a Betti splitting, and consequently, we show that the projective dimension of $R/NI(G)$ is also bounded below by the matching number of $G$, if $G$ is a forest or a unicyclic graph.</description>

      <title>A strengthening of McConnel's theorem on permutations over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime, $q=p^n$, and $D \subset \mathbb{F}_q^*$. A celebrated result of McConnel states that if $D$ is a proper subgroup of $\mathbb{F}_q^*$, and $f:\mathbb{F}_q \to \mathbb{F}_q$ is a function such that $(f(x)-f(y))/(x-y) \in D$ whenever $x \neq y$, then $f(x)$ necessarily has the form $ax^{p^j}+b$. In this notes, we give a sufficient condition on $D$ to obtain the same conclusion on $f$. In particular, we show that McConnel's theorem extends if $D$ has small doubling.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce rainbow codes, a novel class of quantum error correcting codes generalising colour codes and pin codes. Rainbow codes can be defined on any $D$-dimensional simplicial complex that admits a valid $(D+1)$-colouring of its $0$-simplices. We study in detail the case where these simplicial complexes are derived from chain complexes obtained via the hypergraph product and, by reinterpreting these codes as collections of colour codes joined at domain walls, show that we can obtain code families with growing distance and number of encoded qubits as well as logical non-Clifford gates implemented by transversal application of $T$ and $T^\dag$. By combining these techniques with the quasi-hyperbolic colour codes of Zhu et al. (arXiv:2310.16982) we obtain families of codes with transversal non-Clifford gates and parameters $[\![n,O(n),O(log(n))]\!]$ which allow the magic-state yield parameter $\gamma = \log_d(n/k)$ to be made arbitrarily small. In contrast to other recent constructions that achieve $\gamma \rightarrow 0$ our codes are natively defined on qubits, are LDPC, and have logical non-Clifford gates implementable by single-qubit (rather than entangling) physical operations, but are not asymptotically good.</description>
