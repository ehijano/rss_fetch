      <title>Texture tomography with high angular resolution utilizing sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to the reconstruction of scanning probe x-ray diffraction tomography data with anisotropic poly crystalline samples. The method involves reconstructing a voxel map containing an orientation distribution function in each voxel of an extended 3D sample. This method differs from existing approaches by not relying on a peak-finding and is therefore applicable to sample systems consisting of small and highly mosaic crystalline domains that are not handled well by existing methods. Samples of interest include bio-minerals and a range of small-graines microstructures common in engineering metals. By choosing a particular kind of basis functions, we can effectively utilize non-negativity in orientation-space for samples with sparse texture. This enables us to achieve stable solutions at high angular resolutions where the problem would otherwise be under determined. We demonstrate the new approach using data from a shot peened martensite sample where we are able to map the twinning micro structure in the interior of a bulk sample without resolving the individual lattice domains. We also demonstrate the approach on a piece of gastropods shell with a mosaic micro structure.</description>

      <title>Laser-initiated electron and heat transport in gold-skutterudite CoSb$_3$ bilayers resolved by pulsed x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron and lattice heat transport have been investigated in bilayer thin films of gold and CoSb$_3$ after photo-excitation of the nanometric top gold layer through picosecond x-ray scattering in a pump-probe setup. The unconventional observation of a larger portion of the deposited heat being detected first in the underlying CoSb$_3$ layer supports the picture of ballistic transport of the photo-excited electrons from gold to the underlying layer. The lattice expansion recorded by x-ray scattering allows accounting for the energy deposition and heat transport.</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid behavior of non-altermagnetic RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presence of magnetism in potentially altermagnetic RuO$_2$ has been a subject of intense debate. Using broadband infrared spectroscopy combined with density-functional band-structure calculations, we show that optical conductivity of RuO$_2$, the bulk probe of its electronic structure, is well described by the nonmagnetic model of this material. The sharp Pauli edge demonstrates the presence of a Dirac nodal line lying 45 meV below the Fermi level. Good match between the experimental and ab initio plasma frequencies underpins weakness of electronic correlations. The intraband part of the optical conductivity indicates Fermi-liquid behavior with two distinct scattering rates below 150 K. Fermi-liquid theory also accounts for the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility of RuO$_2$ and allows a consistent description of this material as paramagnetic metal.</description>

      <title>A general and modular approach to solid-state integration and readout of zero-dimensional quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic spectroscopy of zero-dimensional (0D) quantum systems, including point defects in solids, atomic states, and small molecules, is a critical tool for developing a fundamental understanding of these systems, with applications ranging from solid-state and molecular materials development to emerging technologies rooted in quantum information science. Toward this end, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) has demonstrated atomic-scale sensitivity, but is not easily scalable for applications, while device-based approaches rely on embedding these systems within a solid-state tunnel junction and are not generally applicable. Here we demonstrate an all-electrical readout mechanism for these quasi-0D states that is modular and general, dramatically expanding the phase space of accessible quantum systems and providing an approach that is amenable to scaling and integration with other solid-state quantum technologies. Our approach relies on the creation of high-quality tunnel junctions via the mechanical exfoliation and stacking of multi-layer graphene (MLG) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to encapsulate the target quantum system (QS) in a MLG-hBN-QS-hBN-MLG heterostructure. This structure allows for electronic spectroscopy and readout of candidate quantum systems through a combination of Coulomb and spin-blockade, providing access to entire classes of quantum systems that have previously only been accessible via optical spectroscopy or magnetic resonance measurements of large ensembles, if at all.</description>

      <title>Machine learning accelerated prediction of Ce-based ternary compounds involving antagonistic pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of novel quantum materials within ternary phase spaces containing antagonistic pair such as Fe with Bi, Pb, In, and Ag, presents significant challenges yet holds great potential. In this work, we investigate the stabilization of these immiscible pairs through the integration of Cerium (Ce), an abundant rare-earth and cost-effective element. By employing a machine learning (ML)-guided framework, particularly crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN), combined with first-principles calculations, we efficiently explore the composition/structure space and predict 9 stable and 37 metastable Ce-Fe-X (X=Bi, Pb, In and Ag) ternary compounds. Our findings include the identification of multiple new stable and metastable phases, which are evaluated for their structural and energetic properties. These discoveries not only contribute to the advancement of quantum materials but also offer viable alternatives to critical rare earth elements, underscoring the importance of Ce-based intermetallic compounds in technological applications.</description>

      <title>From Prediction to Experimental Realization of Ferroelectric Wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$N Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlN-based alloys find widespread application in high-power microelectronics, optoelectronics, and electromechanics. The realization of ferroelectricity in wurtzite AlN-based heterostructural alloys has opened up the possibility of directly integrating ferroelectrics with conventional microelectronics based on tetrahedral semiconductors such as Si, SiC and III-Vs, enabling compute-in-memory architectures, high-density data storage, and more. The discovery of AlN-based wurtzite ferroelectrics has been driven to date by chemical intuition and empirical explorations. Here, we demonstrate the computationally-guided discovery and experimental demonstration of new ferroelectric wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Gd$_x$N alloys. First-principles calculations indicate that the minimum energy pathway for switching changes from a collective to an individual switching process with a lower overall energy barrier, at a rare-earth fraction $x$ of $x&gt;$ 0.10$-$0.15. Experimentally, ferroelectric switching is observed at room temperature in Al$_{1-x}$Gd$_x$N films with $x&gt;$ 0.12, which strongly supports the switching mechanisms in wurtzite ferroelectrics proposed previously (Lee et al., $\textit{Science Advances}$ 10, eadl0848, 2024). This is also the first demonstration of ferroelectricity in an AlN-based alloy with a magnetic rare-earth element, which could pave the way for additional functionalities such as multiferroicity and opto-ferroelectricity in this exciting class of AlN-based materials.</description>

      <title>Investigation of resistive switching in Au/MoS2/Au using Reactive Molecular Dynamics and ab-initio quantum transport calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the underlying physical mechanism for electric-field induced resistive switching in Au/MoS2/Au based memristive devices by combining computational techniques such as reactive molecular dynamics and first-principle quantum transport calculations. From reactive molecular dynamics study we clearly observe a formation of conductive filament of gold atoms from the top electrode on to the 2D MoS2 layer. This state was described the onset of low-resistance state from the initial high-resistance state. To further understand the switching mechanism in the device we deploy first-principle calculations where we see an electron channel being formed during the filament formation leading to the low-resistance state of the device. MoS2 with single defect gives rise to a conductance ratio of LRS to the initial structure is 63.1336 and that of the LRS to HRS is 1.66.</description>

      <title>A machine-learned kinetic energy model for light weight metals and compounds of group III-V elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine-learned (ML) model of kinetic energy for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) suitable for bulk light weight metals and compounds made of group III-V elements. The functional is machine-learned with Gaussian process regression (GPR) from data computed with Kohn-Sham DFT with plane wave bases and local pseudopotentials. The dataset includes multiple phases of unary, binary, and ternary compounds containing Li, Al, Mg, Si, As, Ga, Sb, Na, Sn, P, and In. A total of 433 materials were used for training, and 18 strained structures were used for each material. Averaged (over the unit cell) kinetic energy density is fitted as a function of averaged terms of the 4th order gradient expansion and the product of the density and effective potential. The kinetic energy predicted by the model allows reproducing energy-volume curves around equilibrium geometry with good accuracy. We show that the GPR model beats linear and polynomial regressions. We also find that unary compounds sample a wider region of the descriptor space than binary and ternary compounds, and it is therefore important to include them in the training set; a GPR model trained on a small number of unary compounds is able to extrapolate relatively well to binary and ternary compounds but not vice versa.</description>

      <title>Half-metallicity and wandering axis ferromagnetism in Mn substituted Fe$_2$TiSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of Mn substitution in Fe$_2$Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Sn on electronic structure, magnetic and electrical transport properties. The spin-polarized density of states calculations using density-functional theory (DFT), yields a half-metallic ground state in Mn-rich compositions. Localized magnetic moments at Mn sites that interact through the cloud of conduction electrons formed by Fe and Ti atoms are also predicted. Electrical resistivity and magneto-transport measurements reveal a Kondo-like ground state at low temperatures and a peculiar linear negative temperature coefficient of resistance in the high-temperature regime with a predominant electron-phonon scattering mechanism. Analysis of room temperature powder X-ray diffraction data reveals a highly ordered L2$_1$ structure and reduction of antisite disorder, upon Mn substitution. The temperature-dependent magnetization measurements reveal distinct features indicative of weak anisotropy in the system. Isothermal magnetization measured as a function of the applied field helps identify the unique magnetic ground state of the half-metallic Fe$_2$Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Sn composition as a ferromagnet with a wandering axis, that distinctively orients in the direction of applied field. Our findings thus provide a new perspective for studying the mechanism of half-metallicity and associated magnetic order in Heuslers.</description>

      <title>Extension of a phase-field KKS model to predict the microstructure evolution in LPBF AlSi10Mg alloy submitted to non isothermal processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The out-of-equilibrium heterogeneous microstructure typical of AlSi10Mg processed by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is often modified by further heat treatment to improve its ductility. According to literature, extensive experimental investigations are generally required in order to optimize these heat treatments. In the present work, a phase-field approach is developed based on an extended Kim-Kim-Suzuki (KKS) model to guide and accelerate the post-treatment optimization. Combined with CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) data, this extended KKS model predicts microstructural changes under anisothermal conditions. To ensure a more physical approach, it takes into account the enhanced diffusion by quenched-in excess vacancies as well as the elastic energy due to matrix/precipitate lattice mismatch. As the developed model includes the computation of the evolution of the thermo-physical properties, its results are validated through comparison with experimental DSC curves measured during the non-isothermal loading of as-built LPBF AlSi10Mg. The computed microstructure evolution reproduces the microstructural observation and successfully explains the peaks in the DSC heat flow curve. It thus elucidates the detailed microstructural evolution inside the eutectic silicon phase by considering the growth and coalescence of silicon precipitates and the matrix desaturation.</description>

      <title>First-principles investigation of magnetic exchange force microscopy on adatoms adsorbed on an antiferromagnetic surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using density functional theory (DFT), we calculate the magnetic short-ranged exchange forces between a magnetic tip and an adatom adsorbed on the antiferromagnetic Mn monolayer on the W(110) surface [Mn/W(110)]. These exchange forces can be measured in magnetic exchange force microscopy allowing atomic-scale imaging of spin structures on insulating and conducting surfaces. We consider two types of $3d$ transition-metal atoms with intrinsic magnetic moments: Co and Mn and Ir as an example of a $5d$ transition-metal atom exhibiting an induced magnetic moment on Mn/W(110). The tips are modeled by Fe pyramids and terminated either with an Fe or a Mn apex atom. From our total energy DFT calculations for a parallel and antiparallel alignment between tip and adatom magnetic moments we obtain the exchange energy $E_{\rm ex}(d)$ as a function of tip-adatom distance $d$. The exchange forces, $F_{\rm ex}(d)$, are calculated based on the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. We show that structural relaxations of tip and sample due to their interaction need to be taken into account. Due to the exchange interaction the relaxations depend on the alignment between tip and adatom magnetization -- an effect which will affect the tunneling magnetoresistance that can be measured by a scanning tunneling microscope. A maximum in the exchange energy and force curves is obtained for magnetic adatoms at tip-adatom separations of about 3 to 4~{\AA}. The exchange forces with an Fe terminated tip reach a maximum value of up to 0.2~nN and 0.6~nN for Co and Mn adatoms, respectively, and prefer an antiferromagnetic coupling. Surprisingly, we also find an exchange force of up to 0.2~nN for Ir adatoms. We analyze the exchange interaction between tip and adatom based on the spin-polarized electronic structure of the coupled system......</description>

      <title>Delayed luminescence and thermoluminescence in laboratory-grown diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blue-green phosphorescence/thermoluminescence is most commonly observed in diamonds following excitation at or above the indirect band gap and has been explained by a substitutional nitrogen-boron donor-acceptor pair recombination model. Orange and red phosphorescence have also been frequently observed in lab-grown near-colourless high-pressure high-temperature diamonds following optical excitation, and their luminescence mechanisms are shown to be different from that of the blue-green phosphorescence. The physics of the orange and red luminescence and phosphorescence bands including the optical-excitation dependency (UV-NIR), temperature dependency (20 - 573 K), and related charge transfer process are investigated by a combination of self-built time-resolved imaging/spectroscopic techniques. In this paper, an alternative model for long-lived phosphorescence based on charge trapping is proposed to explain the orange phosphorescence/ thermoluminescence band. Additionally, the red phosphorescence band are attributed to point defect which possibly has a three-level phosphorescence system.</description>

      <title>Magnetic memory and distinct spin populations in ferromagnetic Co3Sn2S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co3Sn2S2, a ferromagnetic Weyl semi-metal with Co atoms on a kagome lattice, has generated much recent attention. Experiments have identified a temperature scale below the Curie temperature. Here, we find that this magnet keeps a memory, when not exposed to a magnetic field sufficiently large to erase it. We identify the driver of this memory effect as a small secondary population of spins, whose coercive field is significantly larger than that of the majority spins. The shape of the magnetization hysteresis curve has a threshold magnetic field set by the demagnetizing factor. These two field scales set the hitherto unidentified temperature scale, which is not a thermodynamic phase transition, but a crossing point between meta-stable boundaries. Global magnetization is well defined, even when it is non-uniform, but drastic variations in local magnetization point to a coarse energy landscape, with the thermodynamic limit not achieved at micrometer length scales.</description>

      <title>Automated production of batched unclonable micro-patterns anti-counterfeiting labels with strong robustness and rapid recognition speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anti-counterfeiting technologies are indeed crucial for information security and protecting product authenticity. Traditional anti-counterfeiting methods have their limitations due to their clonable nature. Exploring new technologies, particularly those based on pixel-level textures is a promising avenue to address the clonable issue due to high encoding capacity. However, research in this field is still in its infancy. This work introduces a new fluorescent anti-counterfeiting label technology with four key characteristics: efficient laser etching, high-throughput fabrication and segmentation, robustness aided by data augmentation, and an exceptionally high recognition speed. To be specific, the etching achieves a speed of 1,200 labels/3s, the high throughput yields a rate of 2,400 labels/4 min, and a total count of 51,966 labels. The number of labels is further augmented to 5,196,600 by implementing arbitrary rotation and brightness variation to enhance the robustness in the recognition procedure. We divide these labels into 44 categories based on differences in patterns. Utilizing machine learning methods, we have achieved a total recognition (including extraction and search process) time per label averaging 421.96 ms without classification, and 40.13 ms with classification. Specifically, the search process with classification is nearly fiftieth times shorter than the non-classification method, reaching 8.52 milliseconds in average. The overall recognition time is much faster than previous works, and achieve an accuracy over 98.7%. This work significantly increases the practicality of pixel-level anti-counterfeiting labels.</description>

Abstract: Segregation to defects, in particular to grain boundaries (GBs), is an unavoidable phenomenon leading to changed material behavior over time. With the increase of available computational power, unbiased quantum-mechanical predictions of segregation energies, which feed classical thermodynamics models of segregation (e.g., McLean isotherm), become available. In recent years, huge progress towards predictions closely resembling experimental observations was made by considering the statistical nature of the segregation process due to competing segregation sites at a single GB and/or many different types of co-existing GBs. In the present work, we further expand this field by explicitly showing how compositional disorder, present in realistic engineering alloys (e.g. steels or Ni-based superalloys), gives rise to a spectrum of segregation energies. With the example of a $\Sigma 5$ GB in a Ni-based model alloy (Ni-Co-Cr-Ti-Al), we show that the segregation energies of Fe, Mn, W, Nb and Zr are significantly different from those predicted for pure elemental Ni. We further use the predicted segregation energy spectra in a statistical evaluation of GB enrichment, which allows for extracting segregation enthalpy and segregation entropy terms related to the chemical complexity in multi-component alloys.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Control of Excitons in Atomically Thin Semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11252v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a promising platform for novel applications ranging from optoelectronic devices to quantum optics and solid state quantum simulators. While much progress has been made towards characterizing and controlling excitons in TMDs, manipulating their properties during the course of their lifetime - a key requirement for many optoelectronic device and information processing modalities - remains an outstanding challenge. Here we combine long-lived interlayer excitons in angle-aligned MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with fast electrical control to realize dynamical control schemes, in which exciton properties are not predetermined at the time of excitation but can be dynamically manipulated during their lifetime. Leveraging the out-of-plane exciton dipole moment, we use electric fields to demonstrate dynamical control over the exciton emission wavelength. Moreover, employing a patterned gate geometry, we demonstrate rapid local sample doping and toggling of the radiative decay rate through exciton-charge interactions during the exciton lifetime. Spatially mapping the exciton response reveals charge redistribution, offering a novel probe of electronic transport in twisted TMD heterostructures. Our results establish the feasibility of dynamical exciton control schemes, unlocking new directions for exciton-based information processing and optoelectronic devices, and the realization of excitonic phenomena in TMDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the implementation details of periodic local coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD) and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] using local natural orbitals (LNOs) and $k$-point symmetry. We discuss and compare several choices for orbital localization, fragmentation, and LNO construction. By studying diamond and lithium, we demonstrate that periodic LNO-CC theory can be applied with equal success to both insulators and metals, achieving speedups of two to three orders of magnitude even for moderately sized $k$-point meshes. Our final predictions of the equilibrium cohesive energy, lattice constant, and bulk modulus for diamond and lithium are in good agreement with previous theoretical predictions and experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is an intrinsically interesting research focus in condensed matter physics but the study is limited by low superconducting ($T_c$) and magnetic ($T_m$) transition temperatures in related materials. Here, we used a scanning superconducting quantum interference device to image the in-situ diamagnetic and ferromagnetic responses of RbEuFe$_4$As$_4$ with high $T_c$ and $T_m$. We observed significant suppression of superfluid density in vicinity of the magnetic phase transition, signifying fluctuation-enhanced magnetic scatterings between Eu spins and Fe 3$d$ conduction electrons. Intriguingly, we observed multiple ferromagnetic domains which should be absent in an ideal magnetic helical phase. The formation of these domains demonstrates a weak $c$-axis ferromagnetic component probably arising from Eu spin-canting effect, indicative of possible superconductivity-driven domain Meissner and domain vortex-antivortex phases as revealed in EuFe$_2$(As$_{0.79}$P$_{0.21}$)$_2$. Our observations highlight RbEuFe$_4$As$_4$ is a unique system which includes multiple interplay channels between superconductivity and ferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous integration of high endurance ferroelectric and piezoelectric epitaxial BaTiO$_3$ devices on Si</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating epitaxial BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) with Si is essential for leveraging its ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and nonlinear optical properties in microelectronics. Recently, heterogeneous integration approaches that involve growth of BTO on ideal substrates followed by transfer to a desired substrate show promise of achieving excellent device-quality films. However, beyond simple demonstrations of the existence of ferroelectricity, robust devices with high endurance were not yet demonstrated on Si using the latter approach. Here, using a novel two-step approach to synthesize epitaxial BTO using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on water soluble Sr3Al2O7 (SAO) (on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) substrates), we demonstrate successful integration of high-quality BTO capacitors on Si, with Pr of 7 uC/cm2, Ec 150 kV/cm, ferroelectric and electromechanical endurance of greater than $10^6$ cycles. We further address the challenge of cracking and disintegration of thicker films by first transferring a large area (5 mm x 5 mm) of the templated layer of BTO (~30 nm thick) on the desired substrate, followed by the growth of high-quality BTO on this substrate, as revealed by HRXRD and HRSTEM measurements. These templated Si substrates offer a versatile platform for integrating any epitaxial complex oxides with diverse functionalities onto any inorganic substrate.</description>

      <title>Interlayer charge transfer in graphene 2D polyimide heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vertical integration of multiple two-dimensional (2D) materials in heterostructures, held together by van der Waals forces, has opened unprecedented possibilities for modifying the (opto-)electronic properties of nanodevices. Graphene, with its remarkable opto-electronic properties, is an ideal candidate for such applications. Further candidates are 2D polymers, crystalline polymeric materials with customizable structure and electronic properties that can be synthesized in all mathematically possible Bravais lattices. In this study, we investigated the optoelectronic properties of a heterostructure created by pristine graphene and a rectangular 2D polyimide (2DPI) film. This imprints a new superlattice on graphene in conjunction with a direct influence on its electronic properties. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that interlayer charge exchange between the 2D polymer and graphene induces hole doping in the graphene layer. We have also observed that the properties of the heterostructure are dependent on the substrate used in experiments, likely due to the porous character of the 2DPI allowing direct interaction of graphene with the support. These findings highlight the unique ability to tailor functionalities in 2D polymers-based heterostructures, allowing the development of optoelectronic devices with precisely engineered properties and stimulating further exploration of the diverse phenomena accessible through tailored designs of the 2D polymers.</description>

      <title>Interface suppressed nematicity and enhanced superconductivity of FeSe/NdFeO3 in the low doping regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of interface-enhanced superconductivity in single-layer FeSe/oxides has generated intensive research interests. Beyond the family of FeSe interfaced with various TiO$_2$ terminated oxides, high pairing temperature up to 80~K has been recently observed in FeSe interfaced with FeO$_x$-terminated LaFeO$_3$. Here we successfully extend the FeSe/FeO$_x$ superconducting interface to FeSe/NdFeO$_3$, by constructing 1uc-FeSe/6uc-NdFeO$_3$/Nb:SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures. Intriguingly, well-annealed FeSe/NdFeO$_3$ exhibits a low doping level of 0.038$\sim$0.046 ~e$^-/$Fe which deviates universally magic doping level (0.10$\sim$0.12 e$^-/\rm{Fe}$) and provides a new playground for studying the FeSe/oxide interface in the low electron-doped regime. Comparing it with thick FeSe films at the comparable electron doping level induced by surface potassium dosing, FeSe/NdFeO$_3$ shows a larger superconducting gap and the absence of a nematic gap, indicating an enhancement of the superconductivity and suppression of nematicity by the FeSe/FeO$_x$ interface. These results not only expand the FeSe/FeO$_x$ superconducting family but also enrich the current understanding on the roles of the oxide interface.</description>

      <title>Effect of spin-dependent tunneling in a MoSe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ van der Waals heterostructure on exciton and trion emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study van der Waals heterostructures consisting of monolayer MoSe$_2$ and few-layer Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ fully encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride using low-temperature photoluminescence and polar magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements. Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and recombination.</description>

      <title>Compressive Electron Backscatter Diffraction Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) has developed over the last few decades into a valuable crystallographic characterisation method for a wide range of sample types. Despite these advances, issues such as the complexity of sample preparation, relatively slow acquisition, and damage in beam-sensitive samples, still limit the quantity and quality of interpretable data that can be obtained. To mitigate these issues, here we propose a method based on the subsampling of probe positions and subsequent reconstruction of an incomplete dataset. The missing probe locations (or pixels in the image) are recovered via an inpainting process using a dictionary-learning based method called beta-process factor analysis (BPFA). To investigate the robustness of both our inpainting method and Hough-based indexing, we simulate subsampled and noisy EBSD datasets from a real fully sampled Ni-superalloy dataset for different subsampling ratios of probe positions using both Gaussian and Poisson noise models. We find that zero solution pixel detection (inpainting un-indexed pixels) enables higher quality reconstructions to be obtained. Numerical tests confirm high quality reconstruction of band contrast and inverse pole figure maps from only 10% of the probe positions, with the potential to reduce this to 5% if only inverse pole figure maps are needed. These results show the potential application of this method in EBSD, allowing for faster analysis and extending the use of this technique to beam sensitive materials.</description>

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride is rapidly gaining interest as a platform for photonic quantum technologies, due to its two-dimensional nature and its ability to host defects deep within its large band gap that may act as room-temperature single-photon emitters. In this review paper we provide an overview of (1) the structure, properties, growth and transfer of hexagonal boron nitride; (2) the creation and assignment of colour centres in hexagonal boron nitride for applications in photonic quantum technologies; and (3) heterostructure devices for the electrical tuning and charge control of colour centres that form the basis for photonic quantum technology devices. The aim of this review is to provide readers a summary of progress in both defect engineering and device fabrication in hexagonal boron nitride based photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform materials are very promising for applications but the successful route for synthesizing them requires to understand the interactions induced by the host media that can switch off this hidden order. With this aim we study the model system of vortices in the $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd superconductor where correlated defects seem to play a determinant role for the nucleation of a gel vortex phase at low densities. We directly image vortices in extended fields-of-view and show that the disordered vortex structure in this material is anti-hyperuniform, contrasting with the case of vortex structures nucleated in samples with point-like disorder. Based on numerical simulations, we show that this anti-hyperuniform structure arises both, from the interaction of a diluted vortex structure with a fourfold-symmetric correlated disorder quite likely generated when cleaving the samples and from the out of equilibrium nature of the quenched configuration.</description>

      <title>Microscopic effect of spin-lattice couplings on dynamical magnetic interactions of a skyrmion system PdFe/Ir(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PdFe/Ir(111) has attracted tremendous attention for next-generation spintronics devices due to existence of magnetic skyrmions with the external magnetic field. Our density functional theoretical calculations in combination with spin dynamics simulation suggest that the spin spiral phase in fcc stacked PdFe/Ir(111) flips into the skyrmion lattice phase around B$_{ext} \sim$ 6 T. This leads to the microscopic understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviours affected by the intrinsic spin-lattice couplings (SLCs) in this skyrmion material for magneto-mechanical properties. Here we calculate fully relativistic SLC parameters from first principle computations and investigate the effect of SLC on dynamical magnetic interactions in skyrmion multilayers PdFe/Ir(111). The exchange interactions arising from next nearest-neighbors (NN) in this material are highly frustrated and responsible for enhancing skyrmion stability. We report the larger spin-lattice effect on both dynamical Heisenberg exchanges and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions for next NN compared to NN which is in contrast with recently observed spin-lattice effect in bulk bcc Fe and CrI$_3$ monolayer. Based on our analysis, we find that the effective measures of SLCs in fcc (hcp) stacking of PdFe/Ir(111) are $\sim 2.71 ( \sim 2.36)$ and $\sim 14.71 ( \sim21.89)$ times stronger for NN and next NN respectively, compared to bcc Fe. The linear regime of displacement for SLC parameters is $\leq$ 0.02 {\AA} which is 0.72\% of the lattice constant for PdFe/Ir(111). The microscopic understanding of SLCs provided by our current study could help in designing spintronic devices based on thermodynamic properties of skyrmion multilayers.</description>

Abstract: The separation of isotopes of natural Krypton at the gas-liquid and liquid-solid phase interfaces was studied under nonequilibrium conditions using a cryogenic cell and mass spectrometry. Condensate formation during Kr cooling begins at an equilibrium temperature, which corresponds to the partial pressure of the dominant isotope 84Kr, and is accompanied by depletion of the gas phase 84Kr with a separation coefficient of ~0.92 due to the excess of the heat of condensation over the heat of dissolution by 70-100 kJ/mol. The formation of a solid phase near the freezing point is accompanied by depletion of the gas phase by heavy isotopes. The separation coefficients 86Kr, 84Kr, 83Kr, 82Kr and 80Kr are about 1.06, 1.11, 0.86, 0.86 and 0.80, respectively, after the transition of ~30% of the atoms to the solid phase. Pressure-selective condensation can be used to separate components with close boiling points when distillation and temperature-selective condensation methods are ineffective, and freezing out of heavy isotopes can be used to enrich elements with practically important isotopes.</description>

      <title>Efficient calculation of unbiased atomic forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a state-of-the-art numerical approach for evaluating accurate expectation values of many-body wavefunctions. However, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders widespread QMC applications is the lack of an affordable scheme to compute unbiased atomic forces. In this study, we propose a very efficient method to obtain unbiased atomic forces and pressures in the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) framework with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, exploiting the gauge-invariant and locality properties of its geminal representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for H$_2$ and Cl$_2$ molecules and for the cubic boron nitride crystal. Our framework has a better algorithmic scaling with the system size than the traditional finite-difference method, and, in practical applications, is as efficient as single-point VMC calculations. Thus, it paves the way to study dynamical properties of materials, such as phonons, and is beneficial for pursuing more reliable machine-learning interatomic potentials based on unbiased VMC forces.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the origin of antiferromagnetic coupling at YIG/permalloy interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14553v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and electronic origin of antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling in the Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and permalloy (Py) bilayer system at the atomic level. Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) reveal unique hybrid modes in samples prepared with surface ion milling, indicative of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling at the YIG/Py interface. Using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we found that AFM coupling appears at the YIG/Py interface of the tetrahedral YIG surface formed with ion milling. The STEM measurements suggest that the interfacial AFM coupling is predominantly driven by an oxygen-mediated super-exchange coupling mechanism, which is confirmed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to be energetically favorable. Thus, the combined experimental and theoretical results reveal the critical role of interfacial atomic structure in determining the type magnetic coupling in a YIG/ferromagnet heterostructure, and prove that the interfacial structure can be experimentally tuned by surface ion-milling.</description>

      <title>Half century of Efros-Shklovskii Coulomb gap. Romance with Coulomb interaction and disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efros-Shklovskii (ES) Coulomb gap in density of localized states and ES law of the variable range hopping conductivity were coined 50 years ago. The theory and its first confirmations were reviewed in our monograph 40-years ago. This paper reviews the subsequent experimental evidence, theoretical advancements, and novel applications. Out of hundreds of experimental validations of the ES law in a diverse range of materials, I focus on those where the dynamic range of conductivity exceeds four orders of magnitude. These include three- and two-dimensional semiconductors under both zero and high magnetic fields, localized phases in the quantum Hall effect, granular metals, nanocrystal arrays, and conducting polymers. Additionally, this review discusses the Coulomb gap near insulator-metal transition and in non-ohmic ES law. Recent developments of other concepts of the ES book are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Green and Solid State Reduction of GO Monolayers Sandwiched between Arachidic Acid LB Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel, single step and environment friendly solid state approach for reduction of graphene oxide (GO) monolayers has been demonstrated, in which, arachidic acid-GO-arachidic acid (AA-GO-AA) sandwich structure obtained by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique was heat treated at moderate temperatures to obtain RGO sheets. Heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure at 200 C results in substantial reduction of GO, with concurrent removal of AA molecules. Such developed RGO sheets possess sp2-C content of 69%, O/C ratio of 0.17 and significantly reduced I(D) and I(G) ratio of ~1.1. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies on RGO sheets evidenced significant increase in density of states in immediate vicinity of Fermi level and decrease in work function after reduction. Bottom gated field effect transistors fabricated with isolated RGO sheets displayed charge neutrality point at a positive gate voltage, indicating p-type nature, consistent with UPS and electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) measurement results.The RGO sheets obtained by heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure exhibited conductivity in the range of 2-7Scm-1 and field effect mobility of 0.03-2cm2V-1s-1, which are consistent with values reported for RGO sheets obtained by various chemical or thermal reduction procedures.The extent of GO reduction is determined primarily by proximity of AA molecules and found to be unaltered with either escalation of heat treatment temperature or increase of AA content in sandwich structure. The single-step GO reduction approach demonstrated in this work is an effective way for development of RGO monolayers with high structural quality towards graphene-based electronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Competitive exciton and polariton scattering inhibits condensation in two-dimensional metal-halide-semiconductor microcavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polariton condensation relies on the macroscopic occupation of the lowest-energy polariton state beyond a critical density. The mechanisms driving the occupation and depopulation of this state all rely on multi-particle scattering, whose dynamics determine the extent to which condensates can form spontaneously. To pinpoint many-body processes hindering polariton condensation in two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductors, we examine the exciton-polariton dynamics in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity over timescales involving polariton ($\bm{\ll 1}$\,ps) and exciton scattering ($\bm{\gg 1}$\,ps). We find enhanced nonlinear exciton-exciton interactions in the microcavity versus the bare semiconductor and ultrafast polariton scattering depopulating the lowest-energy polariton state. We posit that the complex scattering landscape between the exciton reservoir and polaritons limits the formation of polariton condensates in these semiconductors, and we discuss the generality of our conclusions for highly polar materials in which the lattice mediates multi-particle correlations.</description>

      <title>Intricate magnetic landscape in antiferromagnetic kagome metal TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and interplay with Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ (Ln: Tb-Lu) shurikagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we present the discovery and characterization of the kagome metal TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ in tandem with a new series of compounds, the Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ (Ln: Tb-Lu) shurikagome metals. We previously reported on the growth of the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ (Ln: La-Gd$^{3+}$, Eu$^{2+}$, Yb$^{2+}$) family, a chemically diverse and exfoliable series of kagome metals with complex and highly anisotropic magnetism. However, unlike the La-Gd analogs, TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ cannot be synthesized by our previous methodology due to phase competition with Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ (x$\sim$1.7-1.2). Here we discuss the phase competition between the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ families, helping to frame the difficulty in synthesizing LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ compounds with small Ln species and providing a strategy to circumvent formation of Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$. Detailed characterization of the magnetic and electronic transport properties on single crystals of TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ reveals a highly complex landscape of magnetic phases arising from an antiferromagnetic ground state. A series of metamagnetic transitions creates at least 5 unique magnetic phase pockets, including a 1/3 and 2/3 magnetization plateau. Further, the system exhibits an intimate connection between the magnetism and magnetotransport, exhibiting sharp switching from positive (+40%) to negative magnetoresistance (-50%). Like the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ kagome metals, the Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ family exhibits quasi-2D networks of titanium and chains of rare-earth. We present the structures and some basic magnetic properties of the Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ family alongside our characterization of the newly discovered TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic magnetization dynamics in Fe5GeTe2 at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The determination of Lande's g-factor and the damping constant is central to extracting crucial information about the spin-spin and spin-orbit interactions in magnetically ordered systems. In insulating compounds based on 3d elements, the spin-orbit interaction can be effectively probed by investigating the ground state of the corresponding free 3d ion within the crystalline environment. For metallic systems, the problem is non-trivial because of additional band structure effects. Here, we investigate the anisotropic magnetization dynamics in bulk single crystalline Fe5GeTe2, a van der Waals 2D itinerant ferromagnet at room temperature, using broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Strikingly, contrary to the results of ab-initio calculations, we do not observe any intrinsic anisotropy of magnetization damping close to room temperature, suggesting diminished role of spin-orbit interaction. However, there is a sizable anisotropy in the Lande's g factor near room temperature which is attributed to anisotropic critical spin fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Structural Influence on Exciton Formation and the Critical Role of Dark Excitons in Polymeric Carbon Nitrides</title>

Abstract: Polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) exhibit intriguing optical properties and exceptional performance in (photo)catalysis, optoelectronics, and energy storage. Nevertheless, the intricate phenomena involving light absorption extending to the visible range, long-lived excitons, photo-charging, and photochemical processes observed in PCN derivatives remain poorly understood. Our theoretical investigation elucidates the origin of distinct dark and bright excitons, their stability and lifetimes, and their correlation with the microstructural attributes of PCNs. Furthermore, we identify the decisive role of dark excitons in catalytic reactivity, which underlies the differences in the photocatalytic performance of different PCN derivatives.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetic susceptibility of multifold fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological semimetals are intensively studied in recent years. Besides the well known Weyl and Dirac semimetals, some materials posses nodes with linear crossing of multiple bands. Low energy excitations around these nodes are called multifold fermions and can be described by $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian with pseudospin greater than 1/2. In the present work we investigated the contribution of these states into orbital magnetic susceptibility $\chi$. We have found that, similarly to Weyl semimetals, the dependence of susceptibility on chemical potential $\mu$ shows an extremum when $\mu$ is close to the band crossing energy. In the case of half-integer pseudospin this extremum is a minumum and the susceptibility is negative (diamagnetic). While in the case of integer pseudospin the susceptibility is large and positive (paramagnetic) due to the contribution of dispersionless band. This leads also to nonmonotonic temperature dependence of $\chi$. As an example, we considered the case of cobalt monosilicide where the states near the $\Gamma$ point correspond to pseudospin 1 without spin-orbital interaction, and to a combination of Weyl node and pseudospin-3/2 states with the account of spin-orbit coupling.</description>

Abstract: Predicting quantum operator matrices such as Hamiltonian, overlap, and density matrices in the density functional theory (DFT) framework is crucial for understanding material properties. Current methods often focus on individual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for large systems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (strictly localized equivariant message-passing) for predicting multiple quantum operators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improving computational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-based design, constructing local, equivariant representations for quantum tensors while preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependence without expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior data efficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolution technique, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensor products and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$ orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse 2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data. SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFT simulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities for large-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an isothermal electric field-induced first-order phase transition from Mott-insulator to the metallic state in the epitaxial thin film of V$_2$O$_3$ in the temperature regime below its Mott transition temperature $\approx$ 180 K. This isothermal electric field induced transition is accompanied by interesting electro-thermal history effects, which depend on the measurement paths followed in the electric field - temperature phase space. These interesting properties result in tuneable resistive switching and distinct memristive behavior in V$_2$O$_3$. A generalized framework of disorder-influenced first-order phase transition in combination with a resistor network model has been used to explain the observed experimental features. These findings promise possibilities for Mott insulators to be highly energy-efficient switches in novel technologies like neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Evidence of directional structural superlubricity and L\'evy flights in a van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural superlubricity is a special frictionless contact in which two crystals are in incommensurate arrangement such that relative in-plane translation is associated with vanishing energy barrier crossing. So far, it has been realized in multilayer graphene and other van der Waals two-dimensional crystals with hexagonal or triangular crystalline symmetries, leading to isotropic frictionless contacts. Directional structural superlubricity, to date unrealized in two-dimensional systems, is possible when the reciprocal lattices of the two crystals coincide in one direction only. Here, we evidence directional structural superlubricity a $\alpha$-bismuthene/graphite van der Waals system, manifested by spontaneous hopping of the islands over hundreds of nanometres at room temperature, resolved by low-energy electron microscopy and supported by registry simulations. Statistical analysis of individual and collective $\alpha$-bismuthene islands populations reveal a heavy-tailed distribution of the hopping lengths and sticking times indicative of L{\'e}vy flight dynamics, largely unobserved in condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Core-level signature of long-range density-wave order and short-range excitonic correlations probed by attosecond broadband spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in attosecond core-level spectroscopies have successfully unlocked the fastest dynamics involving high-energy electrons. Yet, these techniques are not conventionally regarded as an appropriate probe for low-energy quasiparticle interactions that govern the ground state of quantum materials, nor for studying long-range order because of their limited sensitivity to local charge environments. Here, by employing a unique cryogenic attosecond beamline, we identified clear core-level signatures of long-range charge-density-wave (CDW) formation in a quasi-2D excitonic insulator candidate, even though equilibrium photoemission and absorption measurements of the same core levels showed no spectroscopic singularity at the phase transition. Leveraging the high time resolution and intrinsic sensitivity to short-range charge excitations in attosecond core-level absorption, we observed compelling time-domain evidence for excitonic correlations in the normal-state of the material, whose presence has been subjected to a long-standing debate in equilibrium experiments because of interfering phonon fluctuations in a similar part of the phase space. Our findings support the scenario that short-range excitonic fluctuations prelude long-range order formation in the ground state, providing important insights in the mechanism of exciton condensation in a quasi-low-dimensional system. These results further demonstrate the importance of a simultaneous access to long- and short-range order with underlying dynamical processes spanning a multitude of time- and energy-scales, making attosecond spectroscopy an indispensable tool for both understanding the equilibrium phase diagram and for discovering novel, nonequilibrium states in strongly correlated materials.</description>
