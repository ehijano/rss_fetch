      <title>Amplifying Your Social Media Presence: Personalized Influential Content Generation with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the content generation process in social media, offering significant convenience in writing tasks. However, existing applications, such as sentence completion and fluency enhancement, do not fully address the complex challenges in real-world social media contexts. A prevalent goal among social media users is to increase the visibility and influence of their posts. This paper, therefore, delves into the compelling question: Can LLMs generate personalized influential content to amplify a user's presence on social media? We begin by examining prevalent techniques in content generation to assess their impact on post influence. Acknowledging the critical impact of underlying network structures in social media, which are instrumental in initiating content cascades and highly related to the influence/popularity of a post, we then inject network information into prompt for content generation to boost the post's influence. We design multiple content-centric and structure-aware prompts. The empirical experiments across LLMs validate their ability in improving the influence and draw insights on which strategies are more effective.

      <title>EDTok: A Dataset for Eating Disorder Content on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eating disorders, which include anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with increased diagnoses linked to heightened exposure to idealized body images online. TikTok, a platform with over a billion predominantly adolescent users, has become a key space where eating disorder content is shared, raising concerns about its impact on vulnerable populations. In response, we present a curated dataset of 43,040 TikTok videos, collected using keywords and hashtags related to eating disorders. Spanning from January 2019 to June 2024, this dataset, offers a comprehensive view of eating disorder-related content on TikTok. Our dataset has the potential to address significant research gaps, enabling analysis of content spread and moderation, user engagement, and the pandemic's influence on eating disorder trends. This work aims to inform strategies for mitigating risks associated with harmful content, contributing valuable insights to the study of digital health and social media's role in shaping mental health.</description>

      <title>A longitudinal analysis of misinformation, polarization and toxicity on Bluesky after its public launch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bluesky is a decentralized, Twitter-like social media platform that has rapidly gained popularity. Following an invite-only phase, it officially opened to the public on February 6th, 2024, leading to a significant expansion of its user base. In this paper, we present a longitudinal analysis of user activity in the two months surrounding its public launch, examining how the platform evolved due to this rapid growth. Our analysis reveals that Bluesky exhibits an activity distribution comparable to more established social platforms, yet it features a higher volume of original content relative to reshared posts and maintains low toxicity levels. We further investigate the political leanings of its user base, misinformation dynamics, and engagement in harmful conversations. Our findings indicate that Bluesky users predominantly lean left politically and tend to share high-credibility sources. After the platform's public launch, an influx of new users, particularly those posting in English and Japanese, contributed to a surge in activity. Among them, several accounts displayed suspicious behaviors, such as mass-following users and sharing content from low-credibility news sources. Some of these accounts have already been flagged as spam or suspended, suggesting that Bluesky's moderation efforts have been effective.</description>

      <title>Social Correction on Social Media: A Quantitative Analysis of Comment Behaviour and Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corrections given by ordinary social media users, also referred to as Social Correction have emerged as a viable intervention against misinformation as per the recent literature. However, little is known about how often users give disputing or endorsing comments and how reliable those comments are. An online experiment was conducted to investigate how users' credibility evaluations of social media posts and their confidence in those evaluations combined with online reputational concerns affect their commenting behaviour. The study found that participants exhibited a more conservative approach when giving disputing comments compared to endorsing ones. Nevertheless, participants were more discerning in their disputing comments than endorsing ones. These findings contribute to a better understanding of social correction on social media and highlight the factors influencing comment behaviour and reliability.</description>

      <title>dyGRASS: Dynamic Spectral Graph Sparsification via Localized Random Walks on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02741v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents dyGRASS, an efficient dynamic algorithm for spectral sparsification of large undirected graphs that undergo streaming edge insertions and deletions. At its core, dyGRASS employs a random-walk-based method to efficiently estimate node-to-node distances in both the original graph (for decremental update) and its sparsifier (for incremental update). For incremental updates, dyGRASS enables the identification of spectrally critical edges among the updates to capture the latest structural changes. For decremental updates, dyGRASS facilitates the recovery of important edges from the original graph back into the sparsifier. To further enhance computational efficiency, dyGRASS employs a GPU-based non-backtracking random walk scheme that allows multiple walkers to operate simultaneously across various target updates. This parallelization significantly improves both the performance and scalability of the proposed dyGRASS framework. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations reveal that dyGRASS achieves approximately a 10x speedup compared to the state-of-the-art incremental sparsification (inGRASS) algorithm while eliminating the setup overhead and improving solution quality in incremental spectral sparsification tasks. Moreover, dyGRASS delivers high efficiency and superior solution quality for fully dynamic graph sparsification, accommodating both edge insertions and deletions across a diverse range of graph instances originating from integrated circuit simulations, finite element analysis, and social networks.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Governance (HAIG): A Trust-Utility Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the HAIG framework for analysing trust dynamics across evolving human-AI relationships. Current categorical frameworks (e.g., "human-in-the-loop" models) inadequately capture how AI systems evolve from tools to partners, particularly as foundation models demonstrate emergent capabilities and multi-agent systems exhibit autonomous goal-setting behaviours. As systems advance, agency redistributes in complex patterns that are better represented as positions along continua rather than discrete categories, though progression may include both gradual shifts and significant step changes. The HAIG framework operates across three levels: dimensions (Decision Authority Distribution, Process Autonomy, and Accountability Configuration), continua (gradual shifts along each dimension), and thresholds (critical points requiring governance adaptation). Unlike risk-based or principle-based approaches, HAIG adopts a trust-utility orientation, focusing on maintaining appropriate trust relationships that maximise utility while ensuring sufficient safeguards. Our analysis reveals how technical advances in self-supervision, reasoning authority, and distributed decision-making drive non-uniform trust evolution across both contextual variation and technological advancement. Case studies in healthcare and European regulation demonstrate how HAIG complements existing frameworks while offering a foundation for alternative approaches that anticipate governance challenges before they emerge.</description>

      <title>GraphPrompter: Multi-stage Adaptive Prompt Optimization for Graph In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph In-Context Learning, with the ability to adapt pre-trained graph models to novel and diverse downstream graphs without updating any parameters, has gained much attention in the community. The key to graph in-context learning is to perform downstream graphs conditioned on chosen prompt examples. Existing methods randomly select subgraphs or edges as prompts, leading to noisy graph prompts and inferior model performance. Additionally, due to the gap between pre-training and testing graphs, when the number of classes in the testing graphs is much greater than that in the training, the in-context learning ability will also significantly deteriorate. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we develop a multi-stage adaptive prompt optimization method GraphPrompter, which optimizes the entire process of generating, selecting, and using graph prompts for better in-context learning capabilities. Firstly, Prompt Generator introduces a reconstruction layer to highlight the most informative edges and reduce irrelevant noise for graph prompt construction. Furthermore, in the selection stage, Prompt Selector employs the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and pre-trained selection layers to dynamically choose appropriate samples and minimize the influence of irrelevant prompts. Finally, we leverage a Prompt Augmenter with a cache replacement strategy to enhance the generalization capability of the pre-trained model on new datasets. Extensive experiments show that GraphPrompter effectively enhances the in-context learning ability of graph models. On average across all the settings, our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines by over 8%. Our code is released at https://github.com/karin0018/GraphPrompter.</description>

      <title>Grassroots Democratic Federation: Fair Governance of Large-Scale, Decentralized, Sovereign Digital Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02208v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grassroots Democratic Federation aims to address the egalitarian formation and the fair democratic governance of large-scale, decentralized, sovereign digital communities, the size of the EU, the US, existing social networks, and even humanity at large. A grassroots democratic federation evolves via the grassroots formation of digital communities and their consensual federation. Such digital communities may form according to geography, jurisdiction, affiliations, relations, interests, or causes. Small communities (say up to 100 members) govern themselves; larger communities -- no matter how large -- are governed by a small assembly elected by sortition among its members. Earlier work on Grassroots Democratic Federation explored the fair sortition of the assemblies of a federation in a static setting: Given a federation, populate its assemblies with members satisfying ex ante and ex post fairness conditions on the participation of members of a community in its assembly, and on the representation of child communities in the assembly of their parent community.
  In practice, we expect a grassroots democratic federation to grow and evolve dynamically and in all directions -- bottom-up, top-down, and middle-out. To address that, we formally specify this dynamic setting and adapt the static fairness conditions to it: The ex post condition on the fair representation of a child community becomes a condition that must always hold; the ex ante conditions in expectation on the fair participation of an individual and on the fair representation of a child community become conditions satisfied in actuality in the limit, provided the federation structure eventually stabilizes. We then present a protocol that satisfies these fairness conditions.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Federated Graph Learning: A Data Condensation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated graph learning is a widely recognized technique that promotes collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client graphs.However, existing approaches heavily rely on the communication of model parameters or gradients for federated optimization and fail to adequately address the data heterogeneity introduced by intricate and diverse graph distributions. Although some methods attempt to share additional messages among the server and clients to improve federated convergence during communication, they introduce significant privacy risks and increase communication overhead. To address these issues, we introduce the concept of a condensed graph as a novel optimization carrier to address FGL data heterogeneity and propose a new FGL paradigm called FedGM. Specifically, we utilize a generalized condensation graph consensus to aggregate comprehensive knowledge from distributed graphs, while minimizing communication costs and privacy risks through a single transmission of the condensed data. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedGM over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting its potential for a novel FGL paradigm.</description>

      <title>Inference and Visualization of Community Structure in Attributed Hypergraphs Using Mixed-Membership Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs represent complex systems involving interactions among more than two entities and allow the investigation of higher-order structure and dynamics in complex systems. Node attribute data, which often accompanies network data, can enhance the inference of community structure in complex systems. While mixed-membership stochastic block models have been employed to infer community structure in hypergraphs, they complicate the visualization and interpretation of inferred community structure by assuming that nodes may possess soft community memberships. In this study, we propose a framework, HyperNEO, that combines mixed-membership stochastic block models for hypergraphs with dimensionality reduction methods. Our approach generates a node layout that largely preserves the community memberships of nodes. We evaluate our framework on both synthetic and empirical hypergraphs with node attributes. We expect our framework will broaden the investigation and understanding of higher-order community structure in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Easy-access online social media metrics can foster the identification of misinformation sharing users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant challenge studied extensively by researchers, yet acquiring data to identify primary sharers is time-consuming and challenging. To address this, we propose a low-barrier approach to differentiate social media users who are more likely to share misinformation from those who are less likely. Leveraging insights from previous studies, we demonstrate that easy-access online social network metrics -- average daily tweet count, and account age -- can be leveraged to help identify potential low factuality content spreaders on X (previously known as Twitter). We find that higher tweet frequency is positively associated with low factuality in shared content, while account age is negatively associated with it. We also find that some of the effects, namely the effect of the number of accounts followed and the number of tweets produced, differ depending on the number of followers a user has. Our findings show that relying on these easy-access social network metrics could serve as a low-barrier approach for initial identification of users who are more likely to spread misinformation, and therefore contribute to combating misinformation effectively on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Italian Telegram Ecosystem: Communities, Toxicity, and Hate Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Telegram has become a major space for political discourse and alternative media. However, its lack of moderation allows misinformation, extremism, and toxicity to spread. While prior research focused on these particular phenomena or topics, these have mostly been examined separately, and a broader understanding of the Telegram ecosystem is still missing. In this work, we fill this gap by conducting a large-scale analysis of the Italian Telegram sphere, leveraging a dataset of 186 million messages from 13,151 chats collected in 2023. Using network analysis, Large Language Models, and toxicity detection tools, we examine how different thematic communities form, align ideologically, and engage in harmful discourse within the Italian cultural context. Results show strong thematic and ideological homophily. We also identify mixed ideological communities where far-left and far-right rhetoric coexist on particular geopolitical issues. Beyond political analysis, we find that toxicity, rather than being isolated in a few extreme chats, appears widely normalized within highly toxic communities. Moreover, we find that Italian discourse primarily targets Black people, Jews, and gay individuals independently of the topic. Finally, we uncover common trend of intra-national hostility, where Italians often attack other Italians, reflecting regional and intra-regional cultural conflicts that can be traced back to old historical divisions. This study provides the first large-scale mapping of the Italian Telegram ecosystem, offering insights into ideological interactions, toxicity, and identity-targets of hate and contributing to research on online toxicity across different cultural and linguistic contexts on Telegram.</description>

      <title>A Graph Theoretic Approach for Exploring the Relationship between EV Adoption and Charging Infrastructure Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing global demand for conventional energy has led to significant challenges, particularly due to rising CO2 emissions and the depletion of natural resources. In the U.S., light-duty vehicles contribute significantly to transportation sector emissions, prompting a global shift toward electrified vehicles (EVs). Among the challenges that thwart the widespread adoption of EVs is the insufficient charging infrastructure (CI). This study focuses on exploring the complex relationship between EV adoption and CI growth. Employing a graph theoretic approach, we propose a graph model to analyze correlations between EV adoption and CI growth across 137 counties in six states. We examine how different time granularities impact these correlations in two distinct scenarios: Early Adoption and Late Adoption. Further, we conduct causality tests to assess the directional relationship between EV adoption and CI growth in both scenarios. Our main findings reveal that analysis using lower levels of time granularity result in more homogeneous clusters, with notable differences between clusters in EV adoption and those in CI growth. Additionally, we identify causal relationships between EV adoption and CI growth in 137 counties, and show that causality is observed more frequently in Early Adoption scenarios than in Late Adoption ones. However, the causal effects in Early Adoption are slower than those in Late Adoption.</description>

      <title>A Computational Analysis and Visualization of In-Text Reference Networks Across Philosophical Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We applied computational methods to analyze references across 2,245 philosophical texts, spanning from approximately 550 BCE to 1940 AD, in order to measure patterns in how philosophical ideas have spread over time. Using natural language processing and network analysis, we mapped over 294,970 references between authors, classifying each reference into subdisciplines of philosophy based on its surrounding context. We then constructed a graph, with authors as nodes and textual references as edges, to empirically validate, visualize, and quantify intellectual lineages as they are understood within philosophical scholarship. For instance, we find that Plato and Aristotle alone account for nearly 10% of all references from authors in our dataset, suggesting that their influence may still be underestimated. As another example, we support the view that St. Thomas Aquinas served as a synthesizer between Aristotelian and Christian philosophy by analyzing the network structures of Aquinas, Aristotle, and Christian theologians. Our results are presented through an interactive visualization tool, allowing users to dynamically explore these networks, alongside a mathematical analysis of the network's structure. Our methodology demonstrates the value of applying network analysis with textual references to study a large collection of historical works.</description>
