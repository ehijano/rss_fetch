      <title>On $n$-Dimensional Sequences. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring and let $n \geq 1.$ We study $\Gamma(s)$, the generating function and Ann$(s)$, the ideal of characteristic polynomials of $s$, an $n$--dimensional sequence over $R$.
  We express $f(X_1,\ldots,X_n) \cdot \Gamma(s)(X_1^{-1},\ldots ,X_n^{-1})$ as a partitioned sum. That is, we give (i) a $2^n$--fold ``border'' partition (ii) an explicit expression for the product as a $2^n$--fold sum; the support of each summand is contained in precisely one member of the partition. A key summand is $\beta_0(f,s)$, the ``border polynomial'' of $f$ and $s$, which is divisible by $X_1\cdots X_n$.
  We say that $s$ is {\em eventually rectilinear} if the elimination ideals Ann$(s)\cap R[X_i]$ contain an $f_i(X_i)$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$. In this case, we show that $\mbox{Ann}(s)$ is the ideal quotient $(\sum_{i=1}^n(f_i)\ :\ \beta_0(f,s)/(X_1\cdots X_n)).$
  When $R$ and $R[[X_1,X_2, \ldots ,X_n]]$ are factorial domains (e.g. $R$ a principal ideal domain or ${\Bbb F}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$), we compute {\em the monic generator} $\gamma _i$ of $\mbox{Ann}(s) \cap R[X_i]$ from known $f_i \in \mbox{Ann}(s) \cap R[X_i]$ or from a finite number of $1$--dimensional linear recurring sequences over $R$. Over a field ${\Bbb F}$ this gives an $O(\prod_{i=1}^n \delta \gamma _i^3)$ algorithm to compute an ${\Bbb F}$--basis for $\mbox{Ann}(s)$.</description>

      <title>A realization theorem for almost Dedekind domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integral domain $D$ is called an SP-domain if every ideal is a product of radical ideals. Such domains are always almost Dedekind domains, but not every almost Dedekind domain is an SP-domain. The SP-rank of $D$ provides a natural measure of the deviation of $D$ from being an SP-domain. In the present paper we show that every ordinal number $\alpha$ can be realized as the SP-rank of an almost Dedekind domain.</description>

      <title>The ramification tree and almost Dedekind domains of prescribed SP-rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a valuation $v$ with quotient field $K$ and a sequence $\mathcal{K} :K_0\subseteq K_1\subseteq\cdots$ of finite extensions of $K$, we construct a weighted tree $\mathcal{T}(v,\mathcal{K})$ encoding information about the ramification of $v$ in the extensions $K_i$; conversely, we show that a weighted tree $\mathcal{T}$ can be expressed as $\mathcal{T}(v,\mathcal{K})$ under some mild hypothesis on $v$ or on $\mathcal{T}$. We use this construction to construct, for every countable successor ordinal number $\alpha$, an almost Dedekind domain $D$, integral over $V$ (the valuation domain of $v$) whose SP-rank is $\alpha$. Subsequently, we extend this result to countable limit ordinal numbers by considering integral extensions of Dedekind domains with countably many maximal ideals.</description>

      <title>Triangulated characterizations of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a range of triangulated characterizations for important classes of singularities such as derived splinters, rational singularities, and Du Bois singularities. We measure singularity types by the potential for a pair of objects to finitely build one another in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves utilizing a combination of cones, shifts, or finite coproducts. An invariant called 'level' in a triangulated category can be used to measure the failure of a variety to have a prescribed singularity type. We provide explicit computations of this invariant for reduced Nagata schemes of Krull dimension one and for affine cones over smooth projective hypersurfaces. Furthermore, these computations are utilized to produce upper bounds for Rouquier dimension on the respective bounded derived categories.</description>

      <title>Limit distribution of Hodge spectral exponents of irreducible plane curve singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the Hodge spectral exponents of an irreducible plane curve by comparing it with a continuous distribution. We provide a closed formula for this difference in terms of numerical invariants of the curve. We characterize those families of irreducible plane curves whose limit distribution of Hodge spectral exponents is the continuous distribution and we provide intervals of dominating values.</description>

      <title>Stability theorems for positively graded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12778v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Noetherian graded domain $R = \bigoplus_{i\ge 0} R_i$ of dimension $d\geq 2$ with $\dim(R_0) \geq 1$, we prove that any unimodular row of length $d+1$ in $R$ can be completed to the first row of an invertible matrix $\alpha$ such that $\alpha$ is homotopic to the identity matrix. Utilizing this result we establish that if $I \subset R$ is an ideal satisfying $\mu(I/I^2) = \text{ht}(I) = d$, then any set of generators of $I/I^2$ lifts to a set of generators of $I$, where $\mu(-)$ denotes the minimal number of generators. We improve the injective stability of $\text{K}_1(R)$. Finally, we prove that for any projective $R$-module $P$ of rank $d$ if the Quillen ideal of $P$ is non-zero, then $P$ is cancellative.</description>

      <title>The edge rings of compact graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a simple graph as compact if it lacks even cycles and satisfies the odd-cycle condition. Our focus is on classifying all compact graphs and examining the characteristics of their edge rings. Let $G$ be a compact graph and $\mathbb{K}[G]$ be its edge ring. Specifically, we demonstrate that the Cohen-Macaulay type and the projective dimension of $\mathbb{K}[G]$ are both equal to the number of induced cycles of $G$ minus one, and that the regularity of $\mathbb{K}[G]$ is equal to the matching number of $G_0$. Here, $G_0$ is obtained from $G$ by removing the vertices of degree one successively, resulting in a graph where every vertex has a degree greater than 1.</description>

      <title>Polynomial XL: A Variant of the XL Algorithm Using Macaulay Matrices over Polynomial Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving a system of $m$ multivariate quadratic equations in $n$ variables over finite fields (the MQ problem) is one of the important problems in the theory of computer science. The XL algorithm (XL for short) is a major approach for solving the MQ problem with linearization over a coefficient field. Furthermore, the hybrid approach with XL (h-XL) is a variant of XL guessing some variables beforehand. In this paper, we present a variant of h-XL, which we call the \textit{polynomial XL (PXL)}. In PXL, the whole $n$ variables are divided into $k$ variables to be fixed and the remaining $n-k$ variables as ``main variables'', and we generate a Macaulay matrix with respect to the $n-k$ main variables over a polynomial ring of the $k$ (sub-)variables. By eliminating some columns of the Macaulay matrix over the polynomial ring before guessing $k$ variables, the amount of operations required for each guessed value can be reduced compared with h-XL. Our complexity analysis of PXL (under some practical assumptions and heuristics) gives a new theoretical bound, and it indicates that PXL could be more efficient than other algorithms in theory on the random system with $n=m$, which is the case of general multivariate signatures. For example, on systems over the finite field with ${2^8}$ elements with $n=m=80$, the numbers of operations deduced from the theoretical bounds of the hybrid approaches with XL and Wiedemann XL, Crossbred, and PXL with optimal $k$ are estimated as $2^{252}$, $2^{234}$, $2^{237}$, and $2^{220}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>D\'{e}vissage for generation in derived categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work exhibits that the essential image of the derived pushforward along a proper surjective morphism of Noetherian schemes generates the targets derived category of bounded complexes with coherent cohomology. There are two primary consequences to our work. First, we show that classical generators in the bounded derived category are preserved by derived pushforward along a proper surjective morphism of Noetherian schemes. Secondly, the bounded derived category coincides with the thick subcategory generated by perfect complexes and structure sheaves of closed integral subschemes supported in the singular locus of the ambient scheme.</description>
