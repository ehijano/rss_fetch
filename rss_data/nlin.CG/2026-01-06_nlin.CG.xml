      <title>Structure and dynamics in the low-density phase of a two-dimensional cellular automaton model of traffic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the structure and dynamics in the low-density phase of the deterministic two-dimensional cellular automaton model of traffic flow introduced in [O. Biham, A.A. Middleton and D. Levine, Phys. Rev. A 46, R6124 (1992)]. The model consists of horizontally-oriented (H) cars that move to the right and vertically-oriented (V) cars that move downward, on a square lattice of size $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. Starting from a random initial state of density $p$, which is equally divided between the H and V-cars, the model exhibits a phase transition at a critical density $p_c$. For $p&lt;p_c$ it evolves toward a free-flowing periodic (FFP) state, while for $p&gt;p_c$ it evolves toward a fully-jammed state or to an intermediate state of congested traffic. In the FFP states, the H and V-cars segregate into homogeneous diagonal bands, in which they move freely without obstruction. To analyze the convergence toward the FFP states we introduce a configuration-space distance measure $D(t)=D_{\parallel}(t)+D_{\perp}(t)$ between the state of the system at time $t$ and the set of FFP states. The $D_{\parallel}(t)$ term accounts for the interactions between homotypic pairs of H (or V) cars, while $D_{\perp}(t)$ accounts for the interactions between heterotypic pairs of H and V-cars. We show that in the FFP states $D(t)=0$, while in all the other states $D(t)&gt;0$. As the system evolves toward the FFP states, there is a separation of time scales, where $D_{\parallel}(t)$ decays very fast while $D_{\perp}(t)$ decays much more slowly. Moreover, the time dependence of $D_{\perp}(t)$ is well fitted by an exponentially truncated power-law decay of the form $D_{\perp}(t)\sim t^{-\gamma} \exp(-t/\tau_{\perp})$, where $\tau_{\perp}$ depends on $L$ and $p$. The power-law decay suggests avalanche-like dynamics with no characteristic scale, while the exponential cutoff is imposed by the finite lattice size.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the Structure of Lenia Parameter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous cellular automata are rocketing in popularity, yet developing a theoretical understanding of their behaviour remains a challenge. In the case of Lenia, a few fundamental open problems include determining what exactly constitutes a soliton, what is the overall structure of the parameter space, and where do the solitons occur in it. In this abstract, we present a new method to automatically classify Lenia systems into four qualitatively different dynamical classes. This allows us to detect moving solitons, and to provide an interactive visualization of Lenia's parameter space structure on our website https://lenia-explorer.vercel.app/. The results shed new light on the above-mentioned questions and lead to several observations: the existence of new soliton families for parameters where they were not believed to exist, or the universality of the phase space structure across various kernels.</description>
