      <title>Integrals and chaos in generalized H\'{e}non-Heiles Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the approximate (formal) integrals of motion in the Hamiltonian $ H = \frac{1}{2}\left( \dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 + x^2 + y^2 \right) + \epsilon\,\left( xy^2 + \alpha x^3\right)$ which is an extension of the usual H\'{e}non-Heiles Hamiltonian that has $\alpha = -1/3$. We compare the theoretical surfaces of section (at $y=0$) with the exact surfaces of section calculated by integrating numerically many orbits. For small $\epsilon$, the invariant curves of the theoretical and the exact surfaces of section are close to each other, but for large $\epsilon$ there are differences. The most important is the appearance of chaos in the exact case, which becomes dominant as $\epsilon$ approaches the escape perturbation for $\alpha&lt;0$. We study in particular the cases $\alpha = 1/3$, which represents an integrable system, and $\alpha = 0$. Finally we examine the generation of chaos through the resonance overlap mechanism in the case $\alpha=-1/3$ (the original H\'{e}non-Heiles system) by showing both the homoclinic and the heteroclinic intersection of the asymptotic curves of the unstable periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of chaos in billiards: the role of mixed curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boundary of a billiard system dictates its dynamics, which can be integrable, mixed, or fully chaotic. Despite the significant implications of chaotic billiard systems with mixed curvatures, those whose boundaries feature both positive and negative curvature remain relatively under-explored. This study introduces two such billiards: a bean-shaped billiard and a peanut-shaped billiard, the latter being a variant of Cassini ovals. Unlike traditional chaotic billiards, these systems incorporate both focusing and defocusing regions along their boundaries, with no neutral segments. We examine both classical and quantum dynamics of these billiards and observe a strong alignment between the two perspectives. For classical analysis, the billiard flow diagram and billiard map reveal sensitivity to initial conditions, a hallmark of classical chaos. In the quantum domain, we use nearest-neighbour spacing distribution and spectral complexity as statistical measures to characterise chaotic behaviour. Both classical and quantum mechanical analysis are in firm agreement with each other. One of the most striking quantum phenomena we observe is the eigenfunction scarring (both scars and super-scars). Scarring phenomena serve as a rich visual manifestation of quantum and classical correspondence, and highlight quantum suppression chaos at a local level. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of chaos, especially in billiard systems with mixed curvature boundaries.</description>

      <title>The parametric instability landscape of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) hold promise as for the realization of neuromorphic and quantum computation. Yet, their rich bifurcation structure remains largely not understood. Here, we employ secular perturbation theory to map the stability regions of these networks, and identify the regime where the system can be mapped to an Ising model. Starting with two coupled KPOs, we show how the bifurcations arise from the competition between the global parametric drive and linear coupling between the KPOs. We then extend this framework to larger networks with all-to-all equal coupling, deriving analytical expressions for the full cascade of bifurcation transitions. In the thermodynamic limit, we find that these transitions become uniformly spaced, leading to a highly regular structure. Our results reveal the precise bounds under which KPO networks have an Ising-like solution space, and thus provides crucial guidance for their experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate thermalization to non-Gibbs states in strongly-interacting chaotic lattice gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that equilibrium energy distributions in many-body chaotic systems can be qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions. This effect can appear in systems with finite energy spectra, which support both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum degeneracy, when the eigenstates fill a substantial part of the Hilbert space. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>
