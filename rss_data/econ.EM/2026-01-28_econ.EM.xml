      <title>Design-Robust Event-Study Estimation under Staggered Adoption Diagnostics, Sensitivity, and Orthogonalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a design-first econometric framework for event-study and difference-in-differences estimands under staggered adoption with heterogeneous effects, emphasising (i) exact probability limits for conventional two-way fixed effects event-study regressions, (ii) computable design diagnostics that quantify contamination and negative-weight risk, and (iii) sensitivity-robust inference that remains uniformly valid under restricted violations of parallel trends. The approach is accompanied by orthogonal score constructions that reduce bias from high-dimensional nuisance estimation when conditioning on covariates. Theoretical results and Monte Carlo experiments jointly deliver a self-contained methodology paper suitable for finance and econometrics applications where timing variation is intrinsic to policy, regulation, and market-structure changes.</description>

      <title>To Adopt or Not to Adopt: Heterogeneous Trade Effects of the Euro</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two decades of research on the euro's trade effects have produced estimates ranging from 4% to 30%, with no consensus on the magnitude. We find evidence that this divergence may reflect genuine heterogeneity in the euro's trade effect across country pairs rather than methodological differences alone. Using Eurostat data on 15 EU countries from 1995-2015, we estimate that euro adoption increased bilateral trade by 24% on average (15.0% after fixed effects correction), but effects range from -12% to +68% across eurozone pairs. Core eurozone pairs (e.g., Germany-France, Germany-Netherlands) show large gains, while peripheral pairs involving Finland, Greece, and Portugal saw smaller or negative effects, with some negative estimates statistically significant and interpretable as trade diversion. Pre-euro trade intensity and GDP explain over 90% of this variation. Extending to EU28, we find evidence that crisis-era adopters (Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia) pull down naive estimates to 5%, but accounting for fixed effects recovers estimates of 14.0%, consistent with the EU15 fixed-effects baseline of 15.0%. Illustrative counterfactual analysis suggests non-eurozone members would have experienced varied effects: UK (+24%), Sweden (+20%), Denmark (+19%). The wide range of prior estimates appears to be largely a feature of the data, not a bug in the methods.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional estimation of quadratic variation based on penalized realized variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.03237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a penalized realized variance (PRV) estimator of the quadratic variation (QV) of a high-dimensional continuous It\^{o} semimartingale. We adapt the principle idea of regularization from linear regression to covariance estimation in a continuous-time high-frequency setting. We show that under a nuclear norm penalization, the PRV is computed by soft-thresholding the eigenvalues of realized variance (RV). It therefore encourages sparsity of singular values or, equivalently, low rank of the solution. We prove our estimator is minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor. We derive a concentration inequality, which reveals that the rank of PRV is -- with a high probability -- the number of non-negligible eigenvalues of the QV. Moreover, we also provide the associated non-asymptotic analysis for the spot variance. We suggest an intuitive data-driven subsampling procedure to select the shrinkage parameter. Our theory is supplemented by a simulation study and an empirical application. The PRV detects about three-five factors in the equity market, with a notable rank decrease during times of distress in financial markets. This is consistent with most standard asset pricing models, where a limited amount of systematic factors driving the cross-section of stock returns are perturbed by idiosyncratic errors, rendering the QV -- and also RV -- of full rank.</description>

      <title>Inflation Target at Risk: A Time-varying Parameter Distributional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inflation exhibits state-dependent, skewed, and fat-tailed dynamics that make risk a central concern for monetary policy. Accordingly, inflation risks are distributional and cannot be fully captured by mean-based models. We propose a flexible time-varying parameter distributional regression model that estimates the full conditional distribution of inflation, allowing macroeconomic drivers to have nonlinear and asymmetric effects across the distribution. Applied to U.S. inflation, the model captures major shifts in tail-risk probabilities. Analysis of risk drivers shows that deflationary pressures arise primarily from demand-side weakness and inflation persistence, whereas upside risks are driven mainly by supply-side shocks, particularly energy price inflation. Examining the impact of key drivers further reveals that the unemployment-inflation relationship weakens in the distributional tails. Energy price shocks, by contrast, have little effect on deflation risk but exhibit strongly time-varying and asymmetric effects on high-inflation risk.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Discontinuities: Estimation, Inference and Validity Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a formal econometric framework behind the newly developed difference-in-discontinuities design (DiDC). Despite its increasing use in applied research, there are currently limited studies of its properties. We formalize the theory behind the difference-in-discontinuity approach by stating the identification assumptions, proposing a nonparametric estimator, and deriving its asymptotic properties. We also provide comprehensive tests for one of the identification assumption of the DiDC and sensitivity analysis methods that allow researchers to evaluate the robustness of DiDC estimates under violations of the identifying assumptions. Monte Carlo simulation studies show that the estimators have desirable finite-sample properties. Finally, we revisit Grembi et al. (2016), which studies the effects of relaxing fiscal rules on public finance outcomes. Our results show that most of the qualitative takeaways of the original work are robust to time-varying confounding effects.</description>

      <title>Forecasting for monetary policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses three key themes in forecasting for monetary policy highlighted in the Bernanke (2024) review: the challenges in economic forecasting, the conditional nature of central bank forecasts, and the importance of forecast evaluation. In addition, a formal evaluation of the Bank of England's inflation forecasts indicates that, despite the large forecast errors in recent years, they were still accurate relative to common benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Potential Outcome Modeling and Estimation in DiD Designs with Staggered Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified model for both treated and untreated potential outcomes for Difference-in-Differences designs with multiple time periods and staggered treatment adoption that respects parallel trends and no anticipation. The model incorporates unobserved heterogeneity through sequence-specific random effects and covariate-dependent random intercepts, allowing for flexible baseline dynamics while preserving causal identification. The model lends itself to straightforward inference about group-specific, time-varying Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (ATTs). In contrast to existing methods, it is easy to regularize the ATT parameters in our framework. For Bayesian inference, prior information on the ATTs is incorporated through black-box training sample priors and, in small-sample settings, through thick-tailed t-priors that shrink ATTs of small magnitude toward zero. A hierarchical prior can be employed when ATTs are defined at sub-categories. A Bernstein-von Mises result justifies posterior inference for the treatment effects. To show that the model provides a common foundation for Bayesian and frequentist inference, we develop an iterated feasible GLS based estimation of the ATTs that is based on the updates in the Bayesian posterior sampling. The model and methodology are illustrated in an empirical study of the effects of minimum wage increases on teen employment in the U.S.</description>

      <title>The Identification Power of Combining Experimental and Observational Data for Distributional Treatment Effect Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12206v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the identification power gained by combining experimental data, in which treatment is randomized, with observational data, in which treatment is self-selected, for distributional treatment effect (DTE) parameters. While experimental data identify average treatment effects, many DTE parameters, such as the distribution of individual treatment effects, are only partially identified. We examine whether and how combining these two data sources tightens the identified set for such parameters. For broad classes of DTE parameters, we derive nonparametric sharp bounds under the combined data and clarify the mechanism through which data combination improves identification relative to using experimental data alone. Our analysis highlights that self-selection in observational data is a key source of identification power. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which the combined data shrink the identified set, showing that such shrinkage generally occurs unless selection-on-observables holds in the observational data. We also propose a linear programming approach to compute sharp bounds that can incorporate additional structural restrictions, such as positive dependence between potential outcomes and the generalized Roy selection model. An empirical application using data on negative campaign advertisements in the 2008 U.S. presidential election illustrates the practical relevance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Log-Marginals and Tweedie's Formula : When Is Bayes Possible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Tweedie's formula for the Compound Decision problem, we examine the theoretical foundations of empirical Bayes estimators that directly model the marginal density $m(y)$. Our main result shows that polynomial log-marginals of degree $k \ge 3 $ cannot arise from any valid prior distribution in exponential family models, while quadratic forms correspond exactly to Gaussian priors. This provides theoretical justification for why certain empirical Bayes decision rules, while practically useful, do not correspond to any formal Bayes procedures. We also strengthen the diagnostic by showing that a marginal is a Gaussian convolution only if it extends to a bounded solution of the heat equation in a neighborhood of the smoothing parameter, beyond the convexity of $c(y)=\tfrac12 y^2+\log m(y)$.</description>
