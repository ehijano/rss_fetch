      <title>Continuation and bifurcations of periodic orbits and symbolic dynamics in the Swift-Hohenberg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steady states of the Swift--Hohenberg equation are studied. For the associated four--dimensional ODE we prove that on the energy level $E=0$ two smooth branches of even periodic solutions are created through the saddle-node bifurcation. We also show that these orbits satisfy certain geometric properties, which implies that the system has positive topological entropy for an explicit and wide range of parameter values of the system.
  The proof is computer-assisted and it uses rigorous computation of bounds on certain Poincar\'e map and its higher order derivatives.</description>

      <title>On concentric fractal spheres and spiral shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dimension-theoretic properties of concentric topological spheres, which are fractal sets emerging both in pure and applied mathematics. We calculate the box dimension and Assouad spectrum of such collections, and use them to prove that fractal spheres cannot be shrunk into a point at a polynomial rate. We also apply these dimension estimates to quasiconformally classify certain spiral shells, a generalization of planar spirals in higher dimensions. This classification also provides a bi-H\"older map between shells, and constitutes an addition to a general programme of research proposed by J. Fraser.</description>

      <title>Geometric Markov partitions for pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms with prescribed combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on constructing and refining geometric Markov partitions for pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms that may contain spines. We introduce a systematic approach to constructing \emph{adapted Markov partitions} for these homeomorphisms. Our primary result is an algorithmic construction of \emph{adapted Markov partitions} for every generalized pseudo-Anosov map, starting from a single point. This algorithm is applied to the so-called \emph{first intersection points} of the homeomorphism, producing \emph{primitive Markov partitions} that behave well under iterations. We also prove that the set of \emph{primitive geometric types} of a given order is finite, providing a canonical tool for classifying pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms. We then construct new geometric Markov partitions from existing ones, maintaining control over their combinatorial properties and preserving their geometric types. The first geometric Markov partition we construct has a binary incidence matrix, which allows for the introduction of the sub-shift of finite type associated with any Markov partition's incidence matrix -- this is known as the \emph{binary refinement}. We also describe a process that cuts any Markov partition along stable and unstable segments prescribed by a finite set of periodic codes, referred to as the $s$ and $U$-boundary refinements. Finally, we present an algorithmic construction of a Markov partition where all periodic boundary points are located at the corners of the rectangles in the partition, called the \emph{corner refinement}. Each of these Markov partitions and their intrinsic combinatorial properties plays a crucial role in our algorithmic classification of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms up to topological conjugacy.</description>

      <title>Energy Transport in Random Perturbations of Mechanical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a mechanism for transport of energy in a mechanical system consisting of a pendulum and a rotator subject to a random perturbation. The perturbation that we consider is the product of a Hamiltonian vector field and a scalar, continuous, stationary Gaussian process with H\"older continuous realizations, scaled by a smallness parameter. We show that for almost every realization of the stochastic process, there is a distinguished set of times for which there exists a random normally hyperbolic invariant manifold with associated stable and unstable manifolds that intersect transversally, for all sufficiently small values of the smallness parameter. We derive the existence of orbits along which the energy changes over time by an amount proportional to the smallness parameter. This result is related to the Arnold diffusion problem for Hamiltonian systems, which we treat here in the random setting.</description>

      <title>Multislicing and effective equidistribution for random walks on some homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random walk on a homogeneous space $G/\Lambda$ where $G$ is $\mathrm{SO}(2,1)$ or $\mathrm{SO}(3,1)$ and $\Lambda$ is a lattice. The walk is driven by a probability measure $\mu$ on $G$ whose support generates a Zariski-dense subgroup. We show that for every starting point $x \in G/\Lambda$ which is not trapped in a finite $\mu$-invariant set, the $n$-step distribution $\mu^{*n}*\delta_{x}$ of the walk equidistributes toward the Haar measure. Moreover, under arithmetic assumptions on the pair $(\Lambda, \mu)$, we show the convergence occurs at an exponential rate, tempered by the obstructions that $x$ may be high in a cusp or close to a finite orbit.
  Our approach is substantially different from that of Benoist-Quint, whose equidistribution statements only hold in Ces\`aro average and are not quantitative, that of Bourgain-Furman-Lindenstrauss-Mozes concerning the torus case, and that of Lindenstrauss-Mohammadi-Wang and Yang about the analogous problem for unipotent flows. A key new feature of our proof is the use of a new phenomenon which we call multislicing. The latter is a generalization of the discretized projection theorems \`a la Bourgain and we believe it presents independent interest.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform Cocycles for Some Uniquely Ergodic Minimal Dynamical Systems on Connected Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we pay attention to a weaker version of Walters's question on the existence of non-uniform cocycles for uniquely ergodic minimal dynamical systems on non-degenerate connected spaces. We will classify such dynamical systems into three classes: not totally uniquely ergodic; totally uniquely ergodic but not topological weakly mixing; totally uniquely ergodic and topological weakly mixing. We will give an affirmative answer to such question for the first two classes. Also, we will show the existence of such dynamical systems in the first class with arbitrary topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Advances in Cislunar Periodic Solutions via Taylor Polynomial Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, novel approaches are developed to explore the dynamics of motion in periodic orbits near libration points in cislunar space using the Differential Algebra (DA) framework. The Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) models the motion, with initial states derived numerically via differential correction. Periodic orbit families are computed using the Pseudo-Arclength Continuation (PAC) method and fitted. Two newly developed polynomial regression models (PRMs) express initial states as functions of predefined parameters and are used in the DA framework to evaluate propagated states. The initial states, expressed via PRM, are propagated in the DA framework using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. The resultant polynomials of both PRM and DA are employed to develop a control law that shows significantly reduced control effort compared to the traditional tracking control law, demonstrating their potential for cislunar space applications, particularly those requiring computationally inexpensive low-energy transfers.</description>

      <title>How noise affects memory in linear recurrent networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of noise on memory in a linear recurrent network are theoretically investigated. Memory is characterized by its ability to store previous inputs in its instantaneous state of network, which receives a correlated or uncorrelated noise. Two major properties are revealed: First, the memory reduced by noise is uniquely determined by the noise's power spectral density (PSD). Second, the memory will not decrease regardless of noise intensity if the PSD is in a certain class of distribution (including power law). The results are verified using the human brain signals, showing good agreement.</description>

      <title>State-space models are accurate and efficient neural operators for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a promising alternative to classical methods for predicting dynamical systems, offering faster and more generalizable solutions. However, existing models, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, and neural operators, face challenges such as long-time integration, long-range dependencies, chaotic dynamics, and extrapolation, to name a few. To this end, this paper introduces state-space models implemented in Mamba for accurate and efficient dynamical system operator learning. Mamba addresses the limitations of existing architectures by dynamically capturing long-range dependencies and enhancing computational efficiency through reparameterization techniques. To extensively test Mamba and compare against another 11 baselines, we introduce several strict extrapolation testbeds that go beyond the standard interpolation benchmarks. We demonstrate Mamba's superior performance in both interpolation and challenging extrapolation tasks. Mamba consistently ranks among the top models while maintaining the lowest computational cost and exceptional extrapolation capabilities. Moreover, we demonstrate the good performance of Mamba for a real-world application in quantitative systems pharmacology for assessing the efficacy of drugs in tumor growth under limited data scenarios. Taken together, our findings highlight Mamba's potential as a powerful tool for advancing scientific machine learning in dynamical systems modeling.

Abstract: In this article, we introduce Lyapunov-type results to investigate the stability of the trivial solution of a Stieltjes dynamical system. We utilize prolongation results to establish the global existence of the maximal solution. Using Lyapunov's second method, we establish results of (uniform) stability and (uniform) asymptotic stability by employing a Lyapunov function. Additionally, we present examples and real-life applications to study asymptotic stability of equilibria in two population dynamics models.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on studying a model for molecular motors responsible for the bending of the axoneme in the flagella of microorganisms. The model is a coupled system of partial differential equations inspired by J\"ulicher et al. or Camalet, incorporating two rows of molecular motors between microtubules filaments. Existence and uniqueness of a solution is proved, together with the presence of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Additionally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results. A brief study on the generalization to N-rows is also included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider polynomial correspondences $f (x, y)$ in $\mathbb{C}[x, y]$ of degree $d \ge 2$ in both the variables and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions in order that the equation $f (x, y) = 0$ can be expressed as $\phi (x) = \psi (y)$, where $\phi$ and $\psi$ are fractional degree $d$ rational maps in the Riemann sphere. In the absence of involutions that played a vital role towards characterising quadratic correspondences ($d = 2$), we employ certain elementary ideas from theory of equations and matrices to achieve our results. We further explore certain symmetry conditions on the matrix of coefficients of correspondences that satisfy the above factorisation. We conclude this short note with a few examples.</description>

Abstract: Structural stability of holomorphic functions has been the subject of much research in the last fifty years. Due to various technicalities, however, most of that work has focused on so-called finite-type functions (functions whose set of singular values has finite cardinality). Recent developments in the field go beyond this setting. In this paper we extend Eremenko and Lyubich's result on natural families of entire maps to the case where the set of singular values is not the entire complex plane, showing under this assumption that the set $M_f$ of entire functions quasiconformally equivalent to $f$ admits the structure of a complex manifold (of possibly infinite dimension). Moreover, we will consider functions with wandering domains -- another hot topic of research in complex dynamics. Given an entire function $f$ with a simply connected wandering domain $U$, we construct an analogue of the multiplier of a periodic orbit, called a distortion sequence, and show that, under some hypotheses, the distortion sequence moves analytically as $f$ moves within appropriate parameter families.</description>

      <title>Anticipating critical transitions in multidimensional systems driven by time- and state-dependent noise</title>

Abstract: Anticipating bifurcation-induced transitions in dynamical systems has gained relevance in various fields of the natural, social, and economic sciences. Before the annihilation of a system's equilibrium point by means of a bifurcation, the system's internal feedbacks that stabilize the initial state weaken and eventually vanish, a process referred to as critical slowing down (CSD). In one-dimensional systems, this motivates the use of variance and lag-1 autocorrelation as indicators of CSD. However, the applicability of variance is limited to time- and state-independent driving noise, strongly constraining the generality of this CSD indicator. In multidimensional systems, the use of these indicators is often preceded by a dimension reduction in order to obtain a one-dimensional time series. Many common techniques for such an extraction of a one-dimensional time series generally incur the risk of missing CSD in practice. Here, we propose a data-driven approach based on estimating a multidimensional Langevin equation to detect local stability changes and anticipate bifurcation-induced transitions in systems with generally time- and state-dependent noise. Our approach substantially generalizes the conditions under which CSD can reliably be detected, as demonstrated in a suite of examples. In contrast to existing approaches, changes in deterministic dynamics can be clearly discriminated from changes in the driving noise using our method. This substantially reduces the risk of false or missed alarms of conventional CSD indicators in settings with time-dependent or multiplicative noise. In multidimensional systems, our method can greatly advance the understanding of the coupling between system components and can avoid risks of missing CSD due to dimension reduction, which existing approaches suffer from.</description>

      <title>Construct accurate multi-continuum micromorphic homogenisations in multi-D space-time with computer algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homogenisation empowers the efficient macroscale system level prediction of physical problems with intricate microscale structures. Here we develop an innovative powerful, rigorous and flexible framework for asymptotic homogenisation of dynamics at the finite scale separation of real physics, with proven results underpinned by modern dynamical systems theory. The novel systematic approach removes most of the usual assumptions, whether implicit or explicit, of other methodologies. By no longer assuming averages the methodology constructs so-called multi-continuum or micromorphic homogenisations systematically based upon the microscale physics. The developed framework and approach enables a user to straightforwardly choose and create such homogenisations with clear physical and theoretical support, and of highly controllable accuracy and fidelity.</description>

      <title>Solution to the iterative differential equation $-\gamma g' = g^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a Picard-like operator $T$, we prove that the iterative differential equation $-\gamma g' = g^{-1}$ with parameter $\gamma&gt;0$ has a solution $g=h\colon[0,1]\to[0,1]$ for only one value $\gamma=\kappa\approx0.278877$, and that this solution $h$ is unique. As an even stronger result, we exhibit $h$ as the global limit of the operator $T$.</description>

      <title>Indistinguishability of cells for the ideal Poisson Voronoi tessellation: an answer and a question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we resolve a question of D'Achille, Curien, Enriquez, Lyons, and \"Unel by showing that the cells of the ideal Poisson Voronoi tessellation are indistinguishable. This follows from an application of the Howe-Moore theorem and a theorem of Meyerovitch about the nonexistence of thinnings of the Poisson point process. We also give an alternative proof of Meyerovitch's theorem.</description>
