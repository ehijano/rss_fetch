      <title>The Drude weight of a flatband metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flatband systems form a new class of materials with seemingly contradictory properties that challenge our understanding of their transport phenomenology. On the one hand, the large density of states at the chemical potential suggests a metallic behavior. On the other hand, all states have a vanishing velocity that essentially prevents transport. Furthermore, electronic correlation effects are intrinsically strong as the interaction energy scale naturally exceeds the narrow or vanishing bandwidth. In this work, we determine the conductivity of flatband systems by investigating their Drude weight, thereby avoiding issues associated with a particular choice of relaxation broadening. Our study is a controlled analytic treatment performed at temperatures above the bandwidth and the interaction strength and below the bandgap, a new distinctive transport regime for flat bands. We find that the Drude weight has geometric contributions that are unique to a perfectly flat band and are beyond the commonly studied quantum metric and Berry curvature. We expect that these novel contributions are essential in determining flatband response functions and shed new light on the stability of flatband systems.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Spin Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices present a unique opportunity to venture beyond the conventional paradigm of crystalline many-body physics and explore correlated phenomena in negatively curved space. As a theoretical benchmark for such investigations, we extend Kitaev's spin-1/2 honeycomb model to hyperbolic lattices and exploit their non-Euclidean space-group symmetries to solve the model exactly. We elucidate the ground-state phase diagram on the $\{8,3\}$ lattice and find a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid with Abelian anyons, a gapped chiral spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and chiral edge states, and a compressible spin liquid with low-energy density of states dominated by non-Abelian Bloch states of Majorana fermions.</description>

      <title>The algebraic spin liquid in the SU(6) Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the Dirac spin liquid (DSL) as a candidate for the ground state of the Mott insulating phase of fermions with six flavors on the Kagome lattice, particularly focusing on realizations using $^{173}$Yb atoms in optical lattices.
  Using mean-field theory and variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulations, we confirm the stability of the DSL against local perturbations of the Dirac spin liquid ansatz within a 12-site unit cell and against small second-nearest neighbor and ring exchange interactions.
  To characterize the DSL, we calculate the static and dynamic structure factor of the Gutzwiller projected wavefunction and compare it with mean-field calculations.
  The static structure factor shows triangular-shaped plateaus around the $K$ points in the extended Brillouin zone, with small peaks at the corners of these plateaus.
  The dynamical structure factor consists of a gapless continuum of fractionalized excitations.
  Our study also presents several complementary results, including bounds for the ground state energy, methods for calculating three-site ring exchange expectations in the projective mean field, the boundary of ferromagnetic states, and the non-topological nature of flat bands in the DSL band structure.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of modern measurement techniques, the energy resolution of $1 \, meV$ can now be easily obtained. Generally, the driving mechanisms of the physical, chemical or biological processes of the matters or the living organisms on Earth at about $1 \, meV$ energy scale are assumed to stem from the fundamental microscopic Coulomb interaction and its various reduced ones as well as the relativistic corrections. Examples are such as the electron-phonon interaction, the Heisenberg exchange spin interaction, the superexchange interaction, the van der Waals interaction, the spin-orbit interaction, the Breit interaction, {\it etc}. In this article, by using a path integral approach on a non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics theory, we show that there is another fundamental microscopic interaction at this energy scale, the microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction. It has time-dependent dynamical feature and can be the driving interaction of the physical or chemical properties of the matters or the biological activity of the living organisms on Earth at about $1\, meV$ energy scale. A new Amp\`ere-type exchange spin interaction is also found with a magnitude about $10^{-4}$ of the well-known Coulomb interaction relevant Heisenberg exchange spin interaction.</description>

      <title>Novel low-energy peak in the one-particle spectral function of the electron gas: Breakdown of the Landau's hypothesis as to the Fermi liquids in simple metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a nonperturbative scheme to determine the self-energy \Sigma(k,iw_n) with automatically satisfying the Ward identity and the total momentum conservation law, a fully self-consistent calculation is done in the electron gas at various temperatures T to obtain G(k,iw_n) the one-particle Green's function with fulfilling all known conservation laws, sum rules, and correct asymptotic behaviors; here, T is taken unprecedentedly low, namely, T/E_F down to 10^{-4} with E_F the Fermi energy, and tiny mesh as small as 10^{-4}k_F is chosen near the Fermi surface in k space with k_F the Fermi momentum. By analytically continuing G(k,iw_n) to the retarded function G^R(k,w), we find a novel low-energy peak, in addition to the quasiparticle (QP) peak and one- and two-plasmon high-energy satellites, in the spectral function A(k,w)[= -Im G^R(k,w)/\pi] for T less than about 10^{-3}E_F in the simple-metal density region (2&lt;r_s&lt;6 with r_s the dimensionless density parameter). This new peak is attributed to the effect of excitonic attraction on \Sigma(k,iw_n) arising from multiple excitations of tightly bound electron-hole pairs in the polarization function \Pi(q,iw_q) for |q| equal to about 2k_F and |w_q| &lt;&lt; E_F and thus it is dubbed ``excitron''. Although this excitron peak height is only about a one-hundredth of that of QP, its excitation energy is about a half of that of QP for |k| equal to about k_F, seemingly in contradiction to the Landau's hypothesis as to the one-to-one correspondence of low-energy excitations between a free Fermi gas and an interacting normal Fermi liquid. As for the QP properties, our results of both the effective mass m^* and the renormalization factor z^* are in good agreement with those provided by recent quantum Monte Carlo simulations and available experiments.</description>

      <title>Predicting nonequilibrium Green's function dynamics and photoemission spectra via nonlinear integral operator learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems is an important research topic in a wide range of fields across condensed matter physics, quantum optics, and high-energy physics. However, numerical studies of large-scale nonequilibrium phenomena in realistic materials face serious challenges due to intrinsic high-dimensionality of quantum many-body problems. The nonequilibrium properties of many-body systems can be described by the dynamics of the Green's function of the system, whose time evolution is given by a high-dimensional system of integro-differential equations, known as the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBEs). The time-convolution term in KBEs, which needs to be recalculated at each time step, makes it difficult to perform long-time simulations. In this paper, we develop an operator-learning framework based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to address this challenge. The proposed framework utilizes RNNs to learn the nonlinear mapping between Green's functions and convolution integrals in KBEs. By using the learned operators as a surrogate model in the KBE solver, we obtain a general machine-learning scheme for predicting the dynamics of nonequilibrium Green's functions. This new methodology reduces the temporal computational complexity from $O(N_t^3)$ to $O(N_t)$, where $N_t$ is the total time steps taken in a simulation, thereby making it possible to study large many-body problems which are currently infeasible with conventional KBE solvers. Through different numerical examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the operator-learning based approach in providing accurate predictions of physical observables such as the reduced density matrix and time-resolved photoemission spectra. Moreover, our framework exhibits clear numerical convergence and can be easily parallelized, thereby facilitating many possible further developments and applications.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Lack of Ferromagnetic Fluctuations Despite Ferromagnetic Substrate, with Commensurate Antiferromagnetic Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations in the longitudinal and transversal spin susceptibilities of a square lattice. The inclusion of both first and second neighbour hopping terms, along with exchange coupling, induces anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations over a finite range of fillings in both longitudinal and transversal static spin susceptibilities. The exchange field causes a splitting of the energy bands, resulting in two Van Hove singularities where the Fermi surface topology changes as the filling passes through these points. In the absence of on-site Hubbard interaction, we observe incommensurate anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations between the two Van Hove fillings. Beyond the second Van Hove singularity at $ n=1.03 $, commensurate anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations dominate in both longitudinal and transversal spin susceptibilities. When incorporating a finite Hubbard interaction strength, $ U $, we find that the commensurate anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations are preserved in both longitudinal and transversal dressed spin susceptibilities. However anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations vanish beyond a critical value of the Hubbard coupling strength, $ U_{c} $. Despite the exchange field can be induced by a ferromagnetic substrate, we do not observe any ferromagnetic fluctuations in the system.</description>

      <title>Magnetism and field-induced effects in the S = 5/2 honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet FeP3SiO11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magnets based on honeycomb lattices with low-coordination number offer a viable ground to realize exotic emergent quantum excitations and phenomena arising from the interplay between competing magnetic interactions, spin correlations, and spatial anisotropy. However, unlike their low-spin analogues, high-spin honeycomb lattice antiferromagnets have remained comparatively less explored in the context of capturing the classical analogs of quantum phenomena. Herein, we report the crystal structure, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and electron spin resonance (ESR), complemented by ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations on polycrystalline samples of FeP3SiO11 wherein the Fe3+ ions decorate a nearly-perfect S = 5/2 honeycomb lattice without any site disorder among constituent atoms. Above 150 K, an antiferromagnetic Weiss temperature of - 12 K is observed consistent with DFT calculations, which suggest the presence of strong intra-planar nearest-neighbor and weaker inter-planar further nearest-neighbor exchange interactions. An anomaly at TN = 3.5 K in specific heat and magnetic susceptibility reveals the presence of a long-range ordered ground state in zero field. Above TN, ESR evidences short-range spin correlations and unsaturated magnetic entropy, while below TN unconventional excitations are seen via power-law specific heat. A spin-flop transition is observed in an applied field of Hc1 = 0.2 T. At higher applied fields, TN is gradually suppressed down to zero at Hc2 = 5.6 T with a 2D critical exponent 0.255. Above Hc2, a broad maximum in specific heat due to gapped magnon excitations indicates the emergence of an interesting nearly-polarized state dressed by a disordered state in the honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet FeP3SiO11.</description>

      <title>Abnormal planar Hall effect in quasi-1D Kondo chain CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$ and its implications for hybridization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process how heavy-electron state is established in Kondo-lattice compounds remains an unsolved issue. Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy imply an intermediate regime with hybridization fluctuations prior to the establishment of Kondo coherence, which appears at odds with traditional transport measurements. Extensive experimental works are highly demanded to both reconcile this dichotomy and delineate the intrinsic features in this special regime. Here, on the example of quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we investigated angular dependent magnetotransport properties by planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements. Upon cooling from $T_K^{on}$ (an onset of incoherent Kondo scattering ) to below $T^*$ (where coherent $c$-$f$ hybridization comes into play), the two-fold symmetrical pattern of planar Hall effect changes sign gradually (i.e. $180^\circ$ phase shift); most strikingly, as a crossover, additional oscillations appear and persist until the heavy-electron state is stabilized below $T^*$. These results provide new insights for the regime of hybridization dynamics which might be deemed as a precursor state of the heavy-electron state.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy is a key feature of rare earth materials from permanent magnets to heavy fermions. We explore the complex interplay of Kondo physics and anisotropy in a minimal impurity model using numerical renormalization group. While anisotropy suppresses Kondo physics, Kondo physics enhances the anisotropy. Importantly, we find distinct renormalization of the magnetic anisotropy measured via dynamical spin response (inelastic neutron scattering) versus electronic excitations in the impurity spectral function (resonant inelastic x-rays and scanning tunneling spectroscopy). The two measurement types have different responses and dependences on the temperature and Kondo scales.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian dynamics of Cooper pair splitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a non-Hermitian model for Cooper pair splitters, in which the process of electron tunneling into electrodes is characterized by non-Hermitian terms. We find that across a broad range of parameters, the energy levels consistently remain real, and coalescing states are always present. The Coulomb repulsion between electrons in a quantum dot affects the order of the coalescing states. This gives rise to two distinct dynamic behaviors: (i) when the initial state is an empty state, the final state supports a nonzero electron-escaping rate; (ii) the electron-escaping rate is zero for a single-electron initial state. In the former case, our exact solutions reveal that the average electron-escaping rate vanishes along a set of hyperbolic curves in the plane of the chemical potentials of the two quantum dots. The stability of the results in the presence of disordered perturbation is also investigated. Our findings pave the way for investigating Cooper pair splitters within the framework of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: The layered triangular lattice owing to $1:2$ order of $B$ and $B'$ sites in the triple perovskite $A_3 B B'_2$O$_9$ family provides an enticing domain for exploring the complex phenomena of quantum spin liquids (QSLs). We report a comprehensive investigation of the ground state properties of Sr$_3$CuTa$_2$O$_9$ that belongs to the above family, by employing magnetization, specific heat, and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) experiments down to the lowest temperature of 0.1~K. Analysis of the magnetic susceptibility indicates that the spin-lattice is a nearly isotropic $S = 1/2$ triangular lattice. We illustrate the observation of a gapless QSL, in which conventional spin ordering or freezing effects are absent, even at temperatures more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the exchange energy ($J_{\rm CW}/k_{\rm B} \simeq -5.04$~K). Magnetic specific heat in zero-field follows a power law, $C_{\rm m} \sim T^\eta$, below 1.2~K with $\eta \approx 2/3$, which is consistent with a theoretical proposal of the presence of spinon Fermi surface. Below 1.2~K, the $\mu$SR relaxation rate shows no temperature dependence, suggesting persistent spin dynamics as expected for a QSL state. Delving deeper, we also analyze longitudinal field $\mu$SR spectra revealing strong dynamical correlations in the spin-disordered ground state. All of these highlight the characteristics of spin entanglement in the QSL state.</description>

      <title>Anomalous resistivity upturn in Co intercalated TaS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intercalation of magnetic atoms into the van der Waals gaps of layered transition metal dichalcogenides offers an excellent platform to produce exotic physical properties. Here, we report a detailed study of magnetic and electrical transport properties of Co$_{0.28}$TaS$_2$. The temperature dependent resistivity measurements display anomalous upturn below 11 K, which persists in presence of magnetic field even up to 14 T. In the low temperature region, the resistivity upturn exhibits a unique $T^{1/2}$ scaling behavior, which remains unchanged when an external magnetic field is applied. The $T^{1/2}$ dependence of resistivity upturn is the hallmark of non-Fermi liquid state in orbital two-channel Kondo effect(2CK). This anomalous resistivity upturn in Co$_{0.28}$TaS$_2$ can be attributed to the orbital two-channel Kondo mechanism.</description>

      <title>Quantum Skyrmion Liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological magnetic textures, mostly treated classically, studied extensively due to their potential spintronics applications due to their topological stability. However, it remains unclear what physical phenomena differentiate a classical from a quantum skyrmion. We present numerical evidence for the existence of a quantum skyrmion liquid (SkL) phase in quasi-one-dimensional lattices which has no classical counterpart. The transition from a conventional quantum skyrmion crystal (SkX) to a field-polarized phase (FP) is found to be of second order while the analogous classical transition near zero temperature is first-order due to a missing SkL phase. As an indicator of the quantum mechanical origin of the SkL phase, we find concentrated entanglement (indicated by the concurrence) around the skyrmion center, which we attribute to the uncertainty in the skyrmion position resulting from the non-commutativity of the skyrmion coordinate operators. The latter also gives rise to a nontrivial kinetic energy in the presence of an atomic lattice. The SkL phase emerges when the kinetic energy dominates over the skyrmion-skyrmion interaction energy. It is tied to the breaking of discrete translational invariance of the skyrmion crystal and occurs when the skyrmion radius is comparable with the size of the magnetic unit cell. In contrast to the long-range order present in the SkX phase, spin-spin correlations in the SkL phase exponentially decay with distance, indicating the fluid-like behavior of uncorrelated skyrmions. The emergence of kinetic energy-induced quantum SkL phase serves as a strong indication of the possible Bose-Einstein condensation of skyrmions in higher-dimensional systems. Our findings are effectively explained by microscopic theories like collective coordinate formalism and trial wave functions, effectively enhancing our understanding of the numerical findings.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and nematic order of Bose-Fermi mixtures in moir\'e superlattices of 2D semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic orders in a mixture of Boson (exciton) and Fermion (electron or hole) trapped in transition-metal dichalcogenides moir\'e superlattices. A sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interaction is found between a carrier and an interlayer exciton trapped at different high symmetry points of the moir\'e supercell. This interaction at a distance much shorter than the carrier-carrier separation dominates the magnetic order in the Bose-Fermi mixture, where the carrier sublattice develops ferromagnetism opposite to that in the exciton sublattice. We demonstrate the possibility of increasing the Curie temperature of moir\'e carriers through electrical tuning of the exciton density in the ground state. In a trilayer moir\'e system with a p-n-p type band alignment, the exciton-carrier interplay can establish a layered antiferromagnetism for holes confined in the two outer layers. We further reveal a spontaneous nematic order in the Bose-Fermi mixture, arising from the interference between the Coulomb interaction and p-wave interlayer tunneling dictated by the stacking registry.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which are the set of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we have set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and chaos in deformed SYK models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently been proposed as a quantum probe of chaos. The Krylov exponent characterising the exponential growth of Krylov complexity is conjectured to upper-bound the Lyapunov exponent. We compute the Krylov and the Lyapunov exponents in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and in some of its deformations. We do this analysis both at infinite and finite temperatures, in models where the number of fermionic interactions is both finite and infinite. We consider deformations that interpolate between two regions of near-maximal chaos and deformations that become nearly-integrable at low temperatures. In all cases, we find that the Krylov exponent upper-bounds the Lyapunov one. However, we find that while the Lyapunov exponent can have non-monotonic behaviour as a function of temperature, in all studied examples the Krylov exponent behaves monotonically. For instance, we find models where the Lyapunov exponent goes to zero at low temperatures, while the Krylov exponent saturates to its maximal bound. We speculate on the possibility that this monotonicity might be a generic feature of the Krylov exponent in quantum systems evolving under unitary evolution.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-broken metallic orders in spin-orbit-coupled Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore Bernal bilayer graphene in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions, short-range Hund's coupling, and proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling using self-consistent Hartree-Fock simulations. We show that the interplay between these three ingredients produces an intricate phase diagram comprising a multitude of symmetry-broken metallic states tunable via doping and applied displacement field. In particular, we find intervalley coherent and spin-canted ground states that may hold the key to understanding spin-orbit-enabled superconductivity observed in this platform. We also investigate various phase transitions where a continuous $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry is broken to ascertain the possible role of critical fluctuations on pairing.</description>

      <title>Inferior interfacial superconductivity in 1 UC FeSe/SrVO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ with screened interfacial electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer FeSe/TiO$_x$ and FeSe/FeO$_x$ interfaces exhibit significant superconductivity enhancement compared to bulk FeSe, with interfacial electron-phonon coupling (EPC) playing a crucial role. However, the reduced dimensionality in monolayer FeSe, which may drive superconducting fluctuations, complicates the understanding of the enhancement mechanisms. Here we construct a new superconducting interface: monolayer FeSe/SrVO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, in which the itinerant electrons of highly metallic SrVO$_3$ films can screen all the high-energy Fuchs-Kliewer phonons, including those of SrTiO$_3$, making it the first FeSe/oxide system with screened interfacial EPC while maintaining the monolayer FeSe thickness. Despite comparable doping levels, the heavily electron-doped monolayer FeSe/SrVO$_3$ exhibits a lower pairing temperature ($T_\mathrm{g}$ $\sim$ 48 K) than FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ and FeSe/LaFeO$_3$. Our findings disentangle the contributions of interfacial EPC from dimensionality on enhancing $T_\mathrm{g}$ in FeSe/oxide interfaces, underscoring the importance of interfacial EPC in $T_\mathrm{g}$ enhancement. This FeSe/VO$_x$ interface also provides a platform for studying the interfacial superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Toward a first-principles theory of rare-earth ions in crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT), including its extensions designed to treat strongly correlated localized electron systems such as DFT+$U$ and DFT+dynamical mean field theory, has proven exceedingly useful in studying the magnetic properties of solids. However, materials with rare earths ($R$) have remained a notable exception. The most vital rare-earth magnetic properties, such as magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MA), have been notoriously elusive due to the ubiquitous self-interaction error present in nearly all available DFT flavors. In this work, we show explicitly how the orbital dependence of self-interaction error may contradict Hund's rules and plague MA calculations, and how analyzing DFT metastable states that respect Hund's rules can alleviate the problem. We systematically investigate and discuss several rare-earth-containing families, $R$Co$_5$, $R_2$Fe$_{14}$B, $R$Fe$_{12}$, and $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$, to benchmark the MA calculations in DFT+$U$. For all compounds we investigated, we found that our methodology reproduces the magnetic easy-axis, easy-plane, and non-trivial easy-cone anisotropies in full agreement with low-temperature experimental measurements. Besides the fully-numerical ab initio approach, we further illustrate an efficient semi-analytical perturbation method that treats the crystal field as a perturbation in the limit of large spin-orbit coupling. This approach evaluates the rare-earth anisotropy by assessing the dependence of crystal-field energy on spin-quantization axis rotation using $4f$ crystal-field levels obtained from non-spin-orbit calculations. Our analytical method provides a quantitative microscopic understanding of the factors that control MA and can be used for predicting new high-MA materials.</description>

Abstract: We propose a simple model of a two-dimensional ``locally smectic superconductor'' that exhibits power-law non-linear I-V characteristics with different powers for current applied in two orthogonal directions. We discuss the potential relevance of this model to recent experimental findings on interfacial superconductivity in EuO/KTaO$_3$(110) (Nat. Phys. 20, 957 (2024)), where the apparent critical temperature ($T_c$) has been shown experimentally to depend on the current direction.</description>

      <title>Signature of Orbital Driven Finite Momentum Pairing in a 3D Ising Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finite momentum superconducting pairing states (FMPs), where Cooper pairs carry non-zero momentum, are believed to give rise to exotic physical phenomena including the pseudogap phase of cuprate high-Tc superconductors and Majorana fermions in topological superconductivity. FMPs can emerge in intertwined electronic liquids with strong spin-spin interactions or be induced by lifting the spin degeneracy under magnetic field as originally proposed by Fulde-Ferrell and Larkin-Ovchinnikov. In quantum materials with strong Ising-type spin-orbit coupling, such as the 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the spin degree of freedom is frozen enabling novel orbital driven FMPs via magnetoelectric effect. While evidence of orbital driven FMPs has been revealed in bilayer TMDs, its realization in 3D bulk materials remains an unresolved challenge. Here we report experimental signatures of FMP in a locally noncentrosymmetric bulk superconductor 4Hb-TaS2. Using hard X-ray diffraction and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal unusual 2D chiral charge density wave (CDW) and weak interlayer hopping in 4Hb-TaS2. Below the superconducting transition temperature, the upper critical field, Hc2, linearly increases via decreasing temperature, and well exceeds the Pauli limit, thus establishing the dominant orbital pair-breaking mechanism. Remarkably, we discover a field-induced superconductivity-to-superconductivity transition that breaks continuous rotational symmetry of the s-wave uniform pairing in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory down to the six-fold rotation symmetry. Combining with a Ginzburg-Landau free energy analysis that incorporates magnetoelectric effect, our observations provide strong evidence of orbital driven FMP in the 3D quantum heterostructure 4Hb-TaS2.</description>

Abstract: It is pointed, that the $16\times16$ Hamiltonian density matrix, corresponding to XX spin chain in a staggered magnetic field, satisfies the Reshetikhin condition as well, as the two higher ones. All of them are necessary for the existence of the corresponding $R$-matrix. At the special imaginary value of the staggered field, the $R$-matrix is obtained explicitly. It is shown that the corresponding Hamiltonian has purely imaginary spectrum.</description>

      <title>OnionVQE Optimization Strategy for Ground State Preparation on NISQ Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising and widely used algorithms for exploiting the capabilities of current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. However, VQE algorithms suffer from a plethora of issues, such as barren plateaus, local minima, quantum hardware noise, and limited qubit connectivity, thus posing challenges for their successful deployment on hardware and simulators. In this work, we propose a VQE optimization strategy that builds upon recent advances in the literature, and exhibits very shallow circuit depths when applied to the specific system of interest, namely a model Hamiltonian representing a cuprate superconductor. These features make our approach a favorable candidate for generating good ground state approximations on current NISQ devices. Our findings illustrate the potential of VQE algorithmic development for leveraging the full capabilities of NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Superfluid transition temperature of bond bipolarons with Coulomb interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing an exactly sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo method, we explore the influence of long-range Coulomb interaction on the superfluid transition temperature of bipolarons in two dimensions. The model studied here is the bond Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with phonon-modulated electron hopping. Previously, in the absence of long-range Coulomb interaction, this model demonstrated the emergence of small-size, light-mass bipolarons that undergo a superfluid transition at high values of the transition temperature $T_c$ [Physical Review X 13, 011010, (2023)]. Our findings indicate that even with the inclusion of long-range Coulomb interaction, $T_c$ remains substantially high, even in the deep adiabatic regime where the phonon frequency is $\omega/t = 0.5$ and the Coulomb interaction $V = U/10$. This result suggests a physical mechanism for superconductivity in the low-density regime, which could hold relevance for ongoing experiments on dilute superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat band moir\'e graphene systems have emerged as a quintessential platform to investigate correlated phases of matter. A plethora of interaction-driven ground states have been proposed, and yet despite extensive experimental effort, there has been little direct evidence that distinguishes between the various phases, in particular near charge neutrality point. Here, we use a nanoscale scanning superconducting quantum interference device to image the local thermodynamic quantum oscillations in alternating-twist trilayer graphene at magnetic fields as low as 56 mT, which reveal ultrafine details of the density of states and of the renormalization of the single-particle band structure by Coulomb interactions. We find that the charging self-energy due to occupied electronic states, is critical in explaining the high carrier density physics. At half-filling of the conduction flat band, we observe a Stoner-like symmetry breaking, suggesting that it is the most robust mechanism in the hierarchy of phase transitions. On approaching charge neutrality, where the charging energy is negligible and exchange energy is dominant, we find the ground state to be a nematic semimetal which is favored over gapped states in the presence of heterostrain. In the revealed semimetallic phase, the flat-band Dirac cones migrate towards the mini-Brillouin zone center, spontaneously breaking the C_3 rotational symmetry. Our low-field local quantum oscillations technique presents an alluring avenue to explore the ground states of diverse strongly interacting van der Waals systems.</description>

      <title>From bordisms of three-manifolds to domain walls between topological orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a correspondence between spin three-manifolds and bosonic abelian topological orders. Let $N$ be a spin three-manifold. We can define a $(2+1)$-dimensional topological order $\mathrm{TO}_N$ as follows: its anyons are the torsion elements in $H_1(N)$, the braiding of anyons is given by the linking form, and their topological spins are given by the quadratic refinement of the linking form obtained from the spin structure. Under this correspondence, a surgery presentation of $N$ gives rise to a classical Chern--Simons description of the associated topological order $\mathrm{TO}_N$. We then extend the correspondence to spin bordisms between three-manifolds, and domain walls between topological orders. In particular, we construct a domain wall $\mathcal{D}_M$ between $\mathrm{TO}_N$ and $\mathrm{TO}_{N'}$, where $M$ is a spin bordism from $N$ to $N'$. This domain wall unfolds to a composition of a gapped boundary, obtained from anyon condensation, and a gapless Narain boundary CFT.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids and anyons, used to be subjects of condensed matter physics, now are realized in various platforms of qubits, offering unprecedented opportunities to investigate fundamental physics of many-body quantum entangled states. Qubits are inevitably exposed to environment effects such as decoherence and dissipation, which are believed to be detrimental to many-body entanglement. Here, we argue that unlike the common belief decoherence and dissipation can give rise to novel topological phenomena in quantum spin liquids. We study open quantum systems of the Kitaev spin liquid and the toric code via the Lindblad master equation approach. By using exact solutions and numerical approaches, we show the dynamical occurrence of anyon condensation by decoherence and dissipation, which results in a topological transition from the initial state spin liquid to the steady state spin liquid. The mechanism of the anyon condensation transition by the Lindblad dynamics is elucidated. We also provide an insight into the relationship between the Kitaev spin liquid and the toric code in the picture of anyon condensation. Our work suggests open quantum systems to be a new venue for topological phenomena of quantum spin liquids and anyons.</description>

      <title>Experimentally tunable QED in dipolar-octupolar quantum spin ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a readily achievable experimental setting where an external magnetic field is used to tune the emergent quantum electrodynamics (eQED) of dipolar-octupolar quantum spin ice (DO-QSI). In $U(1)_\pi$ DO-QSI -- the proposed ground state of QSI candidates Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ -- we show that the field can be used to control the emergent speed of light (and, consequently, the emergent fine structure constant). Depending on the field's alignment with the crystal, one may induce different speeds for the two polarizations of the emergent photons, in a fascinating analogue of the electro-optic Kerr effect. In $U(1)_0$ DO-QSI -- yet to be uncovered experimentally -- we find a number of unusual field-induced transitions, including a transition between $0$- and $\pi$-flux QSI phases, as well as phases with frustrated flux configurations. We discuss experimental signatures of these effects in the spinon excitation spectrum, which can be readily accessed for instance in inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Our proposal opens the gate to a plethora of experimentally accessible, engineerable eQED phenomena in the emergent universes of quantum spin ice.</description>

      <title>Disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models: Integrability and a precursor of chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems such as those with disorder or external kick terms. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</description>

      <title>Stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge density wave order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02322v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in a two-dimensional metal, at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of the Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the telltale signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Symmetry, Superposition and Fragmentation in Classical Spin Liquids: A General Framework and Applications to Square Kagome Magnets</title>

Abstract: Classical magnets exhibit exotic ground state properties such as spin liquids and fractionalization, promising a manifestation of superposition and projective symmetry construction in classical theory. While system-specific spin-ice or soft-spin models exist, a formal theory for general classical magnets remains elusive. Here, we introduce a generic symmetry group construction built from a vector field in a plaquette of classical spins, demonstrating how classical spins superpose in irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetry group. The corresponding probability amplitudes serve as order parameters and local spins as fragmented excitations. The formalism offers a many-body vector field representation of diverse ground states, including spin liquids and fragmented phases described as degenerate ensembles of irreps. We apply the theory to a frustrated square Kagome lattice, where spin-ice or soft spin rules are inapt, to describe spin liquids and fragmented phases, all validated through irreps ensembles and unbiased Monte Carlo simulation. Our generic theory sheds light on previously unknown aspects of spin-liquid phases and fragmentation and broadens their applications to other branches of field theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phases and Transitions in Spin Chains with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized symmetries often appear in the form of emergent symmetries in low energy effective descriptions of quantum many-body systems. Non-invertible symmetries are a particularly exotic class of generalized symmetries, in that they are implemented by transformations that do not form a group. Such symmetries appear generically in gapless states of quantum matter, constraining the low-energy dynamics. To provide a UV-complete description of such symmetries, it is useful to construct lattice models that respect these symmetries exactly. In this paper, we discuss two families of one-dimensional lattice Hamiltonians with finite on-site Hilbert spaces: one with (invertible) $S^{\,}_3$ symmetry and the other with non-invertible $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$ symmetry. Our models are largely analytically tractable and demonstrate all possible spontaneous symmetry breaking patterns of these symmetries. Moreover, we use numerical techniques to study the nature of continuous phase transitions between the different symmetry-breaking gapped phases associated with both symmetries. Both models have self-dual lines, where the models are enriched by so-called intrinsically non-invertible symmetries generated by Kramers-Wannier-like duality transformations. We provide explicit lattice operators that generate these non-invertible self-duality symmetries. We show that the enhanced symmetry at the self-dual lines is described by a 2+1D symmetry-topological-order (SymTO) of type $\mathrm{JK}^{\,}_4\boxtimes \overline{\mathrm{JK}}^{\,}_4$. The condensable algebras of the SymTO determine the allowed gapped and gapless states of the self-dual $S^{\,}_3$-symmetric and $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$-symmetric models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. In other words, in the same order of computational time, the previous methods could only get one EE data point, but we can obtain thousands (even more) of times EE data points along a physical parameter path. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relation between charge order, its quantum fluctuations and optical phonon modes in cuprate superconductors remains an unsolved problem. The exploration of these excitations is however complicated by the presence of twinned domains. Here, we use uniaxial strain in combination with ultra-high-resolution Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) at the oxygen K- and copper L3-edges to study the excitations stemming from the charge ordering wave vector in La1.875Sr0.125CuO4. By detwinning stripe ordering, we demonstrate that the optical phonon anomalies do not show any stripe anisotropy. The low-energy charge excitations also retain an in-plane four-fold symmetry. As such, we find that both phonon and charge excitations are decoupled entirely from the strength of static charge ordering. The almost isotropic character of charge excitations remains a possible source for the strange metal properties found in the normal state of cuprate superconductors.</description>

Abstract: We perform sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on a half-filled honeycomb lattice. In particular, we investigate the model's semi-metal (SM) to Kekul{\'e} Valence Bond Solid (KVBS) phase transition at zero and finite temperatures as a function of phonon energy and interaction strength. Using hybrid Monte Carlo sampling methods we can simulate the model near the adiabatic regime, allowing us to access regions of parameter space relevant to graphene. Our simulations suggest that the SM-KVBS transition is weakly first-order at all temperatures, with graphene situated close to the phase boundary in the SM region of the phase diagram. Our results highlight the important role bond-stretching phonon modes play in the formation of KVBS order in strained graphene-derived systems.</description>

Abstract: We study entanglement negativity for evaporating black hole based on the holographic model with defect brane. We introduce a defect extremal surface formula for entanglement negativity. Based on partial reduction, we show the equivalence between defect extremal surface formula and island formula for entanglement negativity in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$. Extending the study to the model of eternal black hole plus CFT bath, we find that black hole-black hole negativity decreases until vanishing, left black hole-left radiation negativity is always a constant, radiation-radiation negativity increases and then saturates at a time later than Page time. In all the time dependent cases, defect extremal surface formula agrees with island formula.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spin Squeezing from Finite Temperature Easy-plane Magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin squeezing is a form of entanglement that reshapes the quantum projection noise to improve measurement precision. Here, we provide numerical and analytic evidence for the following conjecture: any Hamiltonian exhibiting finite temperature, easy-plane ferromagnetism can be used to generate scalable spin squeezing, thereby enabling quantum-enhanced sensing. Our conjecture is guided by a connection between the quantum Fisher information of pure states and the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. We demonstrate that spin-squeezing exhibits a phase diagram with a sharp transition between scalable squeezing and non-squeezing. This transition coincides with the equilibrium phase boundary for XY order at a finite temperature. In the scalable squeezing phase, we predict a sensitivity scaling that lies in between the standard quantum limit and the scaling achieved in all-to-all coupled one-axis twisting models. A corollary of our conjecture is that short-ranged versions of two-axis twisting cannot yield scalable metrological gain. Our results provide insights into the landscape of Hamiltonians that can be used to generate metrologically useful quantum states.</description>

      <title>Critical behaviors of non-stabilizerness in quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness - commonly known as magic - measures the extent to which a quantum state deviates from stabilizer states and is a fundamental resource for achieving universal quantum computation. In this work, we investigate the behavior of non-stabilizerness around criticality in quantum spin chains. To quantify non-stabilizerness, we employ a monotone called mana, based on the negativity of the discrete Wigner function. This measure captures non-stabilizerness for both pure and mixed states. We introduce R\'enyi generalizations of mana, which are also measures of non-stabilizerness for pure states, and utilize it to compute mana in large quantum systems. We consider the three-state Potts model and its non-integrable extension and we provide strong evidence that the mutual mana exhibits universal logarithmic scaling with distance in conformal field theory, as is the case for entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of hydrodynamic theories for superfluids with dipole symmetry. Taking diffusion as an example, we systematically construct a hydrodynamic framework that incorporates an intrinsic dipole degree of freedom in analogy to spin density in micropolar (spinful) fluids. Subsequently, we study a dipole condensed phase and propose a model that captures the spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)$ charge. The theory explains the role of the inverse Higgs constraint for this class of theories, and naturally generates the gapless field. Next, we introduce finite temperature theory using the Hamiltonian formalism and study the hydrodynamics of ideal fracton superfluids. Finally, we postulate a derivative counting scheme and incorporate dissipative effects using the method of irreversible thermodynamics. We verify the consistency of the dispersion relations and argue that our counting is systematic.</description>

      <title>Operator Growth in Disordered Spin Chains: Indications for the Absence of Many-Body Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the growth of a local operator $A$ in one-dimensional many-body systems with Hamiltonian $H$ by calculating the $k$-fold commutator $[H,[H,[...,[H,A]]]]$. We derive general bounds for the operator norm of this commutator in free and interacting fermionic systems with and without disorder thus directly connecting the {\it operator growth hypothesis} with questions of localization. We show, in particular, that in a localized system the norm does grow at most exponentially and that the contributions of operators to the total norm are exponentially suppressed with their length. We support our general results by considering one specific example, the XXZ chain with random magnetic fields. We solve the operator spreading in the XX case without disorder exactly. For the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models we provide strict upper bounds. We support our results by symbolic calculations of the commutator up to high orders. For the XXX case with random magnetic fields, these symbolic calculations show a growth of the operator norm faster than exponential and consistent with the general bound for an ergodic system. Also, there is no exponential decay of the contribution of operators as function of their length. We conclude that there is no indication for a many-body localization transition. Finally, we also discuss the differences between the interacting and non-interacting cases when trying to perturbatively transform the microscopic to an effective Hamiltonian of local conserved charges by consecutive Schrieffer-Wolff transformations. We find that such an approach is not well-defined in the interacting case because the transformation generates $\sim 4^\ell$ terms connecting sites a distance $\ell$ apart which can overwhelm the exponential decay with $\ell$ of the amplitude of each individual term.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic generation in graphene under the application of a DC electric current: From perturbative to nonperturbative regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate high-harmonic generation (HHG) in honeycomb-lattice graphene models when subjected to a DC electric field. By integrating the quantum master equation with the Boltzmann equation, we develop a numerical method to compute laser-driven dynamics in many-electron lattice systems under DC electric current. The method enables us to treat both the weak-laser (perturbative) and intense-laser (nonperturbative) regimes in a unified way, accounting for the experimentally inevitable dissipation effects. From it, we obtain the HHG spectra and analyze their dependence on laser frequency, laser intensity, laser-field direction, and DC current strength. We show that the dynamical and static symmetries are partially broken by a DC current or staggered potential term, and such symmetry breakings drastically change the shape of the HHG spectra, especially in terms of the presence or absence of $(2n+1)$th-, $2n$th-, or $3n$th-order harmonics ($n\in \mathbb Z$). The laser intensity, frequency, and polarization are also shown to affect the shape of the HHG spectra. Our findings indicate that HHG spectra in conducting electron systems can be quantitatively or qualitatively controlled by tuning various external parameters, and DC electric current is used as such an efficient parameter.</description>

      <title>Theory of the inverse Faraday effect in dissipative Rashba electron systems: Floquet engineering perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), i.e., photo-induced magnetization, in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled electron systems irradiated by a circularly polarized light. The quantum master (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation enables us to accurately compute the laser driven dynamics, taking inevitable dissipation effects into account. To find the universal features of laser-driven magnetization and its dynamics, we comprehensively investigate (i) the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) driven by a continuous wave and (ii) ultrafast spin dynamics driven by short laser pulses. In the NESS (i), the laser-induced magnetization and its dependence of several parameters (laser frequency, laser field strength, temperature, dissipation strength, etc.) are shown to be in good agreement with the predictions from Floquet theory for dissipative systems in the high-frequency regime. In the case (ii), we focus on ferromagnetic metal states by introducing an effective magnetic field to the Rashba model as the mean field of electron-electron interaction. We find that a precession of the magnetic moment occurs due to the pulse-driven instantaneous magnetic field and the initial phase of the precession is controlled by changing the sign of light polarization. This is well consistent with the spin dynamics observed in experiments of laser-pulse-driven IFE. We discuss how the pulse-driven dynamics are captured by the Floquet theory. Our results %pave the way for computing provides a microscopic method to compute ultrafast dynamics in many electron systems irradiated by intense light.</description>

Abstract: We study superfluidlike spin transport facilitated by thermal diffusion of magnetic domain walls, where the positive and negative chiralities of domain walls act as opposite topological charges. The topological charge conservation leads to algebraic decay of spin current carried by domain walls, allowing for the transport of spin over extended distances. We demonstrate that the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can lead to nonreciprocity in spin flow, thus effectively realizing a spin ratchet. In one scenario, the nonreciprocity arises due to diode-like behavior where the nucleation of domain walls is governed by thermal activation for one direction of spin current and by viscous injection for the other direction of spin current. We confirm our predictions by micromagnetic simulations of domain walls in TmIG nanowire.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of emergent cluster states by measurement from symmetry-protected-topological states with large symmetry to subsystem cat state</title>

Abstract: We propose {\it measurement-producing hierarchy} emerging among correlated states by sequential subsystem projective measurements. We start from symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) cluster states with a large symmetry and apply sequential subsystem projective measurements to them and find that generalized cluster SPT states with a reduced symmetry appear in the subsystem of the unmeasured sites. That prescription finally produces Greenberger-Home-Zeilinger states with long-range order in the subsystem composed of periodic unmeasured sites of the original lattice. The symmetry-reduction hierarchical structure from a general large symmetric SPT cluster state is clearly captured by the measurement update flow in the efficient algorithm of stabilizer formalism. This approach is useful not only for the analytical search for the measured state but also for numerical simulation with a large system size. We also numerically verify the symmetry-reduction hierarchy by sequential subsystem projective measurements applied to large systems and large symmetric cluster SPT states.</description>

      <title>Superconducting properties and electronic structure of CuAl2-type transition-metal zirconide Fe1-xNixZr2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CuAl2-type transition-metal (Tr) zirconides are superconductor family, and the Tr-site element substitution largely modifies its transition temperature (Tc). Here, we synthesized polycrystalline samples of Fe1-xNixZr2 by arc melting. From magnetic susceptibility measurements, bulk superconductivity was observed for 0.4 &lt; x &lt; 0.8, and the highest Tc of 2.8 K was observed for x = 0.6. Specific heat measurements were also performed, bulk superconductivity was observed for 0.4 &lt; x &lt; 0.8, and the highest Tc of 2.6 K was observed for x = 0.6. The obtained superconductivity phase diagram exhibits dome-shaped trend, which is similar to unconventional superconductors, where magnetic fluctuations are essential for superconductivity. In addition, from the c/a lattice constant ratio analysis, we show the possible relationship between the suppression of bulk superconductivity in the Ni-rich compositions and a collapsed tetragonal transition.</description>
