      <title>A Detailed Analysis of a Magnetic Island Observed by WISPR on Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the identification and physical analysis of a possible magnetic island feature seen in white-light images observed by the Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) on board the Parker Solar Probe (Parker). The island is imaged by WISPR during Parker's second solar encounter on 2019 April 06, when Parker was ~38 solar radii from the Sun center. We report that the average velocity and acceleration of the feature are approximately 334 km s and -0.64 m s-2. The kinematics of the island feature, coupled with its direction of propagation, indicate that the island is likely entrained in the slow solar wind. The island is elliptical in shape with a density deficit in its center, suggesting the presence of a magnetic guide field. We argue that this feature is consistent with the formation of this island via reconnection in the current sheet of the streamer. The feature's aspect ratio (calculated as the ratio of its minor to major axis) evolves from an elliptical to a more circular shape that approximately doubles during its propagation through WISPR's field of view. The island is not distinct in other white-light observations from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) coronagraphs, suggesting that this is a comparatively faint heliospheric feature and that viewing perspective and WISPR's enhanced sensitivity are key to observing the magnetic island.</description>

      <title>The Solar and Geomagnetic Storms in May 2024: A Flash Data Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In May 2024, the scientific community observed intense solar eruptions that resulted in an extreme geomagnetic storm and auroral extension, highlighting the need to document and quantify these events. This study mainly focuses on their quantification. The source active region (AR 13664) evolved from 113 to 2761 millionths of the solar hemisphere between 4 May and 14 May 2024. AR 13664's magnetic free energy surpassed 1033 erg on 7 May 2024, triggering 12 X-class flares. Multiple interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) came out from this AR, accelerating solar energetic particles toward Earth. At least four ICMEs seemingly piled up to disturb the interplanetary space, according to the satellite data and interplanetary scintillation data. The shock arrival at 17:05 UT on 10 May 2024 significantly compressed the magnetosphere down to ~ 5.04 R_E, and triggered a deep Forbush decrease. GOES satellite data and ground-based neutron monitors confirmed a ground-level enhancement from 2 UT to 10 UT on 11 May 2024. The ICMEs induced extreme geomagnetic storms, peaking at a Dst index of -412 nT at 2 UT on 11 May 2024, marking the sixth-largest storm since 1957. The AE and AL indices showed extreme auroral extensions that located the AE/AL stations into the polar cap. We gathered auroral records at that time and reconstructed the equatorward boundary of the visual auroral oval to 29.8{\deg} invariant latitude. We compared naked-eye and camera auroral visibility, providing critical caveats on their difference. We also confirmed global enhancements of storm-enhanced density of the ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Intensity-sensitive quality assessment of extended sources in astronomical images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio astronomy studies the Universe by observing the radio emissions of celestial bodies. Different methods can be used to recover the sky brightness distribution (SBD), which describes the distribution of celestial sources from recorded data, with the output dependent on the method used. Image quality assessment (IQA) indexes can be used to compare the differences between restored SBDs produced by different image reconstruction techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of different techniques. However, reconstructed images (for the same SBD) can appear to be very similar, especially when observed by the human visual system (HVS). Hence current structural similarity methods, inspired by the HVS, are not effective. In the past, we have proposed two methods to assess point source images, where low amounts of concentrated information are present in larger regions of noise-like data. But for images that include extended source(s), the increase in complexity of the structure makes the IQA methods for point sources over-sensitive since the important objects cannot be described by isolated point sources. Therefore, in this article we propose augmented Low-Information Similarity Index (augLISI), an improved version of LISI, to assess images including extended source(s). Experiments have been carried out to illustrate how this new IQA method can help with the development and study of astronomical imaging techniques. Note that although we focus on radio astronomical images herein, these IQA methods are also applicable to other astronomical images, and imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>Pentagonal Photonic Crystal Mirrors: Scalable Lightsails with Enhanced Acceleration via Neural Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Starshot Breakthrough Initiative aims to send one-gram microchip probes to Alpha Centauri within 20 years, using gram-scale lightsails propelled by laser-based radiation pressure, reaching velocities nearing a fifth of light speed. This mission requires lightsail materials that challenge the fundamentals of nanotechnology, requiring innovations in optics, material science and structural engineering. Unlike the microchip payload, which must be minimized in every dimension, such lightsails need meter-scale dimensions with nanoscale thickness and billions of nanoscale holes to enhance reflectivity and reduce mass. Our study employs neural topology optimization, revealing a novel pentagonal lattice-based photonic crystal (PhC) reflector. The optimized designs shorten acceleration times, therefore lowering launch costs significantly. Crucially, these designs also enable lightsail material fabrication with orders-of-magnitude reduction in costs. We have fabricated a 60 x 60 mm$^2$, 200nm thick, single-layer reflector perforated with over a billion nanoscale features; the highest aspect-ratio nanophotonic element to date. We achieve this with nearly 9,000 times cost reduction per m$^2$. Starshot lightsails will have several stringent requirements but will ultimately be driven by costs to build at scale. Here we highlight challenges and possible solutions in developing lightsail materials - showcasing the potential of scaling nanophotonics for cost-effective next-generation space exploration.</description>

      <title>Ion Reflection by a Rippled Perpendicular Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use multi-spacecraft Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) observations to investigate electric fields and ion reflection at a non-stationary collisionless perpendicular plasma shock. We identify sub-proton scale (5-10 electron inertial lengths) large-amplitude normal electric fields, balanced by the Hall term ($\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}/ne$), as a transient feature of the shock ramp related to non-stationarity (rippling). The associated electrostatic potential, comparable to the energy of the incident solar wind protons, decelerates incident ions and reflects a significant fraction of protons, resulting in more efficient shock-drift acceleration than a stationary planar shock.</description>

      <title>Actuation system of the inertial sensor for high-precision space missions using torsion pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision space inertial sensors are imperative to Earth geodesy missions, gravitational wave observations and several fundamental physics experiments in space. In these missions, the residual acceleration noise of the test mass(TM) caused by the forces from inertial sensor components and environment is supposed to be kept below a certain level. As a number of forces contributing to residual acceleration are related to actuation system, developing a precise actuation system to exclude any erroneous force and obtain an ultra sensitive value for TM acceleration noise is necessary and essential. However, it is difficult to test the actuation system on ground. In this paper, a torsion pendulum is established to test the influence of actuation system on TM torque noise and a closed-loop control system combined torsion pendulum and parts of actuation modules is designed to assess the performance of actuation control algorithm. The experimental results show that the parameters in an actuation system will introduce additional torque noise and the maximum noise can reach as much as 10^{-13}Nm /Hz^{1/2} at 1 mHz. The stable tracking error for the closed-loop system is about 10^{-7}, indicating that the combination system achieves good tracking performance and robustness for TM rotation control in different conditions of inertial sensors.</description>

      <title>Understanding the effects of spacecraft trajectories through solar coronal mass ejection flux ropes using 3DCOREweb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of spacecraft positioning and trajectory on in situ signatures of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Employing the 3DCORE model, a 3D flux rope model that can generate in situ profiles for any given point in space and time, we conduct forward modeling to analyze such signatures for various latitudinal and longitudinal positions, with respect to the flux rope apex, at 0.8~au. Using this approach, we explore the appearance of the resulting in situ profiles for different flux rope types, with different handedness and inclination angles, for both high and low twist CMEs. Our findings reveal that CMEs exhibit distinct differences in signatures between apex hits and flank encounters, with the latter displaying elongated profiles with reduced rotation. However, constant, non-rotating in situ signatures are only observed for flank encounters of low twist CMEs, suggesting the existence of untwisted magnetic field lines within CME legs. Additionally, our study confirms the unambiguous appearance of different flux rope types in in situ signatures, contributing to the broader understanding and interpretation of observational data. Given the model assumptions, this may refute trajectory effects to be the cause for mismatching flux rope types as identified in solar signatures. While acknowledging limitations inherent in our model, such as the assumption of constant twist and non-deformable torus-like shape, we still draw relevant conclusions within the context of global magnetic field structures of CMEs and the potential for distinguishing flux rope types based on in situ observations.</description>
