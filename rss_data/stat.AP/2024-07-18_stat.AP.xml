      <title>Time-varying Multivariate Statistical Process Control for Solar Photovoltaic Monitoring and Fault Detecting &amp; Diagnosing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying multivariate statistical process control (TMSPC) has been proposed as a tool for process monitoring, fault detecting &amp; diagnosing of time-varying system. It is a modification of multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) of which is designed for the process that variables operated on normal operational condition which independence of time. However, in some processes, such as solar photovoltaic system, the process variables, i.e., temperature, voltage and current, are time-varying. Therefore, TMSPC has been proposed as monitoring and diagnosing tool for time-varying process. The proposed technique has been demonstrated with solar photovoltaic system located at Research &amp; Development Institute, Nakhon Phanom University, Thailand (RDI-NPU).</description>

      <title>Specific language impairment (SLI) detection pipeline from transcriptions of spontaneous narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is a disorder that affects communication and can affect both comprehension and expression. This study focuses on effectively detecting SLI in children using transcripts of spontaneous narratives from 1063 interviews. A three-stage cascading pipeline was proposed f. In the first stage, feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of the data are performed using the Random Forest (RF) and Spearman correlation methods. In the second stage, the most predictive variables from the first stage are estimated using logistic regression, which is used in the last stage to detect SLI in children from transcripts of spontaneous narratives using a nearest neighbor classifier. The results revealed an accuracy of 97.13% in identifying SLI, highlighting aspects such as the length of the responses, the quality of their utterances, and the complexity of the language. This new approach, framed in natural language processing, offers significant benefits to the field of SLI detection by avoiding complex subjective variables and focusing on quantitative metrics directly related to the child's performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of clustering methods on data produced by a stochastic simulator, with applications in anomaly detection, pre-optimization, and online monitoring. We introduce an agglomerative clustering algorithm that clusters multivariate empirical distributions using the regularized Wasserstein distance and apply the proposed methodology on a call-center model.</description>

      <title>MM Algorithms for Statistical Estimation in Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantile regression is a robust and practically useful way to efficiently model quantile varying correlation and predict varied response quantiles of interest. This article constructs and tests MM algorithms, which are simple to code and have been suggested superior to some other prominent quantile regression methods in nonregularized problems, in an array of quantile regression settings including linear (modeling different quantile coefficients both separately and simultaneously), nonparametric, regularized, and monotone quantile regression. Applications to various real data sets and two simulation studies comparing MM to existing tested methods have corroborated our algorithms' effectiveness. We have made one key advance by generalizing our MM algorithm to efficiently fit easy-to-predict-and-interpret parametric quantile regression models for data sets exhibiting manifest complicated nonlinear correlation patterns, which has not yet been covered by current literature to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal factor models for functional data with application to population map forecast</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices has led to the collection of large amounts of population data. This situation has prompted the need to utilize this rich, multidimensional data in practical applications. In response to this trend, we have integrated functional data analysis (FDA) and factor analysis to address the challenge of predicting hourly population changes across various districts in Tokyo. Specifically, by assuming a Gaussian process, we avoided the large covariance matrix parameters of the multivariate normal distribution. In addition, the data were both time and spatially dependent between districts. To capture these characteristics, a Bayesian factor model was introduced, which modeled the time series of a small number of common factors and expressed the spatial structure through factor loading matrices. Furthermore, the factor loading matrices were made identifiable and sparse to ensure the interpretability of the model. We also proposed a Bayesian shrinkage method as a systematic approach for factor selection. Through numerical experiments and data analysis, we investigated the predictive accuracy and interpretability of our proposed method. We concluded that the flexibility of the method allows for the incorporation of additional time series features, thereby improving its accuracy.</description>

      <title>A mixed effects cosinor modelling framework for circadian gene expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosinor model is frequently used to represent the oscillatory behavior of different genes over time. When data are collected from multiple individuals, the cosinor model is estimated with recorded gene expression levels and the 24 hour day-night cycle time at which gene expression levels are observed. However, the timing of many biological processes are based on individual-specific internal timing systems that are offset relative to day-night cycle time. When these individual-specific offsets are unknown, they pose a challenge in performing statistical analyses with a cosinor model. Specifically, when each individual participating in a study has a different offset, the parameter estimates of a population cosinor model obtained with day-night cycle time are attenuated. These attenuated parameter estimates also attenuate test statistics, which inflate type II error rates in identifying genes with oscillatory behavior. To address this attenuation bias, this paper proposes a method when data are collected in a longitudinal design. This method involves first estimating individual-specific and population cosinor models for each gene, and then translating the times at which an individual's gene expression levels are recorded based on the parameter estimates of these models. Simulation studies confirm that this method mitigates bias in estimation and inference. Illustrations with data from three circadian biology studies highlight that this method produces parameter estimates and test statistics akin to those obtained when each individual's offset is known.</description>

      <title>Extreme-value modelling of migratory bird arrival dates: Insights from citizen science data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Citizen science mobilises many observers and gathers huge datasets but often without strict sampling protocols, which results in observation biases due to heterogeneity in sampling effort that can lead to biased statistical inferences. We develop a spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model for bias-corrected estimation of arrival dates of the first migratory bird individuals at a breeding site. Higher sampling effort could be correlated with earlier observed dates. We implement data fusion of two citizen-science datasets with fundamentally different protocols (BBS, eBird) and map posterior distributions of the latent process, which contains four spatial components with Gaussian process priors: species niche; sampling effort; position and scale parameters of annual first date of arrival. The data layer includes four response variables: counts of observed eBird locations (Poisson); presence-absence at observed eBird locations (Binomial); BBS occurrence counts (Poisson); first arrival dates (Generalized Extreme-Value). We devise a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme and check by simulation that the latent process components are identifiable. We apply our model to several migratory bird species in the northeastern US for 2001--2021, and find that the sampling effort significantly modulates the observed first arrival date. We exploit this relationship to effectively bias-correct predictions of the true first arrival dates.</description>
