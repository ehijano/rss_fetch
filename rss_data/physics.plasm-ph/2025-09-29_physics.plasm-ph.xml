      <title>Electrostatic waves in astrophysical Druyvesteyn plasmas: I. Langmuir waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmas in various astrophysical systems are in non-equilibrium states as evidenced by direct in-situ measurements in the solar wind, solar corona and planetary environments as well as by indirect observations of various sources of waves and emissions. Specific are non-Maxwellian velocity distributions with suprathermal tails, for whose description the most-used are the Kappa (power-law) distributions. With this paper we introduce a modeling alternative for linear waves in plasmas described by another non-equilibrium model, namely the generalized Druyvesteyn distribution. This can reproduce not only the high-energy tails, but also the low-energy flat-tops of velocity distributions, like those of electrons associated with the Earth's bow shock and interplanetary shocks or of electrons in the solar transition region. We derive the corresponding dispersion relation for longitudinal waves in terms of the newly introduced Druyvsteyn dispersion function, numerically compute, for the isotropic case, the dispersion curves as well as damping rates, and provide analytical approximation in the limit of weak damping. Thereby, we provide a new modeling tool that facilitates the quantitative treatment of a variety of non-Maxwellian plasmas.</description>

      <title>Generation of directed electron beams by tight focusing of an ultrashort IR laser in a near-critical plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of accelerating electrons to MeV energies in ambient air using tightly focused laser configurations. In this article, we explore possible strategies to control and optimize the resulting electron beams using laser and gas parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that in near-critical plasmas, linearly and circularly polarized pulses are more efficient than radially polarized pulses for electron acceleration. In addition, electron beams obtained from linearly polarized pulses have lower divergence angles. By studying the efficiency of the acceleration process - characterized by the maximum kinetic energy of electrons and their total number - we identify optimal conditions in ambient air at wavelength lambda_0 approximately 1.5 micrometers and a_0 &gt;= 15. We also scale our results to lower-density air and demonstrate that some noble gases (Ne, Ar) are suitable media for accelerating electrons. Our investigations show that this acceleration scheme enables multi-MeV electrons with low divergence using millijoule-class high-repetition rate lasers, making it a promising candidate for applications in medical sciences and ultrafast imaging.</description>

      <title>Saturation of the kinetic ballooning instability due to the electron parallel nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron parallel nonlinearity (EPN) is implemented in the gyrokinetic Particle-in-Cell turbulence code GEM [Y. Chen and S. E. Parker, J. Comp. Phys. 220, 839 (2007)]. Application to the Cyclone Base Case reveals a strong effect of EPN on the saturated heat transport above the kinetic ballooning mode threshold. Evidence is provided to show that the strong effect is associated with the electron radial motion due to magnetic fluttering, which turns fine structures of the KBM eigenmode in radius into fine structures in velocity and increases the magnitude of the EPN term in the kinetic equation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Axion-Photon Conversion via Seeded Photons instead of Resonant Cavities for Short-Pulse Axion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a seeded axion-photon conversion scheme to enhance the sensitivity of light-shining-through-wall (LSW) experiments for axion detection, where the axions are generated from short pulse lasers and the usual resonant cavity is not applicable. By injecting a small, coherent seed electromagnetic field (EM field) into the axion-photon conversion region, the axion-induced EM field can constructively interfere with the seed field, amplifying the regenerated photon number beyond the unseeded case. Starting from the axion-modified Maxwell equations, we derive the axion-photon conversion probability and show how an initial seed field boosts the final photon amplitude. The relative phase between the seed field and the axion field can cause constructive or destructive interference, though the measurable quantity is the net photon number variation. We evaluate the expected signal enhancement, signal-to-noise considerations (including seed shot noise), and the potential improvement in coupling sensitivity. Compared to a standard LSW setup, the seeded scheme can achieve orders-of-magnitude higher photon yield per axion, potentially surpassing resonance-enhanced experiments in certain parameter regimes. This approach offers a promising route to extend the reach of laboratory axion searches, especially for the case where the resonant cavities are impractical.</description>

      <title>Understanding the oxidation of pure Tungsten in air and its impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oxidation of pure W and the sublimation of W oxide have been investigated to assess their impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant. Pure W has been oxidised at temperatures between 400 and 1050C and for durations ranging between 1 and 70 h. The formation of voids and cracks has been observed at temperatures above 600C, leading to the formation of dust or oxide spalling, which could be problematic in maintenance and waste-handling scenarios of a fusion power plant. Preferential oxidation taking place at the edge of the specimen was characterised, and its impact is discussed in relation to component design. Characterisation using electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the oxide scale is formed of three main layers: the inner layer is 30-50 nm thick WO2 oxide, the middle layer is a 10-20 um of WO_2.72 and the outer layer is formed of WO2.9/WO3 phases - whose thickness varies according to the total thickness of the oxide scale. The observed microstructure is discussed in relation to the parabolic-to-linear kinetics and its potential impact on tritium permeation and detritiation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Tunable Transmissive Metagratings Using Single Layer Cylindrical Plasma Discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel single-layer reconfigurable transmissive metagrating based on plasma discharges. Each unit-cell consists of two side-by-side core-shell cylinders, with a tunable plasma core and a high-index dielectric shell. The structure is modeled using a free-electron plasma permittivity with adjustable plasma frequency. Analytical and numerical results show that the main transmission lobe can be switched between -41{\deg}, 0{\deg} and 41{\deg} by tuning the plasma frequencies. Transmission efficiency remains above 80% at broadside and 90% in the steered direction. This tunability enables effective directional control with low reflection and high overall power efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm for Nonlinear Electromagnetic Fluid Dynamics via Koopman-von Neumann Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To simulate plasma phenomena, large-scale computational resources have been employed in developing high-precision and high-resolution plasma simulations. One of the main obstacles in plasma simulations is the requirement of computational resources that scale polynomially with the number of spatial grids, which poses a significant challenge for large-scale modeling. To address this issue, this study presents a quantum algorithm for simulating the nonlinear electromagnetic fluid dynamics that govern space plasmas. We map it, by applying Koopman-von Neumann linearization, to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and evolve the system using Hamiltonian simulation via quantum singular value transformation. Our algorithm scales $O \left(s N_x \, \mathrm{polylog} \left( N_x \right) T \right)$ in time complexity with $s$, $N_x$, and $T$ being the spatial dimension, the number of spatial grid points per dimension, and the evolution time, respectively. Comparing the scaling $O \left( s N_x^s \left(T^{5/4}+T N_x\right) \right)$ for the classical method with the finite volume scheme, this algorithm achieves polynomial speedup in $N_x$. The space complexity of this algorithm is exponentially reduced from $O\left( s N_x^s \right)$ to $O\left( s \, \mathrm{polylog} \left( N_x \right) \right)$. Numerical experiments validate that accurate solutions are attainable with smaller $m$ than theoretically anticipated and with practical values of $m$ and $R$, underscoring the feasibility of the approach. As a practical demonstration, the method accurately reproduces the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, underscoring its capability to tackle more intricate nonlinear dynamics. These results suggest that quantum computing can offer a viable pathway to overcome the computational barriers of multiscale plasma modeling.</description>

      <title>Plasma acceleration of polarized particle beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-polarized particle beams are of interest for applications like deep-inelastic scattering, e.g. to gain further understanding of the proton's nuclear structure. With the advent of high-intensity laser facilities, laser-plasma-based accelerators offer a promising alternative to standard radiofrequency-based accelerators, as they can shorten the required acceleration length significantly. However, in the scope of spin-polarized particles, they bring unique challenges. This paper reviews the developments in the field of spin-polarized particles, focusing on the interaction of laser pulses and high-energy particle beams with plasma. The relevant scaling laws for spin-dependent effects in laser-plasma interaction, as well as acceleration schemes for polarized leptons, ions, and gamma quanta, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Contemporaneous Appearances of Auroral Spiral and Transpolar Arc: Polar UVI Observations and Global MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A local vortex-structured aurora and a large-scale transpolar arc (TPA) were contemporaneously observed by the Polar ultraviolet imager (UVI) when a substorm almost recovered, and the associated interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) BY and BZ polarities were negative and negative-to-positive. The TPA grew along the dawnside auroral oval from the nightside to the dayside, and an auroral spiral and several spots were located azimuthally near the poleward edge of the nightside auroral oval. Both auroras had tailward elongated source regions with scales of ~30 RE (spiral) and more than ~45 RE (TPA). To examine their magnetospheric/ionospheric field-aligned current (FAC) profiles, we performed global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, using two different types of code: Block-Adaptive-Tree Solar-wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) and improved REProduce Plasma Universe (REPPU). Both MHD simulations reproduced the tailward elongated TPA-associated FAC structures. The spiral-associated FAC intensity was, however, approximately three orders of magnitude weaker than the TPA-associated FAC intensity. Only improved REPPU simulation replicated faint but continuous poleward extending streak-like structures without evident FACs, instead of the auroral spiral. Geomagnetic field measurements showed that the spiral had upward (from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere) FACs, and its appearance might be accompanied by ultra-low-frequency Pc5 waves. Our results suggest that 1) a local-scale spiral might be formed with much weaker magnetotail FACs than global-scale TPA-associated FACs, although the spiral source region is elongated tailward, and 2) a solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system with minimal or no significant substorm effects is required to form the spiral with the weak magnetotail FACs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03119v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.</description>

      <title>Magnitude of Short-Wavelength Electric Field Fluctuations in Simulations of Collisionless Plasma Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-amplitude electrostatic fluctuations are routinely observed by spacecraft upon traversal of collisionless shocks in the heliosphere. Kinetic simulations of shocks have struggled to reproduce the amplitude of such fluctuations, complicating efforts to understand their influence on energy dissipation and shock structure. In this paper, 1D particle-in-cell simulations with realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio are used to show that in cases with upstream electron temperature $T_e$ exceeding the ion temperature $T_i$, the magnitude of the fluctuations increases with the electron plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratio $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$, reaching realistic values at $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce} \gtrsim 30$. The large-amplitude fluctuations in the simulations are shown to be associated with electrostatic solitary structures, such as ion phase-space holes. In the cases where upstream temperature ratio is reversed, the magnitude of the fluctuations remains small.</description>
