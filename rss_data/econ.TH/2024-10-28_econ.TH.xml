      <title>Stochastic cooperative games of risk averse players and application to multiple newsvendors problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the stochastic setting in cooperative games and suggests a solution concept based on second order stochastic dominance (SSD), which is often applied to robustly model risk averse behaviour of players in different economic and game theoretic models as it enables to model not specified levels of risk aversion among players. The main result of the paper connects this solution concept, \emph{SSD-core}, in case of uniform distribution of the game to cores of two deterministic cooperative games. Interestingly, balancedness of both of these games and convexity of one of these implies non-emptiness of the SSD-core. The opposite implication does not, in general, hold and leads to questions about intersections of cores of two games and their relations. Finally, we present an application of the SSD-core to the multiple newsvendors problem, where we provide a characterization of risk averse behaviour of players with an interpretation in terms of the model.</description>

      <title>Performance Rating Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, I introduce Performance Rating Equilibrium (PRE) as a sequence of hypothetical ratings for each player, such that if these ratings were each player's initial rating at the start of a tournament, scoring the same points against the same opponents would leave each player's initial rating unchanged. In other words, each player's initial rating perfectly predicts their actual score in the tournament. However, this property does not hold for the well-known Tournament Performance Rating. PRE is a fixed point of a multidimensional 'rating' function. I show that such a fixed point, and hence a PRE, exists under mild conditions.</description>

      <title>State-Dependent Linear Utility Functions for Monetary Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of expected utility with state-dependent linear utility function for monetary returns, that includes results on first order stochastic dominance, mean-preserving spread, increasing-concave linear utility profiles and risk aversion. As an application of the expected utility theory developed here, we analyze the contract that a monopolist would offer in an insurance market that allowed for partial coverage of loss. We also define a utility function for monetary returns that in a certain sense reconciles state-dependent constant average utility of money with loss aversion and the Friedman-Savage hypothesis. As an immediate consequence of such a utility function, we obtain a profile of state-dependent linear utility functions for monetary returns, where states of nature correspond to mutually disjoint intervals in which monetary gains and losses may occur.</description>

      <title>Information Sharing with Social Image Concerns and the Spread of Fake News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how social image concerns affect information sharing patterns between peers. An individual receives a signal ("news") about the state of the world and can either share it with a peer or not. This signal has two attributes: a headline -- e.g., arguing for or against human-induced climate change -- and a veracity status, indicating if the signal is based on facts or made-up. The headline is observable at no cost by everyone, while observing the veracity status is costly and the cost depends on an individual's type. We study the sharing patterns induced by two different types of social image concern: wanting to be perceived as talented, which implies being able to distinguish proper from fake news, and wanting to signal one's worldview. Our model can rationalize the empirical finding that fake news may be shared with a higher propensity than proper news (e.g., Vosoughi et al., 2018). We show that both a veracity and a worldview concern may rationalize this finding, though sharing patterns are empirically distinguishable and welfare implications differ.</description>

      <title>Local hedging approximately solves Pandora's box problems with nonobligatory inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider search problems with nonobligatory inspection and single-item or combinatorial selection. A decision maker is presented with a number of items, each of which contains an unknown price, and can pay an inspection cost to observe the item's price before selecting it. Under single-item selection, the decision maker must select one item; under combinatorial selection, the decision maker must select a set of items that satisfies certain constraints. In our nonobligatory inspection setting, the decision maker can select items without first inspecting them. It is well-known that search with nonobligatory inspection is harder than the well-studied obligatory inspection case, for which the optimal policy for single-item selection (Weitzman, 1979) and approximation algorithms for combinatorial selection (Singla, 2018) are known.
  We introduce a technique, local hedging, for constructing policies with good approximation ratios in the nonobligatory inspection setting. Local hedging transforms policies for the obligatory inspection setting into policies for the nonobligatory inspection setting, at the cost of an extra factor in the approximation ratio. The factor is instance-dependent but is at most 4/3. We thus obtain the first approximation algorithms for a variety of combinatorial selection problems, including matroid basis, matching, and facility location.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Selection in Pure Bubble Models by Dividend Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rational pure bubble models feature multiple (and often a continuum of) equilibria, which makes model predictions and policy analyses non-robust. We show that when the interest rate in the fundamental equilibrium is below the economic growth rate ($R&lt;G$), a bubbly equilibrium with $R=G$ exists. By injecting dividends to the bubble asset that grow slower than the aggregate economy, we can eliminate the fundamental steady state and resolve equilibrium indeterminacy. We show the general applicability of dividend injection through examples in overlapping generations and infinite-horizon models with or without production or financial frictions.</description>

      <title>Time-Efficient Algorithms for Nash-Bargaining-Based Matching Market Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.02024v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the area of matching-based market design, existing models using cardinal utilities suffer from two deficiencies: First, the Hylland-Zeckhauser (HZ) mechanism, which has remained a classic in economics for one-sided matching markets, is intractable; computation of even an approximate equilibrium is PPAD-complete. Second, there is an extreme paucity of such models. This led Hosseini and Vazirani (2022) to define a rich collection of Nash-bargaining-based models for one-sided and two-sided matching markets, in both Fisher and Arrow-Debreu settings, together with very fast implementations using available solvers and very encouraging experimental results.
  In this paper, we give fast algorithms with proven running times for the models introduced by Hosseini and Vazirani, using the techniques of multiplicative weights update (MWU) and conditional gradient descent (CGD). Additionally, we make the following contributions:
  (1) By Tr\"obst and Vazirani (2024), a linear one-sided Nash-bargaining-based matching market satisfies envy-freeness within factor two. We show that the other models satisfy approximate equal-share fairness, where the exact factor depends on the utility function being used in the particular model.
  (2) We define a Nash-bargaining-based model for non-bipartite matching markets and give fast algorithms for it using conditional gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Congestion and Penalization in Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce two novel models derived from the discrete optimal transport problem. The first model extends the traditional transport problem by adding a quadratic congestion factor directly into the cost function, while the second model replaces conventional constraints with weighted penalization terms. We present theoretical results, for the characterization of interior and corner solution for some specific cases, and we perform smooth comparative statics analysis. We also propose an $O((N+L)(NL)^2)$ algorithm for computing the optimal plan for the penalized model. Additionally, in the annex, we provide some examples that illustrate the main results of the paper.</description>
