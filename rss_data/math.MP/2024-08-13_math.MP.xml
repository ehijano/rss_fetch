      <title>Theory of metastable states in many-body quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mathematical theory of metastable pure states in closed many-body quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Given a Hamiltonian, a pure state is defined to be metastable when all sufficiently local operators either stabilize the state, or raise its average energy. We prove that short-range entangled metastable states are necessarily eigenstates (scars) of a perturbatively close Hamiltonian. Given any metastable eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, in the presence of perturbations, we prove the presence of prethermal behavior: local correlation functions decay at a rate bounded by a time scale nonperturbatively long in the inverse metastability radius, rather than Fermi's Golden Rule. Inspired by this general theory, we prove that the lifetime of the false vacuum in certain $d$-dimensional quantum models grows at least as fast as $\exp(\epsilon^{-d} \log^{-3} \epsilon^{-1} )$, where $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ is the relative energy density of the false vacuum; up to logarithms, this lower bound matches, for the first time, explicit calculations using quantum field theory. We identify metastable states at finite energy density in the PXP model, along with exponentially many metastable states in "helical" spin chains and the two-dimensional Ising model. Our inherently quantum formalism reveals precise connections between many problems, including prethermalization, robust quantum scars, and quantum nucleation theory, and applies to systems without known semiclassical and/or field theoretic limits.</description>

      <title>Piecewise linear constitutive relations for stretch-limited elastic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a simple and novel class of stretch-limiting constitutive relations for perfectly flexible elastic strings drawing from modern advances in constitutive theory for elastic bodies. We investigate strings governed by constitutive relations where stretch is a bounded, piecewise linear function of tension, extending beyond the traditional Cauchy elasticity framework. Our analysis includes explicit solutions for both catenaries and longitudinal, piecewise constant stretched motions.</description>

      <title>Enumerative geometry via elliptic stable envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume $X$ is a variety for which the elliptic stable envelope exists. In this note we construct natural $q$-difference equations from the elliptic stable envelope of $X$. In examples, these equations coincide with the quantum difference equations, which give a natural $q$-deformation of the Dubrovin connection of $X$. Solutions of the quantum difference equations provide generating functions counting curves in $X$. In this way, our construction connects curve counting and equivariant elliptic cohomology.
  This is an overview paper based on the author's talk at the workshop The 16th MSJ-SI: Elliptic Integrable Systems, Representation Theory and Hypergeometric Functions, Tokyo 2023.</description>

Abstract: We discuss elliptic quantum Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models, including their relativistic generalizations due to Ruijsenaars and van Diejen, and the relations of these models to classes of special functions developed and explored in recent and on-going research efforts. We give an introduction to these models and corresponding special functions aimed at non-experts. We also describe a few open problems in the field.</description>

      <title>Circle Foliations Revisited: Periods of Flows whose Orbits are all Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our purpose here is to adapt the results of Geodesic circle foliations for Reeb flows or Hamiltonian flows on contact manifolds. Consequently, all periods are exactly the same if the contact manifold is connected and all orbits on the contact manifold are closed. We also present concrete examples of periodic flows, all of whose orbits are closed, such as Harmonic oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and others. Lotka-Volterra systems, Reeb flows, and some geodesic flows have non-trivial periods, whereas the periods of Harmonic oscillators and similar systems can be easily obtained through direct calculations. As an application to quantum mechanics, we examine the spectrum of semiclassical Shr\"odinger operators. Then we have one of the semiclassical analogies of the Helton-Guillemin theorem.</description>

      <title>A new theory of continuum defects in terms of the general teleparallel geometry and exterior algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the geometric formulation of continuum defects consisting of dislocations and disclinations. After reviewing the metric affine geometry and the present geometric formulation of dislocation and disclination written in terms of torsion and full curvature (together with vanishing non-metricity), we give a new theory of them in a novel way in terms of torsion and non-metricity (together with vanishing full curvature), the so-called general teleparallel geometry. All calculations are performed by using the exterior algebra. We obtain continuity equations explicitly for dislocation density and disclination density.</description>

      <title>General rogue waves of infinite order: Exact properties, asymptotic behavior, and effective numerical computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a comprehensive analysis of a family of solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation called general rogue waves of infinite order. These solutions have recently been shown to describe various limit processes involving large-amplitude waves, and they have also appeared in some physical models not directly connected with nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. We establish the following key property of these solutions: they are all in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ with respect to the spatial variable but they exhibit anomalously slow temporal decay. In this paper we define general rogue waves of infinite order, establish their basic exact and asymptotic properties, and provide computational tools for calculating them accurately.</description>

      <title>Perfect t-embeddings and Lozenge Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct perfect t-embeddings for regular hexagons of the hexagonal lattice, providing the first example, and hence proving existence, for graphs with an outer face of degree greater than four. The construction is in terms of the inverse Kasteleyn matrix and relies only on symmetries of the graph. Using known formulas for the inverse Kasteleyn matrix, we derive exact contour integral formulas for these embeddings and their origami maps. Through steepest descent analysis, we establish scaling limits, proving convergence of origami maps to a maximal surface in the Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$, and we verify structural rigidity conditions, leading to a new proof of convergence of height fluctuations to the Gaussian free field.</description>

      <title>Fourth-Order Paired-Explicit Runge-Kutta Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Paired-Explicit Runge-Kutta schemes by Vermeire et. al. to fourth-order of consistency. Based on the order conditions for partitioned Runge-Kutta methods we motivate a specific form of the Butcher arrays which leads to a family of fourth-order accurate methods. The employed form of the Butcher arrays results in a special structure of the stability polynomials, which needs to be adhered to for an efficient optimization of the domain of absolute stability. We demonstrate that the constructed fourth-order Paired-Explicit Runge-Kutta methods satisfy linear stability, internal consistency, designed order of convergence, and conservation of linear invariants. At the same time, these schemes are seamlessly coupled for codes employing a method-of-lines approach, in particular without any modifications of the spatial discretization. We apply the multirate Paired-Explicit Runge-Kutta (P-ERK) schemes to inviscid and viscous problems with locally varying wave speeds, which may be induced by non-uniform grids or multiscale properties of the governing partial differential equation. Compared to state-of-the-art optimized standalone methods, the multirate P-ERK schemes allow significant reductions in right-hand-side evaluations and wall-clock time, ranging from 40% up to factors greater than three.</description>

      <title>Flatness of $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and commutativity of Frobenius algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tensor functor called $\alpha$-induction produces a new unitary fusion category from a Frobenius algebra, or a $Q$-system, in a braided unitary fusion category. A bi-unitary connection, which is a finite family of complex number subject to some axioms, realizes an object in any unitary fusion category. It also gives a characterization of a finite-dimensional nondegenerate commuting square in subfactor theory of Jones and realizes a certain $4$-tensor appearing in recent studies of $2$-dimensional topological order. We study $\alpha$-induction for bi-unitary connections, and show that flatness of the resulting $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections implies commutativity of the original Frobenius algebra. This gives a converse of our previous result and answers a question raised by R. Longo. We furthermore give finer correspondence between the flat parts of the $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and the commutative Frobenius subalgebras studied by B\"ockenhauer-Evans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a perturbative proof of localization for quasiperiodic operators on $\ell^2(\Z^d)$ with one-dimensional phase space and monotone sampling functions, in the regime of small hopping. The proof is based on an iterative scheme which can be considered as a local (in the energy and the phase) and convergent version of KAM-type diagonalization, whose result is a covariant family of uniformly localized eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We also proof that the spectra of such operators contain infinitely many gaps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the nonlocal Almgren problem, the goal is to investigate the convexity of a minimizer under a mass constraint via a nonlocal free energy generated with some nonlocal perimeter and convex potential. In the paper, the main result is a quantitative stability theorem for the nonlocal free energy assuming symmetry on the potential. In addition, several results that involve uniqueness, non-existence, and moduli estimates from the theory for crystals are proven also in the nonlocal context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a large deviations principle for the solution to the beating NLS equation on the torus with random initial data supported on two Fourier modes. When these modes have different initial variance, we prove that the resonant energy exchange between them increases the likelihood of extreme wave formation. Our results show that nonlinear focusing mechanisms can lead to tail fattening of the probability measure of the sup-norm of the solution to a nonlinear dispersive equation.</description>

      <title>String condensation and topological holography for 2+1D gapless SPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of anyon condensation is the foundation of the bulk-boundary relation and topological holography in 2+1D/1+1D. It is believed string condensation should replace anyon condensation in the 3+1D/2+1D topological holography theory. In this work we study string condensations in 3+1D topological orders and their relations to 2+1D phases. We find that a class of non-Lagrangian condensable algebras in 3+1D are exactly dual to a class of 2+1D symmetry enriched gapless phases known as gapless SPTs(gSPT). We show how topological properties of a gSPT can be fully extracted from the dual string condensation. We give an algebraic classification of this class of condensable algebras in 3+1D $G$-gauge theories that we call magnetic and simple. Through the topological holography dictionary, this maps to the classification of 2+1D $G$-symmetric phases with no topological order, including gapped and gapless SPTs. Utilizing the classification, we identify three classes of gSPTs and study their properties and gauging. Along the way, we reveal physical structures of string condensations.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory for the Inhomogeneous Kinetic Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct global strong dispersive solutions to the space inhomogeneous kinetic wave equation (KWE) which propagate $L^1_{xv}$ -- moments and conserve mass, momentum and energy. We prove that they scatter, and that the wave operators mapping the initial data to the scattering states are 1-1, onto and continuous in a suitable topology.
  Our proof is carried out entirely in physical space, and combines dispersive estimates for the free transport with new trilinear bounds for the gain and loss operators of the KWE on weighted Lebesgue spaces. A fundamental tool in obtaining these bounds is a novel collisional averaging estimate.
  Finally we show that the nonlinear evolution preserves positivity forward in time. For this, we use the Kaniel-Shinbrot iteration scheme \cite{KS}, properly initialized to ensure the successive approximations are dispersive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an Oberbeck-Boussinesq model, rigorously derived, which includes compressibility, one could expect that the onset of convection for the B\'enard problem occurs at a higher critical Rayleigh number. Since of the difficulties related to the new partial differential equations, with non constant coefficients and a non divergence-free velocity field, we show the increased stability of the rest state by exploring the related Lorenz approximation system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A charged particle in a suitably strong magnetic field spirals along the field lines while slowly drifting transversely. This note provides a brief derivation of an effective Lagrangian formulation for the guiding center approximation that captures this dynamics without resolving the gyro motion. It also explains how the effective Lagrangian may, for special magnetic fields, admit a ``quasisymmetry'' which can give rise to a conserved quantity helpful for plasma confinement in fields lacking a geometric isometry. The aim of this note is to offer a pedagogical introduction and some perspectives on this well established subject.</description>

      <title>Negative eigenvalue estimates for the 1D Schr{\"o}dinger operator with measure-potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the negative part of the spectrum of the operator $-\partial^2 - \mu$ on $L^2(\mathbb R)$, where a locally finite Radon measure $\mu \geq 0$ is serving as a potential. We obtain estimates for the eigenvalue counting function, for individual eigenvalues and estimates of the Lieb-Thirring type. A crucial tool for our estimates is Otelbaev's function, a certain average of the measure potential $\mu$, which is used both in the proofs and the formulation of many of the results.</description>

      <title>Symmetry topological field theory and non-abelian Kramers-Wannier dualities of generalised Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a class of two-dimensional Euclidean lattice field theories admitting topological lines encoded into a spherical fusion category, we explore aspects of their realisations as boundary theories of a three-dimensional topological quantum field theory. After providing a general framework for explicitly constructing such realisations, we specialise to non-abelian generalisations of the Ising model and consider two operations: gauging an arbitrary subsymmetry and performing Fourier transforms of the local weights encoding the dynamics of the theory. These are carried out both in a traditional way and in terms of the three-dimensional topological quantum field theory. Whenever the whole symmetry is gauged, combining both operations recovers the non-abelian Kramers-Wannier duals \`a la Freed and Teleman of the generalised Ising models. Moreover, we discuss the interplay between renormalisation group fixed points of gapped symmetric phases and these generalised Kramers-Wannier dualities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explore how rigid rotation affects the thermodynamic properties of free relativistic bosons, we employ the standard imaginary time formalism of thermal field theory to calculate the free propagator of complex scalar fields under rotation. We introduce the corresponding partition function and explicitly compute it by expanding the modes in cylindrical coordinates. The resulting propagator is in full agreement with similar findings in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and the density matrix renormalisation group in the generalised Landau paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We leverage the interplay between gapped phases and dualities of symmetric one-dimensional quantum lattice models to demonstrate that every phase is efficiently characterised by the maximal breaking of the dual (genereralised) symmetry whose structure encodes the quasiparticle excitations. This result has strong implications for the complexity of simulating many-body systems using variational tensor network methods. For every phase in the phase diagram, the dual representation of the ground state that breaks all symmetries minimises both the entanglement entropy and the required number of variational parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of this idea by developing a generalised density matrix renormalisation group algorithm that works on (dual) constrained Hilbert spaces, and quantify the computational gains obtained over traditional DMRG methods in a perturbed Heisenberg model. Our work testifies to the usefulness of generalised non-invertible symmetries and their formal category theoretic description for the nuts and bolts simulation of strongly correlated systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider the analysis of singular waveguides separating insulating phases in two-space dimensions. The insulating domains are modeled by a massive Schr\"odinger equation and the singular waveguide by appropriate jump conditions along the one-dimensional interface separating the insulators. We present an integral formulation of the problem and analyze its mathematical properties. We also implement a fast multipole and sweeping-accelerated iterative algorithm for solving the integral equations, and demonstrate numerically the fast convergence of this method. Several numerical examples of solutions and scattering effects illustrate our theory.</description>

Abstract: The quantum Rabi model (QRM), one of the fundamental models used to describe light and matter interaction, has a deep mathematical structure revealed by the study of its spectrum. In this paper, from the explicit formulas for the partition function we directly derive various limits of the spectral zeta function with respect to the systems parameters of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model (AQRM), a generalization obtained by adding a physically significant parameter to the QRM. In particular, we consider the limit corresponding to the growth of the coupling strength to infinity, recently studied using resolvent analysis. The limits obtained in this paper are given in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function and other $L$-functions, suggesting further relations between spectral zeta function of quantum interaction models and number theory.</description>

Abstract: We study conservation laws of a general class of quantum many-body systems subjected to an external time dependent quasi-periodic driving. {When the frequency of the driving is large enough or the strength of the driving is small enough, we prove a Nekhoroshev-type stability result: we show that the system exhibits a prethermal state for stretched exponentially long times in the perturbative parameter}. Moreover, we prove the quasi-conservation of the constants of motion of the unperturbed Hamiltonian and we analyze their physical meaning in examples of relevance to condensed matter and statistical physics.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the precise physical quantities in the thermodynamic limit of the one-dimensional Hubbard model with nonparallel boundary magnetic fields based on the off-diagonal Bethe ansatz solution. A particular emphasis is placed on the half-filling condition to investigate the distinct patterns of Bethe roots in the reduced Bethe ansatz equations for different boundary parameters. The ground state of the system can be divided into five regions according to the distribution of Bethe roots. By analyzing these patterns, we calculate the densities of states, ground-state energy density, and surface energy. The results reveal the existence of stableboundary bound states, which are dependent on specific constraints regarding the boundary magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Wasserstein divergences are modified versions of quantum Wasserstein distances defined by channels, and they are conjectured to be genuine metrics on quantum state spaces by De Palma and Trevisan. We prove triangle inequality for quantum Wasserstein divergences for every quantum system described by a separable Hilbert space and any quadratic cost operator under the assumption that a particular state involved is pure, and all the states have finite energy. We also provide strong numerical evidence suggesting that the triangle inequality holds in general, for an arbitrary choice of states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random tensor networks are a powerful toy model for understanding the entanglement structure of holographic quantum gravity. However, unlike holographic quantum gravity, their entanglement spectra are flat. It has therefore been argued that a better model consists of random tensor networks with link states that are not maximally entangled, i.e., have nontrivial spectra. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of the entanglement properties of these networks. We employ tools from free probability, random matrix theory, and one-shot quantum information theory to study random tensor networks with bounded and unbounded variation in link spectra, and in cases where a subsystem has one or multiple minimal cuts. If the link states have bounded spectral variation, the limiting entanglement spectrum of a subsystem with two minimal cuts can be expressed as a free product of the entanglement spectra of each cut, along with a Marchenko-Pastur distribution. For a class of states with unbounded spectral variation, analogous to semiclassical states in quantum gravity, we relate the limiting entanglement spectrum of a subsystem with two minimal cuts to the distribution of the minimal entanglement across the two cuts. In doing so, we draw connections to previous work on split transfer protocols, entanglement negativity in random tensor networks, and Euclidean path integrals in quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Einstein-Boltzmann system for massless particles in the Bianchi I space-time with scattering cross-sections in a certain range of soft potentials. We assume that the space-time has an initial conformal gauge singularity and show that the initial value problem is well posed with data given at the singularity. This is understood by considering conformally rescaled equations. The Einstein equations become a system of singular ordinary differential equations, for which we establish an existence theorem which requires several differentiability and eigenvalue conditions on the coefficient functions together with the Fuchsian conditions. The Boltzmann equation is regularized by a suitable choice of time coordinate, but still has singularities in momentum variables. This is resolved by considering singular weights, and the existence is obtained by exploiting singular moment estimates.</description>

Abstract: For the one dimensional Burgers equation with a random and periodic forcing, it is well-known that there exists a family of invariant measures, each corresponding to a different average velocity. In this paper, we consider the coupled invariant measures and study how they change as the velocity parameter varies. We show that the derivative of the invariant measure with respect to the velocity parameter exists, and it can be interpreted as the steady state of a diffusion advected by the Burgers flow</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09146v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces an advanced Koopman mode decomposition (KMD) technique -- coined Featurized Koopman Mode Decomposition (FKMD) -- that uses delay embedding and a learned Mahalanobis distance to enhance analysis and prediction of high dimensional dynamical systems. The delay embedding expands the observation space to better capture underlying manifold structure, while the Mahalanobis distance adjusts observations based on the system's dynamics. This aids in featurizing KMD in cases where good features are not a priori known. We show that FKMD improves predictions for a high-dimensional linear oscillator, a high-dimensional Lorenz attractor that is partially observed, and a cell signaling problem from cancer research.</description>

Abstract: A closed subgroup $G\subset_uU_N^+$ is called easy when its associated Tannakian category $C_{kl}=Hom(u^{\otimes k},u^{\otimes l})$ appears from a category of partitions, $C=span(D)$ with $D=(D_{kl})\subset P$, via the standard implementation of partitions as linear maps. The examples abound, and the main known subgroups $G\subset U_N^+$ are either easy, or not far from being easy. We discuss here the basic theory, examples and known classification results for the easy quantum groups $G\subset U_N^+$, as well as various generalizations of the formalism, known as super-easiness theories, and the unification problem for them.</description>

Abstract: We determine to leading order the maximum of the characteristic polynomial for Wigner matrices and $\beta$-ensembles. In the special case of Gaussian-divisible Wigner matrices, our method provides universality of the maximum up to tightness. These are the first universal results on the Fyodorov--Hiary--Keating conjectures for these models, and in particular answer the question of optimal rigidity for the spectrum of Wigner matrices.
  Our proofs combine dynamical techniques for universality of eigenvalue statistics with ideas surrounding the maxima of log-correlated fields and Gaussian multiplicative chaos.</description>

Abstract: Given a noncommutative Hamiltonian space $A$, we show that the conjecture ``{\it quantization commutes with reduction}'' holds on $A$. We also construct a semi-product algebra $A \rtimes \mG^A$, equivariant sheaves on the representation space are related to left $A \rtimes \mG^A$-modules. In the quiver setting, via the quantum and classical trace maps, we establish the explicit correspondence between quantizations on a preprojective algebra and those on a quiver variety.</description>

      <title>Dense Hopfield Networks in the Teacher-Student Setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense Hopfield networks are known for their feature to prototype transition and adversarial robustness. However, previous theoretical studies have been mostly concerned with their storage capacity. We bridge this gap by studying the phase diagram of p-body Hopfield networks in the teacher-student setting of an unsupervised learning problem, uncovering ferromagnetic phases reminiscent of the prototype and feature learning regimes. On the Nishimori line, we find the critical size of the training set necessary for efficient pattern retrieval. Interestingly, we find that that the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition of the teacher-student setting coincides with the paramagnetic to spin-glass transition of the direct model, i.e. with random patterns. Outside of the Nishimori line, we investigate the learning performance in relation to the inference temperature and dataset noise. Moreover, we show that using a larger p for the student than the teacher gives the student an extensive tolerance to noise. We then derive a closed-form expression measuring the adversarial robustness of such a student at zero temperature, corroborating the positive correlation between number of parameters and robustness observed in large neural networks. We also use our model to clarify why the prototype phase of modern Hopfield networks is adversarially robust.</description>

      <title>Novel knotted non-abelian gauge fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analogy to null electromagnetic fields we define null YM fields. We show that the null non-abelian $SU(N)$ gauge fields admit a set of $2 N^2$ conserved "helicities". We derive null YM solutions that carry finite helicities by uplifting the abelian Hopfion solution and their generalizations. Another method that we implement is to deform YM solutions which do not carry helicities into ones that have nontrivial helicities. A nontrivial non-Abelian solution with helicities is found as a wave of infinite energy. We also discuss non-abelian generalizations of the Bateman parameterization for null abelian gauge fields.</description>

      <title>The phase transition of the Marcu-Fredenhagen ratio in the abelian lattice Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Marcu-Fredenhagen ratio is a quantity used in the physics literature to differentiate between phases in lattice Higgs models. It is defined as the limit of a ratio of expectations of Wilson line observables as the length of these lines go to infinity while the parameters of the model are kept fixed. In this paper, we show that the Marcu-Fredenhagen ratio exists in all predicted phases of the model, and show that it indeed undergoes a phase transition. In the Higgs phase of the model we do a more careful analysis of the ratio to deduce its first order behaviour and also give an upper bound on its rate of convergence. Finally, we also present a short and concise proof of the exponential decay of correlations in the Higgs phase.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for a coherent phenomenon of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is known that Hamiltonian systems may undergo a phenomenon of condensation akin to Bose-Einstein condensation, not all the manifestations of this phenomenon have been uncovered yet. In this work we present a novel form of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems that stands out due to its evolution through highly coherent states. The result is based on a deterministic approach to obtain exact explicit solutions representing the dynamical formation of condensates in finite time. We reveal a dual-cascade behavior during the process, featuring inverse and direct transfer of conserved quantities across the spectrum. The direct cascade yields the excitation of arbitrarily high modes in finite time, being associated with the formation of a small-scale coherent structure. We provide a fully analytic description of the processes involved.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of mild solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in weak-type $L^d$ space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the uniqueness of mild solutions to the forced or unforced Navier-Stokes equations in the whole space. It is known that the uniqueness of mild solutions to the unforced Navier-Stokes equations holds in $L^{\infty}(0,T;L^d(\mathbb{R}^d))$ when $d\geq 4$, and in $C([0,T];L^d(\mathbb{R}^d))$ when $d\geq3$. As for the forced Navier-Stokes equations, when $d\geq3$ the uniqueness of mild solutions in $C([0,T];L^{d,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d))$ with force $f$ and initial data $u_{0}$ in some proper Lorentz spaces is known. In this paper we show that for $d\geq3$, the uniqueness of mild solutions to the forced Navier-Stokes equations in $ C((0,T];\widetilde{L}^{d,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d))\cap L^\beta(0,T;\widetilde{L}^{d,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d))$ for $\beta&gt;2d/(d-2)$ holds when there is a mild solution in $C([0,T];\widetilde{L}^{d,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d))$ with the same initial data and force. Here $\widetilde{L}^{d,\infty}$ is the closure of ${L^{\infty}\cap L^{d,\infty}}$ with respect to $L^{d,\infty}$ norm.</description>

      <title>Mean field coupled dynamical systems: Bifurcations and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a bifurcation theory for infinite dimensional systems satisfying abstract hypotheses that are tailored for applications to mean field coupled chaotic maps. Our abstract theory can be applied to many cases, from globally coupled expanding maps to globally coupled Axiom A diffeomorphisms. To illustrate the range of applicability, we analyze an explicit example consisting of globally coupled Anosov diffeomorphisms. For such an example, we classify all the invariant measures as the coupling strength varies; we show which invariant measures are physical, and we prove that the existence of multiple invariant physical measures is a purely infinite dimensional phenomenon, i.e., the model exhibits phase transitions in the sense of statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Remarks on regularization by noise, convex integration and spontaneous stochasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note is devoted to a discussion of the potential links and differences between three topics: regularization by noise, convex integration, spontaneous stochasticity. All of them deal with the effect on large scales of a small-scale perturbation of fluid dynamic equations. The effects sometimes have something in common, like convex integration and spontaneous stochasticity, sometimes they look the opposite, as in regularization by noise. We are not aware of rigorous links or precise explanations of the differences, and hope to drive new research with this comparative examination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The connection formulae provide a systematic way to compute physical quantities, such as the quasinormal modes, Green functions, in blackhole perturbation theories. In this work, we test whether it is possible to consistently take the collision limit, which bring two or more regular singularities into an irregular one, of the connection formulae, and we provide some supportive evidence for it.</description>

      <title>Generating quantum dissonance via local operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlations may arise in quantum systems through various means, of which the most remarkable one is quantum entanglement. Additionally, there are systems that exhibit non-classical correlations even in the absence of entanglement. Quantum dissonance refers to how quantum discord (QD) -- the difference between the total correlation and the classical correlation in a given quantum state -- appears as a non-classical correlation in a system without entanglement. It could be said that QD has the potential to provide a more inclusive viewpoint for discerning the non-classical correlations. In this work, we address the problem of manipulating the QD between two subsystems through local operations. We propose two explicit procedures for obtaining separable Werner states, a type of mixed state with nonzero QD. Both approaches involve performing local operations on classically correlated states and offers a step-by-step method for obtaining separable Werner states with nonzero discord, providing an alternative (explicit and user-friendly) to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order asymptotic observables are quasi-isomorphic to time-ordered amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic observables in quantum field theory beyond the familiar $S$-matrix have recently attracted much interest, for instance in the context of gravity waveforms. Such observables can be understood in terms of Schwinger-Keldysh-type 'amplitudes' computed by a set of modified Feynman rules involving cut internal legs and external legs labelled by time-folds.
  In parallel, a homotopy-algebraic understanding of perturbative quantum field theory has emerged in recent years. In particular, passing through homotopy transfer, the $S$-matrix of a perturbative quantum field theory can be understood as the minimal model of an associated (quantum) $L_\infty$-algebra.
  Here we bring these two developments together. In particular, we show that Schwinger-Keldysh amplitudes are naturally encoded in an $L_\infty$-algebra, similar to ordinary scattering amplitudes. As before, they are computed via homotopy transfer, but using deformation-retract data that are not canonical (in contrast to the conventional $S$-matrix). We further show that the $L_\infty$-algebras encoding Schwinger-Keldysh amplitudes and ordinary amplitudes are quasi-isomorphic (meaning, in a suitable sense, equivalent). This entails a set of recursion relations that enable one to compute Schwinger-Keldysh amplitudes in terms of ordinary amplitudes or vice versa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimal surfaces are ubiquitous in nature. Here they are considered as geometric objects that bear a deformation content. By refining the resolution of the surface deformation gradient afforded by the polar decomposition theorem, we identify a bending content and a class of deformations that leave it unchanged. These are the bending-neutral deformations, fully characterized by an integrability condition; they preserve normals. We prove that (1) every minimal surface is transformed into a minimal surface by a bending-neutral deformation, (2) given two minimal surfaces with the same system of normals, there is a bending-neutral deformation that maps one into the other, and (3) all minimal surfaces have indeed a universal bending content.</description>

      <title>Holographic stress tensor correlators on higher genus Riemann surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive study of holographic stress tensor correlators on general Riemann surfaces, extending beyond the previously well-studied torus cases to explore higher genus conformal field theories (CFTs) within the framework of the Anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. We develop a methodological approach to compute holographic stress tensor correlators, employing the Schottky uniformization technique to address the handlebody solutions for higher genus Riemann surfaces. Through rigorous calculations, we derive four-point stress tensor correlators, alongside recurrence relations for higher-point correlators, within the $\mathrm{AdS}_3/\mathrm{CFT}_2$ context. Additionally, our research delves into the holography of cutoff $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ spaces, offering novel insights into the lower-point correlators of the $T\bar{T}$-deformed theories on higher genus Riemann surfaces up to the first deformation order.</description>

      <title>Nicolai maps for super Yang-Mills on the light cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Nicolai maps for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four and ten spacetime dimensions in the light-cone gauge, where the elimination of non-propagating degrees of freedom causes nonlocal and four-fermi interactions in the Lagrangian. The presence of the latter used to be an obstruction to the Nicolai map, which has recently been overcome at the price of quantum corrections to the map. No gauge-fixing or ghost terms arise in this formulation, since only physical transverse degrees of freedom occur. We present an explicit form of the Nicolai map to second order in the gauge coupling. In four dimensions, a `chiral' choice of the map leaves one of the two transverse gauge-field modes invariant, which forces the classical part of the map (on the other mode) to become a polynomial (quadratic in the gauge coupling, cubic in the gauge field)! In the power series expansion for the ten-dimensional map however, cancellations at each order in the coupling are systematic but incomplete, still leaving an infinite power series for the Nicolai map (on all eight transverse modes). Nevertheless, the existence of a polynomial variant is conceivable, also for the maximal ${\cal N}{=}\,4$ theory in four dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We connect the indications of 2D CFT for branes in non-supersymmetric strings to actual spacetime profiles, taking the bulk tadpole potentials into account. We find exact solutions for the uncharged branes that spread in the internal intervals of Dudas-Mourad vacua for non-tachyonic orientifolds and heterotic strings. These solutions involve suitable dressings of the uncharged branes of the nine-dimensional tadpole-free theory. Similar exact results for uncharged branes that are transverse to the internal space, or for charged branes, appear more challenging. Nevertheless, we identify their large-distance behavior, which is determined by linearized equations, and show that it is compatible with the CFT analysis in all expected cases. We also provide some hints on the leading back-reaction of the form-fields.</description>

      <title>The dynamical $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropies of local Hamiltonians grow at most linearly in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic one dimensional spin system of length $ L $, arbitrarily large, with strictly local interactions, for example nearest neighbor, and prove that the dynamical $ \alpha $-R\'enyi entropies, $ 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1 $, of an initial product state grow at most linearly in time. This result arises from a general relation among dynamical $ \alpha $-R\'enyi entropies and Lieb-Robinson bounds. We extend our bound on the dynamical generation of entropy to systems with exponential decay of interactions, for values of $\alpha$ close enough to $ 1 $. We provide a non rigorous argument to extend our results to initial pure states with low entanglement of $ O(\log L) $. This class of states includes many examples of spin systems ground states, and also critical states. We establish that low entanglement states have an efficient MPS representation that persists at least up to times of order $ \log L $. The main technical tools are the Lieb-Robinson bounds, to locally approximate the dynamics of the spin chain, a strict upper bound of Audenaert on $ \alpha $-R\'enyi entropies and a bound on their concavity. Such a bound, that we provide in an appendix, can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>How to escape atypical regions in the symmetric binary perceptron: a journey through connected-solutions states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the binary symmetric perceptron model, and in particular its atypical solutions. While the solution-space of this problem is dominated by isolated configurations, it is also solvable for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. We provide in this paper a statistical measure probing sequences of solutions, where two consecutive elements shares a strong overlap. After simplifications, we test its predictions by comparing it to Monte-Carlo simulations. We obtain good agreement and show that connected states with a Markovian correlation profile can fully decorrelate from their initialization only for $\kappa&gt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$ ($\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}\sim \sqrt{0.91\log(N)}$ for $\alpha=0.5$ and $N$ being the dimension of the problem). For $\kappa&lt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$, we show that decorrelated sequences still exist but have a non-trivial correlations profile. To study this regime we introduce an $Ansatz$ for the correlations that we label as the nested Markov chain.</description>
