      <title>Similarity between the Multibrot set and the Julia set of correspondences at Misiurewicz points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fine structure of the parameter space of the unicritical family of algebraic correspondences $z^r + c$, where $r &gt; 1$ is a rational exponent. Building on Tan Lei's result regarding the similarity between the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets in the quadratic family, we prove that the Julia set of the correspondence is asymptotically self-similar about every Misiurewicz point.
  Assuming that the transversality condition holds at a Misiurewicz parameter $a \in \mathbb{C}$, we prove that the associated Multibrot set (which coincides with the Mandelbrot set when $ r =2$) is asymptotically similar to the Julia set about $a$. We provide an algebraic proof of the transversality condition when the correspondence is represented by the semigroup $\langle z^2 +c, -z^2+c \rangle. $ For general exponents, experimental evidence supports the transversality condition, with infinitely many small copies of the Multibrot set accumulating at every Misiurewicz parameter.</description>

      <title>Boundary of the central hyperbolic component II: boundary extension theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the boundary behavior of Milnor's parameterization $\Phi: \mathcal B_d\rightarrow \mathcal H_d$ of the central hyperbolic component $\mathcal H_d$ via Blaschke products. We establish a boundary extension theorem by giving a necessary and sufficient condition for $D\in \partial \mathcal B_d$ which allows $\Phi$-extension. Further we show that cusps are dense in a full Hausdorff dimensional subset of $\partial \mathcal H_d$, partially confirming a conjecture of McMullen.</description>

      <title>An $L^\infty$ Rashevskii-Chow Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a finite family $\{f_1,\dots,f_\nu\}$ of $C^\infty$ vector fields on a $n$-dimensional ($n\in\mathbb{N}$), smooth manifold $\mathcal{M}$. The celebrated Rashevskii-Chow theorem states that, provided the vector fields $\{f_1,\dots,f_\nu\}$, together with their iterated Lie brackets, span the whole tangent space at some $x_*\in\mathcal{M}$, then any $x$ in a neighborhood of $x_*$ can be connected to $x_*$ by means of a finite concatenation of integral curves of $\{\pm f_1,\dots,\pm f_\nu\}$. This result finds applications in a number of areas, e.g., in control theory, in Sub-Riemannian geometry, and the theory of degenerate elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, to mention a few. Here we extend this basic result to families of vector fields, which are considerably less regular, in particular, by allowing iterated Lie brackets to be just bounded measurable. This is technically made possible by the utilization of set-valued Lie brackets, which have already proven to be useful in extending commutativity type results, Frobenius' theorem, and also higher-order necessary conditions for optimal control problems, to the setting of non-smooth vector fields.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein convergence rates in the invariance principle for nonuniformly hyperbolic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain $q$-Wasserstein convergence rates in the invariance principle for nonuniformly hyperbolic flows, where $q\ge1$ depends on the degree of nonuniformity. Utilizing a martingale-coboundary decomposition for nonuniformly expanding semiflows, we extend techniques from the discrete-time setting to the continuous-time case. Our results apply to uniformly hyperbolic (Axiom A) flows, nonuniformly hyperbolic flows that can be modelled by suspensions over Young towers with exponential tails (such as dispersing billiard flows and the classical Lorenz attractor), and intermittent solenoidal flows.</description>

      <title>On exponential separation of analytic self-conformal sets on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article, Rapaport showed that the there is no dimension drop for exponentially separated analytic IFSs on the real line. We show that the set of such exponentially separated IFSs in the space of analytic IFSs contains an open and dense set in the $\mathcal{C}^2$ topology. Moreover, we give a sufficient condition for the IFS to be exponentially separated which allows us to construct explicit examples which are exponentially separated. The key technical tool is the introduction of the \textit{dual IFS} which we believe has significant interest in its own right. As an application we also characterise when an analytic IFS can be conjugated to a self-similar IFS.</description>

      <title>Chern character for torsion-free ample groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an ample groupoid with torsion-free stabilizers, we construct a Chern character map going from the domain of the Baum-Connes assembly map of G to the groupoid homology groups of G with rational coefficients. As a main application, assuming the (rational) Baum-Connes conjecture, we prove the rational form of Matui's HK conjecture, i.e., we show that the operator K-groups of the groupoid C*-algebra are rationally isomorphic to the periodicized groupoid homology groups. Our construction hinges on the recent $\infty$-categorical viewpoint on bivariant K-theory, and does not rely on typical noncommutative geometry tools such as the Chern-Connes character and the periodic cyclic homology of smooth algebras. We also present applications to the homology of hyperbolic dynamical systems, the homology of topological full groups, the homotopy type of the algebraic K-theory spectrum of ample groupoids, and the Elliott invariant of classifiable C*-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a formula to estimate the number of fixed points of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of a surface. When the homeomorphism satisfies a mild property called strong irreducibility, the log of the number of fixed points is coarsely equal to the Teichmuller translation length. We also discuss several applications, including an inequality relating the hyperbolic volume of a mapping torus to the rank of its Heegaard Floer homology.</description>

      <title>A quasi-energy function for Pixton diffeomorphisms defined by generalized Mazur knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we give a lower estimate for the number of critical points of the Lyapunov function for Pixton diffeomorphisms (i.e. Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms in dimension 3 whose chain recurrent set consists of four points: one source, one saddle and two sinks). Ch. Bonatti and V. Grines proved that the class of topological equivalence of such diffeomorphism $f$ is completely defined by the equivalency class of the Hopf knot $L_{f}$ that is the knot in the generating class of the fundamental group of the manifold $\mathbb S^2\times\mathbb S^1$. They also proved that there are infinitely many such classes and that any Hopf knot can be realized by a Pixton diffeomorphism. D.~Pixton proved that diffeomorphisms defined by the standard Hopf knot $L_0=\{s\}\times \mathbb S^1$ have an energy function (Lyapunov function) whose set of critical points coincide with the chain recurrent set whereas the set of critical points of any Lyapunov function for Pixton diffeomorphism with nontrivial (i.e. non equivalent to the standard) Hopf knot is strictly larger than the chain recurrent set of the diffeomorphism. The Lyapunov function for Pixton diffeomorphism with minimal number of critical points is called the quasi-energy function. In this paper we construct a quasi-energy function for Pixton diffeomorphisms defined by a generalized Mazur knot.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds and degeneration of Herman rings with bounded type rotation number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07794v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By adapting the near-degenerate regime designed by Kahn, Lyubich, and D. Dudko, we prove that the boundaries of Herman rings with bounded type rotation number and of the simplest configuration are quasicircles with dilatation depending only on the degree and the rotation number. As a consequence, we show that these Herman rings always degenerate to a Herman curve, i.e. an invariant Jordan curve that is not contained in the closure of a rotation domain and on which the map is conjugate to a rigid rotation. This process enables us to construct the first general examples of rational maps having Herman curves of bounded type with arbitrary degree and combinatorics. In particular, they do not come from Blaschke products. We also demonstrate the existence of Renormalization Theory for Herman curves by constructing rescaled limits of the first return maps in the unicritical case.</description>

      <title>A Complete Invariant for Flow Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimal flow spaces of dimension 1 are among the most fundamental limit sets in dynamical systems. These invariant sets occur as the typical minimal sets in surface flows, the minimal sets of suspensions of subshifts (for example, in Lorenz template models of the Lorenz attractor) and the hulls of repetitive tilings of dimension one. Here we establish a complete invariant for the flow equivalence of such objects. The invariant takes values in a category of `positive trope' classes of inverse sequences of free groups and positive maps, or alternatively within a certain category of symbolic systems. Moreover, every such symbolic system is realised by a flow space, and we thus have a one to one correspondence between flow equivalence classes of minimal flow spaces and positive trope classes of such systems. At the same time, this provides a complete invariant both for flow equivalence of minimal Z-Cantor dynamical systems and for germinal equivalence of minimal Z-Cantor systems. Our work thus greatly extends that of Barge and Diamond on their complete invariant of primitive substitution tilings, and provides counterpoint to the work of Giordano, Putnam and Skau on orbit equivalence of Z-Cantor systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Periodic Solutions for Newtonian Systems via Lyapunov Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes an existence theory for distributed periodic solutions to Newton's equation with stochastic time-periodic forcing, where the friction matrix is the Hessian of a twice continuously differentiable friction function. Employing the Khasminskii criterion and Lyapunov functions, we prove its existence under the assumptions that both the friction and potential functions tend to positive infinity at infinity, and their gradient inner product grows at least like an even-power polynomial. Provided the potential grows sufficiently fast at infinity, this result persists under bounded friction matrix perturbations. This largely confirms the stochastic Levinson conjecture proposed in [8] and resolves the open problem and the interesting problem posed in [8, P. 342].
  Distributed periodic solutions exist in two key cases:
  1. Polynomial Case: Both functions are polynomials with positive definite leading terms (a minimal condition for dissipation).
  2. Plasma Physics Case: The potential force is bounded, while the friction function has sufficiently high growth (as in many plasma physics models).</description>

Abstract: Let $F$ and $G$ be generalized H\'enon maps. We show that the Kato surfaces associated to the germs of $F$ and $G$ near infinity are biholomorphic if and only if $F$ and $G$ are conjugate in $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{C}^2)$. This answers a question raised by Favre in X\'enelkis de H\'enon's survey. Moreover, we describe all the Kato surfaces associated to the germ of a generalized H\'enon map near infinity.
  We also show that two generalized H\'enon maps are conjugate near infinity, if and only if they are affinely conjugate.</description>

      <title>Local Normalization Distortion and the Thermodynamic Formalism of Decoding Strategies for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in hardware and language model architecture have spurred a revolution in natural language generation. However, autoregressive models compute probability distributions over next-token choices, and sampling from these distributions, known as decoding, has received significantly less attention than other design choices. Existing decoding strategies are largely based on heuristics, resulting in methods that are difficult to apply or improve in a principled manner. We develop the theory of decoding strategies for language models by expressing popular decoding algorithms as equilibrium states in the language of ergodic theory and stating the objective functions they optimize. Using this, we analyze the effect of the local normalization step required to make probabilities sum to one in top-k, nucleus, and temperature sampling. We argue that local normalization distortion is a fundamental defect of decoding strategies and quantify the size of this distortion and its effect on mathematical proxies for the quality and diversity of generated text. This yields conclusions for the design of decoding algorithms and the detection of machine-generated text.</description>
