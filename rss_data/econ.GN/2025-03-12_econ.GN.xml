      <title>Impact of the Pandemic on Currency Circulation in Brazil: Projections using the SARIMA Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07876v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on currency circulation in Brazil by comparing actual data from 2000 to 2023 with counterfactual projections using the \textbf{SARIMA(3,1,1)(3,1,4)\textsubscript{12}} model. The model was selected based on an extensive parameter search, balancing accuracy and simplicity, and validated through the metrics MAPE, RMSE, and AIC. The results indicate a significant deviation between projected and observed values, with an average difference of R\$ 47.57 billion (13.95\%). This suggests that the pandemic, emergency policies, and the introduction of \textit{Pix} had a substantial impact on currency circulation. The robustness of the SARIMA model was confirmed, effectively capturing historical trends and seasonality, though findings emphasize the importance of considering exogenous variables, such as interest rates and macroeconomic policies, in future analyses. Future research should explore multivariate models incorporating economic indicators, long-term analysis of post-pandemic currency circulation trends, and studies on public cash-holding behavior. The results reinforce the need for continuous monitoring and econometric modeling to support decision-making in uncertain economic contexts.</description>

      <title>Hedonic Adaptation in the Age of AI: A Perspective on Diminishing Satisfaction Returns in Technology Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast paced progress of artificial intelligence (AI) through scaling laws connecting rising computational power with improving performance has created tremendous technological breakthroughs. These breakthroughs do not translate to corresponding user satisfaction improvements, resulting in a general mismatch. This research suggests that hedonic adaptation the psychological process by which people revert to a baseline state of happiness after drastic change provides a suitable model for understanding this phenomenon. We argue that user satisfaction with AI follows a logarithmic path, thus creating a longterm "satisfaction gap" as people rapidly get used to new capabilities as expectations. This process occurs through discrete stages: initial excitement, declining returns, stabilization, and sporadic resurgence, depending on adaptation rate and capability introduction. These processes have far reaching implications for AI research, user experience design, marketing, and ethics, suggesting a paradigm shift from sole technical scaling to methods that sustain perceived value in the midst of human adaptation. This perspective reframes AI development, necessitating practices that align technological progress with people's subjective experience.</description>

      <title>Inequality in a model of capitalist economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze inequality aspects of the agent-based model of capitalist economy named it Social Architecture of Capitalism that has been introduced by Ian Wright. The model contemplates two main types of agents, workers and capitalists, which can also be unemployed. Starting from a state where all agents are unemployed and possess the same initial wealth, the system, governed by a few simple rules, quickly self-organizes into two classes. After a transient, the model reproduces the statistics of many relevant macroeconomic quantities of real economies worldwide, notably the two regimes of the distributions of wealth and income. We perform extensive simulations testing the role of the model parameters (number of agents, total wealth, and salary range) on the resulting distribution of wealth and income, the social distribution of agents, and other stylized facts of the dynamics. Our main finding is that, according to the model, in an economy where total wealth is conserved and with a fixed average wage, the increase in wealth per capita comes with more inequality.</description>
