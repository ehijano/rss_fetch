      <title>KWT-Tiny: RISC-V Accelerated, Embedded Keyword Spotting Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the adaptation of Transformerbased models for edge devices through the quantisation and hardware acceleration of the ARM Keyword Transformer (KWT) model on a RISC-V platform. The model was targeted to run on 64kB RAM in bare-metal C using a custom-developed edge AI library. KWT-1 was retrained to be 369 times smaller, with only a 10% loss in accuracy through reducing output classes from 35 to 2. The retraining and quantisation reduced model size from 2.42 MB to 1.65 kB. The integration of custom RISC-V instructions that accelerated GELU and SoftMax operations enabled a 5x speedup and thus ~5x power reduction in inference, with inference clock cycle counts decreasing from 26 million to 5.5 million clock cycles while incurring a small area overhead of approximately 29%. The results demonstrate a viable method for porting and accelerating Transformer-based models in low-power IoT devices.</description>

      <title>Active Admission Control in a P2P Distributed Environment for Capacity Efficient Livestreaming in Mobile Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, the Active Control in an Intelligent and Distributed Environment (ACIDE) media distribution model solution and algorithms are proposed for livestreaming in capacity efficient mobile wireless networks. The elements of the ACIDE model are a base station and a cluster formed by a number of peers able to establish peer to peer communications. The cluster peers are selected from a group of users interested in livestreaming the same media. The ACIDE model solution minimizes the bandwidth allocated to a cluster of n peers such that an uninterrupted media play for all peers is guaranteed. The livestream media is sent to the peers in packages and every media package is divided into n blocks. The blocks are distributed to the n peers of a cluster in two phases, such that the base station bandwidth is utilized during first phase only. The allocated bandwidth, the amount of bandwidth the base station has to allocate to a cluster, is minimized and its lower bound is equal to the bandwidth required for multicasting. In this study, the ACIDE model is used to address the problem of how to find the maximum number of peers n, chosen from a group of N users, that can be admitted to a cluster knowing the given allocated bandwidth, the amount of bandwidth that a base station allocates to a cluster in advance, prior to admitting users. When users become peers of an ACIDE cluster, the network capacity, the total number of users who are able to access live media, increases meaning that network resources are used more efficiently. The problem of finding the maximum number of peers n is addressed as an optimization problem, with the objective of having the entire given allocated bandwidth used by the peers admitted to the cluster. This problem is NP-complete and a non-optimal solution is proposed for peers selection such that all admitted peers play media continuously.</description>
