      <title>Enforced Gaplessness from States with Exponentially Decaying Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that an exponentially localized Hamiltonian must be gapless if its ground state has algebraic correlations. We show that even certain exponentially decaying correlations can imply gaplessness. This is exemplified by the deformed toric code $\propto \exp(\beta \sum_{\ell} Z_{\ell}) |\mathsf{TC}\rangle$, where $|\mathsf{TC}\rangle$ is a fixed-point toric code wavefunction. Although it has a confined regime for $\beta &gt; \beta_c$, recent work has drawn attention to its perimeter law loop correlations. Here, we show that these unusual loop correlations -- namely, perimeter law coexisting with a 1-form symmetry whose disorder operator has long-range order -- imply that any local parent Hamiltonian must either be gapless or have a degeneracy scaling with system size. Moreover, we construct a variational low-energy state for arbitrary local frustration-free Hamiltonians, upper bounding the finite-size gap by $O(1/L^3)$ on periodic boundary conditions. Strikingly, these variational states look like loop waves -- non-quasiparticle analogs of spin waves -- generated from the ground state by non-local loop operators. Our findings have implications for identifying the subset of Hilbert space to which gapped ground states belong, and the techniques have wide applicability. For instance, a corollary of our first result is that Glauber dynamics for the ordered phase of the two-dimensional classical Ising model on the torus must have a gapless Markov transition matrix, with our second result bounding its gap.</description>

      <title>Tunable Non-Equilibrium Magic and Minimum Twist Angles in AA-Stacked Twisted Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a series of non-equilibrium magic angles at which isolated topological flat quasienergy bands form in AA-stacked twisted multilayer graphene under circularly polarized light. These non-equilibrium magic angles can be traced back to specific static twist angles where the bandwidth reaches a minimum \textit{without} the formation of isolated flat bands. We refer to these as minimum twist angles, in contrast to the magic angles observed in twisted bilayer graphene. We show that an applied displacement field can further flatten the optically induced topological flat bands accompanied by larger non-equilibrium magic angles. The discovery of these electrically tunable topological flat quasienergy bands is expected to open up a new avenue of exploring exotic Floquet-driven phenomena in AA-stacked twisted multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of a coupled trimer system at half filling using the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat band systems have recently attracted significant attention due to their instability under small perturbations, which can lead to the stabilization of many exotic quantum phases. We study a trimer ladder which shows a middle flat band in the absence of onsite Coulomb interaction. We investigate the quantum phases of the Hubbard model on this geometry using exact diagonalization (ED), density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and perturbation theory. We construct a quantum phase diagram in the plane of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameter $t_2$ and onsite Coulomb interaction $U$, revealing five distinct quantum phases. At low $U$ and moderate to high magnitude of $t_2$, the system exhibits metallic behavior, while at large $U$ and small magnitude of $t_2$, it transitions to a ferrimagnetic insulator phase, similar to those observed in certain trimer materials. In the small $t_2$ limit, the Fermi energy is in the flat band, leading to localization of the electrons within the trimer. At low $U$ and small magnitude of $t_2$, the flat band mechanism favors insulating ferrimagnetism, whereas at large $U$, ferrimagnetic states emerge from singlet dimer formation between neighboring sites of a trimer and an isolated corner spin, which connect ferromagnetically. The insulating cell spin density wave phase displays an up-up-down-down spin configuration due to competing nearest neighbor hopping, $t_1$. Interestingly, in moderate $U$ and $|t_2|&gt;0.3$, the ground state behaves like metallic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid.</description>

      <title>Light Control of Triplet Pairing in Correlated Electrons with Mixed-Sign Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-triplet superconductivity is a key platform for topological quantum computing, yet its experimental realization and control in solid-state materials remain a significant challenge. For this purpose, we propose an ultrafast optical strategy to manipulate spin-triplet superconductivity by leveraging $p$-wave pairing instabilities in the extended Hubbard model, a framework applicable to transition-metal oxides. Utilizing Floquet engineering, we demonstrate that transient flipping of the effective spin-exchange interaction can enhance $p$-wave pairing correlations under linearly polarized optical pulses. Furthermore, we reveal that this emergent spin-triplet pairing in strongly correlated systems can be selectively switched by an orthogonal optical pulse. This work provides a new pathway for stabilizing and controlling spin-triplet superconductivity in correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Systematic Mapping of Altermagnetic Magnons by Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Circular Dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a unique class of magnetic materials that combines features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, have garnered attention for their potential in spintronics and magnonics. While the electronic properties of altermagnets have been well studied, characterizing their magnon excitations is essential for fully understanding their behavior and enabling practical device applications. In this work, we introduce a measurement protocol combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) with circular polarization and azimuthal scanning to probe the chiral nature of the altermagnetic split magnon modes in CrSb. This approach circumvents the challenges posed by domain averaging in macroscopic samples, allowing for precise measurements of the polarization and energy of the magnons in individual antiferromagnetic domains. Our findings demonstrate a pronounced circular dichroism in the magnon peaks, with an azimuthal dependence that directly confirms the theoretical predictions. By establishing a reliable and accessible method for probing altermagnetic magnons, this work opens new avenues for fundamental studies of these collective excitations and for developing next-generation magnonic device applications.</description>

      <title>Identifying two-dimensional topological phase transition by entanglement spectrum : A fermion Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among many types of quantum entanglement properties, the entanglement spectrum provides more abundant information than other observables. Exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group method could handle the system in one-dimension properly, while in higher dimension, it exceeds the capacity of the algorithms. To expand the ability of existing numerical methods, we takes a different approach via quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. By exploiting particle number and spin symmetry, we realize an efficient algorithms to solve the entanglement spectrum in the interacting fermionic system. Taking two-dimensional interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger as example, we verify the existence of topological phase transition under different types of many-body interactions. The calculated particle number distribution and wave-function of entanglement Hamiltonian indicate that the two belong distinct types of topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Flat band driven itinerant magnetism in the Co-pnictides (La,Ca)Co$_2$(As,P)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands can induce strong electron correlation effects that help stabilize both magnetic and superconducting states. Here, we carry out angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to study the electronic structure of the Co-pnictides CaCo$_2$As$_2$ and LaCo$_2$P$_2$. We find that, while the $k_z$ Fermi topology of ferromagnetic LaCo$_2$P$_2$ is markedly 2-dimensional, antiferromagnetic CaCo$_2$As$_2$ develops a 3D Fermi surface described by a $zig-zag$-like band dispersion perpendicular to the Co-As plane. Furthermore, the magnetism is driven by the electronic correlations of the flat bands with $d_{xy}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbital character at the Fermi level. Our results link the electronic dimensionality and the magnetic order, and emphasize the critical role of the As-As and P-P bond strength along the $c$-direction to understand the electronic band structure and the rich phase diagram of transition metal pnictides.</description>

      <title>Melting of devil's staircases in the long-range Dicke-Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present quantum phase diagrams for the antiferromagnetic long-range Ising model with a linear coupling to a single bosonic mode on the square and triangular lattice. For zero coupling, the ground-state magnetization forms a devil's staircase structure of magnetization plateaux as a function of a longitudinal field. Apart from a paramagnetic superradiant phase with a finite photon density at strong light-matter couplings, the long-range interactions lead to a plethora of intermediate phases that break the translational symmetry and have a finite photon density at the same time. We apply an adaption of the unit-cell-based mean-field calculations, which captures all possible magnetic unit cells up to a chosen extent. Further, we exploit an exact mapping of the non-superradiant phases to an effective Dicke model to calculate upper bounds for phase transitions towards superradiant phases. Finally, to treat quantum fluctuations in a quantitative fashion, we employ a generalized wormhole quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. We discuss how these three methods are used in a cooperative fashion. In the calculated phase diagrams we see several features arising from the long-range interactions: The devil's staircases of distinct magnetically ordered normal phases and non-trivial magnetically ordered superradiant phases beyond the findings for nearest-neighbor interactions. Examples are a superradiant phase with a three-sublattice magnetic order on the square lattice and the superradiant Wigner crystal with four sites per unit cell on the triangular lattice. We find the transition between normal and superradiant phases with the same (different) magnetic order to be of second order with Dicke universality (first order). Further, between superradiant phases we find first-order phase transitions, besides specially highlighted regimes for which we find indications for second-order behavior.</description>

      <title>Ground State of $\mathrm{SU}\left(3\right)$ spin model on the checkerboard lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric frustration in quantum spin systems can lead to exotic ground states. In this study, we investigate the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ spin model on the checkerboard lattice to explore the effects of frustration arising from its point-connected $(N+1)$-site local structure. We employ density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and exact diagonalization (ED) techniques to determine the ground state properties. Our results reveal the absence of both 3-sublattice antiferromagnetic order and valence cluster solid order. Instead, we identify ground states with bond stripe patterns sensitive to boundary conditions and system size, comprising staggered singlet arrays and uniform flat stripes. Notably, these stripes are relatively decoupled, and similar patterns can be reconstructed in quasi-one-dimensional ladders. These findings suggest that geometric frustration drives the system toward a mixed phase, combining characteristics of spin-liquid and valence cluster solid states, providing new insights into the behavior of frustrated quantum spin systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement the recently developed influence functional matrix product states approach as impurity solver in equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations of the single-band Hubbard model. The method yields numerically exact descriptions of metallic states without sharp spectral features, at a moderate numerical cost. Systems with narrow quasiparticle or spin-polaron peaks, as well as low-temperature Mott insulators provide more challenges, since these simulations require long time contours or high bond dimensions. A promising field of application is the DMFT simulation of nonequilibrium steady states, which we demonstrate with results for photo-doped Mott systems with long-lived doublon and holon populations.</description>

      <title>Variety of Superradiant Phase Transition in Bose-Fermi System with Tight-Binding Model in the weak-coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a full exploration of the dynamic diversity inherent in superradiant phase transitions within a one-dimensional tight-binding electronic chain that is intricately coupled to a single-mode optical cavity. By employing a quantized electromagnetic vector potential via the Peierls substitution, this gauge-coupled Bose-Fermi system facilitates momentum-dependent superradiant transitions. These transitions are characterized by the displacement of the cavity mode and the redistribution of electronic momentum, thereby circumventing the second-order spurious phase transitions typically observed in Dicke-like models. Distinct from multimode cavity QED systems with atomic gases, the single-mode optical configuration unveils a range of nonlinear phenomena, including multistability and varied spontaneous symmetry breaking. This configuration enables the precise manipulation of superradiant phases in weak coupling regimes, devoid of the quantum fluctuation divergence. Our findings advance the understanding of tunable quantum devices and highlight potential applications in quantum information processing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Bosonizations and dualities in 2+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss two methods for relating bosonic and fermionic relativistic field theories in 2+1 dimensions, the $Z_2^f$ gauging and the flux attachment. The first is primarily a correspondence between topological theories. It amounts to summing over fermionic spin structures, as is familiar in two-dimensional conformal theories. Its inverse map, fermionization, shows how spin structures and $Z_2^f$ fermion parity emerge from a bosonic theory equipped with a dual $Z_2^{(1)}$ generalized symmetry. The second method,flux attachment, gives spin and statistics to charged particles by coupling them to a Chern-Simons theory, and provides the basis for the Abelian dualities. We illustrate the two bosonizations with explicit results in a solvable semiclassical conformal theory, and show their differences and interplays with particle-vortex dualities. We employ the so-called loop model, which can describe general infrared critical points in 2+1 dimensions in the semiclassical limit. We also combine the two bosonizations to obtain further duality relations. By applying $Z_2^f$ gauging to the Dirac-boson and Majorana-boson flux-attachment dualities, we find new relations between bosonic theories.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric Control of Helical Light Emission in a Moir\'e Chern Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric effects and their coupling to light helicity are important for both fundamental science and applications in sensing, communication, and data storage. Traditional approaches require complex device architectures, involving separate spin-injection, ferromagnetic, and optically active layers. Recently, the emergence of 2D semiconductor moir\'e superlattices with flat Chern bands and strong light-matter interactions has established a simple yet powerful platform for exploring the coupling between photon, electron, and spin degrees of freedom. Here, we report efficient current control of spontaneous ferromagnetism and associated helicity of light emission in moir\'e MoTe2 bilayer - a system which hosts a rich variety of topological phases, including newly discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators. We show that the current control is effective over a wide range of doping of the first moir\'e Chern band, implying the uniformity of the Berry curvature distribution over the flat band. By setting the system into the anomalous Hall metal phase, a current as small as 10nA is sufficient to switch the magnetic order, a substantial improvement over both conventional spin torque architectures and other moir\'e systems. The realized current control of ferromagnetism leads to continuous tuning of trion photoluminescence helicity from left to right circular via spin/valley Hall torque at zero magnetic field. Our results pave the way for topological opto-spintronics based on semiconductors with synthetic flat Chern bands.</description>

Abstract: Donor-based quantum devices in silicon are attractive platforms for universal quantum computing and analog quantum simulations. The nearly-atomic precision in dopant placement promises great control over the quantum properties of these devices. We present atomistic calculations and a detailed analysis of many-electron states in a single phosphorus atom and selected phosphorus dimers in silicon. Our self-consistent method involves atomistic calculations of the electron energies utilizing representative tight-binding Hamiltonians, computations of Coulomb and exchange integrals without any reference to an atomic orbital set, and solutions to the associated Hartree-Fock equations. First, we assess the quality of our tight-binding Hartree-Fock protocol against Configuration-Interaction calculations for two electrons in a single phosphorus atom, finding that our formalism provides an accurate estimation of the electron-electron repulsion energy requiring smaller computational boxes and single-electron wavefunctions. Then, we compute charging and binding energies in phosphorus dimers observing their variation as a function of impurity-impurity separation. Our calculations predict an antiferromagnetic ground state for the two-electron system and a weakly bound three-electron state in the range of separations considered. We rationalize these results in terms of the single-electron energies, charging energies, and the wavefunction reshaping.</description>

      <title>Canted antiferromagnetism in a spin-orbit coupled $S_{\text{eff}} = 3/2$ triangular-lattice magnet DyAuGe</title>

Abstract: Exploration of nontrivial magnetic states induced by strong spin-orbit interaction is a central topic of frustrated magnetism. Extensive studies are concentrated on rare-earth-based magnets and 4d/5d transition metal compounds, which are mostly described by an effective spin $S_{\text{eff}} = 1/2$ for the Kramers doublet of the lowest crystal-electric-field levels. Variety of magnetic orderings may be greatly enhanced when magnetic dipolar moments intertwined with multipolar degrees of freedom which are described by higher-rank tensors and often require the magnetic ions with $S_{\text{eff}} &gt; 1/2$. Here, our synchrotron x-ray diffraction near the Dy $L_3$ edge has unveiled a canted antiferromagnetic ground state arising from a quasi-quartet ($S_{\text{eff}} = 3/2$) of 4f electrons in a triangular-lattice (TL) rare-earth intermetallics DyAuGe. Magnetic moment and electric-quadrupole moment are closely interlocked and noncollinear magnetic-dipole alignment is induced by antiferroic electric-quadrupole (AFQ) ordering in the TL layers. The correlation between the AFQ and canted magnetic structures is further confirmed by phase transitions in an in-plane magnetic field. These findings offer insights into the emergence of nontrivial magnetic states in frustrated TL systems described beyond the $S_{\text{eff}} = 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Moment method and continued fraction expansion in Floquet Operator Krylov Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recursion methods such as Krylov techniques map complex dynamics to an effective non-interacting problem in one dimension. For example, the operator Krylov space for Floquet dynamics can be mapped to the dynamics of an edge operator of the one-dimensional Floquet inhomogeneous transverse field Ising model (ITFIM), where the latter, after a Jordan-Wigner transformation, is a Floquet model of non-interacting Majorana fermions, and the couplings correspond to Krylov angles. We present an application of this showing that a moment method exists where given an autocorrelation function, one can construct the corresponding Krylov angles, and from that the corresponding Floquet-ITFIM. Consequently, when no solutions for the Krylov angles are obtained, it indicates that the autocorrelation is not generated by unitary dynamics. We highlight this by studying certain special cases: stable $m$-periodic dynamics derived using the method of continued fractions, exponentially decaying and power-law decaying stroboscopic dynamics. Remarkably, our examples of stable $m$-periodic dynamics correspond to $m$-period edge modes for the Floquet-ITFIM where deep in the chain, the couplings correspond to a critical phase. Our results pave the way to engineer Floquet systems with desired properties of edge modes and also provide examples of persistent edge modes in gapless Floquet systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anisotropic quantum spin-1/2 XY model on a linear chain was solved by Lieb, Schultz, and Mattis in 1961 and shown to display a continuous quantum phase transition at the O(2) symmetric point separating two gapped phases with competing Ising long-range order. For the square lattice, the following is known. The two competing Ising ordered phases extend to finite temperatures, up to a boundary where a transition to the paramagnetic phase occurs, and meet at the O(2) symmetric critical line along the temperature axis that ends at a tricritical point at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature where the two competing phases meet the paramagnetic phase. We show that the first-order zero-temperature (quantum) phase transition that separates the competing phases as a function of the anisotropy parameter is smoothed by thermal fluctuations into deconfined classical criticality.</description>

      <title>Two-Peak Heat Capacity Accounts for $R\ln(2)$ Entropy and Ground State Access in the Dipole-Octupole Pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high-quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K are reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However a second, sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, which signifies the entrance to its ground state, as even the most abrupt low-temperature extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K gives a full accounting of $R\ln(2)$ in entropy, associated with the well isolated pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$, at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$, for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical spin liquid to a quantum spin liquid (QSL). The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI).</description>

      <title>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16417v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a 'large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed 'small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. Critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the FL-SDW quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the 'foot' of strange metal transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.
  However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the 'fan' of strange metal behavior of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and the pseudogap metal is described by thermal fluctuations above a 'fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*) or a 'holon metal', with the descriptions related by a duality on a background spin liquid. The quantum critical fan is described using a field theory for an underlying FL-FL* quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder. This field theory can be mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully models linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations in the quantum critical fan.
  The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we present a theoretical study in the context of photovoltaic (PV) and thermoelectric (TE) applications of ScAgC. The electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties have been investigated systematically using density functional theory (DFT) and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. DFT calculates a direct band gap of 0.47 eV, whereas the $G_{0}W_{0}$ method estimates a band gap of 1.01 eV. We used parabola fitting to estimate the effective mass values for bands B1 to B4 at $\Gamma$-point, which are -0.087 (-0.075), -0.17 (-0.27), -0.17 (-0.27), and 0.049 (0.058) along the $\Gamma$-$X$ ($\Gamma$-$L$) direction, respectively. Furthermore, the optoelectronic properties are calculated and analyzed over an energy range of 0 to 10 eV. The optical conductivity, refractive index, and dielectric function show strong optical transitions in the visible region. The lowest calculated reflectivity is 0.24 at 4.7 eV, and the highest calculated value of the absorption coefficient is $1.7\times10^{6}$ cm$^{-1}$ at $8.5$ eV. At 300 K, we expect a maximum solar efficiency (SLME) of 33\% at a thickness of $1~\mu$m. The lattice part of the thermal conductivity shows a maximum value of 3.8 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at $1200$ K. At 1200 K, for electron doping of $3.9\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$, the maximum value of $S^{2}\sigma /\tau$ is $145 \times 10^{14}$ $\mu$WK$^{-2}$cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, while for hole doping of $1.5\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$, it is $123 \times 10^{14}$ $\mu$WK$^{-2}$cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. The highest $ZT$ at $1200$ K is expected to be $0.53$, whereas the optimal efficiency is predicted to be $8.5\%$ for cold and hot temperatures of $300$ K and $1200$ K, respectively. The collected results suggest that the ScAgC compound is a potential candidate for renewable energy sources such as solar cell and TE applications</description>

Abstract: We consider a system of interacting fermions on the three-dimensional torus in a mean-field scaling limit. Our objective is computing the occupation number of the Fourier modes in a trial state obtained through the random phase approximation (in its collective bosonization formulation) for the ground state. We prove that the trial state's momentum distribution has a jump discontinuity, i.e., a well-defined Fermi surface. Moreover the Fermi momentum does not depend on the interaction potential (it is universal). Our result shows that the random phase approximation in the mean-field scaling limit is in principle sufficiently precise to identify a non-trivial Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Ephemeral Superconductivity Atop the False Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A many body system in the vicinity of a first-order phase transition may get trapped in a local minimum of the free energy landscape. These so-called false-vacuum states may survive for exceedingly long times if the barrier for their decay is high enough. The rich phase diagram obtained in graphene multilayer devices presents a unique opportunity to explore transient superconductivity on top of a correlated false vacuum. Specifically, we consider superconductors which are terminated by an apparent first-order phase transition to a correlated phase with different symmetry. We propose that quenching across this transition leads to a non-equilibrium ephemeral superconductor, readily detectable using straightforward transport measurements. Besides enabling a simple detection scheme, the transient superconductor also generically enhances the false vacuum lifetime, potentially by orders of magnitude. In several scenarios, the complimentary effect takes place as well: superconductivity is temporarily emboldened in the false vacuum, albeit ultimately decaying. We demonstrate the applicability of these claims for two different instances of superconductivity terminated by a first order transition in rhombohedral graphene. The obtained decay timescales position this class of materials as a promising playground to unambiguously realize and measure non-equilibrium superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel multi-scale embedding scheme that links conventional QM/MM embedding and bootstrap embedding (BE) to allow simulations of large chemical systems on limited quantum devices. We also propose a mixed-basis BE scheme that facilitates BE calculations on extended systems using classical computers with limited memory resources. Benchmark data suggest the combination of these two strategies as a robust path in attaining the correlation energies of large realistic systems, combining the proven accuracy of BE with chemical and biological systems of interest in a lower computational cost method. Due to the flexible tunability of the resource requirements and systematic fragment construction, future developments in the realization of quantum computers naturally offer improved accuracy for multi-scale BE calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article reports the synthesis of a single crystalline gray Arsenic (As) via the Bismuth flux method. The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern revealed the single phase of the grown crystal, which crystallized in the rhombohedral structure with the space group R3m. The sharp XRD peaks observed on mechanically exfoliated thin flakes of the same ensured high crystallinity of the same with growth direction along the c-axis. The resistivity measurements illustrated its metallic nature throughout, right from 300K down to 2K. The measured residual resistivity ratio of the sample is 180, which endorses the high metallic nature of the as-synthesized As single crystal. The transverse magnetic field-dependent resistivity (RH) measurements elucidated huge magneto-resistance (MR) at 2K and 14Tesla transverse magnetic fields. Also seen are the SDH oscillations, indicating the presence of topological surface states. The non-trivial band topology and edge states in As are confirmed by first principle calculations.</description>

Abstract: This comment critically examines the claims made in arXiv papers arXiv:2501.17230 and arXiv:2502.00103, which argue that a multiplicity of polar optical phonons can generate a long-range attractive interaction via a generalized Frohlich coupling. I identify a fundamental flaw in their derivation, showing that their result relies on an unphysical assumption--specifically, neglecting the intermode Coulomb interactions between different polar optical phonons. By restoring these missing interactions I show the screened Coulomb interaction is always repulsive in the static limit.</description>
