      <title>Integrability of the sub-Riemannian geodesic flow of the left-invariant metric on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two different classes of normal geodesic flows corresponding to the left-invariant sub-Riemannian metric on the $(2n+1)$-dimensional Heisenberg group. The first class corresponds to the left-invariant distribution, while the second corresponds to the right-invariant one. We prove that corresponding Hamiltonian L-L and L-R systems are completely integrable.</description>

      <title>The G\"odel Universe as the Lie Group with left-invariant Lorentz metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The author studies the G\"odel Universe as the Lie group with left-invariant Lorentz metric. The expressions for timelike and isotropic geodesics in elementary functions are found by methods of geometric theory of optimal control for the search of geodesics on Lie groups with left-invariant (sub-)Lorentz metrics. It is proved that the G\"odel Universe has no closed timelike or isotropic geodesics.</description>

      <title>Twisted Adiabatic Limit for Complex Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a complex manifold $X$ and a smooth positive function $\eta$ thereon, we perturb the standard differential operator $d=\partial + \bar\partial$ acting on differential forms to a first-order differential operator $D_\eta$ whose principal part is $\eta\partial + \bar\partial$. The role of the zero-th order part is to force the integrability property $D_\eta^2=0$ that leads to a cohomology isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology of $X$, while the components of types $(0,\,1)$ and $(1,\,0)$ of $D_\eta$ induce cohomologies isomorphic to the Dolbeault and conjugate-Dolbeault cohomologies. We compute Bochner-Kodaira-Nakano-type formulae for the Laplacians induced by these operators and a given Hermitian metric on $X$. The computations throw up curvature-like operators of order one that can be made (semi-)positive under appropriate assumptions on the function $\eta$. As applications, we obtain vanishing results for certain harmonic spaces on complete, non-compact, manifolds and for the Dolbeault cohomology of compact complex manifolds that carry certain types of functions $\eta$. This study continues and generalises the one of the operators $d_h=h\partial + \bar\partial$ that we introduced and investigated recently for a positive constant $h$ that was then let to converge to $0$ and, more generally, for constants $h\in\C$. The operators $d_h$ had, in turn, been adapted to complex structures from the well-known adiabatic limit construction for Riemannian foliations. Allowing now for possibly non-constant functions $\eta$ creates positivity in the curvature-like operator that stands one in good stead for various kinds of applications.</description>

      <title>Deformations of the scalar curvature of a partially integrable pseudohermitian manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider deformations of the scalar curvature of a partially integrable pseudohermitian manifold, in analogy with the work of Fischer and Marsden on Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we introduce and discuss $R$-singular spaces, give sufficient conditions for the stability of the scalar curvature, and give a partial infinitesimal rigidity result for the scalar curvature of a compact, torsion-free, scalar-flat, integrable pseudohermitian manifold.</description>

      <title>Models of $2$-nondegenerate CR hypersurface in $\mathbb{C}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every point in a uniformly $2$-nondegenerate CR hypersurface is canonically associated with a model $2$-nondegenerate structure. The $2$-nondegenerate models are basic CR invariants playing the same fundamental role as quadrics do in the Levi nondegenerate case. We characterize all $2$-nondegenerate models and show that the moduli space of such hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^N$ is infinite dimensional for each $N&gt;3$. We derive a normal form for these models' defining equations that is unique up to an action of a finite dimensional Lie group. We generalize recently introduced CR invariants termed modified symbols, and show how to compute these intrinsically defined invariants from a model's defining equation. We show that these models automatically possess infinitesimal symmetries spanning a complement to their Levi kernel and derive explicit formulas for them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A direct reformulation of the Hamiltonian formalism in terms of the intrinsic geometry of infinitely prolonged differential equations is obtained. Concepts of spatial equation and spatial-gauge symmetry of a Lagrangian system of equations are introduced. A non-covariant canonical variational principle is proposed and demonstrated using the Maxwell equations as an example. A covariant canonical variational principle is formulated. The results obtained are applicable to any variational equations, including those that do not originate in physics.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Lipschitz Sandwich Theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the consequence of two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions, in the sense of Stein, being close throughout a subset of their domain. A particular consequence of our results is the following. Given $K_0 &gt; \varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\gamma &gt; \eta &gt; 0$ there is a constant $\delta = \delta(\gamma,\eta,\varepsilon,K_0) &gt; 0$ for which the following is true. Let $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be closed and $f , h : \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$ be Lip$(\gamma)$ functions whose Lip$(\gamma)$ norms are both bounded above by $K_0$. Suppose $B \subset \Sigma$ is closed and that $f$ and $h$ coincide throughout $B$. Then over the set of points in $\Sigma$ whose distance to $B$ is at most $\delta$ we have that the Lip$(\eta)$ norm of the difference $f-h$ is bounded above by $\varepsilon$. More generally, we establish that this phenomenon remains valid in a less restrictive Banach space setting under the weaker hypothesis that the two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions $f$ and $h$ are only close in a pointwise sense throughout the closed subset $B$. We require only that the subset $\Sigma$ be closed; in particular, the case that $\Sigma$ is finite is covered by our results. The restriction that $\eta &lt; \gamma$ is sharp in the sense that our result is false for $\eta := \gamma$.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of Courant-type nodal domain bounds for eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a compact manifold $\mathcal M$ with boundary of dimension $n\geq 3$ and any integers $K$ and $N$, we show that there exists a metric on $\mathcal M$ for which the first $K$ nonconstant eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on $\partial\mathcal M$ have at least $N$ nodal components. This provides a negative answer to the question of whether the number of nodal domains of Dirichlet-to-Neumann eigenfunctions satisfies a Courant-type bound, which has been featured in recent surveys by Girouard and Polterovich [21, Open problem 9] and by Colbois, Girouard, Gordon and Sher [9, Open question 10.14].</description>

      <title>On the Betti Numbers of Finite Volume Hyperbolic Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.11431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain strong upper bounds for the Betti numbers of compact complex-hyperbolic manifolds. We use the unitary holonomy to improve the results given by the most direct application of the techniques of [DS17]. We also provide effective upper bounds for Betti numbers of compact quaternionic- and Cayley-hyperbolic manifolds in most degrees. More importantly, we extend our techniques to complete finite volume real- and complex-hyperbolic manifolds. In this setting, we develop new monotonicity inequalities for strongly harmonic forms on hyperbolic cusps and employ a new peaking argument to estimate $L^2$-cohomology ranks. Finally, we provide bounds on the de Rham cohomology of such spaces, using a combination of our bounds on $L^2$-cohomology, bounds on the number of cusps in terms of the volume, and the topological interpretation of reduced $L^2$-cohomology on certain rank one locally symmetric spaces.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a survey (may be incomplete) on partial Nambu-Poisson structures in infinite dimension, mainly in the convenient setting. These ones can be seen as a generalization of both partial Poisson and Nambu-Poisson structures. We also study the properties of the associated characteristic distribution. Finally, we are interested in the projective and direct limits of such structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.09894v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study $3^{\mathrm{rd}}$ order (system of) PDEs in two independent variables $x,y$ and one unknown function $u$ that are invariant with respect to the group of affine transformation $\mathrm{Aff}(3)$ of $\mathbb{R}^3=\{(x,y,u)\}$. After proving their relationship with the Fubini-Pick invariant, we derive the aforementioned PDEs by using a general method introduced in [D.V. Alekseevsky, J. Gutt, G. Manno, and G. Moreno: A general method to construct invariant {PDEs} on homogeneous manifolds. Communications in Contemporary Mathematics (2021)], which sheds light on some of their geometrical properties.</description>

      <title>Horizontal $\Delta$-semimartingales on orthonormal frame bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.04824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we deal with stochastic horizontal lifts and anti-developments of semimartingales with jumps on complete and connected Riemannian manifolds without any assumption for their curvatures. We prove two one-to-one correspondences among some classes of discontinuous semimartingales on Riemannian manifolds, orthonormal frame bundles and Euclidean spaces by using the stochastic differential geometry with jumps introduced by Cohen (1996). Both of these two results are extension of the one shown in Pontier-Estrade (1992). The first result is the correspondence in the case where jumps of semimartingales are regarded as initial velocities of geodesics which are not necessarily minimal. In the second result, we also established the correspondence in the situation where jumps of semimartingales are given by connection rules, but we impose the condition that the jumps of semimartingales are small. The latter result enables us to construct martingales for a given connection rule with small jumps on any compact manifold from local martingales on a Euclidean space through horizontal semimartingales on orthonormal semimartingales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.12802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing on work of Berndtsson and of Lempert and Sz\H{o}ke, we define a kind of complex analytic structure for families of (possibly finite-dimensional) Hilbert spaces that might not fit together to form a holomorphic vector bundle but nevertheless have a reasonable definition of curvature that agrees with the curvature of the Chern connection when the family of Hilbert spaces is locally trivial. We thus obtain a new proof of a celebrated theorem of Berndtsson on the curvature of direct images of semi-positively twisted relative canonical bundles (i.e., adjoint bundles), and of its higher-rank generalization due to Liu and Yang.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing recent mathematical advances in proving stability of Minkowski spacetime with minimal decay rates and nonlinear stability of Kerr black holes with small angular momentum, we investigate the detailed asymptotic behaviors of gravitational waves generated in these spacetimes. Here we report and propose a new angular momentum memory effect along future null infinity. This accompanies Christodoulou's nonlinear displacement memory effect and the spin memory effect. The connections and differences to these effects are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>
