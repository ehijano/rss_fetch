      <title>changepointGA: An R package for Fast Changepoint Detection via Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic algorithm (GA) are stochastic search techniques designed to address combinatorial optimization problems by mimicking the principles of natural selection and evolution. GAs have proven effective in both single and multiple changepoint analyses within time series data, where each chromosome encodes the hyperparameters, number, and locations of changepoints, along with the associated model parameters. Starting with a population of potential changepoint configurations, GAs utilize genetic operators -- selection, crossover, and mutation -- to evolve toward solutions with enhanced fitness. This paper presents the R package changepointGA, which encodes changepoint chromosomes in an integer format. Furthermore, changepointGA facilitates the dynamic and simultaneous estimation of changepoint models hyperparameters, changepoint configurations, and model parameters, leading to more robust and accurate analyses. Several simulation studies and real-world applications are discussed to illustrate the package capabilities.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Exploration of Real Varieties via Variety Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear systems of polynomial equations arise naturally in many applied settings, for example loglinear models on contingency tables and Gaussian graphical models. The solution sets to these systems over the reals are often positive dimensional spaces that in general may be very complicated yet have very nice local behavior almost everywhere. Standard methods in real algebraic geometry for describing positive dimensional real solution sets include cylindrical algebraic decomposition and numerical cell decomposition, both of which can be costly to compute in many practical applications. In this work we communicate recent progress towards a Monte Carlo framework for exploring such real solution sets. After describing how to construct probability distributions whose mass focuses on a variety of interest, we describe how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods can be used to sample points near the variety that may then be moved to the variety using endgames. We conclude by showcasing trial experiments using practical implementations of the method in the Bayesian engine Stan.</description>

      <title>Long time behavior of semi-Markov modulated perpetuity and some related processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Examples of stochastic processes whose state space representations involve functions of an integral type structure $$I_{t}^{(a,b)}:=\int_{0}^{t}b(Y_{s})e^{-\int_{s}^{t}a(Y_{r})dr}ds, \quad t\ge 0$$ are studied under an ergodic semi-Markovian environment described by an $S$ valued jump type process $Y:=(Y_{s}:s\in\mathbb{R}^{+})$ that is ergodic with a limiting distribution $\pi\in\mathcal{P}(S)$. Under different assumptions on signs of $E_{\pi}a(\cdot):=\sum_{j\in S}\pi_{j}a(j)$ and tail properties of the sojourn times of $Y$ we obtain different long time limit results for $I^{(a,b)}_{}:=(I^{(a,b)}_{t}:t\ge 0).$ In all cases mixture type of laws emerge which are naturally represented through an affine stochastic recurrence equation (SRE) $X\stackrel{d}{=}AX+B,\,\, X\perp\!\!\!\perp (A, B)$. Examples include explicit long-time representations of pitchfork bifurcation, and regime-switching diffusions under semi-Markov modulated environments, etc.</description>

      <title>Shorter Is Different: Characterizing the Dynamics of Short-Form Video Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging short-form video platforms have been growing tremendously and become one of the leading social media recently. Although the expanded popularity of these platforms has attracted increasing research attention, there has been a lack of understanding of whether and how they deviate from traditional long-form video-sharing platforms such as YouTube and Bilibili. To address this, we conduct a large-scale data-driven analysis of Kuaishou, one of the largest short-form video platforms in China. Based on 248 million videos uploaded to the platform across all categories, we identify their notable differences from long-form video platforms through a comparison study with Bilibili, a leading long-form video platform in China. We find that videos are shortened by multiples on Kuaishou, with distinctive categorical distributions over-represented by life-related rather than interest-based videos. Users interact with videos less per view, but top videos can even more effectively acquire users' collective attention. More importantly, ordinary content creators have higher probabilities of producing hit videos. Our results shed light on the uniqueness of short-form video platforms and pave the way for future research and design for better short-form video ecology.</description>

      <title>Boosting with copula-based components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The authors propose new additive models for binary outcomes, where the components are copula-based regression models (Noh et al, 2013), and designed such that the model may capture potentially complex interaction effects. The models do not require discretisation of continuous covariates, and are therefore suitable for problems with many such covariates. A fitting algorithm, and efficient procedures for model selection and evaluation of the components are described. Software is provided in the R-package copulaboost. Simulations and illustrations on data sets indicate that the method's predictive performance is either better than or comparable to the other methods.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling and prediction of microglial cell dynamics in the ischemic penumbra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuroinflammation immediately follows the onset of ischemic stroke. During this process, microglial cells are activated in and recruited to the tissue surrounding the irreversibly injured infarct core, referred to as the penumbra. Microglial cells can be activated into two distinct phenotypes; however, the dynamics between the detrimental M1 phenotype and beneficial M2 phenotype are not fully understood. Using phenotype-specific cell count data obtained from experimental studies on middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced stroke in mice, we employ sparsity-promoting system identification techniques combined with Bayesian statistical methods for uncertainty quantification to generate continuous and discrete-time predictive models of the M1 and M2 microglial cell dynamics. The resulting data-driven models include constant and linear terms but do not include nonlinear interactions between the cells. Results emphasize an initial M2 dominance followed by a takeover of M1 cells, capture potential long-term dynamics of microglial cells, and suggest a persistent inflammatory response.</description>

      <title>Sparse Bayesian multidimensional scaling(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian multidimensional scaling (BMDS) is a probabilistic dimension reduction tool that allows one to model and visualize data consisting of dissimilarities between pairs of objects. Although BMDS has proven useful within, e.g., Bayesian phylogenetic inference, its likelihood and gradient calculations require a burdensome order of $N^2$ floating-point operations, where $N$ is the number of data points. Thus, BMDS becomes impractical as $N$ grows large. We propose and compare two sparse versions of BMDS (sBMDS) that apply log-likelihood and gradient computations to subsets of the observed dissimilarity matrix data. Landmark sBMDS (L-sBMDS) extracts columns, while banded sBMDS (B-sBMDS) extracts diagonals of the data. These sparse variants let one specify a time complexity between $N^2$ and $N$. Under simplified settings, we prove posterior consistency for subsampled distance matrices. Through simulations, we examine the accuracy and computational efficiency across all models using both the Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms. We observe approximately 3-fold, 10-fold and 40-fold speedups with negligible loss of accuracy, when applying the sBMDS likelihoods and gradients to 500, 1,000 and 5,000 data points with 50 bands (landmarks); these speedups only increase with the size of data considered. Finally, we apply the sBMDS variants to the phylogeographic modeling of multiple influenza subtypes to better understand how these strains spread through global air transportation networks.</description>

      <title>Functional Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous functional data are commonly seen in time series and longitudinal data analysis. To capture the statistical structures of such data, we propose the framework of Functional Singular Value Decomposition (FSVD), a unified framework with structure-adaptive interpretability for the analysis of heterogeneous functional data. We establish the mathematical foundation of FSVD by proving its existence and providing its fundamental properties using operator theory. We then develop an implementation approach for noisy and irregularly observed functional data based on a novel joint kernel ridge regression scheme and provide theoretical guarantees for its convergence and estimation accuracy. The framework of FSVD also introduces the concepts of intrinsic basis functions and intrinsic basis vectors, which represent two fundamental statistical structures for random functions and connect FSVD to various tasks including functional principal component analysis, factor models, functional clustering, and functional completion. We compare the performance of FSVD with existing methods in several tasks through extensive simulation studies. To demonstrate the value of FSVD in real-world datasets, we apply it to extract temporal patterns from a COVID-19 case count dataset and perform data completion on an electronic health record dataset.</description>

      <title>Variational autoencoders with latent high-dimensional steady geometric flows for dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop Riemannian approaches to variational autoencoders (VAEs) for PDE-type ambient data with regularizing geometric latent dynamics, which we refer to as VAE-DLM, or VAEs with dynamical latent manifolds. We redevelop the VAE framework such that manifold geometries, subject to our geometric flow, embedded in Euclidean space are learned in the intermediary latent space developed by encoders and decoders. By tailoring the geometric flow in which the latent space evolves, we induce latent geometric properties of our choosing, which are reflected in empirical performance. We reformulate the traditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss with a considerate choice of prior. We develop a linear geometric flow with a steady-state regularizing term. This flow requires only automatic differentiation of one time derivative, and can be solved in moderately high dimensions in a physics-informed approach, allowing more expressive latent representations. We discuss how this flow can be formulated as a gradient flow, and maintains entropy away from metric singularity. This, along with an eigenvalue penalization condition, helps ensure the manifold is sufficiently large in measure, nondegenerate, and a canonical geometry, which contribute to a robust representation. Our methods focus on the modified multi-layer perceptron architecture with tanh activations for the manifold encoder-decoder. We demonstrate, on our datasets of interest, our methods perform at least as well as the traditional VAE, and oftentimes better. Our methods can outperform this and a VAE endowed with our proposed architecture by up to 25% reduction in out-of-distribution (OOD) error and potentially greater. We highlight our method on ambient PDEs whose solutions maintain minimal variation in late times. We provide empirical justification towards how we can improve robust learning for external dynamics with VAEs.</description>
