      <title>Stability frontiers in the AM$_6$X$_6$ kagome metals; The LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Lu,Y) family and density-wave transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome motif is a versatile platform for condensed matter physics, hosting rich interactions between magnetic, electronic, and structural degrees of freedom. In recent years, the discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductors and structurally-derived bond density waves in FeGe and ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ have stoked the search for new kagome platforms broadly exhibiting density wave (DW) transitions. In this work, we evaluate the known AM$_6$X$_6$ chemistries and construct a stability diagram that summarizes the structural relationships between the $\approx$125 member family. Subsequently we introduce our discovery of the broader LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Nd,Sm,Gd-Tm,Lu,Y) family of kagome metals and an analogous DW transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. Our X-ray scattering measurements clearly indicate a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) ordering wave vector ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ superlattice) and diffuse scattering on half-integer $L$-planes. Our analysis of the structural data supports the ``rattling mode'' DW model proposed for ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and paints a detailed picture of the steric interactions between the rare-earth filler element and the host Nb-Sn kagome scaffolding. We also provide a broad survey of the magnetic properties within the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ members, revealing a number of complex antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions throughout the family. This work integrates our new LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ series of compounds into the broader AM$_6$X$_6$ family, providing new material platforms and forging a new route forward at the frontier of kagome metal research.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana interference and non-adiabatic topological transport of edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interference under chiral-mirror-like symmetry and propose its application to non-adiabatic topological transport of edge states. Protected by this symmetry, complete destructive interference emerges and can be characterized through occupation probability. This symmetry-protected LZSM interference enables state transitions to be achieved within remarkably short time scales. To demonstrate our mechanism, we provide two distinctive two-level systems as examples and survey them in detail. By tuning evolution speed or increasing holding time, the complete destructive interferences are observed. Furthermore, we make use of this mechanism for topological edge states of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain by taking them as an isolated two-level system. Through carefully designed time sequences, we construct symmetry-protected LZSM interference of topological edge states, enabling non-adiabatic topological transport. Our work unveils an alternative way to study quantum control, quantum state transfer, and quantum communication via non-adiabatic topological transport.</description>

      <title>Toward a Better Understanding of the Photothermal Heating of High-Entropy-Alloy Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical approach, for the first time, to investigate optical and photothermal properties of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles with a focus on FeCoNi-based alloys. We systematically analyze the absorption spectra of spherical nanoparticles composed of pure metals and alloys in various surrounding media. Through comparison with experimental data, we select appropriate dielectric data for the constituent elements to accurately compute absorption spectra for FeCoNi-based high-entropy-alloy nanoparticles. Then, we predict the temperature rise over time within a substrate comprised of Fe nanoparticles exposed to solar irradiation and find quantitative agreement with experimental data for FeCoNi nanoparticles reported in previous studies. The striking similarity between the optical and photothermal behaviors of FeCoNi nanoparticles and their pure iron counterparts suggests that iron nanoparticles can effectively serve as a model for understanding the optical and thermal response of FeCoNi-based alloy nanoparticles. These findings offer a simplified approach for theoretical modeling of complex high-entropy alloys and provide valuable insights into their nanoscale optical behavior.</description>

      <title>Dirac Magnon in Honeycomb Lattice Magnet NiTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed inelastic neutron scattering experiments on single-crystal samples of the honeycomb lattice magnet, ilmenite NiTiO3. Below the Neel temperature of 22 K, spin wave excitations with a band energy of 3.7 meV were observed. The neutron energy spectra were well-reproduced by modeling the system as a ferromagnetic honeycomb lattice with antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, using linear spin wave theory. Similar to another ilmenite CoTiO3, a crossing structure was observed at the K point, suggesting the resence of Dirac magnons in NiTiO3. Further calculations suggested the formation of Dirac nodal line.</description>

      <title>Universal solution to the Schrieffer-Wolff Transformation Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT) is an important perturbative method in quantum mechanics used to simplify Hamiltonians by decoupling low- and high-energy subspaces. Existing methods for implementing the SWT often lack general applicability to arbitrary perturbative systems or fail to provide a closed-form solution for the SWT generator. In this article, we present a systematic and unified framework for the SWT that addresses these shortcomings. Specifically, we derive a closed-form solution for the SWT generator that is universally applicable to any system that satisfies the conditions required to be perturbatively treated. Furthermore, we extend this solution to time-dependent systems with periodic perturbations, covering all frequency regimes. The effectiveness of this approach is then demonstrated by applying it to analyze the dispersive shift of an anharmonic resonator coupled to a two-level system with time-dependent coupling.</description>

      <title>Conventional and unconventional anomalous velocities in multiband systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07810v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anomalous velocity has been derived so far based on the single-band approximation. In this paper, the anomalous velocity is derived accounting for multiple energy bands. It is shown that when multiple energy bands are considered, the anomalous velocity is actually derived from the velocity term which goes to zero under the single-band approximation. It is also shown that the anomalous velocity based on the single-band approximation is derived improperly from the velocity term which becomes zero in considering multiple energy bands. Furthermore, it is found that unconventional types of anomalous velocity may appear in addition to the conventional anomalous velocity. These unconventional anomalous velocities are perpendicular to the electric field and come from the singularity of the magnetic Bloch function in the magnetic Brillouin zone. It is confirmed that conventional and unconventional anomalous velocities can also be derived not only from the steady-state perturbation theory but also from the time-dependent perturbation theory in which a time-dependent vector potential yielding the uniform electric field is treated as a perturbation.</description>

      <title>HamLib: A library of Hamiltonians for benchmarking quantum algorithms and hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13126v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to characterize and benchmark computational hardware, software, and algorithms, it is essential to have many problem instances on-hand. This is no less true for quantum computation, where a large collection of real-world problem instances would allow for benchmarking studies that in turn help to improve both algorithms and hardware designs. To this end, here we present a large dataset of qubit-based quantum Hamiltonians. The dataset, called HamLib (for Hamiltonian Library), is freely available online and contains problem sizes ranging from 2 to 1000 qubits. HamLib includes problem instances of the Heisenberg model, Fermi-Hubbard model, Bose-Hubbard model, molecular electronic structure, molecular vibrational structure, MaxCut, Max-$k$-SAT, Max-$k$-Cut, QMaxCut, and the traveling salesperson problem. The goals of this effort are (a) to save researchers time by eliminating the need to prepare problem instances and map them to qubit representations, (b) to allow for more thorough tests of new algorithms and hardware, and (c) to allow for reproducibility and standardization across research studies.</description>

      <title>Cooperative non-reciprocal emission and quantum sensing of symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal propagation of energy and information is fundamental to a wide range of quantum technology applications. In this work, we explore the quantum many-body dynamics of a qubit ensemble coupled to a shared bath that mediates coherent and dissipative inter-qubit interactions with both symmetric and anti-symmetric components. We find that the interplay between anti-symmetric (symmetric) coherent and symmetric (anti-symmetric) dissipative interactions results in non-reciprocal couplings, which, in turn, generate a spatially asymmetric emission pattern. We demonstrate that this pattern arises from non-reciprocal interactions coupling different quantum many-body states within a specific excitation manifold. Focusing on solid-state baths, we show that their lack of time-reversal and inversion symmetry is a key ingredient for generating non-reciprocal dynamics in the qubit ensemble. With the plethora of quantum materials that exhibit this symmetry breaking at equilibrium, our approach paves the way for realizing cooperative non-reciprocal transport in qubit ensembles without requiring time-modulated external drives or complex engineering. Using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers coupled to a generic non-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic bath as a concrete example, we demonstrate that our predictions can be tested in near-future experiments. As the spatial asymmetry in the relaxation dynamics of the qubit ensemble is a direct probe of symmetry breaking in the solid-state bath, our work also opens the door to developing model-agnostic quantum sensing schemes capable of detecting bath properties invisible to current state-of-the-art protocols, which operate solid-state defects as single-qubit sensors.</description>

      <title>Hidden nonlinear optical susceptibilities in linear polaritonic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear spectra of molecular polaritons formed by $N$ molecules coupled to a microcavity photon mode are usually well described by classical linear optics, raising the question of where the expected nonlinear effects in these strongly coupled systems are. In this work, we derive a general expression for the polaritonic linear spectra that reveal previously overlooked finite-size quantum corrections due to vacuum-mediated molecular Raman processes. Using a $1/N$ expansion, we demonstrate that these nonlinearities are suppressed in typical low-Q cavities due to an emergent timescale separation in polariton dynamics yet manifest in high-Q single-mode cavities where the photon loss is comparable to the single-molecule light-matter coupling strength.</description>
