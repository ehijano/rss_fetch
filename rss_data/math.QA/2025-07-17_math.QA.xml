      <title>Cactus flower spaces and monodromy of Bethe vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of cactus flower moduli spaces $\overline{F}_n$ and Gaudin models started in arXiv:2308.06880, arXiv:2407.06424. We show that isomorphism classes of operadic coverings of the real form $\overline{F}_n(\mathbb{R})$ are naturally one-to-one with equivalence classes of concrete coboundary monoidal categories (i.e. coboundary monoidal categories that admit a faithful monoidal functor to sets) with certain semisimplicity and finiteness conditions. Following the strategy of arXiv:1708.05105, for any complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we recover Kashiwara $\mathfrak{g}$-crystals, as a concrete coboundary category, from the coverings given by Bethe eigenlines for inhomogeneous Gaudin models. Using this, we compute the monodromy of Bethe eigenlines for trigonometric Gaudin models over two different real loci. In the particular case of minuscule highest weights, this can be regarded as combinatorial version of the wall-crossing conjecture of Bezrukavnikov and Okounkov for quantum cohomology of symplectic resolutions in the case of minuscule resolutions of slices in the affine Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>A basis and Schur-Weyl duality for the loop Hecke algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The loop Hecke algebra is a generalization of the Hecke algebra to the loop braid group, introduced by Damiani, Martin and Rowell. We give a new presentation of the loop Hecke algebra provided a mild condition on the parameter and give a basis. We use higher linear rewriting theory to show linear independence and the combinatorics of Dyck paths to compute the cardinality of the basis. This yields a conjecture of Damiani-Martin-Rowel. We also give a representation theoretic interpretation of the loop Hecke algebra in terms of (non-semisimple) Schur-Weyl duality involving the negative half of quantum $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$.</description>

      <title>Modular families of elliptic long-range spin chains from freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the construction of quantum-integrable spin chains with q-deformed long-range interactions by `freezing' integrable quantum many-body systems with spins. The input is a spin-Ruijsenaars system along with an equilibrium configuration of the underlying spinless classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider system. For a distinguished choice of equilibrium, the resulting long-range spin chain has a real spectrum and admits a short-range limit, providing an integrable interpolation from nearest-neighbour to long-range interacting spins. We focus on the elliptic case. We first define an action of the modular group on the spinless elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider system to show that, for a fixed elliptic parameter, it has a whole modular family of classical equilibrium configurations. These typically have constant but nonzero momenta. Then we use the setting of deformation quantisation to provide a uniform framework for freezing elliptic spin-Ruijsenaars systems at any classical equilibrium whilst preserving quantum integrability. As we showed in previous work, the results include the Heisenberg, Inozemtsev and Haldane-Shastry chains along with their xxz-like q-deformations (face-type), or the antiperiodic Haldane-Shastry chain of Fukui-Kawakami, its elliptic generalisation of Sechin-Zotov, and their completely anisotropic q-deformations due to Matushko-Zotov (vertex type).</description>

      <title>Vertex functions for bow varieties and their Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the vertex functions of finite type $A$ bow varieties. Vertex functions are $K$-theoretic analogs of $I$-functions, and 3d mirror symmetry predicts that the $q$-difference equations satisfied by the vertex functions of a variety and its 3d mirror dual are the same after a change of variable swapping the roles of the various parameters. Thus the vertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is expected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove all of these statements.
  The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of complete flag varieties, for which the $q$-difference equations can be explicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in this reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer" flag variety. Our formula involves specializing certain K\"ahler parameters (also called Novikov parameters) to singularities of the vertex functions. In the $\hbar \to \infty$ limit, this statement is expected to degenerate to an analogous result about $I$-functions of flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Associated Varieties and Minimal Tension Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We comment on certain analogies that have recently emerged between path integral localisation phenomena in minimal tension string theory on $\mathrm{AdS}_3\times S^3\times T^4$ and associated varieties of boundary vertex algebras of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories. We give evidence for the fact that the path integral localisation relies on an intriguing relation between the conformal boundary of $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ and the associated variety of $V_1(\mathfrak{psl}(2|2))$, (the complexification of) the affine algebra that enters the world-sheet description of the string theory. We explain the origin of certain operators (related to ``secret representations") that have appeared in this description. Based on the expectation that similar statements will hold for $\mathrm{AdS}_5\times S^5$, we explicitly write down free field realisations of $V_1(\mathfrak{psl}(4|4))$ that may hopefully be useful to study the world-sheet dual of free $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.</description>

      <title>Classification and structure of generalized Legendrian racks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study algebraic aspects of generalized Legendrian racks, which are nonassociative structures based on the Legendrian Reidemeister moves.
  We answer an open question characterizing the group of GL-structures on a given rack. As applications, we classify several infinite families of GL-racks. We also compute automorphism groups of dihedral GL-quandles.
  Then we compute the centers of the category of GL-racks and several of its full subcategories. We also construct an equivalence of categories between racks and GL-quandles.
  We also study tensor products of racks and GL-racks coming from universal algebra. Surprisingly, the categories of racks and GL-racks have tensor units. The induced symmetric monoidal structure on medial racks is closed, and similarly for medial GL-racks.</description>
