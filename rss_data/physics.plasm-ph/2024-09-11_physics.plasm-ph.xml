      <title>Latent Space Dynamics Learning for Stiff Collisional-radiative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisional-radiative (CR) models describe the atomic processes in a plasma by tracking the population density in the ground and excited states for each charge state of the atom or ion. These models predict important plasma properties such as charge state distributions and radiative emissivity and opacity. Accurate CR modeling is essential in radiative plasma modeling for magnetic fusion, especially when significant amount of impurities are introduced into the plasmas. In radiative plasma simulations, a CR model, which is a set of high-dimensional stiff ordinary differential equations (ODE), needs to be solved on each grid point in the configuration space, which can overwhelm the plasma simulation cost. In this work, we propose a deep learning method that discovers the latent space and learns its corresponding latent dynamics, which can capture the essential physics to make accurate predictions at much lower online computational cost. To facilitate coupling of the latent space CR dynamics with the plasma simulation model in physical variables, our latent space in the autoencoder must be a grey box, consisting of a physical latent space and a data-driven or blackbox latent space. It has been demonstrated that the proposed architecture can accurately predict both the full-order CR dynamics and the critical physical quantity of interest, the so-called radiative power loss rate.</description>

      <title>FUSE (Fusion Synthesis Engine): A Next Generation Framework for Integrated Design of Fusion Pilot Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fusion Synthesis Engine (FUSE) is a state-of-the-art software suite designed to revolutionize fusion power plant design. FUSE integrates first-principle models, machine learning, and reduced models into a unified framework, enabling comprehensive simulations that go beyond traditional 0D systems studies. FUSE's modular structure supports a hierarchy of model fidelities, from steady-state to time-dependent simulations, allowing for both pre-conceptual design and operational scenario development. This framework accelerates the design process by enabling self-consistent solutions across physics, engineering, and control systems, minimizing the need for iterative expert evaluations. Leveraging modern software practices and parallel computing, FUSE also provides multi-objective optimization, balancing cost, efficiency, and operational constraints. Developed in Julia, FUSE is fully open-source under the Apache 2.0 license, promoting transparency and collaboration within the fusion research community.</description>

      <title>Multiscale simulation of rarefied gas flows in Divertor Tokamak Test facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating gas flow within the divertor, which is a crucial component in nuclear fusion reactors, is essential for assessing and enhancing its design and performance. Traditional methods, such as the direct simulation Monte Carlo and the discrete velocity method, often fall short in efficiency for these simulations. In this study, we utilize the general synthetic iterative scheme to simulate a simplified Tokamak divertor model, demonstrating its fast convergence and asymptotic-preserving properties in complex three-dimensional scenarios. A conservative estimate of speedup by three orders of magnitude is achieved by the general synthetic iterative scheme when compared to the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. We further investigate the relationship between pumping efficiency and factors like temperature, absorptivity, and the Knudsen number, providing valuable insights to guide the design and optimization of divertor structures.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Chemistry Reduction in $\text{N}_2-\text{H}_2$ Low-Temperature Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-temperature plasmas are partially ionized gases, where ions and neutrals coexist in a highly reactive environment. This creates a rich chemistry, which is often difficult to understand in its full complexity. In this work, we develop a machine learning model to identify the most important reactions in a given chemical scheme. The training data are an initial distribution of species and a final distribution of species, which can be obtained from either experiments or simulations. The model is trained to provide a set of reaction weights, which become the basis for reducing the chemical scheme. The approach is applied to $\text{N}_2-\text{H}_2$ plasmas, created by an electric discharge at low pressure, where the main goal is to produce $\text{NH}_3$. The interplay of multiple species, as well as of volume and surface reactions, make this chemistry especially challenging to understand. Reducing the chemical scheme via the proposed model helps identify the main chemical pathways.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study of Inhomogeneity Effects on Three-Wave Parametric Instability: A WKBJ Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms by which media inhomogeneity affects the three wave parametric instability (PI), including the wave number mismatch and the parameter gradients, are investigated using an approach based on the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) approximation. This approach transforms the coupling wave equations into an amplitude equation and iteratively solves its characteristic polynomials. By analyzing the solutions, we proposed that the wave number of the quasi-mode, a key term in the wave number mismatch of non-resonant type PI, should be a complex root of the quasi-mode's linear dispersion equation. Based on this, we derive a unified amplification factor formula that covers the resonant and non-resonant, the forward-scattered and backward-scattered types of PI. The impact of parameter gradients on the local spatial growth rate becomes significant when the inhomogeneity exceeds 10^{-3}. Considering parameter gradients extends our approach's validity to an inhomogeneity of about 10^{-2}. This approach holds promise for more specific PI modeling in the future.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Matched Layer implementation for E-H fields and Complex Wave Envelope propagation in the Smilei PIC code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) in a numerical simulation is a challenging task. In the best cases, spurious reflections remain for some angles of incidence or at certain wave lengths. In the worst, ABC are not even possible for the set of equations and/or numerical schemes used in the simulation and reflections can not be avoided at all. Perflectly Matched Layer (PML) are layers of absorbing medium which can be added at the simulation edges in order to significantly damp both outgoing and reflected waves, thus effectively playing the role of an ABC. They are able to absorb waves and prevent reflections for all angles and frequencies at a modest computational cost. It increases the simulation accuracy and negates the need of oversizing the simulation usually imposed by ABC and leading to a waste of computational resources and power. PML for finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) schemes in Particle-In-cell (PIC) codes are presented for both Maxwell's equations and, for the first time, the envelope wave equation. Being of the second order, the latter requires significant evolutions with respect to the former. It applies in particular to simulations of lasers propagating in plasmas using the reduced Complex Envelope model. The implementation is done in the open source code Smilei for both Cartesian and azimuthal modes (AM) decomposition geometries.</description>

      <title>Contemporaneous Appearances of Local-Scale Auroral Spiral and Global-Scale Transpolar Arc: Changes of Auroras and Field-Aligned Current Profiles Before a Substorm and After Its Recovery Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local vortex-structured auroral spiral and a large-scale transpolar arc (TPA) were contemporaneously observed by the Polar ultraviolet imager (UVI), when a substorm almost recovered. The TPA grew along the dawnside auroral oval from the nightside to the dayside (oval-aligned TPA), and a chain of multiple auroral spots and spiral were located azimuthally near the poleward edge of the nightside auroral oval. Contemporaneous appearances of the TPA and the auroral spiral can be seen after the spiral appeared alone. Polar also detected the oval-aligned TPA and another dawnside TPA with the nightside end distorted toward the premidnight sector (J-shaped TPA) before and after the spiral's formation, respectively. To examine these associated magnetotail structures, we performed global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, based on two different types of code, BAT-S-RUS and improved REPPU, and examined how the field-aligned current (FAC) profiles varied in association with changes of the auroral form to TPA and/or auroral spiral. Global MHD simulations with the two different types of code can reproduce the TPAs and the associated FAC structures in the magnetotail. The auroral spiral and its nightside FAC profile, however, were not formed in both simulations, suggesting that its formation process cannot be treated within an MHD framework but is closely related to some kinetic process. When the J-shaped TPA and the auroral spiral contemporaneously appeared, the two MHD simulations could not reproduce the TPA, spiral and their associated magnetotail FAC structures, also advocating that a kinetic effect related to the spiral formation might prevent the TPA occurrence.</description>

      <title>Learning force laws in many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific laws describing natural systems may be more complex than our intuition can handle, thus how we discover laws must change. Machine learning (ML) models can analyze large quantities of data, but their structure should match the underlying physical constraints to provide useful insight. While progress has been made using simulated data where the underlying physics is known, training and validating ML models on experimental data requires fundamentally new approaches. Here we demonstrate and experimentally validate an ML approach that incorporates physical intuition to infer force laws in dusty plasma, a complex, many-body system. Trained on 3D particle trajectories, the model accounts for inherent symmetries, non-identical particles, and learns the effective non-reciprocal forces between particles with exquisite accuracy (R^2&gt;0.99). We validate the model by inferring particle masses in two independent yet consistent ways. The model's accuracy enables precise measurements of particle charge and screening length, discovering violations of common theoretical assumptions. Our ability to identify new physics from experimental data demonstrates how ML-powered approaches can guide new routes of scientific discovery in many-body systems. Furthermore, we anticipate our ML approach to be a starting point for inferring laws from dynamics in a wide range of many-body systems, from colloids to living organisms.</description>

      <title>Reduced turbulent transport in the quasi-isodynamic stellarator configuration CIEMAT-QI4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CIEMAT-QI4 is a quasi-isodynamic stellarator configuration that simultaneously features very good fast-ion confinement in a broad range of $\beta$ values, low neoclassical transport and bootstrap current, and ideal magnetohydrodynamic stability up to $\beta=5\%$. In this paper it is shown that CIEMAT-QI4 also exhibits reduced turbulent transport. This is demonstrated through nonlinear electrostatic simulations with the gyrokinetic code stella, including kinetic ions and electrons. The relation between reduced turbulent transport and the fact that CIEMAT-QI4 very approximately satisfies the so-called maximum-J property is discussed.</description>

      <title>Statistical theory of the broadband two-plasmon decay instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is renewed interest in direct-drive inertial confinement fusion, following the milestone December 2022 3.15 MJ ignition result on the National Ignition Facility. A key obstacle is the control of the two plasmon decay instability. Here, recent advances in inhomogeneous turbulence theory are applied to the broadband parametric instability problem for the first time. A novel dispersion relation is derived for the two plasmon decay in a uniform plasma valid under broad-bandwidth laser fields with arbitrary power spectra. The effects of temporal incoherence on the instability are then studied. In the limit of large bandwidth, the well-known scaling relations for the growth rate are recovered, but it is shown that the result is more sensitive to the spectral shape of the laser pulse rather than to its coherence time. The range of wavenumbers of the excited plasma waves is shown to be substantially broadened, suggesting that the absolute instability is favoured in regions further away from the quarter critical density. The intermediate bandwidth regime is explored numerically -- the growth rate is reduced to half its monochromatic value for laser intensities of $10^{15} \, \text{W}/\text{cm}^{2}$ and relatively modest bandwidths of $5 \, \text{THz}$. The instability-quenching properties of a spectrum of discrete lines spread over some bandwidth have also been studied. The reduction in the growth rate is found to be somewhat lower compared to the continuous case but is still significant, despite the fact that, formally, the coherence time of such a laser pulse is infinite.</description>

      <title>Radiative hydrodynamic equations with nonequilibrium radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a kinetic model for the coupled evolution of radiation, electrons, and ions in a radiation plasma system. The model is solved using two methods. The gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) for electron and ion hydrodynamics and the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for non-equilibrium radiative transfer. The UGKS accurately captures multiscale photon transport from free streaming to diffusion across varying fluid opacities. This approach enables the scheme to model equilibrium plasma with non-equilibrium radiation transport. The model is validated through several test cases, including radiative transfer in kinetic and diffusion regimes, Marshak wave, Radiative shock, 3T double lax shock tube problem, two-dimensional Sedov blast wave, and two-dimensional tophat based problem. These tests demonstrate the current scheme's capability to handle diverse radiation plasma scenarios.</description>
