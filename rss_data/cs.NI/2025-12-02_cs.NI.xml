      <title>Trust or Bust: A Survey of Threats in Decentralized Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent emergence of decentralized wireless networks empowers individual entities to own, operate, and offer subscriptionless connectivity services in exchange for monetary compensation. While traditional connectivity providers have built trust over decades through widespread adoption, established practices, and regulation, entities in a decentralized wireless network, lacking this foundation, may be incentivized to exploit the service for their own advantage. For example, a dishonest hotspot operator can intentionally violate the agreed upon connection terms in an attempt to increase their profits. In this paper, we examine and develop a taxonomy of adversarial behavior patterns in decentralized wireless networks. Our case study finds that provider-driven attacks can potentially more than triple provider earnings. We conclude the paper with a discussion on the critical need to develop novel techniques to detect and mitigate adversarial behavior in decentralized wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Server FL with Overlapping Clients: A Latency-Aware Relay Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-server Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate communication bottlenecks of single-server FL. In a typical multi-server FL architecture, the regions covered by different edge servers (ESs) may overlap. Under this architecture, clients located in the overlapping areas can access edge models from multiple ESs. Building on this observation, we propose a cloud-free multi-server FL framework that leverages Overlapping Clients (OCs) as relays for inter-server model exchange while uploading the local updated model to ESs. This enables ES models to be relayed across multiple hops through neighboring ESs by OCs without introducing new communication links. We derive a new convergence upper bound for non-convex objectives under non-IID data and an arbitrary number of cells, which explicitly quantifies the impact of inter-server propagation depth on convergence error. Guided by this theoretical result, we formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize dissemination range of each ES model among all ESs within a limited latency. To solve this problem, we develop a conflict-graph-based local search algorithm optimizing the routing strategy and scheduling the transmission times of individual ESs to its neighboring ESs. This enables ES models to be relayed across multiple hops through neighboring ESs by OCs, achieving the widest possible transmission coverage for each model without introducing new communication links. Extensive experimental results show remarkable performance gains of our scheme compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>An optimization framework for task allocation in the edge/hub/cloud paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), novel critical applications have emerged that leverage the edge/hub/cloud paradigm, which diverges from the conventional edge computing perspective. A growing number of such applications require a streamlined architecture for their effective execution, often comprising a single edge device with sensing capabilities, a single hub device (e.g., a laptop or smartphone) for managing and assisting the edge device, and a more computationally capable cloud server. Typical examples include the utilization of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for critical infrastructure inspection or a wearable biomedical device (e.g., a smartwatch) for remote patient monitoring. Task allocation in this streamlined architecture is particularly challenging, due to the computational, communication, and energy limitations of the devices at the network edge. Consequently, there is a need for a comprehensive framework that can address the specific task allocation problem optimally and efficiently. To this end, we propose a complete, binary integer linear programming (BILP) based formulation for an application-driven design-time approach, capable of providing an optimal task allocation in the targeted edge/hub/cloud environment. The proposed method minimizes the desired objective, either the overall latency or overall energy consumption, while considering several crucial parameters and constraints often overlooked in related literature. We evaluate our framework using a real-world use-case scenario, as well as appropriate synthetic benchmarks. Our extensive experimentation reveals that the proposed approach yields optimal and scalable results, enabling efficient design space exploration for different applications and computational devices.</description>

      <title>Refined Bayesian Optimization for Efficient Beam Alignment in Intelligent Indoor Wireless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future intelligent indoor wireless environments re- quire fast and reliable beam alignment to sustain high-throughput links under mobility and blockage. Exhaustive beam training achieves optimal performance but is prohibitively costly. In indoor settings, dense scatterers and transceiver hardware imperfections introduce multipath and sidelobe leakage, producing measurable power across multiple angles and reducing the effectiveness of outdoor-oriented alignment algorithms. This paper presents a Refined Bayesian Optimization (R-BO) framework that exploits the inherent structure of mmWave transceiver patterns, where received power gradually increases as the transmit and receive beams converge toward the optimum. R-BO integrates a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate with a Matern kernel and an Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, followed by a localized refinement around the predicted optimum. The GP hyperparam- eters are re-optimized online to adapt to irregular variations in the measured angular power field caused by reflections and sidelobe leakage. Experiments across 43 receiver positions in an indoor laboratory demonstrate 97.7% beam-alignment accuracy within 10 degrees, less than 0.3 dB average loss, and an 88% reduction in probing overhead compared to exhaustive search. These results establish R-BO as an efficient and adaptive beam-alignment solution for real-time intelligent indoor wireless environments.</description>

      <title>LM4Opt-RA: A Multi-Candidate LLM Framework with Structured Ranking for Automating Network Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we can tackle complex analytical and mathematical reasoning tasks requiring nuanced contextual understanding. A prime example of such complex tasks is modelling resource allocation optimization in networks, which extends beyond translating natural language inputs into mathematical equations or Linear Programming (LP), Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models. However, existing benchmarks and datasets cannot address the complexities of such problems with dynamic environments, interdependent variables, and heterogeneous constraints. To address this gap, we introduce NL4RA, a curated dataset comprising 50 resource allocation optimization problems formulated as LP, ILP, and MILP. We then evaluate the performance of well-known open-source LLMs with varying parameter counts. To enhance existing LLM based methods, we introduce LM4Opt RA, a multi candidate framework that applies diverse prompting strategies such as direct, few shot, and chain of thought, combined with a structured ranking mechanism to improve accuracy. We identified discrepancies between human judgments and automated scoring such as ROUGE, BLEU, or BERT scores. However, human evaluation is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise, making it impractical for a fully automated end-to-end framework. To quantify the difference between LLM-generated responses and ground truth, we introduce LLM-Assisted Mathematical Evaluation (LAME), an automated metric designed for mathematical formulations. Using LM4Opt-RA, Llama-3.1-70B achieved a LAME score of 0.8007, outperforming other models by a significant margin, followed closely by Llama-3.1-8B. While baseline LLMs demonstrate considerable promise, they still lag behind human expertise; our proposed method surpasses these baselines regarding LAME and other metrics.</description>

      <title>Constrained Network Slice Assignment via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern networks support network slicing, which partitions physical infrastructure into virtual slices tailored to different service requirements (for example, high bandwidth or low latency). Optimally allocating users to slices is a constrained optimization problem that traditionally requires complex algorithms. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle radio resource allocation for network slicing. We focus on two approaches: (1) using an LLM in a zero-shot setting to directly assign user service requests to slices, and (2) formulating an integer programming model where the LLM provides semantic insight by estimating similarity between requests. Our experiments show that an LLM, even with zero-shot prompting, can produce a reasonable first draft of slice assignments, although it may violate some capacity or latency constraints. We then incorporate the LLM's understanding of service requirements into an optimization solver to generate an improved allocation. The results demonstrate that LLM-guided grouping of requests, based on minimal textual input, achieves performance comparable to traditional methods that use detailed numerical data, in terms of resource utilization and slice isolation. While the LLM alone does not perfectly satisfy all constraints, it significantly reduces the search space and, when combined with exact solvers, provides a promising approach for efficient 5G network slicing resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Mesh Augmentation of LoRaWAN-based IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LoRaWAN is a leading standard and technology for low-power, long-range Internet-of-Things (IoT) communications. However, its single-hop architecture results in limited effective range and excessive power consumption for end devices, especially when deployed in large, remote and RF-challenged environments. Existing solutions are either incompatible with LoRaWAN, or limit relaying to a single hop. We present LIMA, a protocol for augmenting an existing or new LoRaWAN deployment with a mesh network of LIMA Routers. LIMA increases the effective coverage range well beyond the maximum LoRa range via multi-hopping, and significantly reduces the energy consumed by end-devices. LIMA requires no changes to the end-device, the servers or the LoRaWAN standard. LIMA builds routes using reverse path forwarding, tunnels LoRaWAN messages over LIMA, provides transparent extension of the existing Adaptive Data Rate (ADR), and suppresses duplicate forwarding if the device is directly reachable from the Gateway. Simulations using Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) show that LIMA increases the delivery rate, scalability, ED energy consumption by up to 5x, 8x and 12.6x respectively, and reduces latency by up to 2.3x. Table-top and outdoor testing with a prototype constructed using a commercial gateway as a starting point confirm that LIMA can be successfully deployed within an existing LoRaWAN system, and can provide range and energy gains transparently.</description>

      <title>On the Prediction of Wi-Fi Performance through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring reliable and predictable communications is one of the main goals in modern industrial systems that rely on Wi-Fi networks, especially in scenarios where continuity of operation and low latency are required. In these contexts, the ability to predict changes in wireless channel quality can enable adaptive strategies and significantly improve system robustness. This contribution focuses on the prediction of the Frame Delivery Ratio (FDR), a key metric that represents the percentage of successful transmissions, starting from time sequences of binary outcomes (success/failure) collected in a real scenario. The analysis focuses on two models of deep learning: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), both selected for their ability to predict the outcome of time sequences. Models are compared in terms of prediction accuracy and computational complexity, with the aim of evaluating their applicability to systems with limited resources. Preliminary results show that both models are able to predict the evolution of the FDR with good accuracy, even from minimal information (a single binary sequence). In particular, CNN shows a significantly lower inference latency, with a marginal loss in accuracy compared to LSTM.</description>

Abstract: Executable QR codes, also known as sQRy, are a technology aimed at inserting executable programs in a QR code. Through a concrete example, in this paper, we demonstrate their usage in the context of industrial networks in order to assess the operation of a TSN switch by analyzing its status LEDs even in the absence of an internet connection. The entire generation chain that is used to create the sQRy, as well as the corresponding execution chain that, starting from the sQRy, runs it on a mobile device, has been detailed through examples.</description>

      <title>Design and Evaluation of a Multi-Agent Perception System for Autonomous Flying Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Flying Networks (FNs) are emerging as a key enabler of on-demand connectivity in dynamic and infrastructure-limited environments. However, current approaches mainly focus on UAV placement, routing, and resource management, neglecting the autonomous perception of users and their service demands - a critical capability for zero-touch network operation.
  This paper presents the Multi-Agent Perception System (MAPS), a modular and scalable system that leverages multi-modal large language models (MM-LLMs) and agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) to interpret visual and audio data collected by UAVs and generate Service Level Specifications (SLSs) describing user count, spatial distribution, and traffic demand. MAPS is evaluated using a synthetic multimodal emergency dataset, achieving user detection accuracies above 70% and SLS generation under 130 seconds in 90% of cases. Results demonstrate that combining audio and visual modalities enhances user detection and show that MAPS provides the perception layer required for autonomous, zero-touch FNs.</description>

      <title>Smart-TCP: An Agentic AI-based Autonomous and Adaptive TCP Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) relies on a state machine and deterministic arithmetic to ensure reliable connections. However, traditional protocol logic driven by hard-coded state machines struggles to meet the demands of intelligent and autonomous network architectures. Here, we adopt the agentic AI-based paradigm, driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), characterized by context perception, autonomous reasoning, and tool use. Based on this, we propose Smart-TCP, which re-imagines TCP's core control logic as an autonomous agent. Specifically, the proposed architecture employs a context aggregation mechanism to synthesize the protocol context, utilizes the LLM for autonomous logical reasoning, and invokes an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) as a tool for computation. Furthermore, we establish a dual-agent interaction framework based on this architecture and implement TCP protocol interactions. Experiments demonstrate that the Smart-TCP agent excels in static prediction and error detection, achieving a 93.33% success rate in end-to-end sessions. These results strongly validate the technical feasibility of an agentic AI-based TCP protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) systems using Gold coding and Conventional-V-BLAST (C-V-BLAST). Superimposed signals on shared subcarriers make NOMA user separation difficult, unlike MIMO. Gold sequences' orthogonal features may enhance user separation and channel estimation. A novel channel estimation approach uses fractional power allocation and partially decoded data symbols. A realistic simulation environment was created using AWGN, Rayleigh fading, and shadowing. Using pilot signals, power allocation, and data symbols, our Channel Prediction Function (CPF) surpasses pilot-based techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous energy monitoring is essential for identifying potential savings and predicting the energy requirements of buildings. Energy meters are often located in underground spaces that are difficult to reach with wireless technology. This paper presents an experimental study comparing different Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) technologies in terms of building penetration and radio coverage. The technologies Low Power Long Range Wide Area Networks (LoRaWAN), Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT), Sigfox 0G and Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks (Wi-SUN) are evaluated experimentally. It also proposes a distributed hybrid IoT architecture that combines multiple LPWAN technologies using an abstraction layer to optimize cost and coverage. Communication is message-based using the publish-subscribe messaging pattern. It is implemented using the MQTT protocol. The abstraction layer decodes the proprietary binary data and converts it to a normalized JSON format.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Multi-Agent Semantic Networking: Unifying Intents, Semantics, and Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G services are evolving toward goal-oriented and AI-native communication, which are expected to deliver transformative societal benefits across various industries and promote energy sustainability. Yet today's networking architectures, built on complete decoupling of the applications and the network, cannot expose or exploit high-level goals, limiting their ability to adapt intelligently to service needs. This work introduces Goal-Oriented Multi-Agent Semantic Networking (GoAgentNet), a new architecture that elevates communication from data exchange to goal fulfilment. GoAgentNet enables applications and the network to collaborate by abstracting their functions into multiple collaborative agents, and jointly orchestrates multi-agent sensing, networking, computation, and control through semantic computation and cross-layer semantic networking, allowing the entire architecture to pursue unified application goals. We first outline the limitations of legacy network designs in supporting 6G services, based on which we highlight key enablers of our GoAgentNet design. Then, through three representative 6G usage scenarios, we demonstrate how GoAgentNet can unlock more efficient and intelligent services. We further identify unique challenges faced by GoAgentNet deployment and corresponding potential solutions. A case study on robotic fault detection and recovery shows that our GoAgentNet architecture improves energy efficiency by up to 99% and increases the task success rate by up to 72%, compared with the existing networking architectures without GoAgentNet, which underscores its potential to support scalable and sustainable 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Internet of Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IoIRS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) are anticipated to serve as a key cornerstone of future wireless networks, providing an unmatched capability to deterministically shape electromagnetic wave propagation. Despite this potential, most existing research still considers the IRS merely as a standalone physical-layer component, controlled by transmitters. However, as networks grow to encompass a massive number of these surfaces and a massive number of transmitters wishing to use them, this transmitter-centric design encounters substantial challenges. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Internet of IRS (IoIRS), an architecture that reconceives the IRS not just as a passive reflecting surface, but as a connected, hybrid entity functioning across both the physical layer and upper network layers. We present the conceptual framework and a preliminary protocol suite necessary to integrate these surfaces into the higher network layers. We conclude by examining how IoIRS architectures could be applied in practice, as their deployment will be essential for fully realizing the capabilities of future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Physical-Layer Analysis of LoRa Robustness in the Presence of Narrowband Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, the sub-GHz unlicensed spectrum is increasingly being shared by protocols such as Long Range (LoRa), Sigfox, and Long-Range Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (LR-FHSS). These protocols must coexist within the same frequency bands, leading to mutual interference. This paper investigates the physical-layer impact of two types of narrowband signals (BPSK and GMSK) on LoRa demodulation. We employ symbol-level Monte Carlo simulations to analyse how the interference-to-noise ratio (INR) affects the symbol error rate (SER) at a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and noise floor, and then compare the results with those for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) of equal power. We demonstrate that modelling narrowband interference as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) systematically overestimates the SER of Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) demodulation. We also clarify the distinct impairment levels induced by AWGN and two types of narrowband interferers, and provide physical insight into the underlying mechanisms. Finally, we fit a two-segment function for the maximum INR that ensures correct demodulation across SNRs, with one segment for low SNR and the other for high SNR.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of Data Protection Systems for Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's corporate landscape, particularly where operations rely heavily on information technologies, establishing a robust business continuity plan, including a disaster recovery strategy, is essential for ensuring swift recuperation following outages. This study presents a comparative analysis of recovery solutions, focusing on systems that operate partially or entirely within cloud environments and assessing their reliability in fulfilling organizational roles securely and dependably. Two such systems were deployed and evaluated in a real-world production setting. Key performance and reliability metrics were identified using simulation software to enhance these systems, alongside a System Dynamics analysis conducted for each. This work proposes a comprehensive framework for selecting and maintaining data protection and recovery solutions within organizational structures, outlining criteria for aligning chosen approaches with operational needs while adhering to predetermined timelines specified in business continuity and disaster recovery plans. The resulting analysis and findings offer actionable insights to guide decision-making when selecting appropriate recovery concepts.</description>

      <title>Velocity-Adaptive Access Scheme for Semantic-Aware Vehicular Networks: Joint Fairness and AoI Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of fair access and Age of Information (AoI) optimization in 5G New Radio (NR) Vehicle to Everything (V2X) Mode 2. Specifically, vehicles need to exchange information with the road side unit (RSU). However, due to the varying vehicle speeds leading to different communication durations, the amount of data exchanged between different vehicles and the RSU may vary. This may poses significant safety risks in high-speed environments. To address this, we define a fairness index through tuning the selection window of different vehicles and consider the image semantic communication system to reduce latency. However, adjusting the selection window may affect the communication time, thereby impacting the AoI. Moreover, considering the re-evaluation mechanism in 5G NR, which helps reduce resource collisions, it may lead to an increase in AoI. We analyze the AoI using Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) and construct a multi-objective optimization problem to achieve fair access and AoI optimization. Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) is employed to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one, and solve it using convex optimization. We also provide a large language model (LLM) based algorithm. The scheme's effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>HERMES: Heterogeneous Application-Enabled Routing Middleware for Edge-IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of the Internet of Things has enabled a new generation of applications, pushing computation and intelligence toward the network edge. This trend, however, exposes challenges, as the heterogeneity of devices and the complex requirements of applications are often misaligned with the assumptions of traditional routing protocols, which lack the flexibility to accommodate application-layer metrics and policies. This work addresses this gap by proposing a software framework that enhances routing flexibility by dynamically incorporating application-aware decisions. The core of the work establishes a multi-hop Wi-Fi network of heterogeneous devices, specifically ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi 3B. The routing layer follows a proactive approach, while the network is fault-tolerant, maintaining operation despite both node loss and message loss. On top of this, a middleware layer introduces three strategies for influencing routing behavior: two adapt the path a message traverses until arriving at the destination, while the third allows applications to shape the network topology. This layer offers a flexible interface for diverse applications. The framework was validated on a physical testbed through edge intelligence use cases, including distributing neural network inference computations across multiple devices and offloading the entire workload to the most capable node. Distributed inference is useful in scenarios requiring low latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and autonomy. Experimental results indicated that device heterogeneity significantly impacts network performance. Throughput and inference duration analysis showed the influence of the strategies on application behaviour, revealed that topology critically affects decentralized performance, and demonstrated the suitability of the framework for complex tasks.</description>

      <title>Delay Tolerant Networking to Extend Connectivity in Rural Areas Using Public Transport Systems: Design And Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's digital age, access to the Internet is essential, yet a significant digital divide exists, particularly in rural areas of developing nations. This paper presents a Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) framework that utilizes informal public transportation systems, such as minibus taxis, as mobile data mules to enhance connectivity in these underserved regions. We develop a probabilistic model to capture the randomness in vehicle mobility, including travel times and contact durations at bus stops. Key performance metrics are analyzed, including average data transmission rate and Peak Age of Information (PAoI), to assess the effectiveness of the proposed system. An analytical approximation for the Mean PAoI (MPAoI) is derived and validated through simulations. Case studies from real-world datasets in Nouakchott, Accra, and Addis Ababa demonstrate the practical applicability and scalability of our framework. The findings indicate that leveraging existing transportation networks can significantly bridge the digital divide by providing reliable internet-like connectivity to remote areas.</description>

      <title>RECTor: Robust and Efficient Correlation Attack on Tor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tor is a widely used anonymity network that conceals user identities by routing traffic through encrypted relays, yet it remains vulnerable to traffic correlation attacks that deanonymize users by matching patterns in ingress and egress traffic. However, existing correlation methods suffer from two major limitations: limited robustness to noise and partial observations, and poor scalability due to computationally expensive pairwise matching. To address these challenges, we propose RECTor, a machine learning-based framework for traffic correlation under realistic conditions. RECTor employs attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and GRU-based temporal encoding to extract robust flow representations, even when traffic data is incomplete or obfuscated. These embeddings are mapped into a shared space via a Siamese network and efficiently matched using approximate nearest neighbor (aNN) search. Empirical evaluations show that RECTor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as DeepCorr, DeepCOFFEA, and FlowTracker, achieving up to 60% higher true positive rates under high-noise conditions and reducing training and inference time by over 50%. Moreover, RECTor demonstrates strong scalability: inference cost grows near-linearly as the number of flows increases. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Tor's anonymity model and highlight the need for advanced model-aware defenses.</description>

      <title>SemAgent: Semantic-Driven Agentic AI Empowered Trajectory Prediction in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient information exchange and reliable contextual reasoning are essential for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. Conventional communication schemes often incur significant transmission overhead and latency, while existing trajectory prediction models generally lack environmental perception and logical inference capabilities. This paper presents a trajectory prediction framework that integrates semantic communication with Agentic AI to enhance predictive performance in vehicular environments. In vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, a feature-extraction agent at the Roadside Unit (RSU) derives compact representations from historical vehicle trajectories, followed by semantic reasoning performed by a semantic-analysis agent. The RSU then transmits both feature representations and semantic insights to the target vehicle via semantic communication, enabling the vehicle to predict future trajectories by combining received semantics with its own historical data. In vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, each vehicle performs local feature extraction and semantic analysis while receiving predicted trajectories from neighboring vehicles, and jointly utilizes this information for its own trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse communication conditions demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline schemes, achieving up to a 47.5% improvement in prediction accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.</description>

      <title>Joint Partitioning and Placement of Foundation Models for Real-Time Edge AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference over large-scale foundation models within heterogeneous edge environments necessitates a fundamentally reconfigurable orchestration substrate. Static partitioning of model layers presumes temporal stability across compute and network resources, which is misaligned with the volatility of real-world deployments. We introduce a framework in which both the spatial placement and internal segmentation of foundation models are elevated to runtime-resolved constructs. The orchestration problem is formalized as a constrained optimization over layer-wise assignments, subject to evolving latency, utilization, and privacy gradients. The framework implements reactive inference composition responsive to infrastructural fluctuations by integrating model-aware capacity profiling with dynamic graph re-partitioning and reallocation. We introduce architectural and algorithmic components, along with a representative use case in 6G multi-access edge computing.</description>

      <title>INFERMAL: Inferential analysis of maliciously registered domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cybercriminals have long depended on domain names for phishing, spam, malware distribution, and botnet operation. To facilitate the malicious activities, they continually register new domain names for exploitation. Previous work revealed an abnormally high concentration of malicious registrations in a handful of domain name registrars and top-level domains (TLDs). Anecdotal evidence suggests that low registration prices attract cybercriminals, implying that higher costs may potentially discourage them. However, no existing study has systematically analyzed the factors driving abuse, leaving a critical gap in understanding how different variables influence malicious registrations. In this report, we carefully distill the inclinations and aversions of malicious actors during the registration of new phishing domain names. We compile a comprehensive list of 73 features encompassing three main latent factors: registration attributes, proactive verification, and reactive security practices. Through a GLM regression analysis, we find that each dollar reduction in registration fees corresponds to a 49% increase in malicious domains. The availability of free services, such as web hosting, drives an 88% surge in phishing activities. Conversely, stringent restrictions cut down abuse by 63%, while registrars providing API access for domain registration or account creation experience a staggering 401% rise in malicious domains. This exploration may assist intermediaries involved in domain registration to develop tailored anti-abuse practices, yet aligning them with their economic incentives.</description>

      <title>Value of Communication in Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications: A Pareto Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging cyber-physical systems increasingly operate under stringent communication constraints that preclude the reliable transmission of their extensive machine-type data streams. Since raw measurements often contain correlated or redundant components, effective operation depends not on transmitting all available data but on selecting the information that contributes to achieving the objectives of the system. Beyond accuracy, goal-oriented semantic communication assesses the \emph{value of information} and aims to generate and transmit only what is relevant and at the right time. Motivated by this perspective, this work studies the \emph{value of communication} through the canonical setting of remote estimation of Markov sources, where a value-of-information measure quantifies the relevance of information. We investigate how optimal estimation performance varies with the available communication budget and determine the marginal performance gain attributable to additional communication. Our approach is based on a \emph{Pareto analysis} that characterizes the complete set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between estimation performance and communication cost. The value of communication is defined as the absolute slope of the resulting Pareto frontier. Although computing this frontier is non-trivial, we demonstrate that in our setting it admits a notably tractable structure: it is strictly decreasing, convex, and piecewise linear, and its slope is governed by a finite collection of constants. Moreover, each Pareto-optimal operating point is realizable as a convex combination of two stationary deterministic policies, enabling practical implementation. Leveraging these structural insights, we introduce SPLIT, an efficient and provably optimal algorithm for constructing the complete Pareto frontier.</description>

      <title>Towards a Multi-Layer Defence Framework for Securing Near-Real-Time Operations in Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Securing the near-real-time (near-RT) control operations in Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) is increasingly critical, yet remains insufficiently addressed, as new runtime threats target the control loop while the system is operational. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories, message-level, data-level, and control logic-level, and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on execution-time hash challenge-response. The framework is evaluated on an O-RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated.</description>

      <title>Secure Over-the-Air Computation Against Multiple Eavesdroppers using Correlated Artificial Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of the Internet of Things and massive connectivity, many engineering applications, such as sensor fusion and federated edge learning, rely on efficient data aggregation from geographically distributed users over wireless networks. Over-the-air computation shows promising potential for enhancing resource efficiency and scalability in such scenarios by leveraging the superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the use of uncoded transmission with linear mapping, it also suffers from security vulnerabilities that must be dealt with to allow widespread adoption. In this work, we consider a scenario where multiple cooperating eavesdroppers attempt to infer information about the aggregation result. We derive the optimal joint estimator for the eavesdroppers and provide bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy for both the eavesdroppers and the intended receiver. We show that significant inherent security exists against individual eavesdroppers due to channel misalignment. However, the security level is greatly compromised when the eavesdroppers can cooperate, motivating the need for deliberate security measures. A common measure is to add carefully calibrated perturbation signals (artificial noise) prior to data transmission to improve the security level. To this end, we propose a zero-forced artificial noise design that achieves a high level of security against cooperative eavesdroppers without compromising the aggregation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Feature-Based Semantics-Aware Scheduling for Energy-Harvesting Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices faces a critical challenge: The computational energy required for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often dominates communication costs. However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.</description>

      <title>Wall-Proximity Matters: Understanding the Effect of Device Placement with Respect to the Wall for Indoor Wi-Fi Sensing</title>

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has been extensively explored for various applications, including vital sign monitoring, human activity recognition, indoor localization, and tracking. However, practical implementation in real-world scenarios is hindered by unstable sensing performance and limited knowledge of wireless sensing coverage. While previous works have aimed to address these challenges, they have overlooked the impact of walls on dynamic sensing capabilities in indoor environments. To fill this gap, we present a theoretical model that accounts for the effect of wall-device distance on sensing coverage. By incorporating both the wall-reflected path and the line-of-sight (LoS) path for dynamic signals, we develop a comprehensive sensing coverage model tailored for indoor environments. This model demonstrates that strategically deploying the transmitter and receiver in proximity to the wall within a specific range can significantly expand sensing coverage. We assess the performance of our model through experiments in respiratory monitoring and stationary crowd counting applications, showcasing a notable 11.2% improvement in counting accuracy. These findings pave the way for optimized deployment strategies in Wi-Fi sensing, facilitating more effective and accurate sensing solutions across various applications.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Beam Prediction in mmWave Communications with Multimodal Realistic Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beamforming is a key technology in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications that improves signal transmission by optimizing directionality and intensity. However, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam sweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments. To address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained significant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR, radar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions. Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a novel resource-efficient learning framework is introduced for beam prediction, which leverages a custom-designed cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD) algorithm specifically tailored for beam prediction tasks, to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a radar-only student model, achieving high accuracy with reduced computational cost. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data.</description>

      <title>Negotiating strict latency limits for dynamic real-time services in vehicular time-sensitive networks</title>

Abstract: Future vehicles are expected to dynamically deploy in-vehicle applications within a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) while critical services continue to operate under hard real-time constraints. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) on the in-vehicle Ethernet layer is dedicated to ensure deterministic communication between critical services; its Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) supports dynamic resource reservations. However, the dynamic nature of service deployment challenges network resource configuration, since any new reservation may change the latency of already validated flows. Standard methods of worst-case latency analysis for CBS have been found incorrect, and current TSN stream reservation procedures lack mechanisms to signal application layer Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements or verify deadlines. In this paper, we propose and validate a QoS negotiation scheme that interacts with the TSN network controller to reserve resources while ensuring latency bounds. For the first time, this work comparatively evaluates reservation schemes using worst-case analysis and simulations of a realistic In-Vehicle Network (IVN) and demonstrates their impact on QoS guarantees, resource utilization, and setup times. We find that only one reservation scheme utilizing per-queue delay budgets and network calculus provides valid configurations and guarantees acceptable latency bounds throughout the IVN. The proposed service negotiation mechanism efficiently establishes 450 vehicular network reservations in just 11ms.</description>

      <title>On the Suitability of Wi-Fi for Interconnecting Moving Equipment in Industrial Environments</title>

Abstract: To ensure an unprecedented degree of flexibility, next-generation Industry 4.0/5.0 production plants increasingly rely on mobile devices, e.g., autonomous mobile robots and wearables. In these cases, a major requirement is getting rid of cables through the adoption of wireless networks. To this purpose, Wi-Fi is currently deemed one of the most promising solutions. Achieving reliable communications over the air for distributed real-time control applications is, however, not devoid of troubles. In fact, bounded transmission latency must be ensured for most of the exchanged packets. Moreover, for devices powered on batteries, energy consumption also needs to be taken into account. In this paper, a joint simulated analysis of these aspects is carried out to quantitatively evaluate what we can practically expect from Wi-Fi technology.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Local Combining with Decentralized Decoding for Distributed Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major bottleneck in uplink distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output networks is the sub-optimal performance of local combining schemes, coupled with high fronthaul load and computational cost inherent in centralized large scale fading decoding (LSFD) architectures. This paper introduces a decentralized decoding architecture that fundamentally breaks from the LSFD, by allowing each access point (AP) to calculate interference-suppressing local weights independently and apply them to its data estimates before transmission. Furthermore, two generalized local zero-forcing (ZF) frameworks, generalized partial full-pilot ZF (G-PFZF) and generalized protected weak PFZF (G-PWPFZF), are introduced, where each AP adaptively and independently determines its combining strategy through a local sum spectral efficiency (SE) optimization that classifies user equipments (UEs) as strong or weak, eliminating the fixed thresholds used in the PFZF and PWPFZF schemes. To enhance scalability, pilot-dependent combining vectors instead of user-dependent ones are introduced and are shared among users with the same pilot. The closed-form SE expressions corresponding to the proposed schemes are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes consistently outperform fixed-threshold counterparts, while the introduction of local weights yields lower overheads and computation costs with lower performance penalty compared to them.</description>

      <title>From AoI to QVAoI: Query-Based Semantics-Aware Scheduling for Energy-Harvesting IoT Status Update Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the freshness and significance of information in an IoT status update system where an Energy Harvesting (EH) device samples an information source and forwards the update packets to a destination node through a direct channel. We introduce and optimize a semantics-aware metric, Query Version Age of Information (QVAoI), in the system along with other metrics: Query Age of Information (QAoI), Version Age of Information (VAoI), and Age of Information (AoI). By employing the MDP framework, we formulate the optimization problem and determine the optimal transmission policies at the device, which involve deciding the time slots for updating, subject to the energy limitations imposed by the device's battery and energy arrivals. Through analytical and numerical results, we compare the performance of QVAoI-Optimal, QAoI-Optimal, VoI-Optimal, and AoI-Optimal policies with a baseline greedy policy. All semantics-aware policies show significantly improved performance compared to the greedy policy. The QVAoI-Optimal policy, in particular, demonstrates a significant performance improvement by either providing fresher, more relevant, and valuable updates with the same amount of energy arrivals or reducing the number of transmissions in the system to maintain the same level of freshness and significance of information compared to the QAoI-Optimal and other policies.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Trade-offs Between Graph Neural Networks and Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.
