      <title>Upper bounds on the dimension of the Schur $\mathsf{Lie}$-multiplier of $\mathsf{Lie}$-nilpotent Leibniz $n$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schur $\mathsf{Lie}$-multiplier of Leibniz algebras is the Schur multiplier of Leibniz algebras defined relative to the Liezation functor. In this paper, we study upper bounds for the dimension of the Schur $\mathsf{Lie}$-multiplier of $\mathsf{Lie}$-filiform Leibniz $n$-algebras and the Schur $\mathsf{Lie}$-multiplier of its $\mathsf{Lie}$-central factor. The upper bound obtained is associated to both the sequences of central binomial coefficients and the sum of the numbers located in the rhombus part of Pascal's triangle. Also, the pattern of counting the number of $\mathsf{Lie}$-brackets of a particular Leibniz $n$-algebra leads us to a new property of Pascal's triangle. Moreover, we discuss some results which improve the existing upper bound published in [23] for $m$-dimensional $\mathsf{Lie}$-nilpotent Leibniz $n$-algebras with $d$-dimensional $\mathsf{Lie}$-commutator. In particular, it is shown that if $\mathfrak{q}$ is an $m$-dimensional $\mathsf{Lie}$-nilpotent Leibniz $2$-algebra with one-dimensional $\mathsf{Lie}$-commutator, then $\dim\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{Lie}}(\mathfrak{q})\leq \frac{1}{2}m(m-1)-1.$</description>

      <title>On finite dimensional algebras with trivial derivation (automorphism)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with $n$ dimensional algebras, over any field, which have only trivial derivation (automorphism). It is shown that the corresponding sets of algebras are not empty and in algebraically closed field case they are dense subsets of the variety of $n$ dimensional algebras with respect to the Zariski topology. Some applications to the problems of local, $k$-local derivations(automorphisms) of finite dimensional algebras are provided as well.</description>

      <title>On prescribed characteristic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field. We show that given any $n$th degree monic polynomial $q(x)\in \mathbb{F}[x]$ and any matrix $A\in\mathbb{M}_n(\mathbb{F})$ whose trace coincides with the trace of $q(x)$ and consisting in its main diagonal of $k$ 0-blocks of order one, with $k&lt;n-k$, and an invertible non-derogatory block of order $n-k$, we can construct a square-zero matrix $N$ such that the characteristic polynomial of $A+N$ is exactly $q(x)$. We also show that the restriction $k&lt;n-k$ is necessary in the sense that, when the equality $k=n-k$ holds, not every characteristic polynomial having the same trace as $A$ can be obtained by adding a square-zero matrix. Finally, we apply our main result to decompose matrices into the sum of a square-zero matrix and some other matrix which is either diagonalizable, invertible, potent or torsion.</description>

      <title>A closer look at Witt rings for forms of higher degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Witt rings for nondegenerate forms $\varphi$ of degree $d$ over a field of characteristic 0 or greater than $d$ were defined by Harrison and Pareigis. We revisit and discuss their definition as well as some special cases, classify the $H$-forms employed in their definition, and define Witt rings of diagonal forms of degree $d$. We also define two new Witt rings for nondegenerate forms $\varphi$ of degree $d$.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Jacobsthal Spinor Sequences and Their Mathematical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, novel Hyperbolic spinor sequences of Jacobsthal, Jacobsthal-Lucas and Jacobsthal polynomial, which have not been studied before, are defined by investigating the relationship between spinors, which are important mathematical objects used in physics and mathematics, and split Jacobsthal and split Jacobsthal-Lucas quaternions, which are extensions of the known Jacobsthal and Jacobsthal-Lucas numbers to quaternion algebra. The recurrence relations of sequences whose members are Hyperbolic Jacobsthal, Jacobsthal-Lucas and Jacobsthal polynomial spinors are described. Additionally, certain properties of these spinors, such as the generator function and Binet formula, are presented and some identities resulting from these spinors are obtained.</description>

      <title>Classification of right nilpotent $\mathbb{F}_p$-braces of cardinality $p^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article the right nilpotent $\mathbb{F}_p$-braces of cardinality $p^5$ has been classified. We use the connection between nilpotent $\mathbb{F}_p$-braces of cardinality $p^5$ and nilpotent pre-Lie algebras of the same order, building on the known relationship between pre-Lie algebras and braces. Leveraging insights from the classification of nilpotent pre-Lie algebras over $\mathbb{F}_p$, we aim to provide a comprehensive classification of right nilpotent $\mathbb{F}_p$-braces of cardinality $p^5$.</description>

      <title>Quantum group deformations and quantum $ R $-(co)matrices vs. Quantum Duality Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the effect on quantum groups - namely, both QUEA's and QFSHA's - of deformations by twist and by 2-cocycles, showing how such deformations affect the semiclassical limit.
  As a second, more important task, we discuss how these deformation procedures can be "stretched" to a new extent, via a formal variation of the original recipes, using quasi-twists and quasi-2-cocycles. These recipes seemingly should make no sense at all, yet we prove that they actually work, thus providing well-defined, more general deformation procedures. Later on, we explain the underlying reason that motivates such a result: this comes from the "Quantum Duality Principle", through which every "quasi-twist/2-cocycle" for a given quantum group can be seen as a standard twist/2-cocycle for another quantum group, associated to the original one via the appropriate Drinfeld functor.
  As a third task, we consider standard constructions involving $ R $-(co)matrices in the general theory of Hopf algebras. First we adapt them to quantum groups, then we show that they extend to the case of quasi-$ R $-(co)matrices, and finally we discuss how these constructions interact with the Quantum Duality Principle. As a byproduct, this yields new special symmetries (isomorphisms) for the underlying pair of dual Poisson (formal) groups that one gets by specialization.</description>

      <title>Linear algebra over T-pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper treats linear algebra over a semiring pair, in a wide range of applications to tropical algebra and related areas such as hyperrings and fuzzy rings. First we present a more general category of ``pairs'' with their morphisms, called ``weak morphisms,'' paying special attention to supertropical pairs, hyperpairs, and the doubling functor. Then we turn to matrices and the question of whether the row rank, column rank, and submatrix rank of a matrix are equal. Often the submatrix rank is less than or equal to the row rank and the column rank, but there is a counterexample to equality, discovered some time ago by the second author, which we provide in a more general setting (``pairs of the second kind'') that includes the hyperfield of signs. Additional positive results include a version of Cramer's rule, and we find situations when equality holds, encompassing results by Akian, Gaubert, Guterman, Izhakian, Knebusch, and Rowen. We pay special attention to the question of whether $n+1$ vectors of length $n$ need be dependent. At the end, we introduce a category with stronger morphisms, that preserve a surpassing relation.</description>

      <title>Finite almost simple groups whose holomorph contains a solvable regular subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper, we gave a complete list of the finite non-abelian simple groups whose holomorph contains a solvable regular subgroup. In this paper, we refine our previous work by considering all finite almost simple groups. In particular, our result yields a complete characterization of the finite almost simple groups which occur as the type of a Hopf-Galois structure on a solvable extension, or equivalently, the additive group of a skew brace having a solvable multiplicative group.</description>
