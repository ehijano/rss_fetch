      <title>Detectability and Characterisation of Strongly Lensed Supernova Lightcurves in the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) was expected to detect more than one strong gravitationally-lensed supernova (glSN) per year, but only one event was identified in the first four years of the survey. This work investigates selection biases in the search strategy that could explain the discrepancy and revise discovery predictions. We present simulations of realistic lightcurves for lensed thermonuclear (glSNIa) and core-collapse supernova (glCCSN) explosions over a span of 5.33 years of the survey, utilizing the actual observation logs of ZTF. We find that the magnitude limit in spectroscopic screening significantly biases the selection towards highly magnified glSNe, for which the detection rates are consistent with the identification of a single object by ZTF. To reach the higher predicted rate of detections requires an optimization of the identification criteria for fainter objects. We find that around 1.36 (3.08) Type Ia SNe (CCSNe) are identifiable with the magnification method per year in ZTF, but when applying the magnitude cut of m &lt; 19 mag, the detection rates decrease to 0.17 (0.32) per year. We compare our simulations with the previously found lensed Type Ia SNe, iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky, and conclude that considering the bias towards highly magnified events, the findings are within expectations in terms of detection rates and lensing properties of the systems. In addition, we provide a set of selection cuts based on simple observables to distinguish glSNe from regular, unlensed, supernovae to select potential candidates for spectroscopic and high-spatial resolution follow-up campaigns. We find optimal cuts in observed colours $g-r$, $g-i$, and $r-i$ as well as in the colour SALT2 fit parameter. The developed pipeline and the simulated lightcurves employed in this analysis can be found in the $LENSIT$ github repository.</description>

      <title>Probing Shocked Ejecta in SN 1987A with XRISM-Resolve: the effects of the gate valve closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A is widely regarded as an excellent candidate for leveraging the capabilities of the freshly launched XRISM satellite. Recent researches indicate that the X-ray emission from SN 1987A will increasingly originate from its ejecta in the years to come. In a previous study, we thoroughly examined the proficiency of XRISM-Resolve in identifying signatures of shocked ejecta in SN 1987A, synthesizing the XRISM-Resolve spectrum based on a state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamic simulation. However, following the satellite's launch, a technical issue arose with the XRISM instrument's gate valve, which failed to open, thereby affecting observations with the Resolve spectrometer. Here, we update our analysis, reevaluating our diagnostic approach under the assumption that the gate valve remains closed. We find that, even with the reduced instrumental capabilities, it will be possible to pinpoint the ejecta contribution through the study of the line profiles in the XRISM-Resolve spectrum of SN 1987A.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. X-ray emission from the warm-hot phase gas in long cosmic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in the cosmic filaments are among the least quantified in modern astrophysics. eROSITA All Sky Survey (eRASS) provides us with a unique opportunity to study the X-ray emission of the WHIM. We applied both imaging and spectroscopic stacking techniques to the data of the first four eRASS scans to inspect the X-ray emissions from 7817 cosmic filaments identified from Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical galaxy samples. We obtained a 9-sigma significant detection of the total X-ray signal from filaments in the 0.3-1.2 keV band. We introduce a novel method to estimate the contamination fraction from unmasked X-ray halos, active galactic nuclei, and X-ray binaries that are associated with galaxies in filaments. We found an approximately 40% contamination fraction by these unmasked sources, suggesting that the remaining 60% of the signal could be from the WHIM and a 5.4-sigma detection significance of the WHIM. Moreover, we modeled the temperature and baryon density contrast of the detected WHIM by fitting the stacked spectrum and surface brightness profile. The best-fit temperature log(T/k)=6.84+/-0.07 obtained by using a single temperature model is marginally higher than the simulation results, which could be due to the fitting of a single temperature model on a multi-temperature spectrum. The best-fit baryon density contrast log\Delta_b=1.88+/-0.18 generally agrees with the X-ray emitting phases in the IllustrisTNG simulation, suggesting that the broadband X-ray emission traces the high temperature and density end of the entire WHIM population.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Crab Nebula with JWST: Pulsar wind, dusty filaments, and Ni/Fe abundance constraints on the explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST observations of the Crab Nebula, the iconic remnant of the historical SN 1054. The observations include NIRCam and MIRI imaging mosaics, plus MIRI/MRS IFU spectra that probe two select locations within the ejecta filaments. We derive a high-resolution map of dust emission and show that the grains are concentrated in the innermost, high-density filaments. These dense filaments coincide with multiple synchrotron bays around the periphery of the Crab's pulsar wind nebula (PWN). We measure synchrotron spectral index changes in small-scale features within the PWN's torus region, including the well-known knot and wisp structures. The index variations are consistent with Doppler boosting of emission from particles with a broken power-law distribution, providing the first direct evidence that the curvature in the particle injection spectrum is tied to the acceleration mechanism at the termination shock. We detect multiple nickel and iron lines in the ejecta filaments and use photoionization models to derive nickel-to-iron abundance ratios that are a factor of 3-8 higher than the solar ratio. We also find that the previously reported order-of-magnitude higher Ni/Fe values from optical data are consistent with the lower values from JWST when we reanalyze the optical emission using updated atomic data and account for local extinction from dust. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding the nature of the explosion that produced the Crab Nebula and conclude that the observational properties are most consistent with a low-mass iron-core-collapse supernova, even though an electron-capture explosion cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>High priority targets for transient gravitational waves from glitching pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glitching pulsars are expected to be important sources of gravitational waves. In this paper, we explore six different models that propose the emission of transient continuous waves, lasting days to months, coincident with glitches. The maximal gravitational wave energy is calculated for each model, which is then used to determine whether associated gravitational waves could be detectable with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's O4 detectors. We provide an analytical approximation to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio which includes information about the source's sky position, improving on previous estimates that assume isotropic or sky and orientation averaged sensitivities. Applying the calculation to the entire glitching population, we find that certain models predict detectable signals in O4, whereas others do not. We also rank glitching pulsars in order of how significant a signal would be, based on archival data, and we find that for all models, the Vela pulsar (PSR J0835$-$4510) would provide the strongest signal. Moreover, PSR J0537$-$6910 is not expected to yield a detectable signal in O4, but will start becoming relevant for next generation detectors. Our analysis also extends to the entire pulsar population, regardless of whether they have glitched or not, and we provide a list of pulsars that would present a significant signal, if they were to glitch. Finally, we apply our analysis to the latest April 2024 Vela glitch and find that a signal should be detectable under certain models. The non-detection of a supposedly detectable signal would provide an efficiency factor that quantifies how much a model can contribute to gravitational wave emission, eventually leading to a differentiation of models and independent constraints on physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Velocity decorrelation functions of high-energy cosmic rays propagating in magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion tensor coefficients play a central role in describing cosmic-ray transport in various astrophysical environments permeated with magnetic fields, which are usually modeled as a fluctuating field on top of a mean field. In this article, a formal derivation of these coefficients is presented by means of the calculation of velocity decorrelation functions of particles. It relies mainly on expanding the 2-pt correlation function of the (fluctuating) magnetic field experienced by the particles between two successive times in the form of an infinite Dyson series and retaining a class of terms that converge to a physical solution. Subsequently, the velocity decorrelation functions, themselves expressed as Dyson series, are deduced from an iteration procedure that improves on the partial summation scheme. The results are shown to provide approximate solutions compared to those obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations as long as the Larmor radius of the particles is larger than at least one tenth of the largest scale of the turbulence.</description>

      <title>Residual neural networks to classify the high frequency emission in core-collapse supernova gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a detailed study on the detectability of the High Frequency Feature (HFF) in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) gravitational wave (GW) signals. We applied Residual Neural Networks (ResNet50), one of the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures in computer vision, to perform a multi-class classification of image samples built from time-frequency Morlet wavelet scalograms of LIGO-Virgo noise plus CCSN GW signals. We consider three target labels for three consecutive and mutually exclusive intervals in which the (first-order) slope of the HFF can be located. We optimized, trained, and tested the ResNet50 model with phenomenological waveforms. Next, we tested the optimized ResNet50 model with GW signals from CCSN simulations. At galactic distances of $1$Kpc and $5$Kpc with H1 and L1 data and $1$Kpc with V1 data, we obtained highly accurate results (test accuracies from $0.8933$ to $0.9867$), which show the feasibility of our methodology. In the case of further distances, we observed declines in test performance until $0.8000$ with H1 and L1 data at $10$Kpc and until $0.5933$ with V1 data at $10$Kpc. Without assuming the continuity and/or discontinuity of the HFF slope values, our methodology is general enough to address, at an early stage, the characterization of the HFF.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray burst Jet Progenitor: long vs short bursts by angular momentum and mass ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the homologous collapse dynamics of a slowly rotating stellar nuclear core. We incorporate the virial theorem of hadron collisional relaxations to analyze the conversion of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy of hadrons. Additionally, we consider the production of photons and electron-positron pairs resulting from hadron collisions. Our analysis reveals a gravo-thermal process wherein gravitational energy transforms into energy associated with photons and pairs. The presence of axial symmetric centrifugal potential reduces the gravitational potential energy gain. The presence of axial symmetric centrifugal potential mitigates the gain in gravitational potential energy. Consequently, we observe the formation of highly energetic and opaque photon-pair jets, whose size, peak spectra, energy and number densities are consistent with observed energetic features and empirical relationships of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) progenitors. Furthermore, we find that the angular momentum and mass ratio ($J/M$) of the collapsing core and binary coalescence play crucial roles in determining the jet angle and the differentiation between short and long bursts. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing GRBs' progenitor systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Energy Distribution and Formation Rate of CHIME Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a large sample of fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we apply the Lynden-Bell's c$^-$ method to study their energy function and formation rate evolutions with redshift. It is found with the non-parametric Kendell's $\tau$ statistics that the FRB energy strongly evolves with the cosmological redshift as $E(z)\propto(1 + z)^{5.23}$. After removing the redshift dependence, the local energy distribution can be described by a broken power-law form of $\Psi(E_{0})\propto E_{0}^{-0.38}$ for the low-energy segment and $\Psi(E_{0})\propto E_{0}^{-2.01}$ for the high-energy segment with a dividing line of $\sim2.1\times10^{40} \rm erg$. Interestingly, we find that the formation rate of CHIME FRBs also evolves with redshift as $\rho(z)\propto(1+z)^{-4.73\pm0.08}$. The local formation rate $\rho(0)$ of the CHIME FRBs is constrained to be about $ 1.25\times 10^4\rm{\,Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ that is comparable with some previous estimations. In addition, we notice the formation rate not only exceeds the star formation rate at the lower redshifts but also always declines with the increase of redshift, which does not match the star formation history at all. Consequently, we suggest that most FRBs could originate from the older stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive analysis of the Apertif Fast Radio Burst sample: similarities with young, energetic neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has become the main science driver of recent dedicated FRB surveys. Between July 2019 and February 2022, we carried out ALERT, an FRB survey at 1370 MHz using the Apertif instrument installed at the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). Here we report the detection of 18 new FRBs, and we study the properties of the entire 24 burst sample detected during the survey. For five bursts, we identify host galaxy candidates with &gt;50% probability association. We observe an average linear polarisation fraction of $\sim$43% and an average circular polarisation fraction consistent with 0%. A third of the FRBs display multiple components. The sample next reveals a population of highly scattered bursts, which is most likely to have been produced in the immediate circumburst environment. Furthermore, two FRBs show evidence for high rotation measures, reaching |RM|&gt;$10^3$ rad m$^{-2}$ in the source reference frames. Together, the scattering and rotation measures ALERT finds prove that a large fraction of FRBs are embedded in complex media such as star forming regions or supernova remnants. Through the discovery of the third most dispersed FRB so far, we show that one-off FRBs can emit at frequencies in excess of 6 GHz. Finally, we determine an FRB all-sky rate of $459^{+208}_{-155}$ sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a fluence limit of 4.1 Jy ms, and a fluence cumulative distribution with a power law index $\gamma=-1.23\pm0.06\pm0.2$, which is roughly consistent with the Euclidean Universe predictions. Through the high resolution in time, frequency, polarisation and localisation that ALERT featured, we were able to determine the morphological complexity, polarisation, local scattering and magnetic environment, and high-frequency luminosity of FRBs. We find all these strongly resemble those seen in young, energetic, highly magnetised neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Radio Images inside Highly Magnetized Jet Funnels Based on Semi-Analytic GRMHD Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By performing general relativistic radiative transfer calculations, we show the radio images of relativistic jets including highly magnetized regions inside jet funnels, based on steady, axisymmetric, and semi-analytic general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models. It is found that multiple ring images appear at the photon frequency of 230 GHz for nearly pole-on observers, because of the strong light bending effect on photons generated at the separation surfaces which is the boundary between the inflow and outflow flows in the jet funnel. A bright teardrop-shaped component, which extends from the bright rings of the separation surface, also appears in the counter jet region. The diameter of the brightest outermost ring originated from the counter jet is $\sim 60 ~ \mu {\rm as}$, which is consistent with the ring-like images of M87 at 86 GHz observed with GMVA, ALMA and GLT, whose ring-diameter is $\sim 64^{+4}_{-8} ~\mu {\rm as}$. The thinner and smaller-diameter rings are exhibited when the black-hole spin magnitude is higher. These morphological features are expected to appear without being prominently affected by the detailed MHD-plasma parameters of our GRMHD jet model, since the location of the separation surfaces is mainly regulated by the black hole spin. Our GRMHD model and the emission features of the images in the horizon-scale, highly magnetized jet funnel may be tested by future observations, e.g., the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope and the Black Hole Explorer.</description>

      <title>Role of particle diffusion in shaping the gravitational wave signal from neutron star inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that the dissipative properties of superdense matter play a negligible role in modeling gravitational waveforms from neutron star inspirals. This study aims to investigate whether this presumption holds true for the often neglected dissipative process associated with particle diffusion in superconducting neutron stars. As we demonstrate, diffusion effects can significantly impact the phase of the gravitational wave from the inspiral, manifesting at a magnitude of a few tens of milliradians at large orbit separations, equivalent to orbital frequencies of a few hertz. We also find that dissipation resulting from particle diffusion might increase the neutron star's temperature to approximately $10^7\rm K$ during the inspiral.</description>

      <title>ViCTORIA project: The LOFAR-MeerKAT view of AGN in Virgo cluster early-type galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is closely connected to their host galaxies and surroundings. Via feedback processes, AGN can counteract the cooling of the intracluster medium (ICM) and suppress star formation in their host galaxies. Radio observations at low frequencies provide a glimpse into the history of AGN activity. The Virgo cluster is a substantial reservoir of nearby galaxies and provides an ideal laboratory for the study of AGN as well as their feedback mechanisms. The aim of our work is to characterise the AGN population within the Virgo cluster down to low radio luminosities, constrain the AGN duty cycle and investigate environmental feedback in cluster member galaxies. We analyse 144 MHz and 1.3 GHz radio observations of early-type galaxies from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS) taken with LOFAR and MeerKAT. We detect 12 of these galaxies at 144 MHz, 5 of which show clearly extended radio emission. The radio luminosity shows a strong dependence on the stellar mass of the host galaxy, in agreement with previous results. As a notable outlier, the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 4365 ($M_* = 2.2 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$) is not detected as a compact source in the LOFAR observations. Instead, it is surrounded by diffuse, low-surface brightness emission, which hints towards a past phase of stronger nuclear activity. Furthermore, we find a cavity in NGC 4472 (= M 49) inflated by the wide-angle tail only visible in the LOFAR data, which implies that the cavity was created by a past outburst. The corresponding cavity power is of the same order of magnitude as the jet power in the present duty cycle of the AGN.</description>

      <title>High-energy Neutrino Source Cross-correlations with Nearest Neighbor Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysical origins of the majority of the IceCube neutrinos remain unknown. Effectively characterizing the spatial distribution of the neutrino samples and associating the events with astrophysical source catalogs can be challenging given the large atmospheric neutrino background and underlying non-Gaussian spatial features in the neutrino and source samples. In this paper, we investigate a framework for identifying and statistically evaluating the cross-correlations between IceCube data and an astrophysical source catalog based on the $k$-Nearest Neighbor Cumulative Distribution Functions ($k$NN-CDFs). We propose a maximum likelihood estimation procedure for inferring the true proportions of astrophysical neutrinos in the point-source data. We conduct a statistical power analysis of an associated likelihood ratio test with estimations of its sensitivity and discovery potential with synthetic neutrino data samples and a WISE-2MASS galaxy sample. We apply the method to IceCube's public ten-year point-source data and find no statistically significant evidence for spatial cross-correlations with the selected galaxy sample. We discuss possible extensions to the current method and explore the method's potential to identify the cross-correlation signals in data sets with different sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Gamma-Ray Emission of the Supernova Remnant RCW 103</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze more than 15 years of the \gr\ data, obtained with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard {\it the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}, for the region of the young supernova remnant (SNR) RCW~103, since the nearby source 4FGL J1616.2$-$5054e, counterpart to HESS~J1616$-$518 and $\simeq$13\,arcmin away from the SNR, is determined to be extended in the more recent Fermi-LAT source catalog. Different templates for 4FGL J1616.2$-$5054e and RCW~103 are tested, and we find that a point source with a power-law (PL) spectrum at the southern limb of the SNR best describes the detected gamma-ray emission. The photon index of the PL emission is $\Gamma\simeq 2.31$, softer than the previously reported $\Gamma\simeq 2.0$ when the counterpart to HESS~J1616$-$518 was considered to be a point source (which likely caused mis-identification of extended emission at RCW~103). In order to produce the \gr\ emission in a hadronic scenario, we estimate that protons with an index$\sim$2.4 PL energy distribution are needed. These results fit with those from multi-wavelength observations that have indicated the remnant at the southern limb is interacting with a molecular cloud.</description>

      <title>Progenitor and explosion properties of SN 2023ixf estimated based on a light-curve model grid of Type II supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the progenitor and explosion properties of the nearby Type II SN 2023ixf using a synthetic model grid of Type II supernova light curves. By comparing the light curves of SN 2023ixf with the pre-existing grid of Type II supernovae containing about 228,000 models with different combinations of the progenitor and explosion properties, we obtain the chi2 value for every model and evaluate the properties of the models providing small values of chi2. We found that the light-curve models with the progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass of 10 Msun, the explosion energy of (2-3)e51 erg, the 56Ni mass of 0.04-0.06 Msun, the mass-loss rate of 1e-3 - 1e-2 Msun/yr with a wind velocity of 10 km/s, and the dense, confined circumstellar matter radius of (6-10)e14 cm match well to the observed light curves of SN 2023ixf. The photospheric velocity evolution of these models is also consistent with the observed velocity evolution. Although our parameter estimation is based on a pre-existing model grid and we do not perform any additional computations, the estimated parameters are consistent with those obtained by the detailed modeling of SN 2023ixf previously reported. This result shows that comparing the pre-existing model grid is a reasonable way to obtain a rough estimate for the properties of Type II supernovae. This simple way to estimate the properties of Type II supernovae will be essential in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) era when thousands of Type II supernovae are expected to be discovered yearly.</description>

      <title>General relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium disks around rotating neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modeling a relativistic disk around a compact object, the self-gravity of the disk is often neglected while it needs to be incorporated for more accurate descriptions in several circumstances. Extending the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu self-consistent field method, we present numerical models of a rapidly rotating neutron star with a self-gravitating disk in stationary equilibrium. In particular, our approach allows us to obtain numerical solutions involving a massive disk with the rest mass $O(10^{-1})-O(10^0) M_\odot$ closely attached to a rotating neutron star. We also assess the impact of self-gravity on the internal structure of the disk and the neutron star. These axisymmetric, stationary solutions can be employed for simulations involving the neutron star-disk system in the context of high-energy transients and gravitational wave emissions.</description>

      <title>The Energy Budget in the Jet of High-frequency Peaked BL Lacertae Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy equipartition and the energy budget in the jet are import issues for the radiation mechanism of blazars. Early work predominantly concentrated on flat-spectrum radio quasars and a limited number of BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs). In this paper, we compile 348 high-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs) based on the catalog of active galactic nuclei (4LAC-DR3) from Fermi-LAT, and employ \textit{JetSet} to fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these HBLs in the framework of the one-zone lepton model. We aim to determine whether the energy budget is reasonable and whether the energy equipartition is satisfied in HBLs. The results of the statistical analysis suggest that: (1) SEDs of HBLs can be reproduced well by using the one-zone lepton model; however it cannot achieve the energy equalization, and the relativistic electron energy density is far greater than the magnetic field energy density, $U_{e} \gtrsim100 U_{B}$; (2) the majority of the HBLs are located in the $t_{cool}$$&lt;$$t_{dyn}$ region (where the horizontal coordinate represents the jet power of electrons, while the ordinate indicates the ratio between the dynamic time scale to the cooling timescale), and the jet kinetic power of HBLs is greater than the jet power of radiation; there is a very low radiation efficiency, we deduce that HBLs may have optically thin advection-dominated accretion flows; (3) the $\log\epsilon_{B}$ of HBLs is less than zero, which indicates that the jet kinetic power of HBLs is not affected by Poynting flux; (4) the relationships with $U_{e} &gt;U_{Syn}\sim U_{B}$, $L_{e}\sim L_{p}&gt;L_{B}\sim L_{rad}$ and $\log\epsilon_{e}&gt;0.5$ are established. These relations indicate that most of the energy of HBLs is stored in the population of low-energy electrons.</description>

      <title>Separating source-intrinsic and Lorentz invariance violation induced delays in the very high energy emission of blazar flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: The aim of the present study is to explore how to disentangle energy-dependent time delays due to a possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) at Planck scale from intrinsic delays expected in standard blazar flares.
  Methods: We first characterise intrinsic time delays in BL Lacs and Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars in standard one-zone time-dependent synchrotron self-Compton or external Compton models, during flares produced by particle acceleration and cooling processes. We simulate families of flares with both intrinsic and external LIV-induced energy-dependent delays. Discrimination between intrinsic and LIV delays is then investigated in two different ways. A technique based on Euclidean distance calculation between delays obtained in the synchrotron and in the inverse-Compton spectral bumps is used to assess their degree of correlation. A complementary study is performed using spectral hardness versus intensity diagrams in both energy ranges.
  Results: We show that the presence of non-negligible LIV effects, which essentially act only at very high energies (VHE), can drastically reduce the strong correlation expected between the X-ray and the VHE gamma-ray emission in leptonic scenarios. The LIV phenomenon can then be hinted at measuring the Euclidean distance $d_{E}$ from simultaneous X-ray and gamma-ray flare monitoring. Large values of minimal distance $d_{E,min}$ would directly indicate the influence of non-intrinsic time delays possibly due to LIV in SSC flares. LIV effects can also significantly modify the VHE hysteresis patterns in hardness-intensity diagrams and even change their direction of rotation as compared to the X-ray behaviour. Both observables could be used to discriminate between LIV and intrinsic delays, provided high quality flare observations are available.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetospheric current sheets in pair enrichment and ultra-high energy proton acceleration in M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in numerical simulations of magnetically arrested accretion onto supermassive black holes have shed light on the formation and dynamics of magnetospheric current sheets near the black hole horizon. By considering the pair magnetization $\sigma_{\rm e}$ in the upstream region and the mass accretion rate $\dot{m}$ (in units of the Eddington mass accretion rate) as free parameters we estimate the strength of the magnetic field and develop analytical models, motivated by recent three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, to describe the populations of relativistic electron and positrons (pairs) in the reconnection region. Applying our model to M87*, we numerically compute the non-thermal photon spectra for various values of $\sigma_e$. We show that pairs that are accelerated up to the synchrotron radiation-limited energy while meandering across both sides of the current sheet, can produce MeV flares with luminosity of $\sim 10^{41}$~erg s$^{-1}$ -- independent of $\sigma_e$ -- for a black hole accreting at $\dot{m}=10^{-5}$. Pairs that are trapped in the transient current sheet can produce X-ray counterparts to the MeV flares, lasting about a day for current sheets with length of a few gravitational radii. We also show that the upstream plasma can be enriched due to photon-photon pair creation, and derive a new equilibrium magnetization of $\sigma_e \sim 10^3-10^4$ for $\dot{m}=10^{-6} - 10^{-5}$. Additionally, we explore the potential of magnetospheric current sheets to accelerate protons to ultra-high energies, finding that while acceleration to such energies is limited by various loss mechanisms, such as synchrotron and photopion losses from the non-thermal emission from pairs, maximal proton energies in the range of a few EeV are attainable in magnetospheric sheets forming around supermassive sub-Eddington accreting black holes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Origin of Ultra-Long Gamma-ray Bursts: Lessons from GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brightest Gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever, GRB 221009A, displays ultra-long GRB (ULGRB) characteristics, with a prompt emission duration exceeding 1000 s. To constrain the origin and central engine of this unique burst, we analyze its prompt and afterglow characteristics and compare them to the established set of similar GRBs. To achieve this, we statistically examine a nearly complete sample of Swift-detected GRBs with measured redshifts. Categorizing the sample to Bronze, Silver, and Gold by fitting a Gaussian function to the log-normal of T$_{90}$ duration distribution and considering three sub-samples respectively to 1, 2, and 3 times of the standard deviation to the mean value. GRB 221009A falls into the Gold sub-sample. Our analysis of prompt emission and afterglow characteristics aims to identify trends between the three burst groups. Notably, the Gold sub-sample (a higher likelihood of being ULGRB candidates) suggests a collapsar scenario with a hyper-accreting black hole as a potential central engine, while a few GRBs (GRB 060218, GRB 091024A, and GRB 100316D) in our Gold sub-sample favor a magnetar. Late-time near-IR (NIR) observations from 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) rule out the presence of any bright supernova associated with GRB 221009A in the Gold sub-sample. To further constrain the physical properties of ULGRB progenitors, we employ the tool MESA to simulate the evolution of low-metallicity massive stars with different initial rotations. The outcomes suggest that rotating ($\Omega \geq 0.2\,\Omega_{\rm c}$) massive stars could potentially be the progenitors of ULGRBs within the considered parameters and initial inputs to MESA.</description>

      <title>ZIJI: a model to calculate X-ray spectra of black hole X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the disk-corona model, the X-ray spectrum of a stellar-mass black hole in an X-ray binary is characterized by three components: a thermal component from a thin and cold accretion disk, a Comptonized component from a hot corona, and a reflection component produced by illumination of the cold disk by the hot corona. In this paper, we present ZIJI, which is a model to calculate the X-ray spectrum of black hole X-ray binaries in the disk-corona model. The accretion disk is described by the Novikov-Thorne model. The reflection spectrum is produced by the direct radiation from the corona as well as by the returning radiation of the thermal and reflection components and is calculated considering the actual spectrum illuminating the disk. If we turn the corona off, the reflection spectrum is completely generated by the returning radiation of the thermal component, as it may happen for some sources in soft spectral states. The user decides the radial density profile of the accretion disk and the ionization parameter is calculated self-consistently at any radial coordinate of the disk from the illuminating X-ray flux and the local electron density. We show the predictions of ZIJI in different regimes. We discuss current limitations of our model as well as the next steps to improve it.</description>

      <title>Localisation of the non-thermal X-ray emission of PSR~J2229+6114 from its multi-wavelength pulse profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars are detected over the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from radio wavelengths up to very high energies, in the GeV-TeV range. Whereas the radio emission site for young pulsars is well constrained to occur at altitudes about several percent of the light-cylinder radius and $\gamma$-ray emission is believed to be produced in the striped wind, outside the light-cylinder, their non-thermal X-ray production site remains unknown. The aim of this letter is to localize the non-thermal X-ray emission region based on multi-wavelength pulse profile fitting for PSR J2229+6114, a particularly good candidate due to its high X-ray brightness. Based on the geometry deduced from the joint radio and $\gamma$-ray pulse profiles, we fix the magnetic axis inclination angle and the line of sight inclination angle but we leave the region of X-ray emission unlocalised, somewhere between the surface and the light-cylinder. We localize this region and its extension by fitting the X-ray pulse profile as observed by the NICER, NuSTAR and RXTE telescopes in the ranges 2-7 keV, 3-10 keV and 9.4-22.4 keV, respectively. We constrain the non-thermal X-ray emission to arise from altitudes between $0.2\,r_L$ and $0.55\,r_L$ where $r_L$ is the light cylinder radius. The magnetic obliquity is approximately $\alpha \approx 45\deg-50\deg$ and the line of sight inclination angle $\zeta \approx 32\deg-48\deg$. This letter is among the first works to tightly constrain the location of the non-thermal X-ray emission from pulsars. We plan to apply this procedure to several other good candidates to confirm this new result.</description>

      <title>The Origins of Narrow Spectra of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations find that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) have extremely narrow-band spectra, i.e., $\Delta\nu/\nu_0 \ll 1$. We show that when the angular size of the emission region is larger than the Doppler beaming angle, the observed spectral width ($\Delta\nu/\nu_0$) exceeds 0.58 due to the {\it high latitude effects} for a source outside the magnetosphere, even when the spectrum in the source's comoving frame is monochromatic. The angular size of the source for magnetospheric models of FRBs can be smaller than the Doppler beaming angle, in which case this geometric effect does not influence the observed bandwidth. We discuss various propagation effects to determine if any could transform a broad-spectrum radio pulse into a narrow-spectrum signal at the observer's location. We find that plasma lensing and scintillation can result in a narrow bandwidth in the observed spectrum. However, the likelihood of these phenomena being responsible for the narrow observed spectra with $\Delta\nu/\nu_0 &lt; 0.58$ in the fairly large observed sample of FRBs is exceedingly small.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal emission from mildly relativistic tidal ejecta of compact objects merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mergers of compact objects (binary neutron stars, BNS, or neutron star-black hole, NSBH) with a substantial mass ratio ($q&gt;1.5$) are expected to produce a mildly relativistic ejecta within $\sim20^\circ$ from the orbital plane. We present a semi-analytic approach to calculate the expected synchrotron emission observed from various viewing angles, along with the corresponding radio maps, that are produced by a collisionless shock driven by such ejecta into the interstellar medium. This method is supported by 2D numerical calculations of the full relativistic hydrodynamics with an agreement in the observed emission of $\sim30\%$. We consider a toroid ejecta with an opening angle of $15^\circ\leq\theta_ \text{open}\leq30^\circ$ and broken power-law mass distribution, $M(&gt;\gamma\beta)\propto(\gamma\beta)^{-s}$ with $s=s_{\rm KN}$ at $\gamma\beta&lt;\gamma_0\beta_0$ and $s=s_{\rm ft}$ at $\gamma\beta&gt;\gamma_0\beta_0$ (where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor). While the peak flux is dimmer by a factor of $\sim$2-3, and the peak time remains roughly the same (within $20\%$), for various viewing angles compared to isotropic equivalent ejecta ($\theta_\text{open}=90^\circ$) considered in preceding papers, the radio maps are significantly different from the spherical case. The semi-analytic method can provide information on the ejecta geometry and viewing angle from future radio map observations and, consequently, constrain the ejection mechanism. Due to the larger ejected mass in NSBH merger, this late non-thermal signal can be observed to distances of $\lesssim 200$Mpc for typical parameter values.</description>

      <title>Magnetar central engine powering the energetic GRB 210610B ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bright GRB 210610B was discovered simultaneously by Fermi and Swift missions at redshift 1.13. We utilized broadband Fermi-GBM observations to perform a detailed prompt emission spectral analysis and to understand the radiation physics of the burst. Our analysis displayed that the low energy spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm pt}$) exceeds boundaries expected from the typical synchrotron emission spectrum (-1.5,-0.67), suggesting additional emission signature. We added an additional thermal model with the typical Band or CPL function and found that CPL + BB function is better fitting to the data, suggesting a hybrid jet composition for the burst. Further, we found that the beaming corrected energy (E$_{\rm \gamma, \theta_{j}}$ = 1.06 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg) of the burst is less than the total energy budget of the magnetar. Additionally, the X-ray afterglow light curve of this burst exhibits achromatic plateaus, adding another layer of complexity to the explosion's behavior. Interestingly, we noted that the X-ray energy release during the plateau phase (E$_{\rm X,iso}$ = 1.94 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg) is also less than the total energy budget of the magnetar.

      <title>Energetic Electrons Accelerated and Trapped in a Magnetic Bottle above a Solar Flare Arcade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Where and how flares efficiently accelerate charged particles remains an unresolved question. Recent studies revealed that a "magnetic bottle" structure, which forms near the bottom of a large-scale reconnection current sheet above the flare arcade, is an excellent candidate for confining and accelerating charged particles. However, further understanding its role requires linking the various observational signatures to the underlying coupled plasma and particle processes. Here we present the first study combining multi-wavelength observations with data-informed macroscopic magnetohydrodynamics and particle modeling in a realistic eruptive flare geometry. The presence of an above-the-looptop magnetic bottle structure is strongly supported by the observations, which feature not only a local minimum of magnetic field strength but also abruptly slowing down plasma downflows. It also coincides with a compact hard X-ray source and an extended microwave source that bestrides above the flare arcade. Spatially resolved spectral analysis suggests that nonthermal electrons are highly concentrated in this region. Our model returns synthetic emission signatures that are well-matched to the observations. The results suggest that the energetic electrons are strongly trapped in the magnetic bottle region due to turbulence, with only a small fraction managing to escape. The electrons are primarily accelerated by plasma compression and facilitated by a fast-mode termination shock via the Fermi mechanism. Our results provide concrete support for the magnetic bottle as the primary electron acceleration site in eruptive solar flares. They also offer new insights into understanding the previously reported small population of flare-accelerated electrons entering interplanetary space.</description>

      <title>Progenitor mass and ejecta asymmetry of SN 2023ixf from nebular spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. SN 2023ixf was discovered in Galaxy M101 in May 2023. Its proximity made it an extremely valuable opportunity for the scientific community to study the characteristics of the SN and its progenitor. A point source detected on archival images and hydrodynamical modelling of the bolometric light curve has been used to constrain the former star's properties. There is a significant variation in the published results regarding the initial mass of the progenitor. Nebular spectroscopy provides an independent tool to enhance our understanding of the supernova and its progenitor. Aims. We determine the SN progenitor mass by studying the first published nebular spectrum taken 259 days after the explosion. Methods. We analyze the nebular spectrum taken with GMOS at the Gemini North Telescope. Typical emission lines are identified, such as [O I], H{\alpha}, [Ca II], among others. Some species' line profiles show broad and narrow components, indicating two ejecta velocities and an asymmetric ejecta. We infer the progenitor mass of SN 2023ixf by comparing with synthetic spectra and by measuring the forbidden oxygen doublet flux. Results. Based on the flux ratio and the direct comparison with spectra models, the progenitor star of SN 2023ixf had a M_{ZAMS} between 12 and 15 M{_\odot}. In comparison with this, we find the use of the [O I] doublet flux to be less constraining of the progenitor mass. Our results agree with those from hydrodynamical modelling of the early light curve and pre-explosion image estimates pointing to a relatively low-mass progenitor.</description>

      <title>Upper limit on axion-photon coupling from Markarian 421</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a stringent upper limit on axion-photon coupling from the 1038 days gamma-ray observations of the TeV blazar Markarian 421. The long-term VHE gamma-ray spectra are measured by the collaborations Fermi-LAT and HAWC from 2015 June to 2018 July. We show the best-fit SEDs of Markarian 421 under the null and axion hypotheses. Then we set the axion-photon limit in the $\{m_a, \, g_{a\gamma}\}$ plane. The 99% $\rm C.L.$ upper limit set by Markarian 421 is $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 4.0\times 10^{-12} \rm \, GeV^{-1}$ for the axion mass $[1.0\times10^{-9} \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 1.0\times10^{-8} \, {\rm eV}]$. It is the most stringent upper limit in this axion mass region.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov Telescope Arrays for High-Energy Neutrino Detection in Mountain Ranges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study investigates the feasibility of employing Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) technology for the detection of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino-tau particles. By observing the Cherenkov light produced by charged particles resulting from neutrino-tau interactions within mountainous regions, the research seeks to assess the viability of detecting neutrinos within the PeV to EeV energy range. The present paper details the methodology used to calculate the effective detection area and the interaction probabilities of neutrino-tau within the mountains, as well as the flux of Cherenkov photons generated by tau leptons. Furthermore, the present paper addresses the selection of optimal parameters for the telescopes, including mountain dimensions, telescope height, the distance between telescopes, and the distance from the telescopes to the mountain. Strategic placement of the telescopes and the identification of mountain ranges in Algeria that are most suitable for detecting these elusive particles are also discussed. The findings and recommendations for the optimal distribution of telescopes across the selected mountain range are presented, aiming to enhance the detection capabilities for high-energy neutrino-tau particles.</description>

      <title>Efficient Massive Black Hole Binary parameter estimation for LISA using Sequential Neural Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is a space mission that has recently entered the implementation phase. The main goal of LISA is to survey, for the first time, the observable universe by detecting low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). One of the main GW sources that LISA will detect is the coalescence and merger of Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs). In this work, we explore the application of Sequential Neural Likelihood, a simulation-based inference algorithm, to the detection and parameter estimation of MBHBs signals in the LISA data. Instead of sampling from the conventional likelihood function, which typically relies on the assumptions of Gaussianity and stationarity of the noise and requires a forward simulation for each evaluation, this method constructs a surrogate likelihood that is ultimately described by a neural network trained from a dataset of simulations (noise + MBHB). Since the likelihood is independent of the priors, we can iteratively train models that target specific observations in a fraction of the time and computational cost that other traditional and machine learning-based strategies would require. One key aspect of the method is the compression of the data. Because of the iterative nature of the method, we are able to train models to obtain qualitatively similar posteriors with less than 2% of the simulator calls that Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods would require. We compare these posteriors with those obtained from standard techniques and discuss the differences that appear, some of which can be identified as caused by the loss of information from the data compression we use. We also discuss future improvements to this method.</description>

      <title>Ohm's Law, the Reconnection Rate, and Energy Conversion in Collisionless Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous plasma process that transforms magnetic energy into particle energy during eruptive events throughout the universe. Reconnection not only converts energy during solar flares and geomagnetic substorms that drive space weather near Earth, but it may also play critical roles in the high energy emissions from the magnetospheres of neutron stars and black holes. In this review article, we focus on collisionless plasmas that are most relevant to reconnection in many space and astrophysical plasmas. Guided by first-principles kinetic simulations and spaceborne in-situ observations, we highlight the most recent progress in understanding this fundamental plasma process. We start by discussing the non-ideal electric field in the generalized Ohm's law that breaks the frozen-in flux condition in ideal magnetohydrodynamics and allows magnetic reconnection to occur. We point out that this same reconnection electric field also plays an important role in sustaining the current and pressure in the current sheet and then discuss the determination of its magnitude (i.e., the reconnection rate), based on force balance and energy conservation. This approach to determining the reconnection rate is applied to kinetic current sheets of a wide variety of magnetic geometries, parameters, and background conditions. We also briefly review the key diagnostics and modeling of energy conversion around the reconnection diffusion region, seeking insights from recently developed theories. Finally, future prospects and open questions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Lunar antineutrinos and heat: Fluxes from primordial radioactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present estimates for the fluxes of heat and antineutrinos due to primordial radioactivity within the moon. We use a radial density profile, specifying an inner core and a model-averaged crust. The $1^\circ$ by $1^\circ$ gridded crust data draw on global maps from spacecraft missions. Thickness, density, and elevation come from measurements of the gravitational field. Thorium, uranium, and potassium abundances come from measurements of the gamma ray intensity. Assuming no vertical variation of the crustal abundances predicts $302$ GW of radiogenic heating. Accepting a heat flux of $5$ mWm$^{-2}$ from the mantle plus low viscosity zone both with $Th/U\simeq3.7$ and $K/U\simeq2000$ tallies an additional $185$ GW of radiogenic heating. The corresponding antineutrino fluxes from the average crust and the mantle plus low viscosity zone are $2.02\times10^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $6.40\times10^5$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, respectively. Subsurface variations of thorium, uranium, and potassium abundances in the crust are a potentially large and not yet assessed source of uncertainty. The uncertainties reported with the radial density profile contribute $\pm1.4\times10^3$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $\pm0.6$ GW ($&lt;1$\%) to the estimates of antineutrino flux and radiogenic heating, respectively, from the mantle plus low viscosity zone.</description>

      <title>A high-velocity star recently ejected by an intermediate-mass black hole in M15</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is crucial for understanding various astrophysical phenomena, yet their existence remains elusive, except for the LIGO-Virgo detection. We report the discovery of a high-velocity star J0731+3717, whose backward trajectory about 21 Myr ago intersects that of globular cluster M15 within the cluster tidal radius. Both its metallicity [Fe/H] and its alpha-to-iron abundance ratio [$\alpha$/Fe] are consistent with those of M15. Furthermore, its location falls right on the fiducial sequence of the cluster M15 on the color-absolute magnitude diagram, suggesting similar ages. These support that J0731+3717 is originally associated with M15 at a confidence level of $5.4\sigma$. We find that such a high-velocity star ($V_{\rm ej} = 548^{+6}_{-5}$ km s$^{-1}$) was most likely tidally ejected from as close as one astronomical unit to the center of M15, confirming an IMBH ($\ge 100 M_{\odot}$ with a credibility of 98%) as the exclusive nature of the central unseen mass proposed previously.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Axion-Photon Coupling Using Stellar Modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismology has been shown to be, together with stellar modelling, an invaluable tool in constraining properties of novel physics. In this work, we study for the first time the influence of axionic production in the evolution of a late main-sequence star, comparing computational models with observational data in order to constrain the axion-photon $g_{a\gamma}$ coupling parameter. We first perform a high-precision calibration of a stellar model to our target star, in order to obtain a benchmark for our other diagnostics. We then apply a two-stage test, first using global quantities and then resorting to precision seismic ratios. We find that seismology allows us to place an independent upper bound of $g_{a\gamma} \leq 0.98\times 10^{-10} $ GeV$^{-1}$ at a $68\%$ confidence level (CL), in the same order of magnitude as both the most recent constraints from the observation of globular clusters and previous bounds obtained through stellar modelling, but more stringent than most current direct axion detections. We also suggest a more conservative limit of $g_{a\gamma} \leq 1.38\times 10^{-10} $ GeV$^{-1}$ at a $95\%$ CL. Moreover, this new diagnostic method can be applied to stellar data that will be obtained in future asteroseismic projects.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN~Ia DR2: Cosmology-independent constraints on Type Ia supernova standardisation from supernova siblings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) and the empirical standardisation relations that make them excellent distance indicators is vital to improving cosmological constraints. SN~Ia ``siblings", i.e. two or more SNe~Ia in the same host or parent galaxy offer a unique way to infer the standardisation relations and their diversity across the population. We analyse a sample of 25 SN~Ia pairs, observed homogeneously by the Zwicky Transient Factory (ZTF) to infer the SNe~Ia light curve width-luminosity and colour-luminosity parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Using the pairwise constraints from siblings, allowing for a diversity in the standardisation relations, we find $\alpha = 0.218 \pm 0.055 $ and $\beta = 3.084 \pm 0.312$, respectively, with a dispersion in $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of $\leq 0.195$ and $\leq 0.923$, respectively, at 95$\%$ C.L. While the median dispersion is large, the values within $\sim 1 \sigma$ are consistent with no dispersion. Hence, fitting for a single global standardisation relation, we find $\alpha = 0.228 \pm 0.029 $ and $\beta = 3.160 \pm 0.191$. We find a very small intrinsic scatter of the siblings sample $\sigma_{\rm int} \leq 0.10$ at 95\% C.L. compared to $\sigma_{\rm int} = 0.22 \pm 0.04$ when computing the scatter using the Hubble residuals without comparing them as siblings. Splitting the sample based on host galaxy stellar mass, we find that SNe~Ia in both subsamples have consistent $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The $\beta$ value is consistent with the value for the cosmological sample. However, we find a higher $\alpha$ by $\sim 2.5 - 3.5 \sigma$. The high $\alpha$ is driven by low $x_1$ pairs, potentially suggesting that the slow and fast declining SN~Ia have different slopes of the width-luminosity relation. We can confirm or refute this with increased statistics from near future time-domain surveys. (abridged)</description>

      <title>High-redshift quasars at $z \geq 3$: radio variability and MPS/GPS candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the radio variability of bright, $S_{1.4}\geq100$ mJy, high-redshift quasars at $z\geq3$ on timescales up to 30-40 years. The study involved simultaneous RATAN-600 measurements at frequencies of 2.3, 4.7, 8.2, 11.2, and 22.3 GHz in 2017-2020. In addition, data from the literature were used. We have found that the variability index, $V_S$, which quantifies the normalized difference between the maximum and minimum flux density while accounting for measurement uncertainties, ranges from 0.02 to 0.96 for the quasars. Approximately half of the objects in the sample exhibit a variability index within the range of 0.25 to 0.50, comparable to that observed in blazars at lower redshifts. The distribution of $V_S$ at 22.3 GHz is significantly different from that at 2.3-11.2 GHz, which may be attributed to the fact that a compact AGN core dominates at the source's rest frame frequencies greater than 45 GHz, leading to higher variability indices obtained at 22.3 GHz (the $V_S$ distribution peaks around 0.4) compared to the lower frequencies (the $V_S$ distribution at 2.3 and 4.7 GHz peaks around 0.1-0.2). Several source groups with distinctive variability characteristics were found using cluster analysis of quasars. We propose 7 new candidates for gigahertz peaked-spectrum (GPS) sources and 5 new megahertz peaked-spectrum (MPS) sources based on their spectrum shape and variability features. Only 6 out of 23 sources previously reported as GPS demonstrate a low variability level typical of classical GPS sources ($V_{S} &lt; 0.25$) at 4.7-22.3 GHz. When excluding the highly variable peaked-spectrum blazars, we expect no more than 20% of the sources in the sample to be GPS candidates and no more than 10% to be MPS candidates.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrinos from choked-jet supernovae: Searches and implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the high-energy astrophysical neutrinos discovered by IceCube remains largely unknown. Multimessenger studies have indicated that the majority of these neutrinos come from gamma-ray-dark sources. Choked-jet supernovae (cjSNe), which are supernovae powered by relativistic jets stalled in stellar materials, may lead to neutrino emission via photohadronic interactions while the coproduced gamma rays are absorbed. In this paper, we perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood analysis to search for correlations between IceCube's ten-year muon-track events and our SN Ib/c sample, collected from publicly available catalogs. In addition to the conventional power-law models, we also consider the impacts of more realistic neutrino emission models for the first time, and we study the effects of the jet beaming factor in the analyses. Our results show no significant correlation. Even so, the conservative upper limits we set to the contribution of cjSNe to the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux still allow SNe Ib/c to be the dominant source of astrophysical neutrinos observed by IceCube. We discuss implications to the cjSNe scenario from our results and the power of future neutrino and supernova observations.</description>

      <title>Did we hear the sound of the Universe boiling? Analysis using the full fluid velocity profiles and NANOGrav 15-year data</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyse sound waves arising from a cosmic phase transition where the full velocity profile is taken into account as an explanation for the gravitational wave spectrum observed by multiple pulsar timing array groups. Unlike the broken power law used in the literature, in this scenario the power law after the peak depends on the macroscopic properties of the phase transition, allowing for a better fit with pulsar timing array (PTA) data. We compare the best fit with that obtained using the usual broken power law and, unsurprisingly, find a better fit with the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum that utilizes the full velocity profile. We then discuss models that can produce the best-fit point and complementary probes using CMB experiments and searches for light particles in DUNE, IceCUBE-Gen2, neutrinoless double beta decay, and forward physics facilities at the LHC like FASER nu, etc.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Scattering of Dark Matter with Heavy Cosmic Rays</title>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of inelastic collisions between dark matter (DM) and heavy cosmic ray (CR) nuclei on CR propagation. We approximate the fragmentation cross-sections for DM-CR collisions using collider-measured proton-nuclei scattering cross-sections, allowing us to assess how these collisions affect the spectra of CR Boron and Carbon. We derive new CR spectra from DM-CR collisions by incorporating their cross-sections into the source terms and solving the diffusion equation for the complete network of reactions involved in generating secondary species. In a specific example with a coupling strength of $b_{\chi}=0.1$ and a DM mass of $m_{\chi}=0.1$ GeV, considering a simplified scenario where DM interacts exclusively with Oxygen, a notable modification in the Boron-to-Carbon spectrum due to the DM-CR interaction is observed. Particularly, the peak within the spectrum, spanning from $0.1$ GeV to $10$ GeV, experiences an enhancement of approximately 1.5 times. However, in a more realistic scenario where DM particles interact with all CRs, this peak can be amplified to twice its original value.Utilizing the latest data from AMS-02 and DAMPE on the Boron-to-Carbon ratio, we estimate a 95\% upper limit for the effective inelastic cross-section of DM-proton as a function of DM mass. Our findings reveal that at $m_\chi\simeq 2$ MeV, the effective inelastic cross-section between DM and protons must be less than $\mathcal{O}(10^{-32})~{\rm cm}^2$.</description>

      <title>Demographics of Tidal Disruption Events with L-Galaxies: I. Volumetric TDE rates and the abundance of Nuclear Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars can be ripped apart by tidal forces in the vicinity of a massive black hole (MBH), causing luminous flares known as tidal disruption events (TDEs). These events could be contributing to the mass growth of intermediate-mass MBHs, and new samples from transient surveys can provide useful information on this growth channel. This work aims to study the demographics of TDEs by modeling the co-evolution of MBHs and their galactic environments in a cosmological framework. We use the semi-analytic galaxy formation model \emph{L-Galaxies}BH, which follows the evolution of galaxies as well as of MBHs, including multiple scenarios for MBH seeds and growth, spin evolution, and binary MBH dynamics. Time-dependent TDE rates are associated with each MBH depending on the stellar environment, following the solutions to the 1-D Fokker Planck equation solved with \textsc{PhaseFlow}. Our model produces volumetric rates that are in agreement with the latest optical and previous X-ray samples. This agreement requires a high occupation fraction of nuclear star clusters with MBHs since these star reservoirs host the majority of TDEs at all mass regimes. We predict that TDE rates are an increasing function of MBH mass up to $\sim\, 10^{5.5}$M$_\odot$, beyond which the distribution flattens and eventually drops for $&gt;\,10^{7}$M$_\odot$. In general, volumetric rates are predicted to be redshift-independent at $z\,{&lt;}\,1$. We discuss how the spin distribution of MBHs around the event horizon suppression can be constrained via TDE rates and what is the average contribution of TDEs to the MBH growth. In our work, the majority of low-mass galaxies host nuclear star clusters that have their loss-cone depleted by $z\,=\,0$, explaining why TDEs are rare in these systems. This highlights that time-dependent TDE rates are essential for any model to be in good agreement with observations at all mass regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ab initio global general-relativistic Particle-in-cell (GR-PIC) simulations of compact millisecond neutron star magnetospheres in the axisymmetric aligned rotator configuration. We investigate the role of GR and plasma supply on the polar cap particle acceleration efficiency - the precursor of coherent radio emission - employing a new module for the PIC code OSIRIS, designed to model plasma dynamics around compact objects with fully self-consistent GR effects. We provide a detailed description of the main sub-algorithms of the novel PIC algorithm, including a charge-conserving current deposit scheme for curvilinear coordinates. We demonstrate efficient particle acceleration in the polar caps of compact neutron stars with denser magnetospheres, numerically validating the spacelike current extension provided by force-free models. We show that GR relaxes the minimum required poloidal magnetospheric current for the transition of the polar cap to the accelerator regime, thus justifying the observation of weak pulsars beyond the expected death line. We denote that spin-down luminosity intermittency and radio pulse nullings for older pulsars might arise from the interplay between the polar and outer gaps. Also, narrower radio beams are expected for weaker low-obliquity pulsars.</description>

      <title>Gamma-rays and Neutrinos from Giant Molecular Cloud Populations in the Galactic Plane</title>

Abstract: The recent IceCube detection of significant neutrino flux from the inner Galactic plane has provided us valuable insights on the spectrum of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. This flux can be produced either by a population of Galactic point sources or by diffused emission from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium or by a mixture of both. In this work, we compute diffused gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes produced by a population of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in our Galaxy, assuming different parametrizations of the Galactic diffused cosmic ray distribution. In particular, we take into account two main cases: (I) constant cosmic ray luminosity in our Galaxy, and (II) space-dependent cosmic ray luminosity, based on the supernovae distribution in our Galaxy. For Case-I, we found that the neutrino flux from GMCs is a factor of $\sim 10$ below compared to $\pi^0$ and KRA$_\gamma$ best-fitted models of IceCube observations at $10^5$ GeV. Instead, for Case-II the model can explain up to $\sim 90 \%$ of the neutrino flux at that energy. Moreover, for this last scenario IceCube detector could be able to detect neutrino events from the Galactic centre regions. We then calculated gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes from individual GMCs and noticed that several current and future Cherenkov telescopes and neutrino observatories have the right sensitivities to study these objects. In particular, very neutrino-bright region such as Aquila Rift is favourable for detection by the IceCube-Gen2 observatory.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Ultra-Compact X-ray Binary Candidate SLX 1735-269 with NICER and NuSTAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations of the ultra-compact X-ray binary (UCXB) candidate SLX 1735-269 while the source was in two different spectral states. Using various reflection modeling techniques, we find that xillverCO, a model used for fitting X-ray spectra of UCXBs with high carbon and oxygen abundances is an improvement over relxill or relxillns, which instead contains solar-like chemical abundances. This provides indirect evidence in support of the source being ultra-compact. We also use this reflection model to get a preliminary measurement of the inclination of the system, $i = 57^{+23}_{-7}$ degrees. This is consistent with our timing analysis, where a lack of eclipses indicates an inclination of $i&lt;80^{\circ}$. The timing analysis is otherwise inconclusive, and we can not confidently measure the orbital period of the system.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Primordial Black Hole Capture by Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sub-solar mass primordial black hole (PBH) passing through a neutron star, can lose enough energy through interactions with the dense stellar medium to become gravitationally bound to the star. Once captured, the PBH would sink to the core of the neutron star, and completely consume it from the inside. In this paper, we improve previous energy-loss calculations by considering a realistic solution for the neutron star interior, and refine the treatment of the interaction dynamics and collapse likelihood. We then consider the effect of a sub-solar PBH population on neutron stars near the Galactic center. We find that it is not possible to explain the lack of observed pulsars near the galactic center through dynamical capture of PBHs, as the velocity dispersion is too high. We then show that future observations of old neutron stars close to Sgr A* could set stringent constraints on the PBHs abundance. These cannot however be extended in the currently unconstrained asteroid-mass range, since PBHs of smaller mass would lose less energy in their interaction with the neutron star and end up in orbits that are too loosely bound and likely to be disrupted by other stars in the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Physical Properties of Type II Supernovae Inferred from ZTF and ATLAS Photometric Data</title>

Abstract: We report an analysis of a sample of 186 spectroscopically confirmed Type II supernova (SN) light curves (LCs) obtained from a combination of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) observations. We implement a method to infer physical parameters from these LCs using hydrodynamic models that take into account the progenitor mass, the explosion energy, and the presence of circumstellar matter (CSM). The CSM is modelled via the mass loss rate, wind acceleration at the surface of the progenitor star with a $\beta$ velocity law, and the CSM radius. We also infer the time of explosion, attenuation (A$_V$), and the redshift for each SN. Our results favor low-mass progenitor stars (M$_{ZAMS}$\,$&lt;$14\,$M_\odot$) with a dense CSM ($\dot{M}$ $&gt;$ 10$^{-3}$ [M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$], a CSM radius of $\sim$ 10$^{15}$ cm, and $\beta$ $&gt;$ 2). Additionally, we find that the redshift inferred from the supernova LCs is significantly more accurate than that inferred using the host galaxy photometric redshift, suggesting that this method could be used to infer more accurate host galaxy redshifts from large samples of SNe II in the LSST era. Lastly, we compare our results with similar works from the literature.</description>

      <title>Big Bang initial conditions and self-interacting hidden dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08454v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of supergravity and string models involve hidden sectors where the hidden sectors may couple feebly with the visible sectors via a variety of portals. While the coupling of the hidden sector to the visible sector is feeble its coupling to the inflaton is largely unknown. It could couple feebly or with the same strength as the visible sector which would result in either a cold or a hot hidden sector at the end of reheating. These two possibilities could lead to significantly different outcomes for observables. We investigate the thermal evolution of the two sectors in a cosmologically consistent hidden sector dark matter model where the hidden sector and the visible sector are thermally coupled. Within this framework we analyze several phenomena to illustrate their dependence on the initial conditions. These include the allowed parameter space of models, dark matter relic density, proton-dark matter cross section, effective massless neutrino species at BBN time, self-interacting dark matter cross-section, where self-interaction occurs via exchange of dark photon, and Sommerfeld enhancement. Finally fits to the velocity dependence of dark matter cross sections from galaxy scales to the scale of galaxy clusters is given. The analysis indicates significant effects of the initial conditions on the observables listed above. The analysis is carried out within the framework where dark matter is constituted of dark fermions and the mediation between the visible and the hidden sector occurs via the exchange of dark photons. The techniques discussed here may have applications for a wider class of hidden sector models using different mediations between the visible and the hidden sectors to explore the impact of Big Bang initial conditions on observable physics.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting dark matter solves the final parsec problem of supermassive black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, plausibly originating from the merger of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), is accumulating with observations from pulsar timing arrays. An outstanding question is how inspiraling SMBHs get past the "final parsec" of separation, where they have a tendency to stall before GW emission alone can make the binary coalesce. We argue that dynamical friction from the dark matter (DM) spike surrounding the black holes is sufficient to resolve this puzzle, if the DM has a self-interaction cross section of order $\,$cm$^2$/g. The same effect leads to a softening of the GW spectrum at low frequencies as suggested by the current data. For collisionless cold DM, the friction deposits so much energy that the spike is disrupted and cannot bridge the final parsec, while for self-interacting DM, the isothermal core of the halo can act as a reservoir for the energy liberated from the SMBH orbits. A realistic velocity dependence, such as generated by the exchange of a massive mediator like a dark photon, is favored to give a good fit to the GW spectrum while providing a large enough core. A similar velocity dependence has been advocated for solving the small-scale structure problems of cold DM.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey: SRG/eROSITA cross-calibration with Chandra and XMM-Newton using galaxy cluster gas temperatures</title>

Abstract: Galaxy cluster gas temperatures ($T$) play a crucial role in many cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, it has been shown that $T$ measurements can vary between different X-ray telescopes. These $T$ biases can propagate to several cluster applications for which $T$ can be used. Thus, it is important to accurately cross-calibrate X-ray instruments to account for systematic biases. In this work, we present the cross-calibration between SRG/eROSITA and Chandra/ACIS, and between SRG/eROSITA and XMM-Newton/EPIC, using for the first time a large sample of galaxy cluster $T$. To do so, we use the first eROSITA All-Sky Survey data and a large X-ray flux-limited cluster catalog. We measure X-ray $T$ for 186 independent cluster regions with both SRG/eROSITA and Chandra/ACIS in a self-consistent way, for three energy bands; 0.7-7 keV (full), 0.5-4 keV (soft), and 1.5-7 keV (hard). We do the same with SRG/eROSITA and XMM-Newton/EPIC for 71 different cluster regions and all three bands. We find that SRG/eROSITA measures systematically lower $T$ than the other two instruments. For the full band, SRG/eROSITA returns 20$\%$ and 14$\%$ lower $T$ than Chandra/ACIS and XMM-Newton/EPIC respectively, when the two latter instruments measure $k_{\text{B}}T\approx 3$ keV each. The discrepancy increases to 38\% and 32\% when Chandra/ACIS and XMM-Newton/EPIC measure $k_{\text{B}}T\approx 10$ keV respectively. For low-$T$ galaxy groups, the discrepancy becomes milder. The soft band shows a marginally lower discrepancy than the full band. In the hard band, the cross-calibration of SRG/eROSITA and the other instruments show stronger differences. We could not identify any possible systematic biases that significantly alleviated the tension. Finally, we provide conversion factors between SRG/eROSITA, Chandra/ACIS, and XMM-Newton/EPIC $T$ which will be beneficial for future cluster studies.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the role of cosmic-ray driven Alfv\'en waves in pre-existing magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. I. Turbulent damping rates and feedback on background fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alfv\'en waves (AWs) excited by the cosmic-ray (CR) streaming instability (CRSI) are a fundamental ingredient for CR confinement. The effectiveness of self-confinement relies on a balance between CRSI growth rate and damping mechanisms acting on quasi-parallel AWs excited by CRs. One relevant mechanism is the so-called turbulent damping, in which an AW packet injected in pre-existing turbulence undergoes a cascade process due to its nonlinear interaction with fluctuations of the background. The turbulent damping of an AW packet in pre-existing magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is re-examined, revised, and extended to include most-recent theories of MHD turbulence that account for dynamic alignment and reconnection-mediated regime. The case in which the role of feedback of CR-driven AWs on pre-existing turbulence is important will also be discussed. Particular attention is given to the nonlinearity parameter $\chi^w$ that estimates the strength of nonlinear interaction between CR-driven AWs and background fluctuations. We point out the difference between $\chi^w$ and $\chi^z$ that instead describes the strength of nonlinear interactions between pre-existing fluctuations. When $\chi^w$ is properly taken into account, one finds that (i) the turbulent damping rate of quasi-parallel AWs in anisotropic turbulence depends on the background-fluctuations' amplitude to the third power, hence is strongly suppressed, and (ii) the dependence on the AW's wavelength (and thus on the CR gyro-radius from which it is excited) is different from what has been previously obtained. Finally, (iii) when dynamic alignment of cascading fluctuations and the possibility of a reconnection-mediated range is included in the picture, the turbulent damping rate exhibits novel regimes and breaks. Finally, a criterion for CR-feedback is derived and simple phenomenological models of CR-modified turbulent scaling are provided.</description>

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based observatory to measure gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band. This frequency band is expected to be dominated by signals from millions of Galactic binaries and tens of merging massive black hole binaries. The LISA Data Challenge 2a is focused on robust signal extraction from a blend of these two types of gravitational wave signals. Here, we introduce a novel high performance and cost-effective global fit pipeline extracting and characterizing galactic binary and massive black hole binary signals and estimate the noise of the residual. We perform the pipeline in a time-evolving weekly analysis starting with an observation time of 1 week until we reach a full year. As expected we detect more galactic binaries and massive black hole binaries bringing the noise estimate of the residual closer to the instrument noise with each week of additional observation time. Furthermore, we present a novel maximum likelihood estimate-based algorithm for extracting multiple massive black hole binaries. Additionally, we demonstrate a massive black hole binary signal extraction with a more accurate LISA response, considering higher harmonic modes, in a noisy data set.</description>

Abstract: Radio surveys of early-type stars have revealed a number of non-thermal emitters. Most of these have been shown to be binaries, where the collision between the two stellar winds is responsible for the non-thermal emission. HD 168112 is a non-thermal radio emitter, whose binary nature has only recently been confirmed spectroscopically. We obtained independent spectroscopic observations to determine its orbit, in addition to radio observations to see if the thermal or non-thermal nature of the emission changes during the periastron passage. We monitored HD 168112 spectroscopically for a 13 year time span. From these data, we determined the orbital parameters, which we compared to the previous results in the literature. From the spectral index of the radio observations, we found how the nature of the emission changes as the system goes through periastron. Combining our results with other literature data allowed us to further constrain the orbital and stellar parameters. We find HD 168112 to have an orbital period of P = 512.17+0.41-0.11 d, an eccentricity of e = 0.7533+0.0053-0.0124, and a mass ratio close to one. From our spectroscopic modelling, we derived the stellar parameters, but we had difficulty arriving at a spectroscopic mass ratio of one. The radio observations around periastron show only thermal emission, suggesting that most of the synchrotron photons are absorbed in the two stellar winds at that phase. Combining our data with the optical interferometry detection, we could constrain the inclination angle to i ~ 63 deg, and the mass of each component to ~ 26 Msun. We have provided an independent spectroscopic confirmation of the binary nature of HD 168112. Although detected as a non-thermal radio emitter, near periastron the radio emission of this highly eccentric system is thermal and is mainly formed in the colliding-wind region.
