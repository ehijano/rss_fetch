      <title>Demonstration of the light collection stability of a PEN-based wavelength shifting reflector in a tonne scale liquid argon detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid argon detectors rely on wavelength shifters for efficient detection of scintillation light. The current standard is tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB), but it is challenging to instrument on a large scale. Poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalate) (PEN), a polyester easily manufactured as thin sheets, could simplify the coverage of large surfaces with wavelength shifters. Previous measurements have shown that commercial grades of PEN have approximately 50% light conversion efficiency relative to TPB. Encouraged by these results, we conducted a large-scale measurement using $4~m^2$ combined PEN and specular reflector foils in a two-tonne liquid argon dewar to assess its stability over approximately two weeks. This test is crucial for validating PEN as a viable substitute for TPB. The setup used for the measurement of the stability of PEN as a wavelength shifter is described, together with the first results, showing no evidence of performance deterioration over a period of 12 days.</description>

      <title>Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective Magnetic Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.</description>

      <title>OASIS-UROS: Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors -- Upgraded, Refined, and Overhauled Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.</description>

      <title>Development of a bunching ionizer for TOF mass spectrometers with reduced resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In some types of mass spectrometers, such as Time of Flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MSs), it is necessary to control pulsed beams of ions. This can be easily accomplished by applying a pulsed voltage to the pusher electrode while the ionizer is continuously flowing ions. This method is preferred for its simplicity, although the ion utilization efficiency is not optimized. Here we employed another pulse-control method with a higher ion utilization rate, which is to bunch ions and kick them out instead of letting them stream. The benefit of this method is that higher sensitivity can be achieved; since the start of new ions cannot be allowed during TOF separation, it is highly advantageous to bunch ions that would otherwise be unusable. In this study, we used analytical and numerical methods to design a new bunching ionizer with reduced resources, adopting the principle of electrostatic ion beam trap. The test model experimentally demonstrated the bunching performance with respect to sample gas density and ion bunching time using gas samples and electron impact ionization. We also conducted an experiment in connection with a miniature TOF-MS, and showed that the sensitivity was improved by more than one order of magnitude using the newly developed ionizer. Since the device is capable of bunching ions with lower voltage and lower power consumption (~100 V, ~0.8 W) compared with conventional RF ion trap bunchers (several kilovolts, ~10 W), it will be possible to find applications in portable mass spectrometer with reduced resources.</description>

      <title>Genetic algorithm as a tool for detection setup optimisation: SiFi-CC case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Proton therapy is a precision-focused cancer treatment where accurate proton beam range monitoring is critical to ensure effective dose delivery. This can be achieved by prompt gamma detection with a Compton camera like the SiFi-CC. This study aims to show the feasibility of optimising the geometry of SiFi-CC Compton camera for verification of dose distribution via prompt gamma detection using a genetic algorithm (GA). Approach: The SiFi-CC key geometric parameters for optimisation with the GA are the source-to-scatterer and scatterer-to-absorber distances, and the module thicknesses. The optimisation process was conducted with a software framework based on the Geant4 toolkit, which included detailed and realistic modelling of gamma interactions, detector response, and further steps such as event selection and image reconstruction. The performance of each individual configuration was evaluated using a fitness function incorporating factors related to gamma detection efficiency and image resolution. Results: The GA-optimised SiFi-CC configuration demonstrated the capability to detect a 5 mm proton beam range shift with a 2 mm resolution using 5e8 protons. The best-performing geometry, with 16 fibre layers in the scatterer, 36 layers in the absorber, source-to-scatterer distance 150 mm and scatterer-to-absorber distance 120 mm, has an imaging sensitivity of 5.58(1)e-5. Significance: This study demonstrates that the SiFi-CC setup, optimised through a GA, can reliably detect clinically relevant proton beam range shifts, improving real-time range verification accuracy in proton therapy. The presented implementation of a GA is a systematic and feasible way of searching for a SiFi-CC geometry that shows the best performance.</description>

      <title>First characterisation of the MAGO cavity, a superconducting RF detector for kHz-MHz gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterodyne detection using microwave cavities is a promising method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves or ultralight axion dark matter. In this work, we report on studies conducted on a spherical 2-cell cavity developed by the MAGO collaboration for high-frequency gravitational waves detection. Although fabricated around 20 years ago, the cavity had not been used since. Due to deviations from the nominal geometry, we conducted a mechanical survey and performed room-temperature plastic tuning. Measurements and simulations of the mechanical resonances and electromagnetic properties were carried out, as these are critical for estimating the cavity's gravitational wave coupling potential. Based on these results, we plan further studies in a cryogenic environment. The cavity characterisation does not only provide valuable experience for a planned physics run but also informs the future development of improved cavity designs.</description>

      <title>Near-field acoustic imaging with a caged bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bubbles are ubiquitous in many research applications ranging from ultrasound imaging and drug delivery to the understanding of volcanic eruptions and water circulation in vascular plants. From an acoustic perspective, bubbles are resonant scatterers with remarkable properties, including a large scattering cross-section and strongly sub-wavelength dimensions. While it is known that the resonance properties of bubbles depend on their local environment, it remains challenging to probe this interaction at the single-bubble level due to the difficulty of manipulating a single resonating bubble in a liquid. Here, we confine a cubic bubble inside a cage using 3D printing technology, and we use this bubble as a local probe to perform scanning near-field acoustic microscopy -- an acoustic analogue of scanning near-field optical microscopy. By probing the acoustic interaction between a single resonating bubble and its local environment, we demonstrate near-field imaging of complex structures with a resolution that is two orders of magnitudes smaller than the wavelength of the acoustic field. As a potential application, our approach paves the way for the development of low-cost acoustic microscopes based on caged bubbles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Observatory (JUNO) is a 20-kton liquid scintillator detector that employs 20,000 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as photon sensors, with 5,000 dynode-PMTs from HAMAMATSU Photonics K.K. (HPK), and 15,000 MCP-PMTs from North Night Vision Technology (NNVT) installed in pure water. JUNO aims to provide long-lasting and the best performance operation by utilizing a high-transparency liquid scintillator, high detection efficiency PMTs, and specially designed electronics including water-proof potting for the high voltage (HV) dividers of PMTs. In this paper, we present a summary of the design and optimization of HV dividers for both types of 20-inch PMTs, which includes collection efficiency, charge resolution, HV divider current, pulse shape, and maximum amplitude restriction. We have developed and finalized four schemes of the HV divider for different scenarios, including the final version selected by JUNO. All 20,000 20-inch PMTs have successfully undergone production and burning tests.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning based photon counting for PMT waveforms and its application to the improvement of the energy resolution in large liquid scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are widely used in particle experiments for photon detection. PMT waveform analysis is crucial for high-precision measurements of the position and energy of incident particles in liquid scintillator (LS) detectors. A key factor contributing to the energy resolution in large liquid scintillator detectors with PMTs is the charge smearing of PMTs. This paper presents a machine-learning-based photon counting method for PMT waveforms and its application to the energy reconstruction, using the JUNO experiment as an example.The results indicate that leveraging the photon counting information from the machine learning model can partially mitigate the impact of PMT charge smearing and lead to a relative 2.0% to 2.8% improvement on the energy resolution in the energy range of [1, 9] MeV.</description>

      <title>Mapping of the Transient Electric Field Created by the Charge Spreading on the Resistive Strip of Micromegas used in the ATLAS New Small Wheels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resistive strips Micromegas are employed in the ATLAS New Small Wheel project. They have been already installed and operate in the experimental cavern of the ATLAS experiment at CERN. This work attempts to describe the mechanism of the surface electric charge spread on a resistive strip of the Micromegas detector and the created transient electric field. Moreover, an approach utilising the Telegraph partial differential equation, used in transmission lines, is discussed assuming a 2-layer geometry approximation. Finally, the transient electric field formation leading to the strong suppression of the sparks in the amplification region is calculated by using the accurate 3-layer geometry for the particular parameters of the Micromegas configuration. The spatial mapping of this field versus time is presented for the time slice of interest.</description>

      <title>uRWELL detector developments at Jefferson Lab for high luminosity experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the future plans at Jefferson Lab is running electron scattering experiments with large acceptance detectors at luminosities $&gt; 10^{37}cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. These experiments allow the measurements of the Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DDVCS) reaction, an important physics process in the formalism of Generalized Parton Distributions, which has never been measured because of its small cross-section. The luminosity upgrade of CLAS12 or the SOLID detector makes Jefferson Lab a unique place to measure DDVCS. One of the important components of these high luminosity detectors is a tracking system that can withstand high rates of $\approx 1MHz/cm^{2}$. The recently developed Micro-Resistive Well (uRWELL) detector technology is a promising option for such a tracking detector by combining good position resolutions, low material budget with simple mechanical construction, and low production costs. In this proceeding, we will discuss recent developments and studies with uRWELL detectors at Jefferson Lab for future upgrades of the CLAS12 detector to study the DDVCS reaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provides high-resolution visualization of atomic structures as well as various functional imaging modes utilizing phase contrast. In this study we introduce a semicircular aperture in STEM bright field imaging, which gives a phase contrast transfer function that becomes complex and includes both lower and higher spatial frequency contrast transfer. This approach offers significant advantages over conventional phase plate methods, having no charge accumulation, degradation, or unwanted background noise, which are all problematic in the phase plate material. Also compared to the differential phase contrast or ptychography equipment, this semicircular aperture is far less costly. We apply this approach to visualization of polymer, biological and magnetic samples.</description>
