      <title>Parity patterns meet Genocchi numbers, I: four labelings and three bijections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hetyei introduced in 2019 the homogenized Linial arrangement and showed that its regions are counted by the median Genocchi numbers. In the course of devising a different proof of Hetyei's result, Lazar and Wachs considered another hyperplane arrangement that is associated with certain bipartite graph called Ferrers graph. We bijectively label the regions of this latter arrangement with permutations whose ascents are subject to a parity restriction. This labeling not only establishes the equivalence between two enumerative results due to Hetyei and Lazar-Wachs, repectively, but also motivates us to derive and investigate a Seidel-like triangle that interweaves Genocchi numbers of both kinds.
  Applying similar ideas, we introduce three more variants of permutations with analogous parity restrictions. We provide labelings for regions of the aforementioned arrangement using these three sets of restricted permutations as well. Furthermore, bijections from our first permutation model to two previously known permutation models are established.</description>

      <title>Some progress on $t$-tone coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $t$-tone coloring of a graph $G$ assigns to each vertex a set of $t$ colors such that any pair of vertices $u, v$ with distance $d$ can share at most $d-1$ colors. In this note, we prove several new results on $t$-tone coloring. For example we prove a new result for trees of large maximum degree, as well as some results for the cartesian power of a graph. We also make a conjecture about trees.</description>

      <title>VC-Dimension vs Degree: An Uncertainty Principle for Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we uncover a new uncertainty principle that governs the complexity of Boolean functions. This principle manifests as a fundamental trade-off between two central measures of complexity: a combinatorial complexity of its supported set, captured by its Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension ($\mathrm{VC}(f)$), and its algebraic structure, captured by its polynomial degree over various fields. We establish two primary inequalities that formalize this trade-off:$\mathrm{VC}(f)+\deg(f)\ge n,$ and $\mathrm{VC}(f)+\deg_{\mathbb{F}_2}(f)\ge n$. In particular, these results recover the classical uncertainty principle on the discrete hypercube, as well as the Sziklai--Weiner's bound in the case of $\mathbb{F}_2$.</description>

      <title>The frequency $K_i$s for symmetrical traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The frequency $K_i$s ($i\in[4,n]$) are studied for symmetrical traveling salesman problem ($TSP$) to identify the edges in optimal Hamiltonian cycle ($OHC$). A frequency $K_i$ is computed with a sort of ${{i}\choose{2}}$ optimal $i$-vertex paths with given endpoints (optimal $i$-vertex path) in a corresponding $K_i$ in $K_n$. In frequency $K_i$, the frequency of an edge is the number of the optimal $i$-vertex paths containing the edge in the corresponding $K_i$. Given an $OHC$ edge related to $K_i$, it has a frequency bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the corresponding frequency $K_i$, and that of an ordinary edge not in $OHC$ is smaller than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$. On average, an $OHC$ edge in $K_i$ has the expected frequency bigger than $\frac{i^2-4i+7}{2}$ whereas an ordinary edge has the expected frequency smaller than 2. Moreover, given a frequency $K_i$ containing an $OHC$ edge related to $K_n$, the frequency of the $OHC$ edge is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the worst average case. It implies that the average frequency of an $OHC$ edge computed with frequency $K_i$s is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$. It also found that the probability that an $OHC$ edge is contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths keeps stable or increases according to $i\in [4, n]$. As the frequency $K_i$s are used to compute the frequency of an edge, each $OHC$ edge has its own peak frequency at $i=P_0$ where $P_0=\frac{n}{2} + 2$ for even $n$ or $\frac{n+1}{2} + 1$ for odd $n$. For ordinary edges out of $OHC$, the probability that they are contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths decreases according to $i$. Moreover, the average frequency of an ordinary edge will be smaller than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ if $i \geq [0.3660n + 5.5849]$. Based on these findings, an algorithm is presented to find $OHC$ in $O(n^62^{0.3660n})$ time using dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>Bounded indegree $k$-forests problem and a faster algorithm for directed graph augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two problems for a directed graph $G$, which we show to be closely related. The first one is to find $k$ edge-disjoint forests in $G$ of maximal size such that the indegree of each vertex in these forests is at most $k$. We describe a min-max characterization for this problem and show that it can be solved in $O(k \delta m \log n)$ time, where $(n,m)$ is the size of $G$ and $\delta$ is the difference between $k$ and the edge connectivity of the graph. The second problem is the directed edge-connectivity augmentation problem, which has been extensively studied before: find a smallest set of directed edges whose addition to the graph makes it strongly $k$-connected. We improve the complexity for this problem from $O(k \delta (m+\delta n)\log n)$ [Gabow, STOC 1994] to $O(k \delta m \log n)$, by exploiting our solution for the first problem. A similar approach with the same complexity also works for the undirected version of the problem.</description>

      <title>Structure of $k$-Matching-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $k \geqslant 0$, we define a simple topological graph $G$ (that is, a graph drawn in the plane such that every pair of edges intersect at most once, including endpoints) to be $k$-matching-planar if for every edge $e \in E(G)$, every matching amongst the edges of $G$ that cross $e$ has size at most $k$. The class of $k$-matching-planar graphs is a significant generalisation of many other existing beyond planar graph classes, including $k$-planar graphs. We prove that every simple topological $k$-matching-planar graph is isomorphic to a subgraph of the strong product of a graph with bounded treewidth and a path. This result qualitatively extends the planar graph product structure theorem of Dujmovi\'c, Joret, Micek, Morin, Ueckerdt, and Wood [J. ACM 2020] and recent product structure theorems for other beyond planar graph classes. Using this result, we deduce that the class of simple topological $k$-matching-planar graphs has several attractive properties, making it the broadest class of simple beyond planar graphs in the literature that has these properties. All of our results about simple topological $k$-matching-planar graphs generalise to the non-simple setting, where the maximum number of pairwise crossing edges incident to a common vertex becomes relevant.
  The paper introduces several tools and results of independent interest. We show that every simple topological $k$-matching-planar graph admits an edge-colouring with $\mathcal{O}(k^{3}\log k)$ colours such that monochromatic edges do not cross. As a key ingredient of the proof of our main product structure theorem, we introduce the concept of weak shallow minors, which subsume and generalise shallow minors, a key concept in graph sparsity theory. We also establish upper bounds on the treewidth of graphs with well-behaved circular drawings that qualitatively generalise several existing results.</description>

      <title>Higher-arity PAC learning, VC dimension and packing lemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to overview some of our work in Chernikov, Towsner'20 (arXiv:2010.00726) developing higher arity VC theory (VC$_n$ dimension), including a generalization of Haussler packing lemma, and an associated tame (slice-wise) hypergraph regularity lemma; and to demonstrate that it characterizes higher arity PAC learning (PAC$_n$ learning) in $n$-fold product spaces with respect to product measures introduced by Kobayashi, Kuriyama and Takeuchi'15. We also point out how some of the recent results in arXiv:2402.14294, arXiv:2505.15688, arXiv:2509.20404 follow from our work in arXiv:2010.00726.</description>

      <title>Explicit Min-wise Hash Families with Optimal Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study explicit constructions of min-wise hash families and their extension to $k$-min-wise hash families. Informally, a min-wise hash family guarantees that for any fixed subset $X\subseteq[N]$, every element in $X$ has an equal chance to have the smallest value among all elements in $X$; a $k$-min-wise hash family guarantees this for every subset of size $k$ in $X$. Min-wise hash is widely used in many areas of computer science such as sketching, web page detection, and $\ell_0$ sampling.
  The classical works by Indyk and P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu and Thorup have shown $\Theta(\log(1/\delta))$-wise independent families give min-wise hash of multiplicative (relative) error $\delta$, resulting in a construction with $\Theta(\log(1/\delta)\log N)$ random bits. Based on a reduction from pseudorandom generators for combinatorial rectangles by Saks, Srinivasan, Zhou and Zuckerman, Gopalan and Yehudayoff improved the number of bits to $O(\log N\log\log N)$ for polynomially small errors $\delta$. However, no construction with $O(\log N)$ bits (polynomial size family) and sub-constant error was known before.
  In this work, we continue and extend the study of constructing ($k$-)min-wise hash families from pseudorandomness for combinatorial rectangles and read-once branching programs. Our main result gives the first explicit min-wise hash families that use an optimal (up to constant) number of random bits and achieve a sub-constant (in fact, almost polynomially small) error, specifically, an explicit family of $k$-min-wise hash with $O(k\log N)$ bits and $2^{-O(\log N/\log\log N)}$ error. This improves all previous results for any $k=\log^{O(1)}N$ under $O(k \log N)$ bits. Our main techniques involve several new ideas to adapt the classical Nisan-Zuckerman pseudorandom generator to fool min-wise hashing with a multiplicative error.</description>
