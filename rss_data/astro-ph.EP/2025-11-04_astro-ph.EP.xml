      <title>The Coupled Tidal Evolution of the Moons and Spins of Warm Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The Solar System giant planets harbour a wide variety of moons. Moons around exoplanets are plausibly similarly abundant, even though most of them are likely too small to be easily detectable with modern instruments. Moons are known to affect the long-term dynamics of the spin of their host planets; however, their influence on warm exoplanets (i.e.\ with moderately short periods of about $10$ to $200$~days), which undergo significant star-planet tidal dissipation, is still unclear. Aims: Here, we study the coupled dynamical evolution of exomoons and the spin dynamics of their host planets, focusing on warm exoplanets. Methods: Analytical criteria give the relevant dynamical regimes at play as a function of the system's parameters. Possible evolution tracks mostly depend on the hierarchy of timescales between the star-planet and the moon-planet tidal dissipations. We illustrate the variety of possible trajectories using self-consistent numerical simulations. Results: We find two principal results: i) Due to star-planet tidal dissipation, a substantial fraction of warm exoplanets naturally evolve through a phase of instability for the moon's orbit (the `Laplace plane' instability). Many warm exoplanets may have lost their moon(s) through this process. ii) Surviving moons slowly migrate inwards due to the moon-planet tidal dissipation until they are disrupted below the Roche limit. During their last migration stage, moons -- even small ones -- eject planets from their tidal spin equilibrium. Conclusions: The loss of moons through the Laplace plane instability may contribute to disfavour the detection of moons around close-in exoplanets. Moreover, moons (even those that have been lost) play a critical role in the final obliquities of warm exoplanets. Hence, the existence of exomoons poses a serious challenge in predicting the present-day obliquities of observed exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Watching a Comet Turn On: High Spectral Resolving Power Observations of Comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report high spectral resolving power optical observations of comet C/2017\,K2 (PanSTARRS) as it approached the Sun. This comet was discovered when it was 16\,{\sc au} from the Sun. At discovery, the comet had a large and relatively bright coma. However, the spectrum at discovery showed only signatures of dust. We used the coud{\'e} spectrograph on the McDonald Observatory 2.7\,m telescope to obtain spectra, starting when the comet was at a heliocentric distance of 5.06\,{\sc au} and following it until 2.47\,{\sc au}, to determine what spectral features would appear at each heliocentric distance. The first heliocentric distance for which we detected any emission from the gas was 3.39\,{\sc au}, when we first detected CN. As the comet continued inward towards the Sun, various other species were detected. We discuss the implications of the early turn-on of CN and of species first appearing at different heliocentric distances in the context of control of the activity by water.</description>

      <title>Sharp dynamic points in Earth-Sun physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subsolar point, the closest location on Earth's surface to the Sun, marks the Sun-Earth line of gravity that governs Earth's coupled orbital-rotational cycle. We examined the dynamic interactions among the Sun meridian declination (SMD), the Equation of Time (EoT), Earth's rotational speed (ER$_\omega$) -- equatorial and with respect to the Sun -- and the path of the subsolar point (NBI) across longitude, including time derivatives up to the fourth order (snap). A central finding was that the function NBI$_\alpha$(SMD) traces a lemniscate whose temporal structure mirrors the analemma, EoT(SMD), and whose symmetry converges to the obliquity component of the EoT. The EoT velocity ($\omega^*$) peaks at solstices, troughs near the equinoxes, and crosses zero every mid-season. ER$_\omega$ decreases monotonically along trans-equinoctial phases where the net drives of EoT and SMD coincide, and increases along trans-solstitial phases, where their net drives oppose. Eight sharp kinematic periods were identified for the cycle SMD-EoT-ER$_\omega$: two equinoctial, two solstitial, and one within each season. The non-solstitial sharp terms, defined by ZCPs and troughs of $\omega^*$, display a consistent 3$^\circ$ northward offset from the function NBI$_\alpha$(SMD). These results reveal a direct dynamical link between SMD, EoT, and Earth's rotational speed, providing a novel framework for understanding Earth's rotation.</description>

      <title>On the Gravitational Collapse of Small Dust Grains in Self-gravitating Disk Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation may begin much earlier than previously expected, when the protoplanetary disk is still massive and gravitationally unstable. It has been proposed that solid grains can concentrate in the spiral arms of self-gravitating disks, leading to the formation of planetary embryos or cores that can greatly accelerate the process of planet formation. We perform hydrodynamic simulations of self-gravitating gas and even smaller dust grains than previously investigated in 3-dimensional shearing box simulations to explore the conditions necessary to form these planetary seeds. Focusing on small grains of dimensionless stopping time $\mathrm{St}=0.01$ and shorter, we find that disk metallicities $Z \gtrsim 0.02$ can overcome the disruptive effects of dust diffusion among these small dust grains. In the outer reaches of a gravitationally unstable disk, these models correspond to grains of approximately 1$\,mm$ and lead to planetary embryos between 0.1 and 1 Earth mass. The formation of these planetary embryos could therefore reduce the time needed for planet assembly, particularly in the outer regions of the disk where coagulation timescales are longer and solid growth is limited.</description>

      <title>Photoevaporation Can Reproduce Extended $\mathrm{H_2}$ Emission from Protoplanetary Disks Imaged by JWST MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding dispersal of protoplanetary disks remains a central challenge in planet formation theory. Disk winds, driven by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and/or photoevaporation, are now recognized as primary agents of dispersal. With the advent of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), spatially resolved imaging of these winds, particularly in H2 pure rotational lines, has become possible, revealing X-shaped morphologies and integrated fluxes of $\sim 10^{-16}$-$10^{-15}{\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. However, the lack of theoretical models suitable for direct comparison has limited interpretation of these features. To address this, we present the first model of photoevaporative \ce{H2} winds tailored for direct comparison with JWST observations. Using radiation hydrodynamics simulations coupled with chemistry, we derive steady-state wind structures and post-process them to compute H2 level populations and line radiative transfer, including collisional excitation and spontaneous decay. Our synthetic images reproduce the observed X-shaped morphology with radial extents of $\gtrsim 50$-$300{\rm \,au}$ and semi-opening angles of $\sim 37^\circ$-$50^\circ$, matching observations of Tau 042021 and SY Cha. While the predicted line fluxes are somewhat lower than the observed values. These results suggest that photoevaporation is a viable mechanism for reproducing key features of observed H2 winds, including morphology and fluxes, though conclusive identification of the wind origin requires source-specific modeling. This challenges the reliance on geometrical structures alone to distinguish between MHD winds and photoevaporation. Based on our findings, we also discuss alternative diagnostics of photoevaporative winds. This work provides a critical first step toward interpreting spatially resolved H2 winds and motivates future modeling efforts.</description>

      <title>Molecular diversity as a biosignature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for life in the Solar System hinges on data from planetary missions. Biosignatures based on molecular identity, isotopic composition, or chiral excess require measurements that current and planned missions cannot provide.
  We introduce a new class of biosignatures, defined by the statistical organization of molecular assemblages and quantified using ecodiversity metrics. Using this framework, we analyze amino acid diversity across a dataset spanning terrestrial and extraterrestrial contexts.
  We find that biotic samples are consistently more diverse, and therefore distinct, from their sparser abiotic counterparts. This distinction holds for fatty acids as well, indicating that the diversity signal reflects a fundamental biosynthetic signature. It also proves persistent under space-like degradation.
  Relying only on relative abundances, this biogenicity assessment strategy is applicable to any molecular composition data from archived, current, and planned planetary missions. By capturing a fundamental statistical property of life's chemical organization, it may also transcend biosignatures that are contingent on Earth's evolutionary history.</description>

      <title>Secondary eclipses of two brown dwarfs in the K2 fields: detection by multiple dataset merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using various data sources for the stellar fluxes in overlapping campaign fields and employing full time series modeling, we report the detection of the secondary eclipses of two brown dwarfs (CWW 89Ab = EPIC 219388192b and HSHJ 430b = EPIC 211946007b). The detections yielded timings in agreement with the orbital elements derived from the earlier radial velocity measurements and eclipse depths of 70+/-12 ppm (CWW 89Ab) and 852+/-123 ppm (HSHJ 430b). While the high depth in the Kepler waveband for HSHJ 430b is in agreement with the assumption that the emitted flux comes mostly from the internal heat source and the absorbed stellar irradiation, the case of CWW 89Ab suggests very high albedo, because of the lack of sufficient thermal radiation in the Kepler waveband. Assuming completely reflective dayside hemisphere, without circulation, the maximum value of the eclipse depth due to the reflection of the stellar light is 56 ppm. By making the extreme assumption that the true eclipse depth is 3 sigma less than the observed depth, the minimum geometric albedo becomes ~0.6.</description>

      <title>Gaia and IRTF abundance of A-type main belt asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Missing Mantle Problem refers to the apparent scarcity of olivine rich (A-type) asteroids in the main belt, despite expectations that such bodies should be common if differentiated parent bodies were widely disrupted. Conversely, A-types appear relatively more abundant among near-Earth asteroids. We present a revised estimate of the A-type abundance in the main belt by combining Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) reflectance spectra with near-infrared observations from NASA IRTF. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to Gaia DR3 visible spectra to identify A-type candidates and confirmed a subset through IRTF spectroscopy. Using these data and literature results, we derived the A-type probability distribution as a function of DR3 principal components, and from this, estimated their abundance across heliocentric distances and collisional families. We find that A-types constitute (2.00 +/- 0.15)% of main-belt asteroids significantly higher than previous estimates. Some families, such as Vesta and Flora, show enhanced A-type fractions, while others (e.g. Themis, Hygiea) contain few or none. The elevated abundance in the Flora family supports the existence of an additional differentiated parent body in the inner belt, besides Vesta. These findings indicate that olivine-rich material is more widespread than previously thought, offering new constraints on the Missing Mantle Problem and on early Solar System differentiation processes.</description>

      <title>Onset of habitable conditions on the Hadean Earth set by feedback between tides and greenhouse forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the aftermath of the Moon-forming giant impact, the Hadean Earth's mantle and surface crystallized from a global magma ocean blanketed by a dense volatile-rich atmosphere. While prior studies have explored the thermal evolution of such early Earth scenarios under idealized, oxidizing conditions, the potential feedback between tidal heating driven by Earth--Moon orbital forcing and variable redox scenarios have not yet been explored in detail. We investigate whether tidal heating could have prolonged this early magma ocean phase and supported quasi-steady state epochs of global radiative equilibrium: periods of thermal balance between outgoing radiation and interior heat flux. Using the $\texttt{PROTEUS}$ simulation framework, we simulate Earth's early evolution under a range of plausible tidal power densities, oxygen fugacities, and volatile inventories. Our results suggest that feedback between tidal heating and atmospheric forcing can induce substantial variation in magma ocean lifetimes, from $\sim$30 Myr up to $\sim$500 Myr, sensitive to interior redox conditions. Global radiative equilibrium epochs commonly arise across this range, lasting from $\sim$2 to $\sim$320 Myr, and typically occur from 24 Myr after the Moon-forming impact. Under oxidizing conditions, late-stage H$_2$O degassing promotes melt retention and sustained heating due to its significant contribution to greenhouse forcing. Weak tides increase the atmospheric abundance of H$_2$S and NH$_3$ and deplete CO. Therefore, the feedback between tides and atmospheric forcing induces a disequilibrium signature in the magma ocean atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Limits on forming coreless terrestrial worlds in the TRAPPIST-1 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With seven temperate Earth-sized planets revolving around an ultracool red dwarf, the nearby TRAPPIST-1 system offers a unique opportunity to verify models of exoplanet composition, differentiation, and interior structure. In particular, the low bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, compared to terrestrial planets in our solar system, require either substantial amount of volatiles to be present or a corefree scenario where the metallic core is fully oxidised. Here, using an updated metal-silicate partitioning model, we show that during core-mantle differentiation oxygen becomes more siderophile (iron-loving) implying larger planet radii. For the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, however, we find that they are not sufficiently large to oxidise all the iron in the core, if they differentiate from an Earth-like composition. Oxygen partitioning in rocky worlds precludes coreless planets up to about 4 Earth masses. The observed density deficit in the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and more generally in M dwarf systems if confirmed by future observations, may be explained by system-dependent element budgets during planet formation, which are intrinsically linked to their stellar metallicity.</description>

      <title>Experiments reveal extreme water generation during planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most abundant type of planet discovered in the Galaxy has no analogue in our Solar System and is believed to consist of a rocky interior with an overlying thick H2 dominated envelope. Models have predicted that the reaction between the atmospheric hydrogen and the underlying magma ocean can lead to the production of significant amounts of water. The models suffer however from the current lack of experimental data on the reaction between hydrogen and silicate melt at high pressures and temperatures. Here we present novel experimental results designed to investigate this interaction. Laser heating diamond anvil cell experiments were conducted between 16 and 60 GPa at temperatures above 4000 K. We find that copious amounts of hydrogen dissolve into the silicate melt with a large dependence on temperature rather than pressure. We also find that the reduction of iron oxide leads to the production of significant amounts of water along with the formation of iron-enriched blebs. Altogether, the results predict that the typical processes attending planet formation will result in significant water production with repercussions for the chemistry and structure of the planetary interior as well as the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Chasing the storm: Investigating the application of high-contrast imaging techniques in producing precise exoplanet light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substellar companions such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs exhibit changes in brightness arising from top-of-atmosphere inhomogeneities, providing insights into their atmospheric structure and dynamics. This variability can be measured in the light curves of high-contrast companions from the ground by combining differential spectrophotometric monitoring techniques with high-contrast imaging. However, ground-based observations are sensitive to the effects of turbulence in Earth's atmosphere, and while adaptive optics (AO) systems and bespoke data processing techniques help to mitigate these, residual systematics can limit photometric precision. Here, we inject artificial companions to data obtained with an AO system and a vector Apodizing Phase Plate coronagraph to test the level to which telluric and other systematics contaminate such light curves, and thus how well their known variability signals can be recovered. We find that varying companions are distinguishable from non-varying companions, but that variability amplitudes and periods cannot be accurately recovered when observations cover only a small number of periods. Residual systematics remain above the photon noise in the light curves but have not yet reached a noise floor. We also simulate observations to assess how specific systematic sources, such as non-common path aberrations and AO residuals, can impact aperture photometry as a companion moves through pupil-stabilised data. We show that only the lowest-order aberrations are likely to affect flux measurements, but that thermal background noise is the dominant source of scatter in raw companion photometry. Predictive control and focal-plane wavefront sensing techniques will help to further reduce systematics in data of this type.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet climate characterization with transit asymmetries -- A comprehensive population study from the optical to the infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space missions (CHEOPS, JWST, PLATO) facilitate detailed characterization of exoplanets. This work provides a framework to characterize cloud and climate properties of close-in gas giants via transit depth asymmetries from the optical to the infrared (0.33 ...10 $\mu$m).
  The AFGKM ExoRad 3D GCM grid provides gas temperature profiles for an ensemble of 50 tidally locked gaseous planets orbiting diverse host stars. It is combined with a detailed kinetic cloud formation model. The end result is a set of synthetic transit spectra and evening-to-morning transit asymmetries that span climate regimes: warm (T=800 K ... 1000K), intermediately hot (T=1200 K ... 2000 K) and ultrahot (T =2200 K ... 2600 K).
  WASP-39b observations suggest iron-free clouds with less abundant cloud condensation nuclei than previously expected. The ensemble study shows that clouds increase transit limb differences due to asymmetries in cloud coverage and by enhancing horizontal differences in the gas temperatures.
  For hot planets, evening-to-morning differences of up to 150 ppm are suggested in the optical and 100 ppm in the infrared (2-8 micron). For ultra-hot Jupiters, evening-to-morning transit differences are dominated by the morning cloud for a cloud-free evening limb: They are strongly negative in the PLATO band (0.5-1~$\mu$m, -500 ppm), moderately negative in the near-infrared (1-1.5~$\mu$m, -200 ppm) and moderately positive (+100 ppm) for $\lambda &gt; 2\mu$m. For a partly cloudy evening terminator, the evening-to-morning transit asymmetry is moderately positive in the whole wavelength range. Warm Jupiter planets exhibit negligible transit asymmetries.
  PLATO and JWST transit asymmetry observations between 1-2 $\mu$m are optimal to characterize cloudy planetary atmospheres around K -A stars. JWST observations are most effective for M star planets with transit differences &gt; +500 ppm for 8-10 $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Planets Across Space and Time (PAST). VIII : Kinematic Characterization and Identification of Radial Velocity Variables for the LAMOST-Gaia-TESS Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered over 6700 nearby exoplanets candidates using the transit method through its all-sky survey. Characterizing the kinematic properties and identifying variable stars for the TESS stellar sample is crucial for revealing the correlations between the properties of planetary systems and the properties of stars (e.g., Galactic components, age, chemistry, dynamics, radiation). Based on data from TESS, Gaia DR3, and LAMOST DR10, we present a catalog of kinematic properties (i.e., Galactic positions, velocities, orbits, Galactic components, and kinematic age) as well as other basic stellar parameters for $\sim 660,000$ TESS stars. Our analysis of the kinematic catalog reveals that stars belonging to different Galactic components (i.e., thin disk, thick disk, halo and 12 streams in the disk) display distinctive kinematic and chemical properties. We also find that hot planets with period less then 10 days in the TESS sample favor thin disk stars compared to thick disk stars, consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, using the LAMOST multiple-epoch observations, we identify 41,445 stars exhibiting significant radial velocity variations, among which 7,846 are classified as binary stars. By fitting the radial velocity curves, we further derive orbital parameters (e.g., mass ratio, orbital period and eccentricity) for 297 binaries. The observed decreasing orbital eccentricity with shorting period reveals evidence of tidal circularization. The catalogs constructed in this work have laid a solid foundation for future work on the formation and evolution of stellar and planetary systems in different Galactic environments.</description>

      <title>Detailed spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the remarkable planet-hosting wide binary system HD 202772A/B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a detailed spectroscopic and photometric characterization of the planet-hosting wide binary HD 202772A/B. No planet has been detected around HD 202772B, whereas HD 202772A, more evolved than its companion and near the end of its main-sequence (MS) phase, hosts a transiting hot Jupiter. The system has one of the hottest components ($T_{\mathrm{eff}; A} \sim 6440$ K) and one of the largest surface gravity differences between components ($\Delta\log g_{A-B} \sim 0.4$ dex) among MS planet-hosting wide binaries. Using a global fit including our stellar parameters, radial velocities, and new TESS data, we derive refined properties of the planet orbiting HD 202772A, finding it to be the most irradiated hot Jupiter known in a wide binary. We also constrain the presence of additional transiting planets around HD 202772A and new transiting planets around HD 202772B using TESS photometry. We derive high-precision, strictly differential abundances for 27 species based on Gemini-GRACES spectra. HD 202772A shows lower lithium abundance (by 0.45 dex) relative to B, consistent with their stellar parameter differences. We also detect a small but significant enhancement in refractory elements in HD 202772A, particularly those with condensation temperatures above 1400 K (+0.018 $\pm$ 0.004 dex). We explored several scenarios to explain the observed chemical anomalies. Our analysis suggests that rocky planet engulfment, primordial inhomogeneities, and $\delta$ Scuti-related effects are unlikely to fully account for the chemical pattern. Instead, the differences observed in certain refractory elements might support atomic diffusion as the most plausible explanation.</description>

      <title>High CO/H2 ratios supports an exocometary origin for a CO-rich debris disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over 20 exocometary belts host detectable circumstellar gas, mostly in the form of CO. Two competing theories for its origin have emerged, positing the gas to be primordial or secondary. Primordial gas survives from the belt's parent protoplanetary disk and is therefore H$_2$-rich. Secondary gas is outgassed \textit{in-situ} by exocomets and is relatively H$_2$-poor. Discriminating between these scenarios has not been possible for belts hosting unexpectedly large quantities of CO. We aim to break this gas origin dichotomy \textit{via} direct measurement of H$_2$ column densities in two edge-on CO-rich exocometary belts around $\sim$15 Myr-old A-type stars, constraining the $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratio and CO gas lifetimes. Observing edge-on belts enables rovibrational absorption spectroscopy against the stellar background. We present near-IR CRIRES+ spectra of HD 110058 and HD 131488 which provide the first direct probe of H$_2$ gas in CO-rich exocometary belts. We target the H$_2$ (v=1-0 S(0)) line at 2223.3 nm and and the $^{12}$CO $v=2\rightarrow0$ rovibrational lines in the range 2333.8-2335.5 nm and derive constraints on column densities along the line-of-sight to the stars. We strongly detect $^{12}$CO but not H$_2$ in the CRIRES+ spectra. This allows us to place $3\sigma$ lower limits on the $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratios of $&gt; 1.35 \times 10^{-3}$ and $&gt; 3.09 \times 10^{-5}$ for HD 110058 and HD 131488 respectively. These constraints demonstrate that at least for HD 110058, the exocometary gas is compositionally distinct and significantly H$_2$-poor, compared to the $&lt;10^{-4}$ $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratios typical of protoplanetary disks. We also find H$_2$ alone is unlikely to shield CO over the lifetime of the systems. Overall this suggests that the gas in CO-rich belts is most likely not primordial in origin, supporting the presence of exocometary gas.</description>

      <title>Origins of Mercury's Big Heart of Iron: Exploring Pathways to Form High Core Mass Fraction (CMF) Planets via N-body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mercury's core mass fraction (CMF) is ~0.7, more than double that of the other rocky planets in the solar system, which have CMFs of ~0.3. The origin of Mercury's large, iron-rich core remains unknown. Adding to this mystery, an elusive population of "Exo-Mercuries" with high densities is emerging. Therefore, understanding the formation of Mercury and its exoplanetary analogs is essential to developing a comprehensive planet formation theory. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the high CMF of Mercury: (1) giant impacts during the latest stages of planet formation strip away mantle layers, leaving Mercury with a large core; and (2) earlier-stage iron enrichment of planetesimals closer to the Sun leads to the formation of an iron-rich planet. In this work, we conduct N-body simulations to test these two possibilities. Our simulations are focused on the solar system, however, we aim to provide a framework that can later be applied to the formation of high-CMF exoplanets. To investigate the giant impact scenario, we employ uniform initial CMF distributions. To address the other hypothesis, we use a step function with higher CMFs in the inner region. For a uniform initial CMF distribution, our results indicate that although erosive impacts produce iron-rich particles, without mechanisms that deplete stripped mantle material, these particles merge with lower-CMF objects and do not lead to Mercury's elevated CMF. However, a step function initial CMF distribution leads to the formation of a high-CMF planet alongside Earth-like planets, resembling the architecture of the terrestrial solar system.</description>

      <title>Modeling dust dynamics in OpenGadget3 - I. SPH implementation of the One-Fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust dynamics plays a critical role in astrophysical processes and has been modeled in hydrodynamical simulations using various approaches. Among particle-based methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), the One-Fluid model has proven to be highly effective for simulating gas-dust mixtures. This study presents the implementation of the One-Fluid model in OpenGadget3, introducing improvements to the original formulation. These enhancements include time-dependent artificial viscosity and conductivity, as well as a novel treatment of dust diffusion using a pressure-like term. The improved model is tested using a suite of dust dynamics benchmark problems: DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK, with the latter extended to multidimensional scenarios, as well as a dusty Sedov-Taylor blast wave. Additional tests include simulations of Cold Keplerian Disks, dusty protoplanetary disks, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to evaluate the model's robustness in more complex flows. The implementation successfully passes all standard benchmark tests. It demonstrates stability and accuracy in both simple and complex simulations. The new diffusion term improves the handling of flows with large dust-to-gas ratios and low drag coefficients, although limitations of the One-Fluid model in these regimes remain. The enhanced One-Fluid model is a reliable and robust tool for simulating dust dynamics in OpenGadget3. While it retains some limitations inherent to the original formulation, the introduced improvements expand its applicability and address some challenges in gas-dust dynamics.</description>

      <title>Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS): V721 CrA and BN CrA have wide and structured disks in polarised IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present near-infrared scattered-light observations of the disks around two stars of the Corona Australis star-forming region, V721 CrA, and BN CrA, obtained with VLT/SPHERE, in the H band, as part of the DESTINYS large programme. Our objective is to analyse the morphology of these disks, and highlight their main properties. We adopt an analytical axisymmetric disk model to fit the observations and perform a regression on key disk parameters, namely the dust mass, the height profile, and the inclination. We use RADMC-3D code to produce synthetic observations of the analytical models, with full polarised scattering treatment. Both stars show resolved and extended disks with substructures in the near-IR. The disk of V721 CrA is vertically thicker, radially smaller (120 au), and brighter than BN CrA (190 au). It also shows spiral arms in the inner regions. The disk of BN CrA shows a dark circular lane, which could be either an intrinsic dust gap or a self-cast shadow, and a brightness enhancement along the disk minor axis. Both disks are compatible with the evolutionary stage of their parent subgroup within the CrA region: V721 CrA belongs to the "on-cloud" part of CrA, which is dustier, denser and younger, whereas BN CrA is found on the outskirts of the older "off-cloud" group.</description>

      <title>Dynamical constraints on the vertical structure of Jupiter's polar cyclones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jupiter's poles feature striking polygons of cyclones that drift westward over time, a motion governed by beta-drift (vortex motion caused by the latitudinal variation of the Coriolis force). This study investigates how beta-drift and the resulting westward motion depend on the depth of these cyclones. Counterintuitively, shallower cyclones drift more slowly, a consequence of stronger vortex stretching. By employing a 2D quasi-geostrophic model of Jupiter's polar regions, we constrain the cyclones' deformation radius, a key parameter that serves as a proxy for their vertical extent, required to replicate the observed westward drift. We then explore possible vertical structures and the static stability of the poles by solving the eigenvalue problem that links the 2D model to a 3D framework, matching the constrained deformation radius. These findings provide a foundation for interpreting upcoming Juno microwave measurements of Jupiter's north pole, offering insights into the static stability and vertical structure of the polar cyclones. Thus, by leveraging long-term motion as a novel constraint on vertical dynamics, this work sets the stage for advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of Jupiter's enigmatic polar cyclones.</description>

      <title>The Challenges Involved in the Detection of Gases in Exoplanet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Claims of detections of gases in exoplanet atmospheres often rely on comparisons between models including and excluding specific chemical species. However, the space of molecular combinations available for model construction is vast and highly degenerate. Only a limited subset of these combinations is typically explored for any given detection. As a result, apparent detections of trace gases risk being artifacts of incomplete modeling rather than robust identification of atmospheric constituents, especially in the low signal-to-noise regime. Using the sub-Neptune K2-18 b as a case study, we show that recent biosignature claims vanish when the model space is expanded, with numerous alternatives providing equally good or better fits. We demonstrate that the significance of a claimed detection relies on the choice of models being compared, and that model preference does not in itself imply the presence of a specific gas. We recommend treating model comparisons instead as relative adequacy tests, which should be supported by theoretical predictions and complementary metrics of statistical significance in order to attribute a signal to a particular gas.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Ariel's Survey Leverage for Population-Level Studies of Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ESA's Ariel mission will be uniquely suited to performing population-level studies of exoplanets. Most of these studies consist of quantifying trends between an Ariel-measured quantity, y, and an a priori planetary property, x; for example, atmospheric metallicity as inferred from Ariel transit spectroscopy vs. planetary mass. The precision with which we can quantify such trends depends on the number of targets in the survey and their variance in the a priori parameter. We define the leverage of a survey with N targets as L = sqrt(N)stdev(x) and show that it quantitatively predicts the precision of population-level trends. The target selection challenge of Ariel can therefore be summarized as maximizing L along some axes of diversity for a given cumulative observing time. To this end, we consider different schemes to select the mission reference sample for a notional three year transit spectroscopy survey with Ariel. We divide the exoplanets in the mission candidate sample into logarithmic classes based on radius, equilibrium temperature and host star temperature. We then construct a target list by cyclically choosing the easiest remaining target in each class. We find that the leverage on a single axis of diversity can be increased by dividing that axis into many classes, but this sacrifices leverage along other axes of diversity. We conclude that a modest number of classes, possibly only one, should be defined when selecting Ariel targets. Lastly, we note that the statistical leverage of the Ariel transit survey would be significantly increased if current candidate planets were confirmed. This highlights the urgency of vetting and confirming the easiest transmission and emission spectroscopy targets in the Ariel mission candidate sample.</description>

      <title>Transit Timing Variations in HIP 41378: CHEOPS and TESS confirm a non-transiting sixth planet in the system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multiple-planet systems, gravitational interactions of exoplanets could lead to transit timing variations (TTVs), whose amplitude becomes significantly enhanced when planets are in or near mean-motion resonances (MMRs). In cases where both TTVs and radial velocity (RV) measurements are available, combined analysis can break degeneracies and provide robust planetary and system characterization, even detecting non-transiting planets. In this context, HIP 41378 hosts five confirmed transiting planets with periods ranging from 15 to over 542 days, providing a unique dynamical laboratory for investigating wide multi-planet systems analogous to the Solar System. In this study, we present an intensive space-based photometric follow-up of HIP 41378, combining 15 new CHEOPS observations with eight TESS sectors, alongside data from K2, Spitzer, HST, and HARPS. We dynamically modeled the TTVs and RV signals of the two inner sub-Neptunes via N-body integration. These planets, HIP 41378 b ($P_{b}$ = 15.57 days) and HIP 41378 c ($P_{c}$ = 31.71 days), are close to ($\Delta\sim1.8$ %) a 2:1 period commensurability. We report a clear detection of TTVs with amplitudes of 20 mins for planet b and greater than 3 hrs for planet c. We dynamically confirm the planetary nature of HIP 41378 g, a non-transiting planet with a period of about 64 days and a mass of about 7 $M_{\oplus}$, close to a 2:1 commensurability with planet c, suggesting a possible MMR chain in the inner system. Our precise determination of the masses, eccentricities, and radii of HIP 41378 b and c enabled us to investigate their possible volatile-rich compositions. Finally, by leveraging on the last TESS sectors we constrained the period of HIP 41378 d to three possible aliases ($P_{d} =$ 278, 371, and 1113 days) suggesting that the system could be placed in a double quasi resonant chain, highlighting its complex dynamical architecture.</description>

      <title>The ExoGRAVITY survey: A K-band spectral library of giant exoplanet and brown dwarf companions</title>

Abstract: Direct observations of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions with near-infrared interferometry, first enabled by the dual-field mode of VLTI/GRAVITY, provide unique measurements of the objects' orbital motions and atmospheric compositions. Here, we compile a homogeneous library of all exoplanet and brown dwarf K-band spectra observed by GRAVITY thus far. We re-reduced all the available GRAVITY dual-field high-contrast data and, where companions are detected, extract their ~2.0-2.4 $\mu$m K-band contrast spectra. We then derived stellar model atmospheres for all employed flux references, which we used to convert the companion contrast into companion flux spectra. Solely from the resulting GRAVITY spectra, we extracted spectral types, spectral indices, and bulk physical properties for all companions. Finally, and with the help of age constraints from the literature, we also derived isochronal masses for most companions using evolutionary models. The resulting library contains R ~ 500 GRAVITY spectra of 39 substellar companions from late M to late T spectral types, including the entire L-T transition. Throughout this transition, a shift from CO-dominated late M- and L-type dwarfs to CH4-dominated T-type dwarfs can be observed in the K-band. The GRAVITY spectra alone constrain the objects' bolometric luminosity to typically within $\pm$0.15 dex. The derived isochronal masses agree with dynamical masses from the literature where available, except for HD 4113 c for which we confirm its previously reported potential underluminosity. Medium-resolution spectroscopy of substellar companions with GRAVITY provides insight into the carbon chemistry and the cloudiness of these objects' atmospheres. It also constrains these objects' bolometric luminosities which can yield measurements of their formation entropy if combined with dynamical masses, for instance from Gaia and GRAVITY astrometry.</description>

      <title>A Census of NUV M-Dwarf Flares Using Archival GALEX Data and the gPhoton2 Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: M-dwarfs are common stellar hosts of habitable-zone exoplanets. NUV radiation can severely impact the atmospheric and surface conditions of such planets, making characterization of NUV flaring activity a key aspect in determining habitability. We use archival data from the GALEX and XMM-Newton telescopes to study the flaring activity of M-dwarfs in the NUV. The GALEX observations form the most extensive dataset of M-dwarfs in the NUV to date, with exploitation of this data possible due to the new gPhoton2 pipeline. We run a dedicated algorithm to detect flares in the pipeline produced lightcurves and find some of the most energetic flares observed to date within the NUV bandpass, with energies of $\sim10^{34}$ ergs. Using GALEX data, we constrain flare frequency distributions for stars from M0 to M6 in the NUV up to $10^5\,$s in equivalent duration and $10^{34}$ ergs in energy, orders of magnitude above any previous study in the UV. We speculate the combined effect of NUV luminosities and flare rates of M4 and later stars could potentially allow abiogenesis on their habitable zone exoplanets. As a counterpoint, we estimate that the high frequencies of energetic UV flares and associated coronal mass ejections would inhibit the formation of an ozone layer, possibly preventing genesis of complex Earth-like lifeforms due to sterilizing levels of surface UV radiation. We also provide a framework for future observations of M-dwarfs with ULTRASAT, a wide FoV NUV telescope to be launched in 2027.</description>

      <title>Water Management Considerations for a Self-Sustaining Moonbase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most pragmatic first step in the all-but-inevitable 3rd-millennium V\"olkerwanderung of humanity throughout the Solar System is the establishment of a permanent human presence on the Moon. This research examines: 1. the human, agricultural, and technical water needs of a 100-person, 500 m x 100 m x 6 m self-sustaining lunar colony; 2. choosing a strategic location for the moonbase; 3. a heat drill model by which the needed lunar water ice could be sublimated; and 4. the robust water treatment and recovery infrastructure and water management personnel that would be needed for a self-sustaining moonbase.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target Wh\,day$^{-1}$ and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2\,m-class phased array at 1064\,nm the reference geometry yields $\sim$0.6--0.8\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ to a 1\,m$^2$ receiver (about 28\,W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^{2}$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10\,m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$\,kW delivers $\sim$30--50\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</description>
