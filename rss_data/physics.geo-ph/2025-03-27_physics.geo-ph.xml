      <title>Measurement of Trace Elements in Volcanic Materials: Consequences for the Cretaceous-Tertiary Mass Extinction, Geoneutrinos and the Origin of the Hawaii's Archipelago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seventeen representative samples of volcanic origin were collected from Ecuador (Pichincha Volcano), Iceland (Eyjafjallaj\"okull Volcano), India (Deccan Traps), Hawaii, Kilimanjaro, Mt. Etna, Rwanda (Virunga Mountains), and Uganda (Virunga Mountains). Neutron activation analysis (NAA) was performed to determine the concentration of 33 chemical elements, including 21 trace elements, 20 heavy metals, and 9 rare earth elements: Al, As, Ba, Ca, Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Dy, Eu, Fe, Hf, K, La, Lu, Mg, Mn, Na, Nd, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sm, Sr, Ta, Tb, Th, Ti, U, Yb, Zn, and Zr.
  Correlation analysis of the abundance of samples from different islands in the Hawaii archipelago (Kauai, Kilauea, Mauna Loa, and Haleakala) confirmed that the islands were likely formed by two different lava sources. Additionally, the upper limit of iridium was determined in 11 of these samples using Bayesian analysis, which does not support the hypothesis that volcanic activity caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.
  We also discuss how the abundance of thorium and uranium in lava from different geological formations and depths can contribute to building a better map of natural radioisotope occurrences on Earth, which is important for geoneutrino experiments. A high abundance of rare elements was reported in some of the analyzed locations, indicating potential commercial interest and the possibility of exploring volcanoes as sources of chemical elements used in electronic devices.</description>

      <title>How Ground Deformation Influences Earthquake Occurrence During the Ongoing Unrest at Campi Flegrei (2005-Present)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the cumulative number of earthquakes and ground uplift at the Campi Flegrei caldera (South Italy) during the ongoing unrest (2005-present). While previous studies have explored this correlation, we propose a nonlinear epidemic model that captures new features of the caldera system. Our model describes earthquakes' occurrence as a cascading process driven by ground deformation. The nonlinearity reflects the reduced efficiency of the triggering mechanism, which contributes to the short duration of seismic swarms. This mechanism may represent a general framework for understanding the occurrence of volcanic earthquakes worldwide.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Uncertainty Estimation in Seismology Data Processing with Application to Extract Rayleigh Wave Dispersion Curves from Noise Cross-correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting meaningful information from large seismic datasets often requires estimating the uncertainty associated with the results for quantitative analysis. This uncertainty arises from both the raw data and the manually labeled annotations. We introduce an uncertainty estimation framework designed to calculate the uncertainty from manually labeled data. This framework can efficiently output the true posterior from large datasets. We apply the framework to extract Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion and compute the posterior distribution of the dispersion results. We utilize 62,899 noise cross-correlation function (NCF) data from 438 stations located in Yunnan Province and manually label the Rayleigh phase velocity dispersion curves. Dispersion curve extraction presents two key challenges: (1) Researchers typically derive dispersion curves from spectrograms in the periodvelocity domain, limiting the ability to directly study the relationship between NCFs and dispersion curves; (2) Assessing uncertainty in manually labeled data remains difficult. To address these challenges, the framework takes the NCFs as input and directly output both the dispersion values and the posterior of the dispersion values when processing the NCF data. This approach allows us to construct a flexible deep neural network (DNN) architecture that balances accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Pipeline for Large Earthquake Analysis using High-Rate Global Navigation Satellite System Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques for processing large and complex datasets have unlocked new opportunities for fast and reliable earthquake analysis using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. This work presents a deep learning model, MagEs, to estimate earthquake magnitudes using data from high-rate GNSS stations. Furthermore, MagEs is integrated with the DetEQ model for earthquake detection within the SAIPy package, creating a comprehensive pipeline for earthquake detection and magnitude estimation using HR-GNSS data. The MagEs model provides magnitude estimates within seconds of detection when using stations within 3 degrees of the epicenter, which are the most relevant for real-time applications. However, since it has been trained on data from stations up to 7.5 degrees away, it can also analyze data from larger distances. The model can process data from a single station at a time or combine data from up to three stations. The model was trained using synthetic data reflecting rupture scenarios in the Chile subduction zone, and the results confirm strong performance for Chilean earthquakes. Although tests from other tectonic regions also yielded good results, incorporating regional data through transfer learning could further improve its performance in diverse seismic settings. The model has not yet been deployed in an operational real-time monitoring system, but simulation tests that update data in a second-by-second manner demonstrate its potential for future real-time adaptation.</description>

      <title>Ambient Noise Full Waveform Inversion with Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation are crucial for investigating velocity structures and improving seismic hazard assessment. However, standard methods such as finite difference or finite element are computationally expensive. Recent studies have shown that a new class of machine learning models, called neural operators, can solve the elastodynamic wave equation orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods. Full waveform inversion is a prime beneficiary of the accelerated simulations. Neural operators, as end-to-end differentiable operators, combined with automatic differentiation, provide an alternative approach to the adjoint-state method. Since neural operators do not involve the Born approximation, when used for full waveform inversion they have the potential to include additional phases and alleviate cycle-skipping problems present in traditional adjoint-state formulations. In this study, we demonstrate the first application of neural operators for full waveform inversion on a real seismic dataset, which consists of several nodal transects collected across the San Gabriel, Chino, and San Bernardino basins in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.</description>

      <title>Simulation and modelling of convective mixing of carbon dioxide in geological formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform large-scale numerical simulations of convection in 3D porous media at Rayleigh-Darcy numbers up to $Ra=8\times10^4$. To investigate the convective mixing of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) in geological formations, we consider a semi-infinite domain, where the CO$_2$ concentration is constant at the top and no flux is prescribed at bottom. Convection begins with a diffusion-dominated phase, transitions to convection-driven solute finger growth, and ends with a shutdown stage as fingers reach the bottom boundary and the concentration in the system increases. For $Ra \ge 5\times10^3$, we observe a constant-flux regime with dissolution flux stabilizing at 0.019, approximately 13\% higher than in 2D estimates. Finally, we provide a simple and yet accurate physical model describing the mass of solute entering the system throughout the whole mixing process. These findings extend solutal convection insights to 3D and high-$Ra$, improving the reliability of tools predicting the long-term CO$_2$ dynamics in the subsurface.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relationship between bolide entry angle and apparent direction of infrasound signal arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing offers critical capabilities for detecting and geolocating bolide events globally. However, the observed back azimuths, directions from which infrasound signals arrive at stations, often differ from the theoretical expectations based on the bolide's peak brightness location. For objects with shallow entry angles, which traverse longer atmospheric paths, acoustic energy may be emitted from multiple points along the trajectory, leading to substantial variability in back azimuth residuals. This study investigates how the entry angle of energetic bolides affects the back azimuth deviations, independent of extrinsic factors such as atmospheric propagation, station noise, and signal processing methodologies. A theoretical framework, the Bolide Infrasound Back-Azimuth EXplorer Model (BIBEX-M), was developed to compute predicted back azimuths solely from geometric considerations. The model quantifies how these residuals vary as a function of source-to-receiver distance, revealing that bolides entering at shallow angles of 10 degrees can experience average residuals of 20 degrees, with deviations reaching up to 46 degrees at distances below 1000 km, and remaining significant even at 10,000 km. In contrast, bolides with steeper entry angles (greater than 60 degrees) show much smaller deviations, typically under 5 degrees at 1000 km and diminishing to less than 1 deg beyond 5000 km. These findings attest to the need for careful interpretation when evaluating signal detections and estimating bolide locations. This work is not only pertinent to bolides but also to other high-energy, extended-duration atmospheric phenomena such as space debris and reentry events, where similar geometric considerations can influence infrasound arrival directions.</description>
