      <title>Pump-driven droplet electrohydrodynamics: deformation, pinch-off and recoalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate pump-driven droplet electrohydrodynamics with an emphasis on deformation, pinch-off, and recoalescence. A thermodynamically consistent phase-field framework is developed that couples Nernst--Planck--Poisson electrodiffusion with incompressible Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard flow, and incorporates interfacial ionic pumps as prescribed surface fluxes. In the pump-free baseline, applied fields merely polarise the droplet and deformation is negligible. By contrast, surface-localised pumping drives the accumulation of positive ions within the droplet, elevates the interior potential, and generates non-uniform electric fields. The resulting Lorentz stresses stretch and displace the droplet, thin interfacial necks, and trigger pinch-off; the daughter droplets subsequently recoalesce, often after wall contact, yielding flattened remnants. In multiple-droplet settings, pump-induced charging produces lateral electrostatic repulsion and asymmetric deformation; under geometric confinement, crescent bending and star-like morphologies emerge. Shear-flow tests further show that a pumped droplet can be immobilised and ruptured while an unpumped neighbour is advected downstream, suggesting a route to sorting. Taken together, the results establish interfacial pumping as an internal actuation mechanism that robustly controls droplet morphology and dynamics across configurations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optimal perturbation growth in pulsatile pipe flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsatile fluid flows through straight pipes undergo a sudden transition to turbulence that is extremely difficult to predict. The difficulty stems here from the linear Floquet stability of the laminar flow up to large Reynolds numbers, well above experimental observations of turbulent flow. This makes the instability problem fully nonlinear and thus dependent on the shape and amplitude of the flow perturbation, in addition to the Reynolds and Womersley numbers and the pulsation amplitude. This problem can be tackled by optimizing over the space of all admissible perturbations to the laminar flow. In this paper, we present an adjoint optimization code, based on a GPU implementation of the pseudo-spectral Navier-Stokes solver nsPipe, which incorporates an automatic, optimal check-pointing strategy. We leverage this code to show that the flow is susceptible to two distinct instability routes: One in the deceleration phase, where the flow is prone to oblique instabilities, and another during the acceleration phase with similar mechanisms as in steady pipe flow. Instability is energetically more likely in the deceleration phase. Specifically, localised oblique perturbations can optimally exploit nonlinear effects to gain over nine orders of magnitude in energy at a peak Reynolds number of $Re_{\max}\approx 4000$. These oblique perturbations saturate into regular flow patterns that decay in the acceleration phase or break down to turbulence depending on the flow parameters. In the acceleration phase, optimal perturbations are substantially less amplified, but generally trigger turbulence if their amplitude is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>A three-dimensional numerical scheme for modeling three-phase contact line pinning using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In several capillary dynamics experiments, the liquid domain is confined by pinning the three-phase contact line along a sharp edge or a discontinuity on the substrate. Simulating the dynamics of pinned droplets can offer valuable insights into capillary flow phenomena involving wetting of inhomogeneous substrates. However, Eulerian multi-phase flow solvers are usually not able to directly implement pinning of three-phase contact lines. We present the implementation of a model for pinning the contact line of a liquid along an arbitrary pinning curve on the substrate, in an updated Lagrangian, meshless flow solver based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We develop the pinning model for a continuum surface force scheme and assume a free surface for the liquid-gas interface. We validate the model against several capillary dynamics experiments involving pinned three phase contact lines with fixed and dynamic substrates to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the solver.</description>

      <title>Convective flux analysis on the instability of one-dimensional detonation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional numerical simulations using the Euler equations and irreversible one-step Arrhenius kinetics are conducted to study the instability mechanism of a one-dimensional gaseous detonation. By increasing the activation energy, this study identifies the characteristics of stable detonation, periodic detonation, pulsating detonation, and detonation quenching. The key difference between this study and previous research is that it is the first quantitative analysis of convective flux, kinetic energy flux, and chemical reaction heat flux. These three fluxes undergo intensive change on the detonation front and the flow field at each time step depends on the algebra summation of them. The mechanisms of detonation instability, detonation reignition and detonation quenching process can be revealed quantitatively by analyzing these fluxes.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of turbulent mixing in a T-shaped mixer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most widespread canonical devices for fluid mixing is the T-shaped mixer, in which two opposing miscible liquid streams meet at a junction and then mix along a main channel. Laminar steady and time-periodic flows in T-shaped mixers have been thoroughly studied, but turbulent flows have received much less scrutiny despite their prevalence in applications. We here introduce a novel experimental setup with a hydraulic diameter of four centimetres that enables the optical study of turbulent mixing at small scales. Using this setup, we perform two-dimensional particle image velocimetry and planar laser-induced fluorescence measurements. First, we successfully replicate characteristic flow regimes observed in micro-scale T-shaped mixers at low Reynolds numbers. We then focus on the turbulent regime and characterize the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation along the mixing channel. Further, we measure the scalar concentration variance and its corresponding probability density function and spectra. The latter exhibits an incipient Batchelor scaling. We estimate the mechanical-to-scalar timescale ratio and examine the link between the turbulent velocity and scalar fields. The measurement data are compared with model predictions and correlations used in engineering practice, and with our own direct numerical simulations performed with a spectral-element code.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Stability Analysis Technique for Fluid Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow transition from a stable to unstable states and eventually to turbulence is a classical fluid mechanics phenomenon with a strong practical relevance. Conventional hydrodynamic stability deals with perturbation dynamics on a steady baseflow, typically in Eulerian reference frame. Common modal techniques, e.g., linear stability theory, involve linearization of governing flow equations and flow/geometrical simplifications, which can be tedious and restrictive. This paper presents a perturbation-free data-driven stability analysis technique by employing Lagrangian modal/non-modal analysis (Shinde &amp; Gaitonde 2021), particularly the adjoint form of Lagrangian dynamics mode decomposition in the forward time direction. The proposed Lagrangian stability analysis technique (LagSAT) builds on the fact that a steady non-uniform fluid flow in the Eulerian reference frame can be perceived as an unsteady flow in the Lagrangian reference frame. LagSAT is demonstrated on classical baseflows that exhibit convective/absolute instabilities, namely, the self-similar Blasius/Falkner-Skan boundary layers, a 2D compressible flow past a cylinder, and a 2D compressible lid-driven cavity flow, producing neutral stability curves, N-factor estimate, and transient energy growth. LagSAT is naturally suitable for the global analysis of large/complex numerical/experimental baseflows with multiphysics effects.</description>

      <title>A Review of the Design of Cone-Cylinder-Flare Geometries for Stability Analyses and Conventional/Quiet Wind Tunnel Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to study the effects of pressure gradients, flow expansion, and recompression on the stability of hypersonic boundary-layers, axisymmetric cone-cylinder-flare configurations have been specifically designed for wind tunnel experiments. The objective is to create well-suited geometries for hypersonic laminar-turbulent transition analyses, while also adding the capability to generate attached and separated flows. After a thorough review of the aerodynamic flows obtained at Mach 6 and zero degree angle of attack in fully laminar conditions on each configuration, linear stability theory (LST) and linear parabolized stability equations (PSE) are used to predict the amplification rates of the boundary-layer disturbances for the case without flow separation since local stability analysis cannot handle highly non-parallel flows. For this attached flow case, the numerical stability results are compared to wind tunnel measurements obtained in the BAM6QT (Boeing AFOSR Mach-6 Quiet Tunnel). The semi-empirical method based on N-factor allows to correlate transition with the integrated growth of the linear instability waves. The influence of tunnel noise is also investigated, using conventional and quiet experiments.</description>

      <title>Instability and self-propulsion of flexible autophoretic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, autophoretic colloids have emerged as a prototypical system for studying self-propelled motion at microscopic scales, with promising applications in microfluidics, micro-machinery, and therapeutics. Their motion in a viscous fluid hinges on their ability to induce surface slip flows that are spatially asymmetric, from self-generated solute gradients. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that a straight elastic filament with homogeneous surface chemical properties -- which is otherwise immotile -- can spontaneously achieve self-propulsion by experiencing a buckling instability that serves as the symmetry-breaking mechanism. Using efficient numerical simulations, we characterize the nonlinear dynamics of the elastic filament and show that, over time, it attains distinct swimming modes such as a steadily translating "U" shape and a metastable rotating "S" shape when semi-flexible, and an oscillatory state when highly flexible. Our findings provide physical insight into future experiments and the design of reconfigurable synthetic active colloids.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Mixing Dynamics of Under-Expanded Hydrogen Jets in Propulsion Systems</title>

Abstract: Underexpanded jets are present in various engineering applications; in recent years, they have gained special attention because of the development of gas-fueled propulsion systems. In these apparatuses, the direct injection of fuels such as hydrogen in innovative low-emission engines' chambers induces turbulent under-expanded jets. In this study, we performed high-fidelity Large Eddy Simulations of under-expanded hydrogen jets to investigate mixing characteristics and provide valuable insights for developing injectors suitable for hydrogen and, more generally, gaseous-fueled propulsion systems. We initially assessed the method's accuracy, evaluating the convergence and uncertainty of the numerical results and validating them against experimental particle image velocimetry and Schlieren data. The simulated jets, the Mach disc dimensions, and the resulting velocity field align closely with the experimental observations. Then, we analysed the jet structure for pressure ratios of 4 to 25 and examined the effects of the geometrical configuration of the nozzle on the characteristics of the air-fuel mixture obtained. We compared the jets resulting from a round-hole nozzle with annular ones resembling outward-opening injectors.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic memory and Quincke rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spontaneous (so-called Quincke) rotation of an uncharged, solid, dielectric, spherical particle under a steady electric field is analyzed, accounting for the inertia of the particle and the transient fluid inertia, or ``hydrodynamic memory,'' due to the unsteady Stokes flow around the particle. The dynamics of the particle are encapsulated in three coupled nonlinear integro-differential equations for the evolution of the angular velocity of the particle, and the components of the induced dipole of the particle that are parallel and transverse to the applied field. These equations represent a generalization of the celebrated Lorenz system. A numerical solution of these `modified Lorenz equations' (MLE) shows that hydrodynamic memory leads to an increase in the threshold field strength for chaotic particle rotation, which is in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Furthermore, hydrodynamic memory leads to an increase in the range of field strengths where multi-stability between steady and chaotic rotation occurs. At large field strengths, chaos ceases and the particle is predicted to execute periodic rotational motion.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of temporal aiming for water waves with an anisotropic metabathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deflection of waves by combining the effects of time modulation with anisotropy has been recently proposed in the context of electromagnetism. In this work, we characterise this phenomenon, called temporal aiming, for water waves using a time-varying metabathymetry. This metabathymetry is composed of thin vertical plates that are periodically arranged at the fluid bottom and which act as an effective anisotropic medium for the surface wave in the long-wavelength approximation. When this plate array is vertically lifted at the fluid bottom at a given time, the medium switches from isotropic to anisotropic, causing a wavepacket to scatter in time and deflect from its initial trajectory. Following a simple modelling, we obtain the scattering coefficients of the two waves generated due to the sudden medium change as well as the angle of deviation with respect to the incident angle. We then numerically evaluate this scattering problem with simulations of the full 2D effective anisotropic wave equation, with a time-dependent anisotropy tensor. Finally, we provide experimental evidence of the temporal aiming, using space time resolved measurement techniques, demonstrating the trajectory shift of a wavepacket and measuring its angle of deviation.</description>

      <title>An approximate Riemann solver approach in Physics-Informed Neural Networks for hyperbolic conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study enhances the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for modeling discontinuous solutions in both hydrodynamics and relativistic hydrodynamics. Conventional PINNs, trained with partial differential equation residuals, frequently face convergence issues and lower accuracy near discontinuities. To address these issues, we build on the recently proposed locally linearized PINNs (LLPINNs), which improve shock detection by modifying the Jacobian matrix resulting from the linearization of the equations, only in regions where the velocity field exhibits strong compression. However, the original LLPINN framework required a priori knowledge of shock velocities, limiting its practical utility. We present a generalized LLPINN method that dynamically computes shock speeds using neighboring states and applies jump conditions through entropy constraints. Additionally, we introduce locally Roe PINNs (LRPINNs), which incorporate an approximate Roe Riemann solver to improve shock resolution and conservation properties across discontinuities. These methods are adapted to two-dimensional Riemann problems by using a divergence-based shock detection combined with dimensional splitting, delivering precise solutions. Compared to a high-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory solver, our method produces sharper shock transitions but smoother solutions in areas with small-scale vortex structures. Future research will aim to improve the resolution of these small-scale features without compromising the model's ability to accurately capture shocks.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report in this experimental and numerical study effects of gelation on the early-time spreading ($&lt;$ 10ms) of millimetric non-Newtonian drops of biopolymer and particle suspensions impacting a Newtonian liquid containing reactive compounds. Our analyses are initially conducted through experiments by considering a variety of biopolymer and gelling compound concentrations, and impact velocities. The experimental results are then compared to three-dimensional numerical simulations based on a variational multiscale approach, which focuses on the impact of simple viscoplastic drops on a liquid bath in the absence of gelation (non-reactive liquid). These comparisons enable the development of theoretical arguments that emphasise relevant gelation effects on the drop's maximum spreading.</description>
