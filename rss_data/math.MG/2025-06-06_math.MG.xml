      <title>Estimating the Euclidean distortion of an orbit space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite-dimensional inner product space $V$ and a group $G$ of isometries, we consider the problem of embedding the orbit space $V/G$ into a Hilbert space in a way that preserves the quotient metric as well as possible. This inquiry is motivated by applications to invariant machine learning. We introduce several new theoretical tools before using them to tackle various fundamental instances of this problem.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric inequalities in Hadamard spaces of asymptotic rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gromov's isoperimetric gap conjecture for Hadamard spaces states that cycles in dimensions greater than or equal to the asymptotic rank admit linear isoperimetric filling inequalities, as opposed to the inequalities of Euclidean type in lower dimensions. In the case of asymptotic rank 2, recent progress was made by Dru\c{t}u-Lang-Papasoglu-Stadler who established a homotopical inequality for Lipschitz 2-spheres with exponents arbitrarily close to 1. We prove a homological inequality of the same type for general cycles in dimensions at least 2, assuming that the ambient space has finite linearly controlled asymptotic dimension. This holds in particular for all Hadamard 3-manifolds and finite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every planar convex body is contained in a quadrangle whose area is less than $(1 - 2.6 \cdot 10^{-7}) \sqrt{2}$ times the area of the original convex body, improving the best known upper bound by W. Kuperberg.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of synthetic null hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a synthetic framework for the geometric and analytic study of null (lightlike) hypersurfaces in non-smooth spacetimes. Drawing from optimal transport and recent advances in Lorentzian geometry and causality theory, we define a synthetic null hypersurface as a triple $(H, G, \mathfrak{m})$: $H$ is a closed achronal set in a topological causal space, $G$ is a gauge function encoding affine parametrizations along null generators, and $\mathfrak{m}$ is a Radon measure serving as a synthetic analog of the rigged measure. This generalizes classical differential geometric structures to potentially singular spacetimes.
  A central object is the synthetic null energy condition ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$), defined via the concavity of an entropy power functional along optimal transport, with parametrization given by the gauge $G$. This condition is invariant under changes of gauge and measure within natural equivalence classes. It agrees with the classical Null Energy Condition in the smooth setting and it applies to low-regularity spacetimes. A key property of $\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$ is the stability under convergence of synthetic null hypersurfaces, inspired by measured Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.
  As a first application, we obtain a synthetic version of Hawking's area theorem. Moreover, we obtain various sharpenings of the celebrated Penrose's singularity theorem: for smooth spacetimes we show that the incomplete null geodesic whose existence is guaranteed by Penrose's argument is actually maximizing; we extend Penrose's singularity theorem to continuous spacetimes; we prove the existence of trapped regions in the general setting of topological causal spaces satisfying the synthetic $\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$.</description>

      <title>On Certain Extremal Banach-Mazur Distances and Ader's Characterization of Distance Ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical consequence of the John Ellipsoid Theorem is the upper bound $\sqrt{n}$ on the Banach-Mazur distance between the Euclidean ball and any symmetric convex body in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Equality is attained for the parallelotope and the cross-polytope. While it is known that they are unique with this property for $n=2$ but not for $n \geq 4$, no proof of the characterization of the three-dimensional equality case seems to have ever been published. We fill this gap by showing that the parallelotope and the cross-polytope are the unique maximizers for $n=3$. Our proof is based on an extension of a characterization of distance ellipsoids due to Ader from $1938$, which predates the John Ellipsoid Theorem. Ader's characterization turns out to provide a decomposition similar to the John decomposition, which leads to a proof of the aforementioned $\sqrt{n}$ estimate that bypasses the concept of volumes and reveals precise information about the equality case. We highlight further consequences of Ader's characterization, including a proof of an unpublished result attributed to Maurey related to the uniqueness of distance ellipsoids. Additionally, we investigate more closely the role of the parallelogram as a maximizer in various problems related to the distance between planar symmetric convex bodies. We establish the stability of the parallelogram as the unique planar symmetric convex body with the maximal distance to the Euclidean disc with the best possible (linear) order. This uniqueness extends to the setting of pairs of planar $1$-symmetric convex bodies, where we show that the maximal possible distance between them is again $\sqrt{2}$, together with a characterization of the equality case involving the parallelogram.</description>

      <title>PyRigi -- a general-purpose Python package for the rigidity and flexibility of bar-and-joint frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PyRigi, a novel Python package designed to study the rigidity properties of graphs and frameworks. Among many other capabilities, PyRigi can determine whether a graph admits only finitely many ways, up to isometries, of being drawn in the plane once the edge lengths are fixed, whether it has a unique embedding, or whether it satisfied such properties even after the removal of any of its edges. By implementing algorithms from the scientific literature, PyRigi enables the exploration of rigidity properties of structures that would be out of reach for computations by hand. With reliable and robust algorithms, as well as clear, well-documented methods that are closely connected to the underlying mathematical definitions and results, PyRigi aims to be a practical and powerful general-purpose tool for the working mathematician interested in rigidity theory. PyRigi is open source and easy to use, and awaits researchers to benefit from its computational potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the classical Blaschke Rolling Theorem to convex domains in Riemannian manifolds of bounded sectional curvature and arbitrary dimension. Our results are sharp and, in this sharp form, are new even in the model spaces of constant curvature.</description>
