      <title>Managing Credible Anonymous Identities in Web 3.0 Services: A Scalable On-Chain Admission Framework with Recursive Proof Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Web 3.0 platforms increasingly operate as \emph{service ecosystems} (e.g., DeFi, DAOs, and decentralized social applications) where \emph{admission control} and \emph{account provisioning} must be delivered as an always-on service under bursty demand. Service operators face a fundamental tension: enforcing Sybil resistance (one-person-one-account) while preserving user privacy, yet keeping on-chain verification cost and admission latency predictable at scale. Existing credential-based ZK admission approaches typically require per-request on-chain verification, making the provisioning cost grow with the number of concurrent joiners. We present \textbf{ZK-AMS}, a scalable admission and provisioning layer that bridges real-world \emph{Personhood Credentials} to anonymous on-chain service accounts. ZK-AMS combines (i) zero-knowledge credential validation, (ii) a \emph{permissionless} batch submitter model, and (iii) a decentralized, privacy-preserving folding pipeline that uses Nova-style recursive aggregation together with multi-key homomorphic encryption, enabling batch settlement with \emph{constant} on-chain verification per batch. We implement ZK-AMS end-to-end on an Ethereum testbed and evaluate admission throughput, end-to-end latency, and gas consumption. Results show stable verification cost across batch sizes and substantially improved admission efficiency over non-recursive baselines, providing a practical and cost-predictable admission service for large-scale Web 3.0 communities.</description>

      <title>Collection: UAV-Based Wireless Multi-modal Measurements from AERPAW Autonomous Data Mule (AADM) Challenge in Digital Twin and Real-World Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16163v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wireless dataset collected as part of the AERPAW Autonomous Aerial Data Mule (AADM) challenge, organized by the NSF Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless (AERPAW) project. The AADM challenge was the second competition in which an autonomous UAV acted as a data mule, where the UAV downloaded data from multiple base stations (BSs) in a dynamic wireless environment. Participating teams designed flight control and decision-making algorithms for choosing which BSs to communicate with and how to plan flight trajectories to maximize data download within a mission completion time. The competition was conducted in two stages: Stage 1 involved development and experimentation using a digital twin (DT) environment, and in Stage 2, the final test run was conducted on the outdoor testbed. The total score for each team was compiled from both stages. The resulting dataset includes link quality and data download measurements, both in DT and physical environments. Along with the USRP measurements used in the contest, the dataset also includes UAV telemetry, Keysight RF sensors position estimates, link quality measurements from LoRa receivers, and Fortem radar measurements. It supports reproducible research on autonomous UAV networking, multi-cell association and scheduling, air-to-ground propagation modeling, DT-to-real-world transfer learning, and integrated sensing and communication, which serves as a benchmark for future autonomous wireless experimentation.</description>

      <title>Edge Learning via Federated Split Decision Transformers for Metaverse Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) based wireless metaverse services offer an untethered, immersive experience to users, where the superior quality of experience (QoE) needs to be achieved under stringent latency constraints and visual quality demands. To achieve this, MEC-based intelligent resource allocation for virtual reality users needs to be supported by coordination across MEC servers to harness distributed data. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution, and can be combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to develop generalized policies across MEC-servers. However, conventional FL incurs transmitting the full model parameters across the MEC-servers and the cloud, and suffer performance degradation due to naive global aggregation, especially in heterogeneous multi-radio access technology environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Federated Split Decision Transformer (FSDT), an offline RL framework where the transformer model is partitioned between MEC servers and the cloud. Agent-specific components (e.g., MEC-based embedding and prediction layers) enable local adaptability, while shared global layers in the cloud facilitate cooperative training across MEC servers. Experimental results demonstrate that FSDT enhances QoE for up to 10% in heterogeneous environments compared to baselines, while offloadingnearly 98% of the transformer model parameters to the cloud, thereby reducing the computational burden on MEC servers.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Meta-Advisor for UAV Fleet Trajectory Design in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future vehicular networks require continuous connectivity to serve highly mobile users in urban environments. To mitigate the coverage limitations of fixed terrestrial macro base stations (MBS) under non line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, fleets of unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) can be deployed as aerial base stations, dynamically repositioning to track vehicular users and traffic hotspots in coordination with the terrestrial network. This paper addresses cooperative multi-agent trajectory design under different service areas and takeoff configurations, where rapid and safe adaptation across scenarios is essential. We formulate the problem as a multi-task decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and solve it using centralized training and decentralized execution with double dueling deep Q-network (3DQN), enabling online training for real-world deployments. However, efficient exploration remains a bottleneck, with conventional strategies like $\epsilon$-greedy requiring careful tuning. To overcome this, we propose the multi-agent meta-advisor with advisor override (MAMO). This framework guides agent exploration through a meta-policy learned jointly across tasks. It uses a dynamic override mechanism that allows agents to reject misaligned guidance when the advisor fails to generalize to a specific scenario. Simulation results across three realistic urban scenarios and multiple takeoff configurations show that MAMO achieves faster convergence and higher returns than tuned $\epsilon$-greedy baselines, outperforming both an advisor-only ablation and a single generalized policy. Finally, we demonstrate that the learned UABS fleet significantly improves network performance compared to deployments without aerial support.</description>

      <title>A Multihop Rendezvous Protocol for Cognitive Radio-based Emergency Response Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel Multihop Dual Modular Clock Algorithm (M-DMCA) for efficient node discovery in cognitive radio-based emergency response networks. M-DMCA supports dual-channel selection per timeslot and incorporates a three-way handshake mechanism to significantly reduce rendezvous time. Performance evaluation under a worst-case scenario with 20 nodes, asymmetric channel sets of size 20, channel similarity index (m) as 2, and high primary radio activity shows that M-DMCA achieves a 24% reduction in rendezvous time compared to the multihop Extended Modular Clock Algorithm (EMCA), outperforming existing rendezvous protocols.</description>

      <title>Towards Secure and Interoperable Data Spaces for 6G: The 6G-DALI Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of mobile networks, 6G, is expected to enable data-driven services at unprecedented scale and complexity, with stringent requirements for trust, interoperability, and automation. Central to this vision is the ability to create, manage, and share high-quality datasets across distributed and heterogeneous environments. This paper presents the data architecture of the 6G-DALI project, which implements a federated dataspace and DataOps infrastructure to support secure, compliant, and scalable data sharing for AI-driven experimentation and service orchestration. Drawing from principles defined by GAIA-X and the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA), the architecture incorporates components such as federated identity management, policy-based data contracts, and automated data pipelines. We detail how the 6G-DALI architecture aligns with and extends GAIA-X and IDSA reference models to meet the unique demands of 6G networks, including low-latency edge processing, dynamic trust management, and cross-domain federation. A comparative analysis highlights both convergence points and necessary innovations.</description>

      <title>Fast-MCS: A Scalable Open-Source Tool to Find Minimal Cut Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16686v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A network is represented as a graph consisting of nodes and edges. A cut set for a source-destination pair in a network is a set of elements that, when failed, cause the source-destination pair to lose connectivity. A Minimal Cut Set (MCS) is a cut set that cannot be further reduced while maintaining its status as a cut set. MCSs are crucial in identifying the critical elements in the network that have the most significant impact on failure. This work introduces Fast-MCS, an open-source, scalable tool for evaluating MCSs in large, complex networks. Additionally, we compare the computation time of Fast-MCS with the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Close-enough general routing problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles in monitoring missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a close-enough multi-UAV general routing problem (CEMUAVGRP) where a fleet of homogeneous UAVs conduct monitoring tasks containing nodes, each of which has its disk neighborhood, and edges, aiming to minimize the total distance. A two-phase iterative method is proposed, partitioning the CEMUAVGRP into a general routing phase where a satisfactory route including required nodes and edges for each UAV is obtained without considering the disk neighborhoods of required nodes, and a close-enough routing phase where representative points are optimized for each required node in the determined route. To be specific, a variable neighborhood descent (VND) heuristic is proposed for the general routing phase, while a second-order cone programming (SOCP) procedure is applied in the close-enough routing phase. These two phases are performed in an iterative fashion under the framework of an adaptive iterated local search (AILS) algorithm until the predefined termination criteria are satisfied. Extensive experiments and comparative studies are conducted, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed AILS-VND-SOCP algorithm and the superiority of disk neighborhoods.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Safe Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile networks require safe optimization to adapt to changing conditions in traffic demand and signal transmission quality, in addition to improving service performance metrics. With the increasing complexity of emerging mobile networks, traditional parameter tuning methods become too conservative or complex to evaluate. For the first time, we apply safe Bayesian optimization to mobile networks. Moreover, we develop a new safe collaborative optimization algorithm called CoSBO, leveraging information from multiple optimization tasks in the network and considering multiple safety constraints. The resulting algorithm is capable of safely tuning the network parameter online with very few iterations. We demonstrate that the proposed method improves sample efficiency in the early stages of the optimization process by comparing it against the SafeOpt-MC algorithm in a mobile network scenario.</description>

      <title>How Reliable is Your Service at the Extreme Edge? Analytical Modeling of Computational Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme Edge Computing (XEC) distributes streaming workloads across consumer-owned devices, exploiting their proximity to users and ubiquitous availability. Many such workloads are AI-driven, requiring continuous neural network inference for tasks like object detection and video analytics. Distributed Inference (DI), which partitions model execution across multiple edge devices, enables these streaming services to meet strict throughput and latency requirements. Yet consumer devices exhibit volatile computational availability due to competing applications and unpredictable usage patterns. This volatility poses a fundamental challenge: how can we quantify the probability that a device, or ensemble of devices, will maintain the processing rate required by a streaming service? This paper presents an analytical framework for computational reliability in XEC, defined as the probability that instantaneous capacity meets demand at a specified Quality of Service (QoS) threshold. We derive closed-form reliability expressions under two information regimes: Minimal Information (MI), requiring only declared operational bounds, and historical data, which refines estimates via Maximum Likelihood Estimation from past observations. The framework extends to multi-device deployments, providing reliability expressions for series, parallel, and partitioned workload configurations. We derive optimal workload allocation rules and analytical bounds for device selection, equipping orchestrators with tractable tools to evaluate deployment feasibility and configure distributed streaming systems. We validate the framework using real-time object detection with YOLO11m model as a representative DI streaming workload; experiments on emulated XED environments demonstrate close agreement between analytical predictions, Monte Carlo sampling, and empirical measurements across diverse capacity and demand configurations.</description>

      <title>Scalable Base Station Configuration via Bayesian Optimization with Block Coordinate Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable Bayesian optimization (BO) framework for dense base-station (BS) configuration design. BO can find an optimal BS configuration by iterating parameter search, channel simulation, and probabilistic modeling of the objective function. However, its performance is severely affected by the curse of dimensionality, thereby reducing its scalability. To overcome this limitation, the proposed method sequentially optimizes per-BS parameters based on block coordinate descent while fixing the remaining BS configurations, thereby reducing the effective dimensionality of each optimization step. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms naive optimization in dense deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Role of Common Randomness Replication in Symmetric PIR on Graph-Based Replicated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR), a user communicates with multiple servers to retrieve from them a message in a database, while not revealing the message index to any individual server (user privacy), and learning no additional information about the database (database privacy). We study the problem of SPIR on graph-replicated database systems, where each node of the graph represents a server and each link represents a message. Each message is replicated at exactly two servers; those at which the link representing the message is incident. To ensure database privacy, the servers share a set of common randomness, independent of the database and the user's desired message index. We study two cases of common randomness distribution to the servers: i) graph-replicated common randomness, and ii) fully-replicated common randomness. Given a graph-replicated database system, in i), we assign one randomness variable independently to every pair of servers sharing a message, while in ii), we assign an identical set of randomness variable to all servers, irrespective of the underlying graph. In both settings, our goal is to characterize the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum number of desired message symbols retrieved per downloaded symbol, and quantify the minimum amount of common randomness required to achieve the capacity. To this goal, in setting i), we derive a general lower bound on the SPIR capacity, and show it to be tight for path and regular graphs through a matching converse. Moreover, we establish that the minimum size of common randomness required for SPIR is equal to the message size. In setting ii), the SPIR capacity improves over the first, more restrictive setting. We show this through capacity lower bounds for a class of graphs, by constructing SPIR schemes from PIR schemes.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to QoSAware Load Balancing in 5G Cellular Networks under User Mobility and Observation Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient mobility management and load balancing are critical to sustaining Quality of Service (QoS) in dense, highly dynamic 5G radio access networks. We present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for autonomous, QoS-aware load balancing implemented end-to-end in a lightweight, pure-Python simulation environment. The control problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process in which the agent periodically adjusts Cell Individual Offset (CIO) values to steer user-cell associations. A multi-objective reward captures key performance indicators (aggregate throughput, latency, jitter, packet loss rate, Jain's fairness index, and handover count), so the learned policy explicitly balances efficiency and stability under user mobility and noisy observations. The PPO agent uses an actor-critic neural network trained from trajectories generated by the Python simulator with configurable mobility (e.g., Gauss-Markov) and stochastic measurement noise. Across 500+ training episodes and stress tests with increasing user density, the PPO policy consistently improves KPI trends (higher throughput and fairness, lower delay, jitter, packet loss, and handovers) and exhibits rapid, stable convergence. Comparative evaluations show that PPO outperforms rule-based ReBuHa and A3 as well as the learning-based CDQL baseline across all KPIs while maintaining smoother learning dynamics and stronger generalization as load increases. These results indicate that PPO's clipped policy updates and advantage-based training yield robust, deployable control for next-generation RAN load balancing using an entirely Python-based toolchain.</description>

Within this paradigm, federated fine-tuning (FFT) serves as a key enabler that allows distributed LLM agents to co-train an intelligent global LLM without centralizing local datasets. However, the FFT-enabled IoA systems remain vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, where adversaries can upload malicious updates to the server to degrade the performance of the aggregated global LLM. This paper proposes a graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP) attack, which exploits overheard benign updates to construct a feature correlation graph and employs a variational graph autoencoder to capture structural dependencies and generate malicious updates. A novel attack algorithm is developed based on augmented Lagrangian and subgradient descent methods to optimize malicious updates that preserve benign-like statistics while embedding adversarial objectives. Experimental results show that the proposed GRMP attack can substantially decrease accuracy across different LLM models while remaining statistically consistent with benign updates, thereby evading detection by existing defense mechanisms and underscoring a severe threat to the ambitious IoA paradigm.</description>

      <title>Refined Bayesian Optimization for Efficient Beam Alignment in Intelligent Indoor Wireless Environments</title>

Abstract: Future intelligent indoor wireless environments require fast and reliable beam alignment to sustain high-throughput links under mobility and blockage. Exhaustive beam training achieves optimal performance but is prohibitively costly. In indoor settings, dense scatterers and transceiver hardware imperfections introduce multipath and sidelobe leakage, producing measurable power across multiple angles and reducing the effectiveness of outdoor-oriented alignment algorithms. This paper presents a Refined Bayesian Optimization (R-BO) framework that exploits the inherent structure of mmWave transceiver patterns, where received power gradually increases as the transmit and receive beams converge toward the optimum. R-BO integrates a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate with a Matern kernel and an Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, followed by a localized refinement around the predicted optimum. The GP hyperparameters are re-optimized online to adapt to irregular variations in the measured angular power field caused by reflections and sidelobe leakage. Experiments across 43 receiver positions in an indoor laboratory demonstrate 97.7% beam-alignment accuracy within 10 degrees, less than 0.3 dB average loss, and an 88% reduction in probing overhead compared to exhaustive search. These results establish R-BO as an efficient and adaptive beam-alignment solution for real-time intelligent indoor wireless environments.</description>

      <title>Integrating HAPS, LEO, and Terrestrial Networks: A Cost-Performance Study for IoT Connectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work evaluates the potential of High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites as alternative or complementary systems to enhance Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. We first analyze the transmission erasure probability under different connectivity configurations, including only HAPS or LEO satellites, as well as hybrid architectures that integrate both aerial/spatial and terrestrial infrastructures. To make the analysis more realistic, we considered movement of LEO satellites regarding a fixed region, elevation angle between gateway and devices, and different fading models for terrestrial and non-terrestrial communication. We also analyze LR-FHSS (Long-Range Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) random access uplink technology as a potential use case for IoT connectivity, showing the scalability impact of the scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that HAPS can effectively complement sparse terrestrial networks and improve the performance of satellite-based systems in specific scenarios. Furthermore, considering the deployment and operational costs, respectively, CAPEX and OPEX, the economic analysis reveals that although HAPS exhibits higher costs, these remain within a comparable order of magnitude to LEO and terrestrial deployments. In addition, specific use cases, such as natural disasters, transform HAPS into a competitive technology for conventional infrastructures.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Network Management for Federated AI-as-a-Service: Cross-Domain Orchestration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To support the emergence of AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS), communication service providers (CSPs) are on the verge of a radical transformation-from pure connectivity providers to AIaaS a managed network service (control-and-orchestration plane that exposes AI models). In this model, the CSP is responsible not only for transport/communications, but also for intent-to-model resolution and joint network-compute orchestration, i.e., reliable and timely end-to-end delivery. The resulting end-to-end AIaaS service thus becomes governed by communications impairments (delay, loss) and inference impairments (latency, error). A central open problem is an operational AIaaS control-and-orchestration framework that enforces high fidelity, particularly under multi-domain federation. This paper introduces an assurance-oriented AIaaS management plane based on Tail-Risk Envelopes (TREs): signed, composable per-domain descriptors that combine deterministic guardrails with stochastic rate-latency-impairment models. Using stochastic network calculus, we derive bounds on end-to-end delay violation probabilities across tandem domains and obtain an optimization-ready risk-budget decomposition. We show that tenant-level reservations prevent bursty traffic from inflating tail latency under TRE contracts. An auditing layer then uses runtime telemetry to estimate extreme-percentile performance, quantify uncertainty, and attribute tail-risk to each domain for accountability. Packet-level Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate improved p99.9 compliance under overload via admission control and robust tenant isolation under correlated burstiness.</description>

      <title>AI-Paging: Lease-Based Execution Anchoring for Network-Exposed AI-as-a-Service</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) now deployed across multiple providers and model tiers, selecting the appropriate model instance at run time is increasingly outside the end user's knowledge and operational control. Accordingly, the 6G service providers are envisioned to play a crucial role in exposing AIaaS in a setting where users submit only an intent while the network helps in the intent-to-model matching (resolution) and execution placement under policy, trust, and Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. The network role becomes to discover candidate execution endpoints and selects a suitable model/anchor under policy and QoS constraints in a process referred here to as AI-paging (by analogy to cellular call paging). In the proposed architecture, AI-paging is a control-plane transaction that resolves an intent into an AI service identity (AISI), a scoped session token (AIST), and an expiring admission lease (COMMIT) that authorizes user-plane steering to a selected AI execution anchor (AEXF) under a QoS binding. AI-Paging enforces two invariants: (i) lease-gated steering (without COMMIT, no steering state is installed) and (ii) make-before-break anchoring to support continuity and reliability of AIaaS services under dynamic network conditions. We prototype AI-Paging using existing control- and user-plane mechanisms (service-based control, QoS flows, and policy-based steering) with no new packet headers, ensuring compatibility with existing 3GPP-based exposure and management architectures, and evaluate transaction latency, relocation interruption, enforcement correctness under lease expiry, and audit-evidence overhead under mobility and failures.</description>

      <title>AI Sessions for Network-Exposed AI-as-a-Service</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference is increasingly latency- and context-sensitive, yet today's AI-as-a-Service is typically consumed as an application-chosen endpoint, leaving the network to provide only best-effort transport. This decoupling prevents enforceable tail-latency guarantees, compute-aware admission control, and continuity under mobility. This paper proposes Network-Exposed AI-as-a-Service (NE-AIaaS) built around a new service primitive: the AI Session (AIS)-a contractual object that binds model identity, execution placement, transport Quality-of-Service (QoS), and consent/charging scope into a single lifecycle with explicit failure semantics. We introduce the AI Service Profile (ASP), a compact contract that expresses task modality and measurable service objectives (e.g., time-to-first-response/token, p99 latency, success probability) alongside privacy and mobility constraints. On this basis, we specify protocol-grade procedures for (i) DISCOVER (model/site discovery), (ii) AI PAGING (context-aware selection of execution anchor), (iii) two-phase PREPARE/COMMIT that atomically co-reserves compute and QoS resources, and (iv) make-before-break MIGRATION for session continuity. The design is standard-mappable to Common API Framework (CAPIF) style northbound exposure, ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) execution substrates, 5G QoS flows for transport enforcement, and Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) style analytics for closed-loop paging/migration triggers.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Rank Allocation for Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14406v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated their superiority and versatility in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), effectively adapting to various downstream tasks through further fine-tuning. Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising solution to address privacy and efficiency challenges in distributed training for PLMs on resource-constrained local devices. However, our measurements reveal two key limitations of FedPEFT: heterogeneous data across devices exacerbates performance degradation of low-rank adaptation, and a fixed parameter configuration results in communication inefficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose FedARA, a novel adaptive rank allocation framework for federated parameter-efficient fine-tuning of language models. Specifically, FedARA employs truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) adaptation to enhance similar feature representation across clients, significantly mitigating the adverse effects of data heterogeneity. Subsequently, it utilizes dynamic rank allocation to progressively identify critical ranks, effectively improving communication efficiency. Lastly, it leverages rank-based module pruning to automatically remove inactive modules, steadily reducing local computational cost and memory usage in each federated learning round. Extensive experiments show that FedARA consistently outperforms baselines by an average of 6.95% to 8.49% across various datasets and models under heterogeneous data while significantly improving communication efficiency by 2.40$ \times$. Moreover, experiments on various edge devices demonstrate substantial decreases in total training time and energy consumption by up to 48.90% and 46.95%, respectively.</description>

      <title>ReaCritic: Reasoning Transformer-based DRL Critic-model Scaling For Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) pose critical challenges for intelligent management due to the diverse user requirements and time-varying wireless conditions. These factors introduce significant decision complexity, which limits the adaptability of existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods. In many DRL algorithms, especially those involving value-based or actor-critic structures, the critic component plays a key role in guiding policy learning by estimating value functions. However, conventional critic models often use shallow architectures that map observations directly to scalar estimates, limiting their ability to handle multi-task complexity. In contrast, recent progress in inference-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown that generating intermediate reasoning steps can significantly improve decision quality. Motivated by this, we propose ReaCritic, a reasoning transformer-based critic-model scaling scheme that brings reasoning-like ability into DRL. ReaCritic performs horizontal reasoning over parallel state-action inputs and vertical reasoning through deep transformer stacks. It is compatible with a broad range of value-based and actor-critic DRL algorithms and enhances generalization in dynamic wireless environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaCritic improves convergence speed and final performance across various HetNet settings and standard OpenAI Gym control tasks. The code of ReaCritic is available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/ReaCritic.</description>

      <title>Software Testing at the Network Layer: Automated HTTP API Quality Assessment and Security Analysis of Production Web Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08242v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern web applications rely heavily on client-side API calls to fetch data, render content, and communicate with backend services. However, the quality of these network interactions (redundant requests, missing cache headers, oversized payloads, and excessive third-party dependencies) is rarely tested in a systematic way. Moreover, many of these quality deficiencies carry security implications: missing cache headers enable cache poisoning, excessive third-party dependencies expand the supply-chain attack surface, and error responses risk leaking server internals. In this study, we present an automated software testing framework that captures and analyzes the complete HTTP traffic of 18 production websites spanning 11 categories (e-commerce, news, government, developer tools, travel, and more). Using automated browser instrumentation via Playwright, we record 108 HAR (HTTP Archive) files across 3 independent runs per page, then apply 8 heuristic-based anti-pattern detectors to produce a composite quality score (0-100) for each site. Our results reveal a wide quality spectrum: minimalist server-rendered sites achieve perfect scores of 100, while content-heavy commercial sites score as low as 56.8. We identify redundant API calls and missing cache headers as the two most pervasive anti-patterns, each affecting 67% of sites, while third-party overhead exceeds 20% on 72% of sites. One utility site makes 2,684 requests per page load, which is 447x more than the most minimal site. To protect site reputations, all identities are anonymized using category-based pseudonyms. We provide all analysis scripts, anonymized results, and reproducibility instructions as an open artifact. This work establishes an empirical baseline for HTTP API call quality across the modern web and offers a reproducible testing framework that researchers and practitioners can apply to their own applications.</description>

      <title>COOPERTRIM: Adaptive Data Selection for Uncertainty-Aware Cooperative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative perception enables autonomous agents to share encoded representations over wireless communication to enhance each other's live situational awareness. However, the tension between the limited communication bandwidth and the rich sensor information hinders its practical deployment. Recent studies have explored selection strategies that share only a subset of features per frame while striving to keep the performance on par. Nevertheless, the bandwidth requirement still stresses current wireless technologies. To fundamentally ease the tension, we take a proactive approach, exploiting the temporal continuity to identify features that capture environment dynamics, while avoiding repetitive and redundant transmission of static information. By incorporating temporal awareness, agents are empowered to dynamically adapt the sharing quantity according to environment complexity. We instantiate this intuition into an adaptive selection framework, COOPERTRIM, which introduces a novel conformal temporal uncertainty metric to gauge feature relevance, and a data-driven mechanism to dynamically determine the sharing quantity. To evaluate COOPERTRIM, we take semantic segmentation and 3D detection as example tasks. Across multiple open-source cooperative segmentation and detection models, COOPERTRIM achieves up to 80.28% and 72.52% bandwidth reduction respectively while maintaining a comparable accuracy. Relative to other selection strategies, COOPERTRIM also improves IoU by as much as 45.54% with up to 72% less bandwidth. Combined with compression strategies, COOPERTRIM can further reduce bandwidth usage to as low as 1.46% without compromising IoU performance. Qualitative results show COOPERTRIM gracefully adapts to environmental dynamics, localization error, and communication latency, demonstrating flexibility and paving the way for real-world deployment.</description>
