      <title>First eigenvalue estimates on complete K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ (M,\omega_g) $ be a complete K\"ahler manifold of complex dimension $n$. We prove that if the holomorphic sectional curvature satisfies $\mathrm{HSC} \geq 2 $, then the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Laplacian on $(M,\omega_g)$ satisfies $$ \lambda_1 \geq \frac{320(n-1)+576}{81(n-1)+144}.$$ This result is established through a new Bochner-Kodaira type identity specifically developed for holomorphic sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>G\'eom\'etrie \`a l'infini des vari\'et\'es hyperk\"ahl\'eriennes toriques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that simply connected toric hyperK\"ahler metrics of finite topological type with maximal volume growth are generically quasi-asymptotically conical, which allows to compute explicitly their reduced $L^2$-cohomology groups. In the asymptotically conical case, we also provide a fine description of the geometry at infinity of their Taub-NUT deformations of order 1 in terms of a compactification by a manifold with corners, which allows us to show that those deformations are of bounded geometry, to estimate their curvature at infinity and their volume growth and to identify uniquely their tangent cone at infinity. In many instances, the dimension of this tangent cone at infinity is strictly smaller than the order of the volume growth.</description>

      <title>Topology of singular foliations of closed 1-forms on orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of the leaves of the singular foliation induced by a closed 1-form of Morse type on a compact orbifold. In particular, we establish criteria that characterize when all such leaves are compact, when they are non-compact, and how both types may coexist. As an application, we extend to the orbifold setting a celebrated result of Calabi, which provides a purely topological characterization of intrinsically closed harmonic 1-forms of Morse type.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the normalized second fundamental form $A$ of immersed $C^2$ hypersurface in a space form $(N^{n+1}, \bar g)$ is intrinsic provided $\sigma_{2k+1}(A)\neq 0$ for some $k\ge 1$. We also establish the intrinsicality of the normalized second fundamental form $A$ of $M^{n}=\partial\Omega$ for domain $ \Omega\subset N^{n+1}, \ n\ge 3$.</description>

      <title>A class of affine maximal surfaces with singularities and its relationship with minimal surface theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a global theory of affine maximal surfaces with singularities, which are called affine maximal maps and defined by Aledo--Mart\' inez--Mil\' an. In this paper, we define a special subclass of such surfaces other than improper affine fronts, called \emph{affine maxfaces}, and investigate their global properties with respect to certain notions of completeness. In particular, by applying Euclidean minimal surface theory, we show that ``complete'' affine maxfaces satisfy an Osserman-type inequality. Moreover, one can also observe that affine maxfaces are in a class that does not contain non-trivial improper affine fronts. We also provide examples of such surfaces which are related to Euclidean minimal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Closed vacuum static spaces with closed conformal vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims to classify closed vacuum static spaces with a non-Killing closed conformal vector field. We firstly provide several characterizations of the conditions under which the first derivative of the warping function fulfills the vacuum static equation. Then we establish an identity involving the characteristic function of a conformal vector field on a Riemannian manifold. As applications, we derive a rigidity theorem on closed Riemannian manifolds with a non-Killing closed conformal vector field under suitable conditions and classify closed vacuum static spaces admitting such a vector field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Hermitian geometrically formal metrics on compact complex manifolds, focusing on Dolbeault, Bott-Chern, and Aeppli cohomologies. We establish topological and cohomological obstructions to their existence and we provide a detailed analysis for compact complex surfaces, complex parallelisable solvmanifolds, and Calabi-Eckmann manifolds. We prove that the standard blow-up metric on any blow-up of a K\"ahler manifold is not geometrically formal, and that K\"ahler metrics with nonnegative curvature operator are necessarily geometrically formal.</description>

      <title>The space of rough Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a smooth connected manifold, we consider all possible locally elliptic and locally bounded measurable coefficient Riemannian metrics called rough Riemannian metrics. We equip this set with an extended metric which is connected if and only if the manifold is compact. We prove that this is a complete length extended metric space and the components on which the distance is finite are path-connected. Moreover, we identify the closure of smooth metrics in this space to be continuous metrics.</description>

      <title>p-Laplacians for Manifold-valued Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs extend traditional graphs by enabling the representation of N-ary relationships through higher-order edges. Akin to a common approach of deriving graph Laplacians, we define function spaces and corresponding symmetric products on the nodes and edges to derive hypergraph Laplacians. While this has been done before for Euclidean features, this work generalizes previous hypergraph Laplacian approaches to accommodate manifold-valued hypergraphs for many commonly encountered manifolds.</description>

      <title>Short-time existence of Lagrangian mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his paper `Conjectures on Bridgeland Stability', Joyce asked if one can desingularise the transverse intersection point of an immersed Lagrangian using JLT expanders such that one gets a Lagrangian mean curvature flow via the desingularisations. Begley and Moore answered this in the affirmative by constructing a family of desingularisations and showing that a certain limit along their flows satisfies LMCF along with convergence to the immersed Lagrangian in the sense of varifolds. We prove that there exists a solution with convergence in a stronger sense, using the notion of manifolds with corners and a-corners as introduced by Joyce. Our methods are a direct P.D.E. based approach, along the lines of the proof of short-time existence for network flow by Lira, Mazzeo, Pluda and Saez.</description>

      <title>Dynamic off-the-grid untangling of curves by Riemannian metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an improved strategy for point sources tracking in a temporal stack through an off-the-grid fashion, inspired by the Benamou-Brenier regularisation in the literature. We define a lifting of the problem in the higher-dimensional space of the roto-translation group. This allows us to overcome the theoretical limitation of the off-the-grid method towards tangled point source trajectories, thus enabling the reconstruction and untangling even from the numerical standpoint. We define accordingly a new regularisation based on the relaxed Reeds-Shepp metric, an approximation of the sub-Riemannian Reeds-Shepp metric, further allowing control on the local curvature of the recovered trajectories. Then, we derive some properties of the discretisation and prove a $\Gamma$-convergence result, fostering interest for practical applications of polygonal, B\'ezier, and piecewise geodesic discretisation. We finally test our proposed method on a localisation problem example, and give a fair comparison with the state-of-the-art off-the-grid method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the semilinear elliptic equation and inequality on pseudo-Hermitian manifolds. In particular, we first obtain a Liouville theorem for the equation $\Delta_b u+F(u)=0$ based on a generalized Jerison-Lee's formula. Next, we prove the nonexistence of a positive solution to the inequality $\Delta_b u+F(u)\leq 0$ under the volume estimate.</description>

      <title>On Information Geometry and Iterative Optimization in Model Compression: Operator Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever-increasing parameter counts of deep learning models necessitate effective compression techniques for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This paper explores the application of information geometry, the study of density-induced metrics on parameter spaces, to analyze existing methods within the space of model compression, primarily focusing on operator factorization. Adopting this perspective highlights the core challenge: defining an optimal low-compute submanifold (or subset) and projecting onto it. We argue that many successful model compression approaches can be understood as implicitly approximating information divergences for this projection. We highlight that when compressing a pre-trained model, using information divergences is paramount for achieving improved zero-shot accuracy, yet this may no longer be the case when the model is fine-tuned. In such scenarios, trainability of bottlenecked models turns out to be far more important for achieving high compression ratios with minimal performance degradation, necessitating adoption of iterative methods. In this context, we prove convergence of iterative singular value thresholding for training neural networks subject to a soft rank constraint. To further illustrate the utility of this perspective, we showcase how simple modifications to existing methods through softer rank reduction result in improved performance under fixed compression rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to generalize the Sobolev-type inequalities given by Guo-Phong-Song-Sturm and Guedj-T\^o from the case of functions to the framework of twisted differential forms. To this end, we establish certain estimates of heat kernels for differential forms with values in holomorphic vector bundles over compact K\"ahler manifolds. As applications of these estimates, we also prove a vanishing theorem and give certain $L^{q,p}$-estimates for the $\bar\partial$-operator on twisted differential forms.</description>

      <title>Equiangular lines via nodal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For given $\Delta&gt;0$ and $0&lt;\lambda&lt;3/\sqrt{2}$, we show that the maximum multiplicity that $\lambda$ can appear as the second largest eigenvalue of a connected graph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ is $O_{\Delta,\lambda}(1)$. This result answers a question due to Jiang, Tidor, Yao, Zhang and Zhao [Question 6.4, Ann. of Math. (2) 194 (2021), no. 3, 729-743] in the case of $0&lt;\lambda&lt;3/\sqrt{2}$, and consequently leads to improvements in their results on equiangular lines. Our proof is based on the concept of nodal domains of eigenfunctions. Indeed, we establish a multiplicity estimate in terms of maximum degree and cyclomatic number of the graph, via a novel construction of eigenfunctions with large number of nodal domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a decomposition of classical potentials into a conservative (gradient) component and a non-conservative component. The latter generalizes the curl component of the force in the three-dimensional case. The force is transformed into a differential $1$-form, known as the work form. This work form is decomposed into an exact (gradient) component and an antiexact component, which in turn generalizes the curl part of the force. The antiexact component is subsequently decomposed using the Frobenius theorem. This local decomposition is a useful tool for identifying the specific components of classical potentials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce nonlocal minimal surfaces on closed manifolds and establish a far-reaching Yau-type result: in every closed, $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold we construct infinitely many nonlocal $s$-minimal surfaces. We prove that, when $s\in (0,1)$ is sufficiently close to $1$, the constructed surfaces are smooth for $n=3$ and $n=4$, while for $n\ge 5$ they are smooth outside of a closed set of dimension $n-5$. Moreover, we prove surprisingly strong regularity and rigidity properties of finite Morse index $s$-minimal surfaces such as a "finite Morse index Bernstein-type result". These properties make nonlocal minimal surfaces ideal objects on which to apply min-max variational methods.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Dimension for Autonomous Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08001v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a curvature-dimension condition for autonomous Lagrangians on weighted manifolds, which depends on the Euler-Lagrange dynamics on a single energy level. By generalizing Klartag's needle decomposition technique to the Lagrangian setting, we prove that this curvature-dimension condition is equivalent to displacement convexity of entropy along cost-minimizing interpolations in an $L^1$ sense, and that it implies various consequences of lower Ricci curvature bounds, as in the metric setting. As examples we consider classical and isotropic Lagrangians on Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we generalize the horocyclic Brunn-Minkowski inequality to complex hyperbolic space of arbitrary dimension, and present a new Brunn-Minkowski inequality for contact magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres.</description>

      <title>A classification of Biconservative Hypersurfaces in the Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Lorentzian biconservative hypersurfaces for which the gradient of their mean curvature $H$ is lightlike, i.e. $\langle \gr H,\gr H\rangle=0$. We establish the non-existence of such hypersurfaces in the Minkowski spaces by conducting a rigorous analysis of both the Codazzi and Gauss equations.</description>

      <title>Circle packings and hyperbolic surfaces of finite type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper constructs hyperbolic polyhedral metrics via circle packings. We introduce the curvature of circles as a parameter to include all three types of constant curvature curves in the hyperbolic geometry. This provides a unified approach to producing polyhedral metrics for surfaces of broader topological types. The combinatorial total geodesic curvature serves as an effective tool for establishing the existence and uniqueness of the packing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the real spectrum compactification of character varieties of finitely generated groups in semisimple Lie groups. This provides a compactification with good topological properties, and we interpret the boundary points in terms of actions on building-like spaces. Among the applications we give a general framework guaranteeing the existence of equivariant harmonic maps in building-like spaces.</description>

      <title>On the residual Monge-Amp\`{e}re mass of plurisubharmonic functions, III: uniformly directional Lipschitz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to study the (residual) Monge-Amp\`{e}re mass of a plurisubharmonic function with an isolated unbounded locus. A general decomposition formula is obtained under the Sasakian structure of the unit sphere. In complex dimension two, we obtain an $L^{1}$-apriori estimate on the complex Monge-Amp\`{e}re operator. This induces an upper-bound estimate on the residual mass, provided with the uniform directional Lipschitz continuity. As an application, the zero mass conjecture is confirmed, if the function further separates the circular direction in its alternating part.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Estimation Accuracy of 5 Different Numerical ODE Solvers on 3 Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers are indispensable tools in various engineering domains, enabling the simulation and analysis of dynamic systems. In this work, we utilize 5 different numerical ODE solvers namely: Euler's method, Heun's method, Midpoint Method, Runge-kutta 4th order and ODE45 method in order to discover the answer of three wellknown case studies and compare their results by calculation of relative errors. To check for the validity of the estimations, the experimental data of previous literature have been compared with the data in this paper which shows a good accordance. We observe that for each of the case studies based on the behavior of the model, the estimation accuracy of the solvers is different. For the logistic population change as the first case study, the results of all solvers are so close to each other that only their solution cost can be considered for their superiority. For temperature change of a building as the second case study we see that in some especial areas the accuracy of the solvers is different and in general Midpoint ODE solver shows better results. As the last case study, market equilibrium price shows that none of the numerical ODE solvers can estimate its behavior which is due to its sudden changing nature.</description>

      <title>Prescribing hyperbolic bordered surfaces via combinatorial flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the fractional combinatorial Calabi flow for hyperbolic bordered surfaces. By Lyapunov theory, it is proved that the flow exists for all time and converges exponentially to a conformal factor that generates a hyperbolic surface whose lengths of boundary components are prescribed positive numbers. Furthermore, a generalized combinatorial Yamabe flow is introduced in the same geometry setting, with the long time existence and convergence established. This result yields an algorithm for searching bordered surfaces, which may accelerate convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Maximizing higher eigenvalues in dimensions three and above</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing the $k$-th eigenvalue functional over the class of absolutely continuous measures on a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $m\geq 3$.
  For dimensions $3 \leq m \leq 6$, we generalize the work of Karpukhin and Stern on the first eigenvalue, showing that the maximizing measures are realized by smooth harmonic maps into finite-dimensional spheres.
  For $m \geq 7$, the maximizing measures are again induced by harmonic maps, which may now exhibit singularities. We prove that $m-7$ is the optimal upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set. More precisely, for any $m \geq 7$, there exist maximizing harmonic maps on the $m$-dimensional sphere whose singular sets have any prescribed integer dimension up to $m - 7$.</description>

      <title>On graded and shifted notions, and thick morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the notions of $L_{\infty}$-, $P_{\infty}$-, and $S_{\infty}$-algebras (including "shifted" versions) in the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}$-graded setting. We also consider thick (microformal) morphisms and show how they work in such graded context.
  In particular, we show that a "shifted $S_{\infty}$-thick morphism" (which we introduce here) induces an $L_{\infty}$-morphism of shifted $S_{\infty}$-structures. The same holds for "shifted $P_{\infty}$-thick morphisms" and shifted $P_{\infty}$-structures, respectively.</description>

      <title>Linear and Regular Kepler-Manev Dynamics via Projective Transformations: A Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a geometric formulation for transforming nonconservative mechanical Hamiltonian systems and introduces a new method for regularizing and linearizing central force dynamics -- in particular, Kepler and Manev dynamics -- through a projective transformation. The transformation is formulated as a configuration space diffeomorphism (rather than a submersion) that is lifted to a cotangent bundle (phase space) symplectomorphism and used to pullback the original mechanical Hamiltonian system, Riemannian kinetic energy metric, and other key geometric objects. Full linearization of both Kepler and Manev dynamics (in any finite dimension) is achieved by a subsequent conformal scaling of the projectively-transformed Hamiltonian vector field. Two such conformal scalings are given, both achieving linearization. Arbitrary conservative and nonconservative perturbations are included, with closed-form solutions readily obtained in the unperturbed Kepler or Manev cases.</description>
