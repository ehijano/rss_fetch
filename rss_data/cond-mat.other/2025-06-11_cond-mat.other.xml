      <title>Quantum Dot Behaviour under the Influence of Non-Resonant Structured Laser Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study investigates and compares the impact of intense, non-diffractive, non-resonant structured laser beams with various intensity profiles on the properties of InAs/GaAs cylindrical quantum dot. The comparative study demon-strates that the different structured beams, having unique symmetries and hence properties, have significant effects on the confinement potentials and electron probability densities of the quantum dot. It is shown that the system is most sensitive to the intensity and peak position changes of the zeroth order Bessel beam. Drastic changes in the dressed confinement potentials and electron probability densities under the impact of the above-mentioned beams were demonstrated, which can lead to the usage of the following method in such applications, where the precise manipulation of the charge carrier location is required. This study provides new insights into the role of structured laser fields in quantum dot systems, offering possibilities for their use in advanced nanophotonics and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries in Shallow Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments have extended the concept of global symmetries in several directions, offering new perspectives across a wide range of physical systems. This work shows that generalized global symmetries naturally emerge in shallow water systems. In particular, we demonstrate that both global and gauge subsystem symmetries-previously studied primarily in exotic field theories-arise intrinsically in the dynamics of shallow water flows. A central result is that the local conservation of potential vorticity follows directly from the underlying gauge subsystem symmetries, revealing that the classic Kelvin circulation theorem is rooted in these symmetries. Notably, the associated charge algebra forms a Kac-Moody current algebra, with the level determined by the spatial variation of the Coriolis parameter. Beyond gauge symmetries, we also identify global subsystem symmetries, construct the corresponding Noether charges, and explore their potential applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalous slow-down of the bound state dynamics in a non-locally coupled quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additional hopping channels in a tight-binding lattice is known to introduce faster dynamics of a quantum mechanical particle. However, we show that in the case of a repulsively bound state, the dynamics becomes abnormally slow when next-nearest neighbor (NNN) hopping is allowed for the particles. We show that such slowing down occurs for some magic strength of the NNN hopping at which the bound state band exhibits a quasi-flatband feature. We reveal this anomalous dynamical behavior by analyzing the quench dynamics of two nearest neighbor (NN) spin excitations (magnons) on a ferromagnetic chain by allowing both NN and NNN couplings. By implementing digital quantum computing simulations on a NISQ device, we obtain such non-trivial signatures and complement the results with exact numerical calculations. Moreover, through perturbative arguments, we reveal that the slowing down is due to the destructive interference between different paths associated to the bound state dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Aharonov-Casher Phase: Topological or Geometric?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is demonstrated that the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase is a geometric phase that, in general, depends on the details of the closed path taken by a particle with a magnetic moment that is subject to an electric field. Consequently, it is not a topological phase. The proof of this statement is obtained by developing a counterexample that elucidates the dependence of the AC phase on the details of the path. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the particular example considered here, paths having an Abelian AC phase factor, also have an AC phase that is path-independent, whereas paths having a non-Abelian AC phase factor may have an AC phase that is path-dependent (i.e., not topological).</description>

      <title>Bi, Cr and Ag dopants in PbTe and SnTe: impact of the host band symmetry on doping properties by ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doping properties of Bi, Cr and Ag dopants in thermoelectric and topological materials PbTe and SnTe are analyzed based on density functional theory calculations in the local density approximations and the large supercell method. In agreement with experiment, in both PbTe and SnTe, Bi is a donor and Ag is an acceptor with a vanishing magnetic moment. In contrast, Cr is a resonant donor in PbTe, and an resonant acceptor in SnTe. We also consider the electronic structure of cation vacancies in PbTe and SnTe, since these abundant native defects induce $p$-type conductivity in both hosts. The quantitatively different impact of these dopants/defects on the host band structure of PbTe and SnTe (level energies, band splittings, band inversion, and a different level of hybridization between dopant and host states) is explained based on the group-theoretical arguments.</description>

      <title>Universal path decomposition of transfer and scattering matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04822v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a universal identity: any entry of a one-dimensional transfer or scattering matrix comprising N layers equals a coherent sum of 2**(N-1) directed paths representing wave patterns with pre-defined amplitude and phase evolutions. Treating those paths as analytic building blocks, we derive closed-form results for arbitrary stratified media - optical, acoustic, elastic, or electronic - without resorting to matrix products or recursion. The combinatorial construction of paths turns layered system design into rule-based path engineering, illustrated with a design example that offers a reinterpretation of the quarter-wavelength principle. We also quantify the computational speed-up of the path method over classical transfer-matrix chaining and showcase two more cross-disciplinary applications (site-response seismology and quantum superlattices). This paradigm replaces numerical sweeps that employ the transfer matrix method with physically-transparent path-construction rules; its applicability spans across physical disciplines and scales: from nanometer optical coatings to kilometer-scale seismic strata.</description>
