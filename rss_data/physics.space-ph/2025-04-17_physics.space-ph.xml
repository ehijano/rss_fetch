      <title>Trajectory Dispersion Control for Precision Landing Guidance of Reusable Rockets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is an engineering note, and formal abstract is omitted in accordance with the requirements of the journal. The main idea of this note is as follows. In endoatmospheric landing of reusable rockets, there exist various kinds of disturbances that can induce the trajectory dispersion. The trajectory dispersion propagates with flight time and ultimately determines landing accuracy. Therefore, to achieve high-precision landing, this note proposes a novel online trajectory dispersion control method. Based on a Parameterized Optimal Feedback Guidance Law (POFGL), two key components of the proposed method are designed: online trajectory dispersion prediction and real-time guidance parameter tuning for trajectory dispersion optimization. First, by formalizing a parameterized probabilistic disturbance model, the closed-loop trajectory dispersion under the POFGL is predicted online. Compared with the covariance control guidance method, a more accurate trajectory dispersion prediction is achieved by using generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansion and pseudospectral collocation methods. Second, to ensure computational efficiency, a gradient descent based real-time guidance parameter tuning law is designed to simultaneously optimize the performance index and meet the landing error dispersion constraint, which significantly reduces the conservativeness of guidance design compared with the robust trajectory optimization method. Numerical simulations indicate that the trajectory dispersion prediction method can achieve the same accuracy as the Monte Carlo method with smaller computational resource; the guidance parameter tuning law can improve the optimal performance index and meet the desired accuracy requirements through directly shaping the trajectory dispersion.</description>

      <title>Scaler rates from the Pierre Auger Observatory: a new proxy of solar activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modulation of low-energy galactic cosmic rays reflects interplanetary magnetic field variations and can provide useful information on solar activity. An array of ground-surface detectors can reveal the secondary particles, which originate from the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere. In this work, we present an investigation of the low-threshold rate (scaler) time series recorded in 16 years of operation by the Pierre Auger Observatory surface detectors in Malargue, Argentina. Through an advanced spectral analysis, we detected highly statistically significant variations in the time series with periods ranging from the decadal to the daily scale. We investigate their origin, revealing a direct connection with solar variability. Thanks to their intrinsic very low noise level, the Auger scalers allow a thorough and detailed investigation of the galactic cosmic-ray flux variations in the heliosphere at different timescales and can, therefore, be considered a new proxy of solar variability.</description>

      <title>Understanding the impact of satellites on radio astronomy observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio telescopes observe extremely faint emission from astronomical objects, ranging from compact sources to large scale structures that can be seen across the whole sky. Satellites actively transmit at radio frequencies (particularly at 10--20\,GHz, but usage of increasing broader frequency ranges are already planned for the future by satellite operators), and can appear as bright as the Sun in radio astronomy observations. Remote locations have historically enabled telescopes to avoid most interference, however this is no longer the case with dramatically increasing numbers of satellites that transmit everywhere on Earth. Even more remote locations such as the far side of the Moon may provide new radio astronomy observation opportunities, but only if they are protected from satellite transmissions. Improving our understanding of satellite transmissions on radio telescopes across the whole spectrum and beyond is urgently needed to overcome this new observational challenge, as part of ensuring the future access to dark and quiet skies.
  In this contribution we summarise the current status of observations of active satellites at radio frequencies, the implications for future astronomical observations, and the longer-term consequences of an increasing number of active satellites. This will include frequencies where satellites actively transmit, where they unintentionally also transmit, and considerations about thermal emission and other unintended emissions. This work is ongoing through the IAU CPS.</description>

      <title>Extended scenarios for solar radio emissions with downshifted electron beam plasma excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principle studies of radiative processes aimed at explaining the origin of type II and type III solar radio bursts raise questions on the implications of downshifted electron beam plasma excitations with frequency (slightly) below the plasma frequency ($\omega\lesssim\omega_{pe}$) in the generation of radio emissions. Unlike the beam-induced Langmuir waves ($\omega \gtrsim \omega_{pe}$) in the standard radio emission plasma model, the primary wave excitations of cooler and/or denser beams have predominantly downshifted frequencies. Broadbands of such downshifted excitations are also confirmed by in situ observations in association with terrestrial foreshock and electron beams (in contrast to narrowband Langmuir waves), but their involvement in radiative processes has not been examined so far. We revisit three radiative scenarios specific to downshifted primary excitations, and the results demonstrate their direct or indirect involvement in plasma radio emission. Downshifted excitations of an electron beam primarily play an indirect role, contributing to the relaxation to a plateau-on-tail still able to induce Langmuir beam waves that satisfy conditions for nonlinear wave-wave interactions leading to free radio waves. At longer time scales, the primary excitations can become predominantly downshifted, and then directly couple with the secondary (backscattered) Langmuir waves to generate the second harmonic of radio emissions. Two counterbeams are more efficient and lead to faster radiative mechanisms, involving counterpropagating downshifted excitations, which couple to each other and generate intense, broadband and isotropic radio spectra of downshifted second harmonics. Such a long-lasting (second) radio harmonic can thus be invoked to distinguish regimes with downshifted ($\omega \gtrsim \omega_{pe}$) primary excitations.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Dynamics Identification and Linearization of Orbital Problems using Koopman Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the Two-Body and Circular Restricted Three-Body Problems in the field of aerospace engineering and sciences is deeply important because they help describe the motion of both celestial and artificial satellites. With the growing demand for satellites and satellite formation flying, fast and efficient control of these systems is becoming ever more important. Global linearization of these systems allows engineers to employ methods of control in order to achieve these desired results. We propose a data-driven framework for simultaneous system identification and global linearization of the Circular, Elliptical and Perturbed Two-Body Problem as well as the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem around the L1 Lagrange point via deep learning-based Koopman Theory, i.e., a framework that can identify the underlying dynamics and globally linearize it into a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The linear Koopman operator is discovered through purely data-driven training of a Deep Neural Network with a custom architecture. This paper displays the ability of the Koopman operator to generalize to various other Two-Body systems without the need for retraining. We also demonstrate the capability of the same architecture to be utilized to accurately learn a Koopman operator that approximates the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem.</description>
