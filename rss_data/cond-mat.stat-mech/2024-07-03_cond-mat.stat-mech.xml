      <title>Fluctuation-Response Relation in Non-Equilibrium Systems and Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use dynamic equations to derive a relation between correlation functions and response or relaxation functions in many-body systems. The relation is very general and holds both in equilibrium, when the usual fluctuation-dissipation theorem is valid, and to linear order in an expansion about arbitrary non-equilibrium states, when it is not. We illustrate our results by discussing fluids, both in equilibrium and non-equilibrium states, as well as several active-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of dynamical observables in linear diffusions with time delay: a Riccati-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our current understanding of fluctuations of dynamical (time-integrated) observables in non- Markovian processes is still very limited. A major obstacle is the lack of an appropriate theoretical framework to evaluate the associated large deviation functions. In this paper we bypass this difficulty in the case of linear diffusions with time delay by using a Markovian embedding procedure that introduces an infinite set of coupled differential equations. We then show that the generating functions of current-type observables can be computed at arbitrary finite time by solving matrix Riccati differential equations (RDEs) somewhat similar to those encountered in optimal control and filtering problems. By exploring in detail the properties of these RDEs and of the corresponding continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs), we identify the generic fixed point towards which the solutions converge in the long-time limit. This allows us to derive the explicit expressions of the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), of the pre-exponential factors, and of the effective (or driven) process that describes how fluctuations are created dynamically. Finally, we describe the special behavior occurring at the limits of the domain of existence of the SCGF, in connection with fluctuation relations for the heat and the entropy production.</description>

      <title>Semi-Markov Processes in Open Quantum Systems. III. Large Deviations of First Passage Time Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-Markov process method is used to calculate large deviations of first passage time statistics of counting variables in open quantum systems. The core formula is an equation of poles. Although it also calculates large deviations of counting statistics of the same variables, the degrees of the equation are distinct with respect to the two statistics. Because the former is usually lower than the latter in the quantum case, analytical solutions for the first passage time statistics are possible. We illustrate these results via a driven two-level quantum system and apply them to explore quantum violations of the classical kinetic and thermodynamic uncertainty relations.</description>

      <title>Cost-time trade-off in diffusion with stochastic return: optimal resetting potential and Pareto front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resetting processes, where a system is regularly returned to a given state after a fixed or random duration, offer a simple strategy to generate non-equilibrium properties and optimize search operations. While earlier theoretical frameworks focused on instantaneous resetting, wherein the system is directly teleported to a resetting state, there is a growing interest in physical resetting mechanisms that involve a finite return time. In this paper, we present an exact thermodynamic analysis of a diffusing particle whose position is intermittently reset to a specific site by employing a stochastic return protocol with external confining trap. We derive a renewal formula for the joint distribution of the first-passage time and the work done in terms of the characteristic measures of the underlying process. Using this formula, we compute general expressions for the averages of the work done and the first-passage time for an arbitrary confining potential. We next focus on a family of potentials $U_R(x) \sim |x|^{m}$ with $m&gt;0$, and optimise, with respect to the potential shape, the expected first-passage time for a given value of the work done. The Pareto front associated with this optimisation is exactly obtained, along with the optimal resetting potentials. Finally, we use this to demonstrate a trade-off relation between the first-passage time and the work done.</description>

      <title>Long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced experimental capabilities to control nonlocal and power-law decaying interactions are currently fuelling intense research in the domain of quantum many-body physics. Compared to their counterparts with short-ranged interactions, long-range interacting systems display novel physics, such as nonlinear light cones for the propagation of information or inequivalent thermodynamic ensembles. In this work, we consider generic long-range open quantum systems in arbitrary dimensions and focus on the so-called strong long-range regime. We prove that in the thermodynamic limit local properties, captured by reduced quantum states, are described by an emergent non-interacting theory. Here, the dynamics factorizes and the individual constituents of the system evolve independently such that no correlations are generated over time. In this sense, long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting. This has significant implications for their relaxation behavior, for instance in relation to the emergence of long-lived quasi-stationary states or to the absence of thermalization.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Matching the Self-Consistent Expansion to Approximate the Modified Bessel Functions of the Second Kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-consistent expansion (SCE) is a powerful technique for obtaining perturbative solutions to problems in statistical physics but it suffers from a subtle problem - too much freedom! The SCE can be used to generate an enormous number of approximations but distinguishing the superb approximations from the deficient ones can only be achieved after the fact by comparison to experimental or numerical results. Here, we propose a method of using the SCE to a priori obtain uniform approximations, namely asymptotic matching. If the asymptotic behaviour of a problem can be identified, then the approximations generated by the SCE can be tuned to asymptotically match the desired behaviour and this can be used to obtain uniform approximations over the entire domain of consideration, without needing to resort to empirical comparisons. We demonstrate this method by applying it to the task of obtaining uniform approximations of the modified Bessel functions of the second kind, $K_\alpha(x)$.</description>

      <title>A mesoscopic theory for stochastic coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Ott-Antonsen ansatz for coupled oscillators provides a useful framework to work with deterministic systems in the thermodynamic limit, but remains just an approximation for stochastic models. In this paper, I construct a general mesoscopic description of finite-sized populations of stochastic coupled oscillators and apply it to study the stochastic Kuramoto model. From such a mesoscopic description it is possible to obtain the natural, multiplicative fluctuations of the oscillator ensemble. The analysis allows one to derive highly accurate, closed expressions for the stochastic Kuramoto model's order parameter for the first time. Moreover, it is possible to get novel insights into the system's fluctuations and the synchronization transition's critical exponents which were inaccessible before.</description>

      <title>Reflection and Transmission Amplitudes in a Digital Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how to measure in the setting of digital quantum simulations the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the one-dimensional scattering of a particle with a short-ranged potential. The main feature of the protocol is the coupling between the particle and an ancillary spin-1/2 degree of freedom. This allows us to reconstruct tomographically the scattering amplitudes, which are in general complex numbers, from the readout of one qubit. Applications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonians and the quasiparticle picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) provides the most comprehensive characterization of bipartite entanglement in many-body quantum systems. Ground states of local Hamiltonians inherit this locality, resulting in EHs that are dominated by local, few-body terms. Unfortunately, in non-equilibrium situations, analytic results are rare and largely confined to continuous field theories, which fail to accurately describe microscopic models. To address this gap, we present an exact analytic result for the EH following a generic quantum quench in non-interacting fermionic models. This derivation adapts the celebrated quasiparticle picture to the EH, providing detailed insights into its physical properties. The resulting analytic formula serves as a foundation for engineering EHs in quantum optics experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium steady state thermodynamics of a photodevice which can operate as a solar cell or a photoconductor, depending on the degree of asymmetry of the junction. The thermodynamic efficiency is captured by a single coefficient of performance. Using a minimal model, we show that when the electron repulsion energy matches the transport gap of the junction, the photoconductor displays maximal response, performance and signal-to-noise ratio, while the same regime is always detrimental for the solar cell. Nevertheless, we find that electron repulsion is beneficial for the solar cell if it lies below the transport gap. Our work sheds important light on design principles for thermodynamically efficient photodevices in the presence of interactions.</description>

      <title>Exceeding the maximum classical energy density in fully charged quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are anticipated to achieve significant advancements in energy storage capacity. In classical batteries, the energy density at each subsystem reaches its maximum value, denoted as $E_C$, which is determined by dividing the maximum energy by the number of subsystems. We demonstrate that this limit can be surpassed in quantum batteries by protocols of Quantum Energy Teleportaion (QET), allowing for the energy density at a subsystem to exceed the value of $E_C$. Our protocol offers enhanced efficiency, reduces experimental complexity on quantum computers, and enables instantaneous energy charging through Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). Leveraging quantum entanglement, this protocol significantly improves quantum energy storage systems, promising advances in quantum computing and new technological applications. This work represents a crucial step towards revolutionizing quantum energy storage and transfer.</description>

      <title>Memory Kernel Coupling Theory: Obtain Time Correlation Function from Higher-order Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01923v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical observables can often be described by time correlation functions (TCFs). However, efficiently calculating TCFs for complex quantum systems is a significant challenge, which generally requires solving the full dynamics of the systems. This Letter presents the memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT), a general formalism for evaluating TCFs. The MKCT builds upon Mori's memory kernel formalism for TCFs. Our theory further decomposes the memory kernel into auxiliary kernels. Rapid decay of auxiliary kernels allows us to truncate the coupled equations of motion with high accuracy. Notably, only higher-order moments are sufficient as the input for obtaining TCFs. While this formalism is general, we carry out the numerical demonstration for a typical open quantum system--the spin-boson model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marginal optima are minima or maxima of a function with many nearly flat directions. In settings with many competing optima, marginal ones tend to attract algorithms and physical dynamics. Often, the important family of marginal attractors are a vanishing minority compared with nonmarginal optima and other unstable stationary points. We introduce a generic technique for conditioning the statistics of stationary points in random landscapes on their marginality, and apply it in three isotropic settings with qualitatively different structure: in the spherical spin-glasses, where the energy is Gaussian and its Hessian is GOE; in multispherical spin glasses, which are Gaussian but non-GOE; and in sums of squared spherical random functions, which are non-Gaussian. In these problems we are able to fully characterize the distribution of marginal optima in the landscape, including when they are in the minority.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization seeks extremal points in a function. When there are superextensively many optima, optimization algorithms are liable to get stuck. Under these conditions, generic algorithms tend to find marginal optima, which have many nearly flat directions. In a companion paper, we introduce a technique to count marginal optima in random landscapes. Here, we use the statistics of marginal optima calculated using this technique to produce generic bounds on optimization, based on the simple principle that algorithms will overwhelmingly tend to get stuck only where marginal optima are found. We demonstrate the idea on a simple non-Gaussian problem of maximizing the sum of squared random functions on a compact space. Numeric experiments using both gradient descent and generalized approximate message passing algorithms fall inside the expected bounds.</description>

      <title>Dual Role for Heterogeneity in Dynamic Fracture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Are heterogeneous materials harder to break than homogeneous ones? Predicting rapid crack propagation in the presence of inhomogeneities remains a challenge. Linear perturbations leave the net speed of fracture unchanged. We obtain a nonlinear equation of motion for planar crack fronts to gain insight into the dynamic fracture of moderately heterogeneous solids. The coupling of the front geometry to the heterogeneity landscape renormalizes the energy dissipation and the crack velocity. In materials whose toughness is weakly sensitive to crack speed, such as silica glass, heterogeneity results in increased dissipation and slower crack propagation. However, heterogeneity has a reduced effect and may even facilitate fracture in strongly velocity-dependent materials.</description>

Abstract: The current/height fluctuation statistics of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality in 1+1 dimensions are sensitive to the initial state. We find that the averages over the initial states exhibit universal and scale-invariant patterns when conditioning on fluctuations. To establish universality of our findings we demonstrate scale invariance at different times and heights using large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) which belongs to the KPZ universality class. Here we focus on current/height fluctuations in the steady state regime described by the Baik-Rains distribution. The conditioned probability distribution of an initial state order parameter shows a transition from uni- to bimodal. Bimodality occurs for negative current/height fluctuations that are dominated by super-diffusive shock dynamics. It is caused by two possible point-symmetric shock profiles and the KPZ mirror symmetry breakdown. Similar surprising relations between initial states and fluctuations might exist in other universality classes as well.</description>

Abstract: A natural criticism of the optimal protocol of the irreversible work found for weakly driven processes is its experimental difficulty in being implementable due to its singular part. In this work, I explore the possibility of taking its continuous linear part as an acceptable near-optimal protocol. First, I prove that such a solution is the optimal protocol for non-singular admissible functions. I corroborate this result by observing successful comparisons with test protocols on six reasonable examples. Also, extending such analysis, I conclude that the error committed on this near-optimal protocol is considerable compared to the first-order singular approximation solution, except for sudden and slowly-varying processes. A conjecture is made about a general structure of a near-optimal protocol for systems under arbitrarily strong perturbations.</description>

      <title>Extracting Equations of Motion from Superconducting Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01926v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alternative computing paradigms open the door to exploiting recent innovations in computational hardware to probe the fundamental thermodynamic limits of information processing. One such paradigm employs superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to execute classical computations. This, though, requires constructing sufficiently complex superconducting circuits that support a suite of useful information processing tasks and storage operations, as well as understanding these circuits' energetics. First-principle circuit design, though, leads to prohibitive algebraic complications when deriving the effective equations of motion -- complications that to date have precluded achieving these goals, let alone doing so efficiently. We circumvent these complications by (i) specializing our class of circuits and physical operating regimes, (ii) synthesizing existing derivation techniques to suit these specializations, and (iii) implementing solution-finding optimizations which facilitate physically interpreting circuit degrees of freedom that respect physically-grounded constraints. This leads to efficient, practical circuit prototyping and access to scalable circuit architectures. The analytical efficiency is demonstrated by reproducing the potential energy landscape generated by the quantum flux parametron (QFP). We then show how inductively coupling two QFPs produces a device that is capable of executing 2-bit computations via its composite potential energy landscape. More generally, the synthesis methods detailed here provide a basis for constructing universal logic gates and investigating their thermodynamic performance.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of the quantum Mpemba effect in integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The highly complicated nature of far from equilibrium systems can lead to a complete breakdown of the physical intuition developed in equilibrium. A famous example of this is the Mpemba effect, which states that non-equilibrium states may relax faster when they are further from equilibrium or, put another way, hot water can freeze faster than warm water. Despite possessing a storied history, the precise criteria and mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon are still not known. Here we study a quantum version of the Mpemba effect that takes place in closed many body systems with a U(1) conserved charge: in certain cases a more asymmetric initial configuration relaxes and restores the symmetry faster than a more symmetric one. In contrast to the classical case, we establish the criteria for this to occur in arbitrary integrable quantum systems using the recently introduced entanglement asymmetry. We describe the quantum Mpemba effect in such systems and relate properties of the initial state, specifically its charge fluctuations, to the criteria for its occurrence. These criteria are expounded using exact analytic and numerical techniques in several examples, a free fermion model, the Rule 54 cellular automaton, and the Lieb-Liniger model.</description>

      <title>Persistent and anti-Persistent Motion in Bounded and Unbounded Space: Resolution of the First-Passage Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of temporal correlations in random movement trajectories is a widespread phenomenon across biological, chemical and physical systems. The ubiquity of persistent and anti-persistent motion in many natural and synthetic systems has led to a large literature on the modelling of temporally correlated movement paths. Despite the substantial body of work, little progress has been made to determine the dynamical properties of various transport related quantities, including the first-passage or first-hitting probability to one or multiple absorbing targets when space is bounded. To bridge this knowledge gap we generalise the renewal theory of first-passage and splitting probabilities to correlated discrete variables. We do so in arbitrary dimensions on a lattice for the so-called correlated or persistent random walk, the one step non-Markovian extension of the simple lattice random walk in bounded and unbounded space. We focus on bounded domains and consider both persistent and anti-persistent motion in hypercubic lattices as well as the hexagonal lattice. The discrete formalism allows us to extend the notion of the first-passage to that of the directional first-passage, whereby the walker must reach the target from a prescribed direction for a hitting event to occur. As an application to spatio-temporal observations of correlated moving cells that may be either repelled or attracted to hard surfaces, we compare the first-passage statistics to a target within a reflecting domain depending on whether an interaction with the reflective interface invokes a reversal of the movement direction or not. With strong persistence we observe multi-modality in the first-passage distribution in the former case, which instead is greatly suppressed in the latter.</description>

      <title>Non Gaussian statistics in static and dynamic Galton boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbing the arrangements of pegs on a static Galton board can result in non-trivial stationary distributions, which in the continuum limit correspond to departure from regular gaussian behavior. Two such distributions are obtained. Further, the distributions generated for a dynamic galton board under external forcing in a general direction are obtained by solution of the corresponding stochastic differential equations. Exact cumulant generating functions for the distribution are presented for forcing in one dimension. An approximate expression, correct to first order in the forcing amplitude, is presented for the case of two dimensions. Both cases show nontrivial departures from the static gaussian solution.</description>

      <title>Defect Solutions of the Non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model: Spirals and Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the defect solutions of the Non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model (NRCH). We find two kinds of defects, spirals with unit magnitude topological charge, and topologically neutral targets. These defects generate radially outward travelling waves and thus break the parity and time-reversal symmetry. For a given strength of non-reciprocity, spirals and targets with unique asymptotic wavenumber and amplitude are selected. We use large-scale simulations to show that at low non-reciprocity $\alpha$, a quenched disordered state evolves into quasi-stationary spiral networks. With increasing $\alpha$, we observe networks composed primarily of targets. Beyond a critical threshold $\alpha_c$, a disorder-order transition from defect networks to travelling waves emerges. The transition is marked by a sharp rise in the global polar order.</description>

      <title>Gaseous Diffusion as a Correlated Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean square displacement per collision of a molecule immersed in a gas at equilibrium is given by its mean square displacement between two consecutive collisions (mean square free path) corrected by a prefactor in the form of a series. The $n$-th term of the series is proportional to the mean value of the scalar product $\rb_1 \cdot \rb_{n}$, where $\rb_i$ is the displacement of the molecule between the $(i-1)$-th and $i$-th collisions. Simple arguments are used to obtain approximate expressions for each term. The key finding is that the ratio of consecutive terms in the series closely approximates the so-called mean persistence ratio. Exact expressions for the terms in the series are considered and their ratios for several consecutive terms are calculated for the case of hard spheres, showing an excellent agreement with the mean persistence ratio. These theoretical results are confirmed by solving the Boltzmann equation by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. By summing the series, the mean square displacement and the diffusion coefficient can be determined using only two quantities: the mean square free path and the mean persistence ratio. A simple and an improved expression for the diffusion coefficient $D$ are considered and compared with the so-called first and second Sonine approximations to $D$ as well as with computer simulations of the Boltzmann equation. It is found that the improved diffusion coefficient shows very good agreement with simulation results over all intruder and molecule mass ranges. When the intruder mass is smaller than that of the gas molecules, the improved formula even outperforms the first Sonine approximation.</description>

      <title>Learning protein-ligand unbinding pathways via single-parameter community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07103v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of biomolecular complexes, e.g., of protein-ligand (un)binding, requires the understanding of paths such systems take between metastable states. In MD simulation data, paths are usually not observable per se, but need to be inferred from simulation trajectories. Here we present a novel approach to cluster trajectories based on a community detection algorithm that requires the definition of only a single free parameter. Using the streptavidin-biotin complex as benchmark system and the A\textsubscript{2a} adenosine receptor in complex with the inhibitor ZM241385 as an elaborate application, we demonstrate how such clusters of trajectories correspond to pathways, and how the approach helps in the identification of reaction coordinates for a considered (un)binding process.</description>

      <title>How to compute efficiently the analytical solution to Heisenberg spin glass models on sparse random graphs and their de Almeida-Thouless line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Results regarding spin glass models are, to this day, mainly confined to models with Ising spins. Spin glass models with continuous spins exhibit interesting new physical behaviors related to the additional degrees of freedom, but have been primarily studied on fully connected topologies. Only recently some advancements have been made in the study of continuous models on sparse graphs. In this work we partially fill this void by introducing a method to solve numerically the Belief Propagation equations for systems of Heisenberg spins on sparse random graphs via a discretization of the sphere. We introduce techniques to study the finite-temperature, finite-connectivity case as well as novel algorithms to deal with the zero-temperature and large connectivity limits. As an application, we locate the de Almeida-Thouless line for this class of models and the critical field at zero temperature, showing the full consistency of the methods presented. Beyond the specific results reported for Heisenberg models, the approaches presented in this paper have a much broader scope of application and pave the way to the solution of strongly disordered models with continuous variables.</description>
