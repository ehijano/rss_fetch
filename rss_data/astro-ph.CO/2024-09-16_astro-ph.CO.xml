      <title>CHARM: Creating Halos with Auto-Regressive Multi-stage networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To maximize the amount of information extracted from cosmological datasets, simulations that accurately represent these observations are necessary. However, traditional simulations that evolve particles under gravity by estimating particle-particle interactions (N-body simulations) are computationally expensive and prohibitive to scale to the large volumes and resolutions necessary for the upcoming datasets. Moreover, modeling the distribution of galaxies typically involves identifying virialized dark matter halos, which is also a time- and memory-consuming process for large N-body simulations, further exacerbating the computational cost. In this study, we introduce CHARM, a novel method for creating mock halo catalogs by matching the spatial, mass, and velocity statistics of halos directly from the large-scale distribution of the dark matter density field. We develop multi-stage neural spline flow-based networks to learn this mapping at redshift z=0.5 directly with computationally cheaper low-resolution particle mesh simulations instead of relying on the high-resolution N-body simulations. We show that the mock halo catalogs and painted galaxy catalogs have the same statistical properties as obtained from $N$-body simulations in both real space and redshift space. Finally, we use these mock catalogs for cosmological inference using redshift-space galaxy power spectrum, bispectrum, and wavelet-based statistics using simulation-based inference, performing the first inference with accelerated forward model simulations and finding unbiased cosmological constraints with well-calibrated posteriors. The code was developed as part of the Simons Collaboration on Learning the Universe and is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/shivampcosmo/CHARM}.</description>

      <title>Caught in the cosmic web: environmental effects on subhalo abundance and internal density profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the high-resolution \Nbody{} cosmological simulation COLOR, we explore the cosmic web (CW) environmental effects on subhalo populations and their internal properties. We use \cactus{}, a new implementation of the state-of-the-art segmentation method \nexus{}, to delineate the simulation volume into nodes, filaments, walls, and voids. We group host halos by virial mass and segment each mass bin into consecutive CW elements. This reveals that subhalo populations in hosts within specific environments differ on average from the cosmic mean. The subhalo mass function is affected strongly, where hosts in filaments typically contain more subhalos (5 to 30\%), while hosts in voids are subhalo-poor, with 50\% fewer subhalos. We find that the abundance of the most massive subhalos, with reduced masses of $\mu\equiv M_\mathrm{sub}/M_{200}\geq0.1$ is most sensitive to the CW environment. A corresponding picture emerges when looking at subhalo mass fractions, $f_\mathrm{sub}$, where the filament hosts are significantly more `granular' (having higher $f_\mathrm{sub}$) than the cosmic mean, while the void hosts have much smoother density distributions (with $f_\mathrm{sub}$ lower by $10{-}40\%$ than the mean). Finally, when we look at the subhalo internal kinematic \vmax{}--\rmax{} relations, we find that subhalos located in the void and wall hosts exhibit density profiles with lower concentrations than the mean, while the filament hosts demonstrate much more concentrated mass profiles. Across all our samples, the effect of the CW environment generally strengthens with decreasing host halo virial mass. Our results show that host location in the large-scale CW introduces significant systematic effects on internal subhalo properties and population statistics. Understanding and accounting for them is crucial for unbiased interpretation of observations related to small scales and satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred project: Radio luminosity evolution from merger-induced shock fronts in simulated galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster mergers are believed to generate large-scale shock waves that are ideal sites for electron acceleration. We compute radio emission light curves for galaxy group and cluster mergers simulated in a cosmological context to study the dependence of radio luminosity on cluster mass, redshift, and impact parameter. We used model galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred project to identify cluster mergers characterised by the two main merging structures and follow their evolution throughout the simulated cosmic history. We found that the median non-thermal radio relic luminosity light curve produced in galaxy cluster mergers can be described by a skewed Gaussian function abruptly rising after core-passage of the secondary cluster that peaks after $\sim0.1-0.8\,$Gyr as a function of $M_{200,1}$, the mass of the primary, displaying a mass-dependent luminosity output increase of $\lesssim10$ to about $\gtrsim10-50$ times relative to the radio emission measured at core-passage for galaxy groups and clusters, respectively. In general, most merger orbits are fairly radial with a median opening angle of $\sim20^{\circ}$ before the collision. We also found that, independent of the cluster mass, less radial mergers tend to last longer, although the trend is weak. Finally, we found that the peak radio luminosity shows a significant correlation with mass, $P_{1.4}\propto M_{200,1}^{2.05}$, demonstrating that this relation holds all the way up from galaxy group scales to the most massive galaxy clusters. We conclude that cluster mass is the primary driver for radio `gischt' median luminosity, although there are significant variations for a given cluster mass. Our simulations suggest that the shock-driven, non-thermal radio emission observed on cluster outskirts are the result of massive galaxy cluster mergers at $z\lesssim1$, peaking at $z\sim0-0.5$.</description>

      <title>An Independent Measure of the Kinematic Dipole from SDSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) catalogs with precise spectroscopic redshifts to estimate the kinematic redshift dipole caused by the proper motion of the Solar system. We find that the velocity extracted from the kinematic dipole is consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background inferred values. Although the small sky coverage and limited number density of the SDSS sources constrain us from obtaining precise and robust measurements, we leverage the redshift dipole method to estimate the kinematic dipole. The velocity measurements in this study are insensitive to intrinsic clustering, associated with the source count dipole. The kinematic dipole measured in this work and its consistency with CMB values do not guarantee isotropy at large scales. The anisotropy (excess dipole) measured with the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and the WISE Catalog (CatWISE) could be due to the intrinsic distribution of galaxies. The results in this work focus solely on the kinematic dipole term.</description>

      <title>Redshift Drift fluctuations from N-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the redshift drift -- the real time variation of the redshift of distance sources -- are expected in the next couple of decades using next generation facilities such as the ANDES spectrograph at the ELT and the SKAO survey. The unprecedented precision of such observations will demand precise theoretical and numerical modeling of the effect in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this work, we use the Gadget4 $N$-body code to simulate the redshift drift and its fluctuations in $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies, deriving the corresponding power spectra from a simulation with $1024^3$ particles in a $1\textrm{Gpc}\,h^{-1}$ box. Our results provide an estimate for the distribution and amplitude of the fluctuations and the spectra, which match previous work in the literature using Einstein-Boltzmann solvers to within an order of magnitude. Our work provides a methodology for performing statistical analysis of the redshift drift effect and deriving its fluctuation power spectra from future large scale surveys.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole from domain wall fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain walls are topological defects produced by the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of discrete symmetry during cosmological phase transitions. The horizon-size domain wall can significantly contribute to the energy density in the late-evolution stage. We propose that the density perturbations from the fluctuations in the number density of the horizon-size domain wall could collapse to form primordial black holes. This mechanism becomes effective when the domain wall energy density ratio to that of the radiation reaches about 0.1 in the radiation-dominated universe. We find that models with $Z_2$ symmetry are excluded for interpreting pulsar timing array observations on the nano-Hz gravitational wave background since this model's domain wall number density fluctuations could lead to an overabundance of the primordial black holes. Moreover, models with $N\sim 10$ domain walls also suffer strong constraints from the overabundance of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>A Common Origin for Nano-Hz Gravitational Wave Background and Black Hole Merger Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential primordial connection between the black hole merger events detected by LIGO and the nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays. We propose an innovative mechanism for the formation of primordial black holes, suggesting that the Poisson fluctuations within the domain wall network can give rise to horizon-sized overdense regions. Our results indicate a plausible common origin for gravitational wave observations in two different frequency bands, potentially linked to the annihilation of the domain wall network at the QCD scale, while accounting for the accretion effects on primordial black holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bias potential induced by the QCD instanton effect may naturally facilitate the annihilation of the domain wall network during the QCD phase transition. Additionally, our scenario can yield the correct axion dark matter relic abundance, particularly if realized within the clockwork axion framework.</description>

      <title>Minimally coupled $\beta$-exponential inflation with an $R^2$ term in the Palatini formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the inflationary predictions of $\beta$-exponential potential models, in which the inflaton is a representation of the field delineating the size of extra-dimension. Since it offers a well-motivated starting point for the study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the Palatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates about the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This occurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the standard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by considering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the different scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal history after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r, \mathrm{d}n_s/\mathrm{d}\ln k$ of $\beta$-exponential potential with minimal coupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity. Also, different kinds of constraints from a variety of observations, such as BICEP/Keck, Planck 2018, as well as future possible detectable sensitivities that might be reached by CMB experiments: CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD are taken into account in this work. We indicate that our results are consistent with both the latest data and the future sensitivity forecasts of LiteBIRD/Planck and CMB-S4. Finally, the results in this study highlight the viability of our model even in the case of the existence of more stringent constraints expected from future achievable confidence level limits.</description>

      <title>Unveiling V Modes: Enhancing CMB Sensitivity to BSM Physics with a Non-Ideal Half-Wave Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background is expected to be vanishingly small in the $\Lambda$CDM model and, hence, usually ignored. Nonetheless, several astrophysical effects, as well as beyond standard model physics could produce it at a detectable level. A realistic half-wave plate - an optical element commonly used in CMB experiments to modulate the polarized signal - can provide sensitivity to V modes without significantly spoiling that to linear polarization. We assess this sensitivity for some new-generation CMB experiments, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, the ground-based Simons Observatory and a CMB-S4-like experiment. We forecast the efficiency of these experiments to constrain the phenomenology of certain classes of BSM models inducing mixing of linear polarization states and generation of V modes in the CMB. We find that new-generation experiments can improve current limits by 1-to-3 orders of magnitude, depending on the data combination. The inclusion of V-mode information dramatically boosts the sensitivity to these BSM models.</description>

      <title>Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resonant conversion of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons into axions within large-scale structure induces an anisotropic spectral distortion in CMB temperature maps. Applying state-of-the-art foreground cleaning techniques to $\textit{Planck}$ CMB observations, we construct maps of axion-induced "patchy screening" of the CMB. We cross-correlate these maps with data from the $\textit{unWISE}$ galaxy survey and find no evidence of axions. We constrain the axion-photon coupling, $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, at the 95% confidence level for axion masses in the range $10^{-13}~{\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-12}~{\rm eV}$. These constraints are competitive with the tightest astrophysical axion limits in this mass range and are inferred from robust population-level statistics, which makes them complementary to existing searches that rely on modeling of individual systems.</description>

      <title>Understanding posterior projection effects with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many modern applications of Bayesian inference, such as in cosmology, are based on complicated forward models with high-dimensional parameter spaces. This considerably limits the sampling of posterior distributions conditioned on observed data. In turn, this reduces the interpretability of posteriors to their one- and two-dimensional marginal distributions, when more information is available in the full dimensional distributions. We show how to learn smooth and differentiable representations of posterior distributions from their samples using normalizing flows, which we train with an added evidence error loss term, to improve accuracy in multiple ways. Motivated by problems from cosmology, we implement a robust method to obtain one and two-dimensional posterior profiles. These are obtained by optimizing, instead of integrating, over other parameters, and are thus less prone than marginals to so-called projection effects. We also demonstrate how this representation provides an accurate estimator of the Bayesian evidence, with log error at the 0.2 level, allowing accurate model comparison. We test our method on multi-modal mixtures of Gaussians up to dimension 32 before applying it to simulated cosmology examples. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mraveri/tensiometer.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Initial-Mass Function via Stellar Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar initial-mass function (IMF) represents a fundamental quantity in astrophysics and cosmology, describing the mass distribution of stars from low to very-high masses. It is intimately linked to a wide variety of topics, including stellar and binary evolution, galaxy evolution, chemical enrichment, and cosmological reionization. Nonetheless, the IMF still remains highly uncertain. In this work, we aim at determining the IMF with a novel approach based on the observed rates of transients of stellar origin. We parametrize the IMF with a simple, but flexible, Larson shape, and insert it into a parametric model for the cosmic UV luminosity density, local stellar mass density, type Ia supernova (SN Ia), core-collapse supernova (CCSN), and long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) rates as function of redshift. We constrain our free parameters by matching the model predictions to a set of empirical determinations for the corresponding quantities, via a Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method. Remarkably, we are able to provide an independent IMF determination, with characteristic mass $m_c=0.10^{+0.24}_{-0.08}\:M_{\odot}$, and high-mass slope $\xi=-2.53^{+0.24}_{-0.27}$, that is in accordance with the widely-used IMF parameterizations (e.g. Salpeter, Kroupa, Chabrier). Moreover, the adoption of an up-to-date recipe for the cosmic metallicity evolution, allows us to constrain the maximum metallicity of LGRB progenitors to $Z_{max}=0.12^{+0.29}_{-0.05}\:Z_{\odot}$. We also find what progenitor fraction actually leads to SN Ia or LGRB emission, put constraints on the CCSN and LGRB progenitor mass ranges, and test the IMF universality. These results show the potential of this kind of approach for studying the IMF, its putative evolution with galactic environment and cosmic history, and the properties of SN Ia, CCSN and LGRB progenitors, especially considering the wealth of data incoming in the future.</description>

      <title>The Large Magellanic Cloud: expanding the low-mass parameter space of dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) impacts the predicted signals in near-future direct detection experiments for non-standard dark matter (DM) interactions, using the Auriga cosmological simulations. We extract the local DM distribution of a simulated Milky Way-like halo that has an LMC analogue and study the expected signals in DarkSide-20k, SBC, DARWIN/XLZD, SuperCDMS, NEWS-G, and DarkSPHERE considering DM-nucleon effective interactions, as well as inelastic DM scattering. We find that the LMC causes substantial shifts in direct detection exclusion limits towards smaller cross sections and DM masses for all non-relativistic effective field theory (NREFT) operators, with the impact being highly pronounced for velocity-dependent operators at low DM masses. For inelastic DM, where the DM particle up-scatters to a heavier state, the LMC shifts the direct detection exclusion limits towards larger DM mass splitting and smaller cross sections. Thus, we show that the LMC significantly expands the parameter space that can be probed by direct detection experiments towards smaller DM-nucleon cross sections for all NREFT operators and larger values of mass splitting for inelastic DM.</description>

      <title>Towards Implementation of the Pressure-Regulated, Feedback-Modulated Model of Star Formation in Cosmological Simulations: Methods and Application to TNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional star formation subgrid models implemented in cosmological galaxy formation simulations, such as that of Springel &amp; Hernquist (2003, hereafter SH03), employ adjustable parameters to satisfy constraints measured in the local Universe. In recent years, however, theory and spatially-resolved simulations of the turbulent, multiphase, star-forming ISM have begun to produce new first-principles models, which when fully developed can replace traditional subgrid prescriptions. This approach has advantages of being physically motivated and predictive rather than empirically tuned, and allowing for varying environmental conditions rather than being tied to local Universe conditions. As a prototype of this new approach, by combining calibrations from the TIGRESS numerical framework with the Pressure-Regulated Feedback-Modulated (PRFM) theory, simple formulae can be obtained for both the gas depletion time and an effective equation of state. Considering galaxies in TNG50, we compare the "native" simulation outputs with post-processed predictions from PRFM. At TNG50 resolution, the total midplane pressure is nearly equal to the total ISM weight, indicating that galaxies in TNG50 are close to satisfying vertical equilibrium. The measured gas scale height is also close to theoretical equilibrium predictions. The slopes of the effective equations of states are similar, but with effective velocity dispersion normalization from SH03 slightly larger than that from current TIGRESS simulations. Because of this and the decrease in PRFM feedback yield at high pressure, the PRFM model predicts shorter gas depletion times than the SH03 model at high densities and redshift. Our results represent a first step towards implementing new, numerically calibrated subgrid algorithms in cosmological galaxy formation simulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Birefringence in Symmetron Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetron is a light scalar which provides a screening mechanism so as to evade the strong constraints from local gravity tests. In order to achieve this goal, a $Z_2$ symmetry is imposed on the symmetron model. In this paper, we introduce a new symmetron Chern-Simons-like gravitational interaction which is $Z_2$ invariant but breaks the parity symmetry explicitly. As a result, it is found that this coupling can generate gravitational wave (GW) amplitude birefringence when GWs propagate over the symmetron backgrounds. Due to the matter density difference, the symmetron profile changes significantly when entering the galaxy, so that we need to discuss the extra-galactic and galactic situations separately. On the one hand, the cosmological symmetron field follows the adiabatic solution, which induces a parity-violating GW amplitude correction with its exponent proportional to the GW frequency and the traveling distance. On the other hand, the symmetron takes the screening solution within the Milky Way, and the generated GW birefringence is only a function of the GW frequency. By further comparing these two contributions, we find that the extra-galactic symmetron field produces the dominant birefringence effects. Finally, with the latest GW data from LIGO-Virgo-Kagra, we place a reasonable constraint on the parity-violating coupling parameter in this symmetron model.</description>

      <title>Constraining matter bounce scenario from scalar-induced vector perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bouncing cosmologies, while offering a compelling alternative to inflationary models, face challenges from the growth of vector perturbations during the contracting phase. While linear vector instabilities can be avoided with specific initial conditions or the absence of vector degrees of freedom, we demonstrate the significant role of secondary vector perturbations generated by non-linear interactions with scalar fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that in a broad class of single-field matter bounce scenarios, these secondary vector perturbations inevitably get unacceptably large amplitudes, provided the curvature fluctuations are consistent with cosmic microwave background observations. This finding underscores the crucial importance of scalar-induced vector perturbations in bouncing cosmology and highlights the need for further investigation into their potential impact on the viability of these models.</description>

      <title>High-Energy and Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are capable of emitting extremely energetic particles independent of their interactions with the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate a particularly interesting scenario in which PBHs evaporating in the early universe may be responsible for some of the observed high-energy neutrinos above the TeV or PeV scale in the present universe. We compute the energy spectrum of neutrinos directly emitted by PBHs with a monochromatic mass function and estimate the wash-out point, which determines the maximum energy of the spectrum. We find that the spectrum generally extends to high energies following a power law of $E_{\nu}^{-3}$ until it reaches the wash-out point, which crucially depends on the PBH mass. For PBHs of $10^{13}$ grams, the spectrum can extend up to the PeV scale, though the flux is too low for detection. We also consider an indirect production mechanism involving dark particles that are emitted by PBHs and decay into neutrinos at a much later epoch. This mechanism allows lighter (such as those in the gram to kilogram range) PBHs to produce more energetic neutrino fluxes without being washed out by the thermal plasma in the early universe. In this scenario, we find that ultra-high-energy neutrinos around or above the EeV scale can be generated, with sufficiently high fluxes detectable by current and future high-energy neutrino observatories such as IceCube and GRAND.</description>

      <title>More is Different: Multi-Axion Dynamics Changes Topological Defect Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topological defects in multi-axion models arising from multiple Peccei-Quinn (PQ) scalars. Using a simplified two-axion system, we reveal fundamental differences in the evolution of these defects compared to single-axion scenarios. This finding is particularly significant because, despite the fact that integrating out heavier axions reduces these models to an effective single PQ scalar theory at low energies, the actual physical behavior of topological defects differs markedly from single-axion predictions. Unlike single-axion models where conventional cosmic strings form, multi-axion scenarios with post-inflationary or mixed initial conditions generically produce networks of strings interconnected by high-tension domain walls. This results in a severe cosmological domain wall problem. We determine string-wall network instability conditions and discuss cosmological implications including the application to the QCD axion and gravitational wave generation. Our findings highlight that multi-axion dynamics can lead to qualitatively different outcomes for topological defects, challenging the conventional picture of cosmic evolution of topological defects based on single-axion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chern-Simons gravity is known to suffer from graviton ghost production during inflation, which suppresses the parity-violating power spectrum at scales relevant to cosmic microwave background observations. In this work, we show that allowing the initial conditions of inflation to deviate from the standard Bunch-Davies state can enhance parity-violating non-Gaussianity in the scalar-tensor cross-bispectra. Our results reveal a significant additional contribution to the cross-bispectra in the flattened configuration, offering a new avenue to constrain parity-violating gravity.</description>

      <title>ANNZ+: an enhanced photometric redshift estimation algorithm with applications on the PAU Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ANNZ is a fast and simple algorithm which utilises artificial neural networks (ANNs), it was known as one of the pioneers of machine learning approaches to photometric redshift estimation decades ago. We enhanced the algorithm by introducing new activation functions like tanh, softplus, SiLU, Mish and ReLU variants; its new performance is then vigorously tested on legacy samples like the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) and Stripe-82 samples from SDSS, as well as modern galaxy samples like the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS). This work focuses on testing the robustness of activation functions with respect to the choice of ANN architectures, particularly on its depth and width, in the context of galaxy photometric redshift estimation. Our upgraded algorithm, which we named ANNZ+, shows that the tanh and Leaky ReLU activation functions provide more consistent and stable results across deeper and wider architectures with &gt; 1 per cent improvement in root-mean-square error ($\sigma_{\textrm{RMS}}$) and 68th percentile error ($\sigma_{68}$) when tested on SDSS data sets. While assessing its capabilities in handling high dimensional inputs, we achieved an improvement of 11 per cent in $\sigma_{\textrm{RMS}}$ and 6 per cent in $\sigma_{68}$ with the tanh activation function when tested on the 40-narrowband PAUS dataset; it even outperformed ANNZ2, its supposed successor, by 44 per cent in $\sigma_{\textrm{RMS}}$. This justifies the effort to upgrade the 20-year-old ANNZ, allowing it to remain viable and competitive within the photo-z community today. The updated algorithm ANNZ+ is publicly available at https://github.com/imdadmpt/ANNzPlus.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred: The existence of massive dark matter-deficient satellite galaxies in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of a massive galaxy with an extremely low dark matter content (i.e. NGC 1277) has posed questions about how such objects form and evolve in a hierarchical universe. We here report on the finding of several massive, dark matter-deficient galaxies in a set of 324 galaxy clusters theoretically modelled by means of full-physics hydrodynamical simulations. We first focus on two example galaxies selected amongst the most massive and dark matter-deficient ones. By tracing the evolution of these galaxies, we find that their lack of dark matter is a result of multiple pericentre passages. While orbiting their host halo, tidal interactions gradually strip away dark matter while preserving the stellar component. A statistical analysis of all massive satellite galaxies in the simulated clusters shows that the stellar-to-total mass ratio today is strongly influenced by the number of orbits and the distance at pericentres. Galaxies with more orbits and closer pericentres are more dark matter-deficient. Additionally, we find that massive, dark matter-deficient galaxies at the present day are either the remnants of very massive galaxies at infall or former central galaxies of infalling groups. We conclude that such massive yet dark matter-deficient galaxies exist and are natural by-products of typical cluster galaxy evolution, with no specific requirement for an exotic formation scenario.</description>

      <title>The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II. Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first 2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays, and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of these observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time, rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately every month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the band-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are 0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: We study conversion processes between gravitons and dark photons and reveal the effects of dark photons on the polarization of gravitational waves. Considering cosmological dark magnetic fields, we investigate the evolution of the intensity and polarization of gravitational waves through the conversion. Specifically, we demonstrate that for minimal coupling between gravitons and dark photons, the intensity, circular polarization, and linear polarization evolve separately. We derive explicit formulas for the statistical mean and variance of the intensity and polarization when the gravitational waves pass through magnetic fields with random orientation. The formulas capture how the initial polarization of dark photons will be imprinted on the observed gravitational wave background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accretion of matter onto primordial black holes (PBHs) during the dark ages and the subsequent energy injection in the medium should have left imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Recent works have claimed stringent CMB limits on the PBH abundance, hardly compatible with a PBH interpretation of the gravitational-wave observations of binary BH mergers. By using a more realistic accretion model based on hydrodynamical simulations and conservative assumptions for the emission efficiency, we show that CMB limits on the PBH abundance are up to two orders of magnitude less stringent than previously estimated between $10$ and $10^4$ M$_\odot$. This reopens the possibility that PBHs might explain at the same time (at least a fraction of) the dark matter, some of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binary BH mergers and the existence of super-massive BHs. More generally, we emphasize that PBH accretion can be a rather complex physical process with velocity dependences that are hard to assess, which introduces large uncertainties in accretion-based limits on the PBH abundance.</description>

Abstract: The redshifted 21cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn is expected to provide unprecedented insights into early Universe astrophysics and cosmology. Here we explore how dark matter can heat the intergalactic medium before the first galaxies, leaving a distinctive imprint in the 21cm power spectrum. We provide the first dedicated Fisher matrix forecasts on the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope to dark matter decays. We show that with 1000 hours of observation, HERA has the potential to improve current cosmological constraints on the dark matter decay lifetime by up to three orders of magnitude. Even in extreme scenarios with strong X-ray emission from early-forming, metal-free galaxies, the bounds on the decay lifetime would be improved by up to two orders of magnitude. Overall, HERA shall improve on existing limits for dark matter masses below $2$ GeV$/c^2$ for decays into $e^+e^-$ and below few MeV$/c^2$ for decays into photons.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) remain a viable dark matter candidate in the asteroid-mass range. We point out that in this scenario, the PBH abundance would be large enough for at least one object to cross through the inner Solar System per decade. Since Solar System ephemerides are modeled and measured to extremely high precision, such close encounters could produce detectable perturbations to orbital trajectories with characteristic features. We evaluate this possibility with a suite of simple Solar System simulations, and we argue that the abundance of asteroid-mass PBHs can plausibly be probed by existing and near-future data.</description>

Abstract: Superclusters, encompassing environments across a wide range of overdensities, can be regarded as unique laboratories for studying galaxy evolution. Although numerous supercluster catalogs have been published, none of them goes beyond redshift $z=0.7$. In this work, we adopt a physically motivated supercluster definition, requiring that superclusters should eventually collapse even in the presence of dark energy. Applying a friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm to the CAMIRA cluster sample constructed using the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey data, we have conducted the first systematic search for superclusters at $z=0.5-1.0$ and identified 673 supercluster candidates over an area of 1027 deg$^2$. The FoF algorithm is calibrated by evolving $N$-body simulations to the far future to ensure high purity. We found that these high-$z$ superclusters are mainly composed of $2-4$ clusters, suggesting the limit of gravitationally bound structures in the younger Universe. In addition, we studied the properties of the clusters and brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) residing in different large-scale environments. We found that clusters associated with superclusters are typically richer, but no apparent dependence of the BCG properties on large-scale structures is found. We also compared the abundance of observed superclusters with mock superclusters extracted from halo light cones, finding that photometric redshift uncertainty is a limiting factor in the performance of superclusters detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive observational constraints on an anisotropic $w$CDM model from observational data including Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs), Cosmic Chronometer (CC), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), Pantheon Plus (PP) compilation of Type Ia supernovae, and SH0ES Cepheid host distance anchors. We find that anisotropy is of the order $10^{-13}$, and its presence in the $w$CDM model reduces $H_0$ tension by $\sim 2\sigma$ and $\sim 1\sigma$ in the analyses with BAO+CC+BBN+PP and BAO+CC+BBN+PPSH0ES data combinations, respectively. In both analyses, the quintessence form of dark energy is favored at 95\% CL.</description>

      <title>A likelihood framework for cryogenic scintillating calorimeters used in the CRESST dark matter search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryogenic scintillating calorimeters are ultrasensitive particle detectors for rare event searches, particularly for the search for dark matter and the measurement of neutrino properties. These detectors are made from scintillating target crystals generating two signals for each particle interaction. The phonon (heat) signal precisely measures the deposited energy independent of the type of interacting particle. The scintillation light signal yields particle discrimination on an event-by-event basis. This paper presents a likelihood framework modeling backgrounds and a potential dark matter signal in the two-dimensional plane spanned by phonon and scintillation light energies. We apply the framework to data from CaWO$_4$-based detectors operated in the CRESST dark matter search. For the first time, a single likelihood framework is used in CRESST to model the data and extract results on dark matter in one step by using a profile likelihood ratio test. Our framework simultaneously fits (neutron) calibration data and physics (background) data and allows combining data from multiple detectors. Although tailored to CaWO$_4$-targets and the CRESST experiment, the framework can easily be expanded to other materials and experiments using scintillating cryogenic calorimeters for dark matter search and neutrino physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is unveiling astounding results about the first few hundred million years of life of the Universe, delivering images of galaxies at very high redshifts. Here, we develop a UV luminosity function model for high-redshift galaxies, considering parameters such as the stellar formation rate, dust extinction, and halo mass function. Calibration of this luminosity function model using UV luminosity data at redshifts z = 4-7 yields optimal parameter values. Testing the model against data at higher redshifts reveals successful accommodation of the data at z = 8-9, but challenges emerge at z~13. Our findings suggest a negligible role of dust extinction at the highest redshifts, prompting a modification of the stellar formation rate to incorporate a larger fraction of luminous objects per massive halo, consistently with similar recent studies. This effect could be attributed to mundane explanations such as unknown evolution of standard astrophysics at high redshift or to the existence of exotic objects at high redshift. We comment on this latter possibility.</description>

      <title>Silk Damping in Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves: A Novel Probe for New Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silk damping is well known in the study of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and accounts for suppression of the angular power spectrum of CMB on large angular multipoles. In this Letter, we study the effect of Silk damping on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). Resulting from the dissipation of cosmic fluid, the Silk damping notably suppresses the energy-density spectrum of SIGWs on scales comparable to a diffusion scale at the decoupling time of feebly-interacting particles. The effect offers a novel observable for probing the underlying particle interaction, especially for those mediated by heavy gauge bosons beyond the standard model of particles. We anticipate that pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to gauge bosons with mass $\sim10^{3}-10^{4}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, while space- and ground-based interferometers to those with mass $\sim10^7-10^{12}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, leading to essential complements to on-going and future experiments of high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>A power spectrum approach to the search for Axion-like Particles from resolved galaxy clusters using CMB as a backlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions or ALPs are hypothetical particles predicted by BSM theories, which make one of the dark matter candidates. These particles can convert into photons and vice-versa in the presence of magnetic field, with a probability decided by its coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$. One of the ways to detect these particles is using the CMB as a backlight. As the CMB photons pass through a galaxy cluster, they can get converted into ALPs in the mass range $10^{-15}$ eV to $10^{-11}$ eV through resonant conversion in the presence of cluster magnetic fields. This leads to a polarized spectral distortion ($\alpha$-distortion) in the CMB as the photon polarization parallel to the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster is involved in the conversion. The fluctuations in the magnetic field and electron density in a galaxy cluster lead to spatially varying $\alpha$-distortion around the cluster, with a power spectrum that is different from the lensed CMB polarization power spectrum for the standard model of cosmology. By measuring the difference in the polarization power spectrum around a galaxy cluster from the all-sky signal, one can find new $\alpha$-distortion in the sky. For galaxy clusters resolvable in multiple EM bands, one can measure the coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ from the ALP power spectrum. Using multi-frequency techniques like ILC to clean the foregrounds, we show that the new power spectrum-based approach of the resolved galaxy clusters from upcoming CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 can detect (or put constraints) on the ALP-photon coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 5.2 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ and $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 3.6 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ at 95\% C.I. respectively for ALPs of masses $10^{-13}$ eV or for smaller $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ for lighter ALP masses (Abridged).</description>

      <title>ELG Spectroscopic Systematics Analysis of the DESI Data Release 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16657v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) uses more than 2.4 million Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) for 3D large-scale structure (LSS) analyses in its Data Release 1 (DR1). Such large statistics enable thorough research on systematic uncertainties. In this study, we focus on spectroscopic systematics of ELGs. The redshift success rate ($f_{\rm goodz}$) is the relative fraction of secure redshifts among all measurements. It depends on observing conditions, thus introduces non-cosmological variations to the LSS. We, therefore, develop the redshift failure weight ($w_{\rm zfail}$) and a per-fibre correction ($\eta_{\rm zfail}$) to mitigate these dependences. They have minor influences on the galaxy clustering. For ELGs with a secure redshift, there are two subtypes of systematics: 1) catastrophics (large) that only occur in a few samples; 2) redshift uncertainty (small) that exists for all samples. The catastrophics represent 0.26\% of the total DR1 ELGs, composed of the confusion between O\,\textsc{ii} and sky residuals, double objects, total catastrophics and others. We simulate the realistic 0.26\% catastrophics of DR1 ELGs, the hypothetical 1\% catastrophics, and the truncation of the contaminated $1.31&lt;z&lt;1.33$ in the \textsc{AbacusSummit} ELG mocks. Their $P_\ell$ show non-negligible bias from the uncontaminated mocks. But their influences on the redshift space distortions (RSD) parameters are smaller than $0.2\sigma$. The redshift uncertainty of \Yone ELGs is 8.5 km/s with a Lorentzian profile. The code for implementing the catastrophics and redshift uncertainty on mocks can be found in https://github.com/Jiaxi-Yu/modelling_spectro_sys.</description>

      <title>Dispersion in the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant measurements from gravitational clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant ($H_0$) require us to estimate the distance and recession velocity of galaxies independently. Gravitational clustering that leads to the formation of galaxies and the large scale structure leaves its imprints in the form of peculiar velocities of galaxies. In general, it is not possible to disentangle the peculiar velocity component from the recession velocities of galaxies, and this introduces an uncertainty in the determination of $H_0$. Using N-body simulations, we quantify the impact of peculiar velocities on the $H_0$ estimation. We consider observers to be located in dark matter halos and compute the distribution of the estimated value of $H_0$ across all such observers. We find that the dispersion of this distribution is large at small scales, and it diminishes as we go to large separations, reaching the level of the quoted statistical error in Planck and SH0ES measurements well beyond $\sim$135 Mpc/h and $\sim$220 Mpc/h, respectively. Measurements at smaller scales are susceptible to errors arising from peculiar motions, and this error can propagate to measurements at larger scales in the distance ladder. Notably, we observe a negative correlation between the local over-density around an observer and the deviation of the local and the global value of $H_0$. We show that deviations more significant than 5% of the global values can be encountered frequently at scales of up to 40 Mpc/h, and this is considerably larger than the statistical errors on local estimates. We also analyse the cumulative effect of such errors on mock measurements of $H_0$ as measured from Milky Way-sized halos. We find that this error is sensitive to the lowest distance at which we use measurements. The distribution of $H_0$ in mock measurements has a large tail, and deviations of a few percent from the global value cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We do a detailed study on vortex formation in a magnetized plasma within the spacetime of a moving cosmic string using analytical and numerical methods. The conical spacetime around the cosmic string causes the frozen-in magnetic field to deform due to the fluid flow. We find that the overdensity in the wake region amplifies the magnetic field. This amplification depends on the direction and the lengthscale of the magnetic perturbations. Alfvens theorem of flux conservation explains this result. However, our study also shows that the magnetic field can decay depending on the perturbation lengthscale, due to the breakdown of Alfvens theorem at a certain lengthscale. This lengthscale is the gyroradius of the charged particles in the plasma. Our findings are significant for understanding magnetic reconnection in cosmic string wakes.</description>

Abstract: The Euclid mission is a visionary project undertaken by the European Space Agency (ESA) to probe the universe's evolution and geometry by surveying the position and gravitational shape distortion of billions of galaxies. These observations bear the potential to offer unprecedented measurements of the cosmological parameters, thereby advancing our understanding of the cosmos. This work revolves around the central theme of quantifying the constraining power of the upcoming Euclid 3$\times$2pt photometric survey, accounting for several factors which have been neglected to this date in the official forecasts, especially more subtle sources of uncertainty which need to be included in the forecast (and data) analysis due to the precision of the observations. First, we include and study the impact of super-sample covariance, a source of sample variance coming from the incomplete sampling of the density and shear field Fourier modes caused by the limited survey volume. Second, we examine the effect of scale cuts, translating them from Fourier to harmonic space through the use of the BNT transform, which offers an efficient way of separating angular scales for the cosmic shear signal. This analysis allows quantifying and mitigating the bias coming from the uncertainty on our modelling of small scales. These updated forecasts, validated against the reference Euclid ones, provide insights into the expected precision achieved on the cosmological and nuisance parameters, for a variety of survey settings and for the inclusion of different realistic systematics, such as multiplicative shear bias, magnification bias, uncertainty in the mean of the redshift distribution and so on.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new inflationary scenario driven by a slowly-rolling homogeneous scalar field whose potential $V\left(\varphi\right)$ is given by a generalized exponential function is investigated. Within the {\it slow-roll} approximation we obtain the main predictions of the model and compare them with current data from cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure observations. We show that this single scalar field model admits a wider set of solutions than usual exponential scenarios and predicts acceptable values of the spectral index, running of the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio for the remaining number of {\it e}-folds lying in the interval $N = 55 \pm 5$ and an energy scale on which $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$; in particular, we observe that the value of the model parameter $\kappa$ depends on the analysis. Finally, the primordial local non-Gaussianity is briefly discussed where we conclude that $k\gtrsim 0.02$ for $f_\text{NL}^\text{local} \ll 1$.</description>

      <title>Gradient corrections to the quantum effective action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the quantum effective action up to second order in gradients and up to two-loop order for an interacting scalar field theory. This expansion of the effective action is useful to study problems in cosmological settings where spatial or time gradients are important, such as bubble nucleation in first-order phase transitions. Assuming spacetime dependent background fields, we work in Wigner space and perform a midpoint gradient expansion, which is consistent with the equations of motion satisfied by the propagator. In particular, we consider the fact that the propagator is non-trivially constrained by an additional equation of motion, obtained from symmetry requirements. At one-loop order, we show the calculations for the case of a single scalar field and then generalise the result to the multi-field case. While we find a vanishing result in the single field case, the one-loop second-order gradient corrections can be significant when considering multiple fields. As an example, we apply our result to a simple toy model of two scalar fields with canonical kinetic terms and mass mixing at tree-level. Finally, we calculate the two-loop one-particle irreducible (1PI) effective action in the single scalar field case, and obtain a nonrenormalisable result. The theory is rendered renormalisable by adding two-particle irreducible (2PI) counterterms, making the 2PI formalism the right framework for renormalization when resummed 1PI two-point functions are used in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>The THESAN project: galaxy sizes during the epoch of reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate galaxy sizes at redshift $z\gtrsim 6$ with the cosmological radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulation suite THESAN(-HR). These simulations simultaneously capture the reionization of the large-scale intergalactic medium and resolved galaxy properties. The intrinsic size ($r^{\ast}_{1/2}$) of simulated galaxies increases moderately with stellar mass at $M_{\ast} \lesssim 10^{8}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ and decreases fast at larger masses, resulting in a hump feature at $M_{\ast}\sim 10^{8}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ that is insensitive to redshift. Low-mass galaxies are in the initial phase of size growth and are better described by a spherical shell model with feedback-driven gas outflows competing with the cold inflows. In contrast, massive galaxies fit better with the disk formation model. They generally experience a phase of rapid compaction and gas depletion, likely driven by internal disk instability rather than external processes. We identify four compact quenched galaxies in the $(95.5\,{\rm cMpc})^{3}$ volume of THESAN-1 at $z\simeq 6$, and their quenching follows reaching a characteristic stellar surface density akin to the massive compact galaxies at cosmic noon. Compared to observations, we find that the median UV effective radius ($R^{\rm UV}_{\rm eff}$) of simulated galaxies is at least three times larger than the observed ones at $M_{\ast}\lesssim 10^{9}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ or $M_{\rm UV}\gtrsim -20$ at $6 \lesssim z \lesssim 10$. This inconsistency, related to the hump feature of the intrinsic size--mass relation, persists across many other cosmological simulations with different galaxy formation models and demonstrates the potential of using galaxy morphology to constrain the physics of galaxy formation at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Cavity Detection of Gravitational Waves: Where Do We Stand?</title>

Abstract: High frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) are predicted in various exotic scenarios involving both cosmological and astrophysical sources. These elusive signals have recently sparked the interest of a diverse community of researchers, due to the possibility of HFGW detection in the laboratory through graviton-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields. Notable examples include the redesign of the resonant cavities currently under development to detect the cosmic axion. In this work, we derive the sensitivities of some existing and planned resonant cavities to detect a HFGW background. As a concrete scenario, we consider the collective signals that originate from the merging of compact objects, such as two primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid mass window. Our findings improve over existing work by explicitly discussing and quantifying the loss in the experimental reach due to the actual coherence of the source. We elucidate on the approach we adopt in relation with recent literature on the topic. Most notably, we give a recipe for the estimate of the stochastic background that focuses on the presence of the signal in the cavity at all times and showing that, in the relevant PBH mass region, the signal is dominated by coherent binary mergers.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. X-ray emission from the warm-hot phase gas in long cosmic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in cosmic filaments are among the least quantified units in modern astrophysics. The Spectrum Roentgen Gamma/eROSITA All Sky Survey ((SRG/eRASS) provides a unique opportunity to study the X-ray emission of the WHIM. We applied both imaging and spectroscopic stacking techniques to the data of the first four eRASS scans to inspect the X-ray emissions from 7817 cosmic filaments identified from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical galaxy samples. We obtained a $9\sigma$ significant detection of the total X-ray signal from filaments in the 0.3--1.2~keV band. Here, we introduce a novel method to estimate the contamination fraction from unmasked X-ray halos, active galactic nuclei, and X-ray binaries associated with filament galaxies. We found an approximately 40\% contamination fraction for these unmasked sources, suggesting that the remaining 60\% of the signal could be coming from the WHIM and a $5.4\sigma$ detection significance of the WHIM. Moreover, we modeled the temperature and baryon density contrast of the detected WHIM by fitting the stacked spectrum and surface brightness profile. The best-fit temperature $\log(T/\mathrm{K})=6.84\pm0.07$, obtained by using a single temperature model, is marginally higher than in the simulation results. This could be due to the fitting of a single temperature model on a multi-temperature spectrum. Assuming a 0.2 solar abundance, the best-fit baryon density contrast $\log\Delta_\mathrm{b}=1.88\pm0.18$ is in general agreement with the X-ray emitting phases in the IllustrisTNG simulation. This result suggests that the broadband X-ray emission traces the high end of the temperature and density values that characterize the entire WHIM population.</description>

      <title>Gravitational ringdown in the Minimal Theory of Massive Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on gravitational perturbations of black holes in the self-accelerating branch of the Minimal Theory of Massive Gravity (MTMG). This theory is a healthy extension of GR which displays the feature of massive tensor modes, without additional polarizations, strong-coupling issues nor requiring screening mechanisms. We proceed by implementing a newly developed technique that, instead of considering a second-order Schr\"odinger-like reformulation of perturbation equations, relies on a first-order formulation and solves it asymptotically, before numerically deriving the quasi-normal modes. We find that the black holes of MTMG are stable, and that their quasi-normal modes smoothly differ from the GR ones, for non-vanishing values of the graviton mass. This work hence confirms the fact that GR is a smooth limit of MTMG, and opens the exciting possibility of a clean test, performed for instance by the LISA detector.</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Starobinsky Inflation and the Species Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potentials in cosmological inflation often involve scalars with trans-Planckian ranges. As a result, towers of states become massless and their presence pushes the fundamental scale not to coincide with $M_{\rm P}$ but rather with the $species\, scale$, $\Lambda$. This scale transforms as an automorphic form of the theory's duality symmetries. We propose that the inflaton potential should be 1) an automorphic invariant form, non-singular over all moduli space, 2) depending only on $\Lambda$ and its field derivatives, and 3) approaching constant values in the large moduli to ensure a long period of inflation. These conditions lead to the proposal $V \sim \lambda(\phi, \phi^*)$, with $\lambda = G^{i\bar{j}} (\partial_i \Lambda)(\partial_{\bar{j}} \Lambda) / \Lambda^2$, determining the 'species scale convex hull'. For a single elliptic complex modulus with $SL(2, Z)$ symmetry, this results in an inflaton potential $V \simeq (\text{Im} \tau)^2 |\tilde{G}_2|^2 / N^2$, with $N \simeq -\log(\text{Im} \tau |\eta(\tau)|^4)$, where $\eta$ is the Dedekind function and $\tilde{G}_2$ the Eisenstein modular form of weight 2. Surprisingly, this potential at large modulus resembles that of the Starobinsky model. We compute inflation parameters yielding results similar to Starobinsky's, but extended to modular invariant expressions. Interestingly, the number of e-folds is proportional to the number of species in the tower, $N_e \simeq N$, and $\epsilon \simeq \Lambda^4$ at large moduli, suggesting that the tower of states plays an important role in the inflation process.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter (I): tr-symmetric metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are usually assumed to be described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr metrics, which however feature unwelcome singularities. We study the possibility that PBHs are non-singular objects, considering four phenomenological, regular tr-symmetric space-times, featuring either de Sitter or Minkowski cores. We characterize the evaporation of these PBHs and constrain their abundance from $\gamma$-ray observations. For three of the metrics, including the well-known Bardeen and Hayward ones, we show that constraints on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs, weaken with respect to the Schwarzschild limits, because of modifications to the PBH temperature and greybody factors. This moves the lower edge of the asteroid mass window down by up to an order of magnitude, leading to a much larger region of parameter space where PBHs can make up all the DM. A companion paper is instead devoted to non-tr-symmetric metrics, including loop quantum gravity-inspired ones. Our work provides a proof-of-principle for the interface between the DM and singularity problems being a promising arena with a rich phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: It is a common belief that a theory of quantum gravity should ultimately cure curvature singularities which are inevitable within General Relativity, and plague for instance the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, usually considered as prototypes for primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates. We continue our study, initiated in a companion paper, of non-singular objects as PBHs, considering three regular non-tr-symmetric metrics, all of which are one-parameter extensions of the Schwarzschild space-time: the Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times, with the latter two motivated by loop quantum gravity. We study evaporation constraints on PBHs described by these regular metrics, deriving upper limits on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. Compared to their Schwarzschild counterparts, these limits are weaker, and result in a larger asteroid mass window where all the DM can be in the form of PBHs. Our work demonstrates as a proof-of-principle that quantum gravity-inspired space-times can simultaneously play an important role in the resolution of singularities and in the DM problem.</description>
