      <title>Uncertainty quantification for seismic response using dimensionality reduction-based stochastic simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a stochastic simulator for seismic uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for performance-based earthquake engineering. The proposed simulator extends the recently developed dimensionality reduction-based surrogate modeling method (DR-SM) to address high-dimensional ground motion uncertainties and the high computational demands associated with nonlinear response history analyses. By integrating physics-based dimensionality reduction with multivariate conditional distribution models, the proposed simulator efficiently propagates seismic input into multivariate response quantities of interest. The simulator can incorporate both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties and does not assume distribution models for the seismic responses. The method is demonstrated through three finite element building models subjected to synthetic and recorded ground motions. The proposed method effectively predicts multivariate seismic responses and quantifies uncertainties, including correlations among responses.</description>

      <title>Entropy-based feature selection for capturing impacts in Earth system models with extreme forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a new entropy-based feature selection method for identifying and quantifying impacts. Here, impacts are defined as statistically significant differences in spatio-temporal fields when comparing datasets with and without an external forcing in Earth system models. Temporal feature selection is performed by first computing the cross-fuzzy entropy to quantify similarity of patterns between two datasets and then applying changepoint detection to identify regions of statistically constant entropy. The method is used to capture temperate north surface cooling from a 9-member simulation ensemble of the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption, which injected 10 Tg of SO2 into the stratosphere. The results estimate a mean difference decrease in near surface air temperature of -0.560 K with a 99% confidence interval between -0.864 K and -0.257 K between April and November of 1992, one year following the eruption. A sensitivity analysis with decreasing SO2 injection revealed that the impact is statistically significant at 5 Tg but not at 3 Tg. Using identified features, a dependency graph model composed of 68 nodes and 229 edges directly connecting initial aerosol optical depth changes in the tropics to solar flux and temperature changes before the temperate north surface cooling is presented.</description>
