      <title>General trends of electronic structures, superconducting pairing, and magnetic correlations in the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate $m$-layered superconductors La$_{m+1}$Ni$_{m}$O$_{3m+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the Ruddlesden-Popper layered nickelates La$_{m+1}$Ni$_m$O$_{3m+1}$ ($m = 1$ to 6) under pressure. Our results suggest that, while these Ruddlesden-Popper layered nickelates display many similarities, they also show noticeable differences. The Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals display bonding-antibonding, or bonding-antibonding-nonbonding, characteristic splittings, depending on the even or odd number of stacking layers $m$. In addition, the ratio of the in-plane interorbital hopping between $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and in-plane intraorbital hopping between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals was found to be large in La$_{m+1}$Ni$_m$O$_{3m+1}$ ($m = 1$ to 6), and this ratio increases from $m = 1$ to $m = 6$, suggesting that the in-plane hybridization will increase as the layer number $m$ increases. In contrast to the dominant $s^\pm$--wave state driven by spin fluctuations in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, two nearly degenerate $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and $s^\pm$-wave leading states were obtained in the four-layer stacking La$_5$Ni$_4$O$_{13}$ and five-layer stacking La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{16}$. The leading $s^\pm$-wave state was recovered in the six-layer material La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$. In general, at the level of the random phase approximation treatment, the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ decreases in stoichiometric bulk systems from the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to the six-layer La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$, despite the $m$ dependent dominant pairing. Both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic correlations are found to be quite complex. Within the in-plane direction, we obtained the peak of the magnetic susceptibility at ${\bf q} = (0.6 \pi, 0.6 \pi)$ for La$_5$Ni$_4$O$_{13}$ and La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$, and at ${\bf q} = (0.7 \pi, 0.7 \pi)$ for La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{16}$.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic analysis of coated conductors with ferromagnetic substrates: Novel insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic substrates can significantly influence the electromagnetic response of a coated conductor to an external magnetic field and transport current. This study analyzes this response theoretically using the thin shell integrodifferential model. First, assuming the substrate is strongly magnetic and the superconductor is in the Meissner state, we present the analytical solution in a convenient explicit form. This helps us to analyze the superconducting current density distributions, highlighting their differences from those in conductors with non-magnetic substrates. Secondly, for a superconducting layer characterized by a nonlinear current-voltage relation and a substrate with a finite field-independent magnetic permeability, we use an effective spectral numerical method to study the unique features of this hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet system, such as magnetization in a parallel external field and the peculiar nonmonotonic variation of loss observed when alternating transport current and parallel field are applied simultaneously. Dynamic losses for the case of a direct transport current and an alternating parallel field are also investigated. It is shown that tuning the phase and amplitude of the applied parallel field relative to those of the transport current can minimize AC losses.</description>

      <title>The compliance of the molecular hydride superconductor $BiH_4$ with the Migdal's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of near-room-temperature superconductivity in H3S sparked experimental and theoretical studies of highly compressed hydrides with the aim of obtaining room-temperature superconductivity. There are two dominant hydride classes where the search is ongoing: the first class is the covalently bonded hydrides (which is represented by H3S), and the second class is the clathrate-type hydrides (which is represented by LaH10, YH6, CaH6). Recently, the third class of superconducting hydrides, where the hydrogen remains its molecular form, has been discovered. This class is represented by BaH12 and BiH4. Here, we analyzed experimental data for the BaH12 and BiH4. We found that the BaH12 exhibits grains of an average size of 26 nm and a low level of microstrain 0.1%, in the range of 126 GPa &lt; P &lt; 160 GPa. We also derived the Debye $\Theta_D$ and Einstein $\Theta_E$ temperatures, and the electron-phonon coupling constant $\Lambda_{e-ph} $ in BaH12 and BiH4. The $\Lambda_{e-ph} $ in BiH4 significantly differs from the values obtained by first-principles calculations. The derived Fermi temperature $T_F = 20,000 K$ for BiH4 positions this molecular hydride between the unconventional and conventional superconductors bands in the Uemura plot. This position is outside of the band where covalently bonded and clathrate hydrides are located. The ratio $\Theta_D / T_F = 0.026 $ of BiH4 is typical for pure metals and A-15 alloys. This implies that the BiH4, is the first hydride superconductor which complains with the Migdal's theorem.</description>

      <title>Exact Duality at Low Energy in a Josephson Tunnel Junction Coupled to a Transmission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the low-energy behavior of a Josephson tunnel junction coupled to a finite-length, charge-biased transmission line and compare it to its flux-biased counterpart. For transmission lines of increasing length, we show that the low-energy charge-dependent energy bands of the charge-biased configuration can be exactly mapped onto those of the flux-biased system via a well-defined duality transformation of circuit parameters. In the limit of an infinitely long transmission line, the influence of boundary conditions vanishes, and both circuits reduce to a resistively shunted Josephson junction. This convergence reveals the system's intrinsic self-duality and critical behavior. Our exact formulation of charge-flux duality provides a foundation for generalizations to more complex superconductor-insulator phase transitions.</description>

      <title>The phase diagram of CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ for out-of-plane magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ ($T_{\textrm{c}} = 0.35\, \textrm{K}$) shows two superconducting (SC) phases, SC1 and SC2, when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the $c$ axis of the tetragonal unit cell. All experiments to date indicate that the change in SC order parameter detected at $\mu_{\textrm{0}}H^{*} \approx 4\, \textrm{T}$ is due to strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling at the Ce sites caused by the locally non-centrosymmetric environments of the otherwise globally centrosymmetric crystalline structure. Another phase (phase I) exists in this material below $T_{\textrm{0}} = 0.54\, \textrm{K}$. In a previous specific heat study [K. Semeniuk et al. Phys. Rev. B, $107$, L220504 (2023)] we have shown that phase I persists up to a field $\mu_{\textrm{0}}H_{0} \approx 6\, \textrm{T}$, larger than $H^{*}$. From thermodynamic arguments we expected the phase-I boundary line to cross phase SC2 at a tetracritical point. However, we could not find any signature of the phase-I line inside the SC2 phase and speculated that this was due to the fact that the $T_{0}(H)$ line is almost perpendicular to the $H$ axis and, therefore, invisible to $T$-dependent measurements. This would imply a weak competition between the two order parameters. Here, we report magnetic field dependent measurements of the magnetostriction and ac-susceptibility on high-quality single crystals. We see clear evidence of the singularity at $H_{0}$ inside the SC2 phase and confirm our previous prediction. Furthermore, we observe the transition across the $T^{*}(H)$ line in $T$-dependent specific heat measurements, which show that the $T^{*}(H)$ line is not perpendicular to the field axis, but has a positive slope. Our work supports recent $\mu$SR results which suggest coexistence of phase I with superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Classification of pair symmetries in superconductors with unconventional magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider unconventional magnets with proximity-induced superconductivity and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets under the influence of spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductivity induced by proximity effect. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as with $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave symmetries. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Superconducting dome and structural changes in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is of current research interest as a kagome metal with a superconducting transition temperature, $T_c\sim$7 K and higher temperature charge density wave (CDW) orders. Here we report electrical transport and X-ray diffraction measurements on LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ under pressure up to 65 GPa and 35 GPa respectively. The superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ first gets slightly enhanced and reaches a maximum $\sim$8.7 K at $\sim$8.5 GPa. With further applied pressure, $T_c$ is initially gradually suppressed, then more rapidly suppressed, followed by gradual suppression, revealing a superconducting dome. Two possible pressure-induced structural phase transitions are also observed at room temperature, from original hexagonal phase to another hexagonal structure above $\sim$11.5 GPa, and further to a structure with lower symmetry above $\sim$23.5 GPa. These transition pressures roughly correlate with features found in our pressure dependent transport data.</description>

      <title>Emergent quantum phase transition of a Josephson junction coupled to a high-impedance multimode resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment is a long-standing fundamental problem at the center of an intense debate, strongly revived by the advent of superconducting platforms with high-impedance multimode resonators. Here we investigate the emergent criticality of a junction coupled to a multimode resonator when the number of modes is increased. We demonstrate how the multimode environment renormalizes the Josephson and capacitive energies of the junction so that in the thermodynamic limit the charging energy dominates when the impedance is larger than the resistance quantum and is negligible otherwise, independently from the bare ratio between the two energy scales and the compact or extended nature of the phase of the junction. Via exact diagonalization, we find that the transition surprisingly stems from a level anticrossing involving not the ground state, but the first excited state, whose energy gap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. We clarify the nature of the two phases by pointing at a different behaviour of the ground and excited states and we show that at the transition point the spectrum displays universality not only at low frequencies. In agreement with recent experiments, we reveal striking spectral signatures of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Emergence of nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles across the transition from the pseudogap metal to the d-wave superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the pseudogap state of the hole- and electron-doped cuprates as a metal with hole and/or electron pocket Fermi surfaces. In the absence of long-range antiferromagnetism, such Fermi surfaces violate the Luttinger requirement of enclosing the same area as free electrons at the same density. Using the Ancilla theory of such a pseudogap state, we describe the onset of conventional $d$-wave superconductivity by the condensation of a charge e Higgs boson transforming as a fundamental under the emergent SU(2) gauge symmetry of a background $\pi$-flux spin liquid. In all cases, we find that the $d$-wave superconductor has gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles at 4 nodal points on the Brillouin zone diagonals with significant velocity anisotropy, just as in the BCS state. This includes the case of the electron-doped pseudogap metal with only electron pockets centered at wavevectors $(\pi, 0)$, $(0, \pi)$, and an electronic gap along the zone diagonals. Remarkably, in this case too, gapless nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles emerge within the gap at 4 points along the zone diagonals upon the onset of superconductivity.</description>
