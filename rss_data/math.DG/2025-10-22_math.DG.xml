      <title>Stable Bernstein Problem in certain positively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18079v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate stable Bernstein type theorems in certain positively curved ambient manifolds.
  In all dimensions, we prove that for any complete Riemannian manifold $(X^{n+1},g)$, if the Ricci curvature is non-negative and it positive BiRic curvature with $\alpha$-decay, then any complete, two-sided, stable minimal immersion must be totally geodesic and $\text{Ric}(\nu,\nu)$ vanish along the minimal immersion.
  For $4\leq n+1\leq 6$, we prove that the result still holds if $(X^{n+1},g)$ has uniform positive $3$-intermediate curvature and non-negative $(n-1)$-Ricci curvature, which generalize Chodosh-Li-Stryker's result \cite{chodosh2024complete} for $n+1=4$ to higher dimensions.
  As an immediate corollary, we show that, in all dimensions, for a complete Riemannian manifold $(X^{n+1},g)$, if it has uniform positive Ricci curvature and non-negative $(n-1)$-Ricci curvature then there is no (not necessarily) complete, two-sided, stable minimal immersion in $(X^{n+1},g)$.</description>

      <title>A remark on $\Lambda^2$-enlargeable manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we consider the case that the condition ``constant near infinity" in the definition of $\Lambda^2$-enlargeable manifold replaced by the condition ``locally constant near infinity" and prove that $\Lambda^2$-enlargeable manifold in the current sense also can not carry a complete Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature. As a consequence, we give another proof of Wang-Zhang's theorem on the generalized Geroch conjecture for complete spin manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18618v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we answer positively a question of Yau by proving the existence of closed minimal surfaces with negative induced curvature in any sphere of large dimension. The proof follows the strategy of Song, applying it to closed Riemann surfaces with large automorphism groups, and obtaining almost hyperbolic minimal surfaces.</description>

      <title>The algebra and the geometry aspect of Deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the foundations of deep learning through insight of geometry, algebra and differential calculus. At is core, artificial intelligence relies on assumption that data and its intrinsic structure can be embedded into vector spaces allowing for analysis through geometric and algebraic methods. We thrace the development of neural networks from the perceptron to the transformer architecture, emphasizing on the underlying geometric structures and differential processes that govern their behavior. Our original approach highlights how the canonical scalar product on matrix spaces naturally leads to backpropagation equations yielding to a coordinate free formulation. We explore how classification problems can reinterpreted using tools from differential and algebraic geometry suggesting that manifold structure, degree of variety, homology may inform both convergence and interpretability of learning algorithms We further examine how neural networks can be interpreted via their associated directed graph, drawing connection to a Quillen model defined in [1] and [13] to describe memory as an homotopy theoretic property of the associated network.</description>

      <title>Dihedral rigidity for submanifolds of warped product manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a dihedral extremality and rigidity theorem for a large class of codimension zero submanifolds with polyhedral boundary in warped product manifolds. We remark that the spaces considered in this paper are not necessarily warped product manifolds themselves. In particular, the results of this paper are applicable to submanifolds (of warped product manifolds) with faces that are neither orthogonal nor parallel to the radial direction of the warped product metric. Generally speaking, the dihedral rigidity results require the leaf of the underlying warped space to have positive Ricci curvature and the warping function to be strictly log-concave. Nevertheless, we prove a dihedral rigidity theorem for a large class of hyperbolic polyhedra, where the leaf of the underlying warped product space is flat and the warping function is not strictly log-concave.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic geometry at infinity of quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an approach developed by Melrose to study the geometry at infinity of the Nakajima metric on the reduced Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$, we show that the Nakajima metric on a quiver variety is quasi-asymptotically conical (QAC) whenever its defining parameters satisfy an appropriate genericity assumption. As such, it is of bounded geometry and of maximal volume growth. Being QAC is one of two main ingredients allowing us to use the work of Kottke and the second author to compute its reduced $L^2$-cohomology and prove the Vafa-Witten conjecture. The other is a vanishing theorem in $L^2$-cohomology for exact wedge $3$-Sasakian metrics generalizing a result of Galicki and Salamon for closed $3$-Sasakian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Cohomology for Linearized Boundary-Value Problems on General Riemannian Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for casting the solvability and uniqueness conditions of linearized geometric boundary-value problems in cohomological terms. The theory is designed to be applicable without assumptions on the underlying geometric structure and provides tools to study the emergent cohomology explicitly. To achieve this generality, we extend Hodge theory to sequences of Douglas--Nirenberg systems that interact via Green's formulae, overdetermined ellipticity, and a condition we call the order-reduction property, replacing the classical requirement that the sequence form a cochain complex. This property typically arises from linearized symmetries and constraints, as demonstrated in several examples, including exterior covariant derivatives, linearized prescribed Riemann curvature, and linearized Einstein equations with sources.</description>

      <title>An extension of the Floquet-Bloch theory to nilpotent groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting.
  As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand.
  We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a compact Hermitian surface is K\"ahler under certain non-positivity or non-negativity conditions on Strominger-Bismut-Ricci curvatures. The key tools for achieve these results are new Ricci curvature and Chern number identities for the Strominger-Bismut connection.

      <title>On FKM isoparametric hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{S}^n \times \mathbb{S}^n$ and new area-minimizing cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Via a new isoparametric foliation in $\mathbb{S}^n(1) \times \mathbb{S}^n(1)$, we find many new area-minimizing cones by applying Lawlor's curvature criterion, especially codimension-two area-minimizing cones in $\mathbb{R}^{2n+2}$ for $n\geq 63$. This new isoparametric foliation is a further restriction of the Ferus-Karcher-M\"unzner isoparametric foliation to $\mathbb{S}^n(1) \times \mathbb{S}^n(1) \subset \mathbb{S}^{2n+1}(\sqrt{2})$, which can also be defined on general $\mathbb{S}^n(a) \times \mathbb{S}^n(b)(a&gt;0,b&gt;0)$, and it extends the recent classification results of F. Urbano for $n=2$.</description>

      <title>Centralizers of Hamiltonian circle actions on rational ruled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the homotopy type of the group of equivariant symplectomorphisms of $S^2 \times S^2$ and $\mathbb{C}P^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{C}P^2}$ under the presence of Hamiltonian group actions of the circle $S^1$. We prove that the group of equivariant symplectomorphisms are homotopy equivalent to either a torus, or to the homotopy pushout of two tori depending on whether the circle action extends to a single toric action or to exactly two non-equivalent toric actions. This follows from the analysis of the action of equivariant symplectomorphisms on the space of compatible and invariant almost complex structures $\mathcal{J}^{S^1}_{\omega}$. In particular, we show that this action preserves a decomposition of $\mathcal{J}^{S^1}_{\omega}$ into strata which are in bijection with toric extensions of the circle action. Our results rely on $J$-holomorphic techniques, on Delzant's classification of toric actions and on Karshon's classification of Hamiltonian circle actions on $4$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>The truncated symbol of a differential symmetry breaking operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the truncated symbol $\mathrm{Symb}_0(\mathbb{D})$ of a differential symmetry breaking operator $\mathbb{D}$ between parabolically induced representations. This generalizes the symbol map $\mathrm{Symb}$, which is defined for the case of abelian nilpotent radicals, to the non-abelian setting. The inverse $\mathrm{Symb}_0^{-1}$ of the truncated symbol map $\mathrm{Symb}_0$ enables one to apply a recipe of the F-method for any nilpotent radical.
  As an application, we classify and construct differential intertwining operators $\mathcal{D}$ on the full flag variety $SL(3,\mathbb{R})/B$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ between Verma modules. It turned out that, surprisingly, Cayley continuants $\mathrm{Cay}_m(x;y)$ appeared in the coefficients of one of the five families of operators that we constructed. At the end, the factorization identities of the differential operators $\mathcal{D}$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ are also classified. Binary Krawtchouk polynomials $K_m(x;y)$ play a key role in the proof.</description>

      <title>Nonvanishing results for K\"ahler varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonvanishing theorems play a central role in birational geometry, since they derive geometric consequences from numerical information and constitute a crucial step towards abundance and semiampleness problems. General nonvanishing statements remain rare, especially in the K\"ahler setting.
  We present two types of nonvanishing results for compact K\"ahler varieties. First, on non-uniruled varieties with nonzero Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic, we prove nonvanishing for adjoint bundles of numerical dimension one on K\"ahler klt pairs, as well as nonvanishing for nef line bundles of numerical dimension one on $K$-trivial varieties. Second, on hyperk\"ahler manifolds we study line bundles $\mathcal L$ which are nef but not big, and establish a dichotomy: either nonvanishing holds for $\mathcal L$, or any closed positive current in the cohomology class of $\mathcal L$ has maximal Lelong components with a rather restricted geometry. We obtain much stronger abundance-type results in dimension $4$.</description>

      <title>Geometric Mechanics of Thin Periodic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin surfaces are ubiquitous in nature, from leaves to cell membranes, and in technology, from paper to corrugated containers. Structural thinness imbues them with flexibility, the ability to easily bend under light loads, even as their much higher stretching stiffness can bear substantial stresses. When surfaces have periodic patterns of either smooth hills and valleys or sharp origami-like creases this can substantially modify their mechanical response. We show that for any such surface, there is a duality between the surface rotations of an isometric deformation and the in-plane stresses of a force-balanced configuration. This duality means that of the six possible combinations of global in-plane strain and out-of-plane bending, exactly three must be isometries. We show further that stressed configurations can be expressed in terms of both the applied deformation and the isometric deformation that is dual to the pattern of stress that arises. We identify constraints rooted in symplectic geometry on the three isometries that a single surface can generate. This framework sheds new light on the fundamental limits of the mechanical response of thin periodic surfaces, while also highlighting the role that continuum differential geometry plays in even sharply creased origami surfaces.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate a priori estimates for the solution to the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem for a broad class of concave elliptic Hessian operators of the form \[ F(D^2u)=-\Lambda u \quad \textrm{in} \, \Omega, \qquad u=0 \quad \textrm{on} \, \partial \Omega. \] These operators encompass the Monge-Amp\`ere operator, the $k$-Hessian operators, and the $p$-Monge-Amp\`ere operators. We impose a fairly mild constraint on the operator $F$, allowing us to demonstrate the existence of the first nonzero eigenvalue and its corresponding $\Gamma$-admissible eigenfunction on the smooth, strictly $\Gamma$-convex domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Furthermore, we prove that the eigenfunction $u_{1}$ belongs to $C^{\infty}(\Omega) \cap C^{1,1}(\overline{\Omega})$. As an application, we prove that every invariant G\r{a}rding-Dirichlet operator admits a unique first nonzero eigenvalue.</description>
