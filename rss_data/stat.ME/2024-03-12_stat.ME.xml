      <title>Stochastic gradient descent-based inference for dynamic network models with attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Coevolving Latent Space Networks with Attractors (CLSNA) models, nodes in a latent space represent social actors, and edges indicate their dynamic interactions. Attractors are added at the latent level to capture the notion of attractive and repulsive forces between nodes, borrowing from dynamical systems theory. However, CLSNA reliance on MCMC estimation makes scaling difficult, and the requirement for nodes to be present throughout the study period limit practical applications. We address these issues by (i) introducing a Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) parameter estimation method, (ii) developing a novel approach for uncertainty quantification using SGD, and (iii) extending the model to allow nodes to join and leave over time. Simulation results show that our extensions result in little loss of accuracy compared to MCMC, but can scale to much larger networks. We apply our approach to the longitudinal social networks of members of US Congress on the social media platform X. Accounting for node dynamics overcomes selection bias in the network and uncovers uniquely and increasingly repulsive forces within the Republican Party.</description>

      <title>Sample Splitting and Assessing Goodness-of-fit of Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental and often final step in time series modeling is to assess the quality of fit of a proposed model to the data. Since the underlying distribution of the innovations that generate a model is often not prescribed, goodness-of-fit tests typically take the form of testing the fitted residuals for serial independence. However, these fitted residuals are inherently dependent since they are based on the same parameter estimates and thus standard tests of serial independence, such as those based on the autocorrelation function (ACF) or distance correlation function (ADCF) of the fitted residuals need to be adjusted. The sample splitting procedure in Pfister et al.~(2018) is one such fix for the case of models for independent data, but fails to work in the dependent setting. In this paper sample splitting is leveraged in the time series setting to perform tests of serial dependence of fitted residuals using the ACF and ADCF. Here the first $f_n$ of the data points are used to estimate the parameters of the model and then using these parameter estimates, the last $l_n$ of the data points are used to compute the estimated residuals. Tests for serial independence are then based on these $l_n$ residuals. As long as the overlap between the $f_n$ and $l_n$ data splits is asymptotically 1/2, the ACF and ADCF tests of serial independence tests often have the same limit distributions as though the underlying residuals are indeed iid. In particular if the first half of the data is used to estimate the parameters and the estimated residuals are computed for the entire data set based on these parameter estimates, then the ACF and ADCF can have the same limit distributions as though the residuals were iid. This procedure ameliorates the need for adjustment in the construction of confidence bounds for both the ACF and ADCF in goodness-of-fit testing.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Model-Agnostic Parameter Estimation Under Privacy-Preserving Post-randomization Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting individual privacy is crucial when releasing sensitive data for public use. While data de-identification helps, it is not enough. This paper addresses parameter estimation in scenarios where data are perturbed using the Post-Randomization Method (PRAM) to enhance privacy. Existing methods for parameter estimation under PRAM data suffer from limitations like being parameter-specific, model-dependent, and lacking efficiency guarantees. We propose a novel, efficient method that overcomes these limitations. Our method is applicable to general parameters defined through estimating equations and makes no assumptions about the underlying data model. We further prove that the proposed estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound, making it optimal in terms of asymptotic variance.</description>

      <title>A Class of Semiparametric Yang and Prentice Frailty Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yang and Prentice (YP) regression models have garnered interest from the scientific community due to their ability to analyze data whose survival curves exhibit intersection. These models include proportional hazards (PH) and proportional odds (PO) models as specific cases. However, they encounter limitations when dealing with multivariate survival data due to potential dependencies between the times-to-event. A solution is introducing a frailty term into the hazard functions, making it possible for the times-to-event to be considered independent, given the frailty term. In this study, we propose a new class of YP models that incorporate frailty. We use the exponential distribution, the piecewise exponential distribution (PE), and Bernstein polynomials (BP) as baseline functions. Our approach adopts a Bayesian methodology. The proposed models are evaluated through a simulation study, which shows that the YP frailty models with BP and PE baselines perform similarly to the generator parametric model of the data. We apply the models in two real data sets.</description>

      <title>Joint Modeling of Longitudinal Measurements and Time-to-event Outcomes Using BUGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to provide an introduction to the principles of Bayesian joint modeling of longitudinal measurements and time-to-event outcomes, as well as model implementation using the BUGS language syntax. This syntax can be executed directly using OpenBUGS or by utilizing convenient functions to invoke OpenBUGS and JAGS from R software. In this paper, all details of joint models are provided, ranging from simple to more advanced models. The presentation started with the joint modeling of a Gaussian longitudinal marker and time-to-event outcome. The implementation of the Bayesian paradigm of the model is reviewed. The strategies for simulating data from the JM are also discussed. A proportional hazard model with various forms of baseline hazards, along with the discussion of all possible association structures between the two sub-models are taken into consideration. The paper covers joint models with multivariate longitudinal measurements, zero-inflated longitudinal measurements, competing risks, and time-to-event with cure fraction. The models are illustrated by the analyses of several real data sets. All simulated and real data and code are available at \url{https://github.com/tbaghfalaki/JM-with-BUGS-and-JAGS}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of machine learning models using human-labeled validation data can be expensive and time-consuming. AI-labeled synthetic data can be used to decrease the number of human annotations required for this purpose in a process called autoevaluation. We suggest efficient and statistically principled algorithms for this purpose that improve sample efficiency while remaining unbiased. These algorithms increase the effective human-labeled sample size by up to 50% on experiments with GPT-4.</description>

      <title>The Cram Method for Efficient Simultaneous Learning and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the "cram" method, a general and efficient approach to simultaneous learning and evaluation using a generic machine learning (ML) algorithm. In a single pass of batched data, the proposed method repeatedly trains an ML algorithm and tests its empirical performance. Because it utilizes the entire sample for both learning and evaluation, cramming is significantly more data-efficient than sample-splitting. The cram method also naturally accommodates online learning algorithms, making its implementation computationally efficient. To demonstrate the power of the cram method, we consider the standard policy learning setting where cramming is applied to the same data to both develop an individualized treatment rule (ITR) and estimate the average outcome that would result if the learned ITR were to be deployed. We show that under a minimal set of assumptions, the resulting crammed evaluation estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. While our asymptotic results require a relatively weak stabilization condition of ML algorithm, we develop a simple, generic method that can be used with any policy learning algorithm to satisfy this condition. Our extensive simulation studies show that, when compared to sample-splitting, cramming reduces the evaluation standard error by more than 40% while improving the performance of learned policy. We also apply the cram method to a randomized clinical trial to demonstrate its applicability to real-world problems. Finally, we briefly discuss future extensions of the cram method to other learning and evaluation settings.</description>

      <title>Shrinkage MMSE estimators of covariances beyond the zero-mean and stationary variance assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle covariance estimation in low-sample scenarios, employing a structured covariance matrix with shrinkage methods. These involve convexly combining a low-bias/high-variance empirical estimate with a biased regularization estimator, striking a bias-variance trade-off. Literature provides optimal settings of the regularization amount through risk minimization between the true covariance and its shrunk counterpart. Such estimators were derived for zero-mean statistics with i.i.d. diagonal regularization matrices accounting for the average sample variance solely. We extend these results to regularization matrices accounting for the sample variances both for centered and non-centered samples. In the latter case, the empirical estimate of the true mean is incorporated into our shrinkage estimators. Introducing confidence weights into the statistics also enhance estimator robustness against outliers. We compare our estimators to other shrinkage methods both on numerical simulations and on real data to solve a detection problem in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Partial Identification of Individual-Level Parameters Using Aggregate Data in a Nonparametric Binary Outcome Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the relationship between variables at the individual level can be different from the relationship between those same variables aggregated over individuals. This problem of aggregation becomes relevant when the researcher wants to learn individual-level relationships, but only has access to data that has been aggregated. In this paper, I develop a methodology to partially identify linear combinations of conditional average outcomes from aggregate data when the outcome of interest is binary, while imposing as few restrictions on the underlying data generating process as possible. I construct identified sets using an optimization program that allows for researchers to impose additional shape restrictions. I also provide consistency results and construct an inference procedure that is valid with aggregate data, which only provides marginal information about each variable. I apply the methodology to simulated and real-world data sets and find that the estimated identified sets are too wide to be useful. This suggests that to obtain useful information from aggregate data sets about individual-level relationships, researchers must impose further assumptions that are carefully justified.</description>

      <title>On Ranking-based Tests of Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a novel nonparametric framework to test the independence of two random variables $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ with unknown respective marginals $H(dx)$ and $G(dy)$ and joint distribution $F(dx dy)$, based on {\it Receiver Operating Characteristic} (ROC) analysis and bipartite ranking. The rationale behind our approach relies on the fact that, the independence hypothesis $\mathcal{H}\_0$ is necessarily false as soon as the optimal scoring function related to the pair of distributions $(H\otimes G,\; F)$, obtained from a bipartite ranking algorithm, has a ROC curve that deviates from the main diagonal of the unit square.We consider a wide class of rank statistics encompassing many ways of deviating from the diagonal in the ROC space to build tests of independence. Beyond its great flexibility, this new method has theoretical properties that far surpass those of its competitors. Nonasymptotic bounds for the two types of testing errors are established. From an empirical perspective, the novel procedure we promote in this paper exhibits a remarkable ability to detect small departures, of various types, from the null assumption $\mathcal{H}_0$, even in high dimension, as supported by the numerical experiments presented here.</description>

      <title>Tuning diagonal scale matrices for HMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three approaches for adaptively tuning diagonal scale matrices for HMC are discussed and compared. The common practice of scaling according to estimated marginal standard deviations is taken as a benchmark. Scaling according to the mean log-target gradient (ISG), and a scaling method targeting that the frequency of when the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics crosses the respective medians should be uniform across dimensions, are taken as alternatives. Numerical studies suggest that the ISG method leads in many cases to more efficient sampling than the benchmark, in particular in cases with strong correlations or non-linear dependencies. The ISG method is also easy to implement, computationally cheap and would be relatively simple to include in automatically tuned codes as an alternative to the benchmark practice.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spatiotemporal Prediction with Bayesian Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal datasets, which consist of spatially-referenced time series, are ubiquitous in many scientific and business-intelligence applications, such as air pollution monitoring, disease tracking, and cloud-demand forecasting. As modern datasets continue to increase in size and complexity, there is a growing need for new statistical methods that are flexible enough to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics and scalable enough to handle large prediction problems. This work presents the Bayesian Neural Field (BayesNF), a domain-general statistical model for inferring rich probability distributions over a spatiotemporal domain, which can be used for data-analysis tasks including forecasting, interpolation, and variography. BayesNF integrates a novel deep neural network architecture for high-capacity function estimation with hierarchical Bayesian inference for robust uncertainty quantification. By defining the prior through a sequence of smooth differentiable transforms, posterior inference is conducted on large-scale data using variationally learned surrogates trained via stochastic gradient descent. We evaluate BayesNF against prominent statistical and machine-learning baselines, showing considerable improvements on diverse prediction problems from climate and public health datasets that contain tens to hundreds of thousands of measurements. The paper is accompanied with an open-source software package (https://github.com/google/bayesnf) that is easy-to-use and compatible with modern GPU and TPU accelerators on the JAX machine learning platform.</description>

      <title>CAS: A General Algorithm for Online Selective Conformal Prediction with FCR Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of post-selection predictive inference in an online fashion. To avoid devoting resources to unimportant units, a preliminary selection of the current individual before reporting its prediction interval is common and meaningful in online predictive tasks. Since the online selection causes a temporal multiplicity in the selected prediction intervals, it is important to control the real-time false coverage-statement rate (FCR) to measure the averaged miscoverage error. We develop a general framework named CAS (Calibration after Adaptive Selection) that can wrap around any prediction model and online selection rule to output post-selection prediction intervals. If the current individual is selected, we first perform an adaptive selection on historical data to construct a calibration set, then output a conformal prediction interval for the unobserved label. We provide tractable constructions for the calibration set for popular online selection rules. We proved that CAS can achieve an exact selection-conditional coverage guarantee in the finite-sample and distribution-free regimes. For the decision-driven selection rule, including most online multiple-testing procedures, CAS can exactly control the real-time FCR below the target level without any distributional assumptions. For the online selection with symmetric thresholds, we establish the error bound for the control gap of FCR under mild distributional assumptions. To account for the distribution shift in online data, we also embed CAS into some recent dynamic conformal prediction methods and examine the long-run FCR control. Numerical results on both synthetic and real data corroborate that CAS can effectively control FCR around the target level and yield more narrowed prediction intervals over existing baselines across various settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.11066v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning how to optimally allocate treatments whose cost is uncertain and can vary with pre-treatment covariates. This setting may arise in medicine if we need to prioritize access to a scarce resource that different patients would use for different amounts of time, or in marketing if we want to target discounts whose cost to the company depends on how much the discounts are used. Here, we show that the optimal treatment allocation rule under budget constraints is a thresholding rule based on priority scores, and we propose a number of practical methods for learning these priority scores using data from a randomized trial. Our formal results leverage a statistical connection between our problem and that of learning heterogeneous treatment effects under endogeneity using an instrumental variable. We find our method to perform well in a number of empirical evaluations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.01879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CRISPR genome engineering and single-cell RNA sequencing have accelerated biological discovery. Single-cell CRISPR screens unite these two technologies, linking genetic perturbations in individual cells to changes in gene expression and illuminating regulatory networks underlying diseases. Despite their promise, single-cell CRISPR screens present substantial statistical challenges. We demonstrate through theoretical and real data analyses that a standard method for estimation and inference in single-cell CRISPR screens -- "thresholded regression" -- exhibits attenuation bias and a bias-variance tradeoff as a function of an intrinsic, challenging-to-select tuning parameter. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce GLM-EIV ("GLM-based errors-in-variables"), a new method for single-cell CRISPR screen analysis. GLM-EIV extends the classical errors-in-variables model to responses and noisy predictors that are exponential family-distributed and potentially impacted by the same set of confounding variables. We develop a computational infrastructure to deploy GLM-EIV across hundreds of processors on clouds (e.g., Microsoft Azure) and high-performance clusters. Leveraging this infrastructure, we apply GLM-EIV to analyze two recent, large-scale, single-cell CRISPR screen datasets, yielding several novel insights.</description>

      <title>Causal survival analysis under competing risks using longitudinal modified treatment policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.03513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Longitudinal modified treatment policies (LMTP) have been recently developed as a novel method to define and estimate causal parameters that depend on the natural value of treatment. LMTPs represent an important advancement in causal inference for longitudinal studies as they allow the non-parametric definition and estimation of the joint effect of multiple categorical, numerical, or continuous exposures measured at several time points. We extend the LMTP methodology to problems in which the outcome is a time-to-event variable subject to right-censoring and competing risks. We present identification results and non-parametric locally efficient estimators that use flexible data-adaptive regression techniques to alleviate model misspecification bias, while retaining important asymptotic properties such as $\sqrt{n}$-consistency. We present an application to the estimation of the effect of the time-to-intubation on acute kidney injury amongst COVID-19 hospitalized patients, where death by other causes is taken to be the competing event.</description>

      <title>Selective conformal inference with false coverage-statement rate control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00584v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal inference is a popular tool for constructing prediction intervals (PI). We consider here the scenario of post-selection/selective conformal inference, that is PIs are reported only for individuals selected from an unlabeled test data. To account for multiplicity, we develop a general split conformal framework to construct selective PIs with the false coverage-statement rate (FCR) control. We first investigate the Benjamini and Yekutieli (2005)'s FCR-adjusted method in the present setting, and show that it is able to achieve FCR control but yields uniformly inflated PIs. We then propose a novel solution to the problem, named as Selective COnditional conformal Predictions (SCOP), which entails performing selection procedures on both calibration set and test set and construct marginal conformal PIs on the selected sets by the aid of conditional empirical distribution obtained by the calibration set. Under a unified framework and exchangeable assumptions, we show that the SCOP can exactly control the FCR. More importantly, we provide non-asymptotic miscoverage bounds for a general class of selection procedures beyond exchangeablity and discuss the conditions under which the SCOP is able to control the FCR. As special cases, the SCOP with quantile-based selection or conformal p-values-based multiple testing procedures enjoys valid coverage guarantee under mild conditions. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of SCOP in FCR control and show that it achieves more narrowed PIs over existing methods in many settings.</description>

      <title>Empirical study of periodic autoregressive models with additive noise -- estimation and testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic autoregressive (PAR) time series with finite variance is considered as one of the most common models of second-order cyclostationary processes. However, in the real applications, the signals with periodic characteristics may be disturbed by additional noise related to measurement device disturbances or to other external sources. Thus, the known estimation techniques dedicated for PAR models may be inefficient for such cases. When the variance of the additive noise is relatively small, it can be ignored and the classical estimation techniques can be applied. However, for extreme cases, the additive noise can have a significant influence on the estimation results. In this paper, we propose four estimation techniques for the noise-corrupted PAR models with finite variance distributions. The methodology is based on Yule-Walker equations utilizing the autocovariance function. It can be used for any type of the finite variance additive noise. The presented simulation study clearly indicates the efficiency of the proposed techniques, also for extreme case, when the additive noise is a sum of the Gaussian additive noise and additive outliers. The proposed estimation techniques are also applied for testing if the data corresponds to noise-corrupted PAR model. This issue is strongly related to the identification of informative component in the data in case when the model is disturbed by additive non-informative noise. The power of the test is studied for simulated data. Finally, the testing procedure is applied for two real time series describing particulate matter concentration in the air.</description>

      <title>Minimum contrast for the first-order intensity estimation of spatial and spatio-temporal point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we harness a result in point process theory, specifically the expectation of the weighted $K$-function, where the weighting is done by the true first-order intensity function. This theoretical result can be employed as an estimation method to derive parameter estimates for a particular model assumed for the data. The underlying motivation is to avoid the difficulties associated with dealing with complex likelihoods in point process models and their maximization. The exploited result makes our method theoretically applicable to any model specification. In this paper, we restrict our study to Poisson models, whose likelihood represents the base for many more complex point process models.
  In this context, our proposed method can estimate the vector of local parameters that correspond to the points within the analyzed point pattern without introducing any additional complexity compared to the global estimation. We illustrate the method through simulation studies for both purely spatial and spatio-temporal point processes and show complex scenarios based on the Poisson model through the analysis of two real datasets concerning environmental problems.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new approach to the autoregressive spatial functional model, based on the notion of signature, which represents a function as an infinite series of its iterated integrals. It presents the advantage of being applicable to a wide range of processes. After having provided theoretical guarantees to the proposed model, we have shown in a simulation study and on a real data set that this new approach presents competitive performances compared to the traditional model.</description>

      <title>An interpretable neural network-based non-proportional odds model for ordinal regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17823v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes an interpretable neural network-based non-proportional odds model (N$^3$POM) for ordinal regression. N$^3$POM is different from conventional approaches to ordinal regression with non-proportional models in several ways: (1) N$^3$POM is defined for both continuous and discrete responses, whereas standard methods typically treat the ordered continuous variables as if they are discrete, (2) instead of estimating response-dependent finite-dimensional coefficients of linear models from discrete responses as is done in conventional approaches, we train a non-linear neural network to serve as a coefficient function. Thanks to the neural network, N$^3$POM offers flexibility while preserving the interpretability of conventional ordinal regression. We establish a sufficient condition under which the predicted conditional cumulative probability locally satisfies the monotonicity constraint over a user-specified region in the covariate space. Additionally, we provide a monotonicity-preserving stochastic (MPS) algorithm for effectively training the neural network. We apply N$^3$POM to several real-world datasets.</description>

Abstract: Urn models for innovation have proven to capture fundamental empirical laws shared by several real-world processes. The so-called urn model with triggering includes, as particular cases, an urn representation of the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process and the Dirichlet process, seminal in Bayesian non-parametric inference. In this work, we leverage this connection to introduce a novel approach for quantifying closeness between symbolic sequences and test it within the framework of the authorship attribution problem. The method demonstrates high accuracy when compared to other state-of-the-art methods in different scenarios, featuring a substantial gain in computational efficiency and theoretical transparency. Beyond the practical convenience, this work demonstrates how the recently established connection between urn models and non-parametric Bayesian inference can pave the way for designing more efficient inference methods. In particular, the hybrid approach that we propose allows us to relax the exchangeability hypothesis, which can be particularly relevant for systems exhibiting complex correlation patterns and non-stationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Integrating Uncertainty Awareness into Conformalized Quantile Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR) is a recently proposed method for constructing prediction intervals for a response $Y$ given covariates $X$, without making distributional assumptions. However, existing constructions of CQR can be ineffective for problems where the quantile regressors perform better in certain parts of the feature space than others. The reason is that the prediction intervals of CQR do not distinguish between two forms of uncertainty: first, the variability of the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ (i.e., aleatoric uncertainty), and second, our uncertainty in estimating this conditional distribution (i.e., epistemic uncertainty). This can lead to intervals that are overly narrow in regions where epistemic uncertainty is high. To address this, we propose a new variant of the CQR methodology, Uncertainty-Aware CQR (UACQR), that explicitly separates these two sources of uncertainty to adjust quantile regressors differentially across the feature space. Compared to CQR, our methods enjoy the same distribution-free theoretical coverage guarantees, while demonstrating in our experiments stronger conditional coverage properties in simulated settings and real-world data sets alike.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine biases arising in A/B tests where firms modify a continuous parameter, such as price, to estimate the global treatment effect of a given performance metric, such as profit. These biases emerge in canonical experimental estimators due to interference among market participants. We employ structural modeling and differential calculus to derive intuitive characterizations of these biases. We then specialize our general model to a standard revenue management pricing problem. This setting highlights a key pitfall in the use of A/B pricing experiments to guide profit maximization: notably, the canonical estimator for the expected change in profits can have the {\em wrong sign}. In other words, following the guidance of canonical estimators may lead firms to move prices in the wrong direction, inadvertently decreasing profits relative to the status quo. We apply these results to a two-sided market model and show how this ``change of sign" regime depends on model parameters such as market imbalance, as well as the price markup. Finally, we discuss structural and practical implications for platform operators.</description>

      <title>Incorporating nonparametric methods for estimating causal excursion effects in mobile health with zero-inflated count outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In mobile health, tailoring interventions for real-time delivery is of paramount importance. Micro-randomized trials have emerged as the "gold-standard" methodology for developing such interventions. Analyzing data from these trials provides insights into the efficacy of interventions and the potential moderation by specific covariates. The "causal excursion effect", a novel class of causal estimand, addresses these inquiries. Yet, existing research mainly focuses on continuous or binary data, leaving count data largely unexplored. The current work is motivated by the Drink Less micro-randomized trial from the UK, which focuses on a zero-inflated proximal outcome, i.e., the number of screen views in the subsequent hour following the intervention decision point. To be specific, we revisit the concept of causal excursion effect, specifically for zero-inflated count outcomes, and introduce novel estimation approaches that incorporate nonparametric techniques. Bidirectional asymptotics are established for the proposed estimators. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. As an illustration, we also implement these methods to the Drink Less trial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying a conditional causal effect through covariate adjustment. We focus on the setting where the causal graph is known up to one of two types of graphs: a maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graph (MPDAG) or a partial ancestral graph (PAG). Both MPDAGs and PAGs represent equivalence classes of possible underlying causal models. After defining adjustment sets in this setting, we provide a necessary and sufficient graphical criterion -- the conditional adjustment criterion -- for finding these sets under conditioning on variables unaffected by treatment. We further provide explicit sets from the graph that satisfy the conditional adjustment criterion, and therefore, can be used as adjustment sets for conditional causal effect identification.</description>

Abstract: Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) is a classic method to analyse cointegration relationships amongst multivariate non-stationary time series. In this paper, we focus on high dimensional setting and seek for sample-size-efficient methodology to determine the level of cointegration. Our investigation centres at a Bayesian approach to analyse the cointegration matrix, henceforth determining the cointegration rank. We design two algorithms and implement them on simulated examples, yielding promising results particularly when dealing with high number of variables and relatively low number of observations. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to empirically investigate the constituents of the S&amp;P 500 index, where low-volatility portfolios can be found during both in-sample training and out-of-sample testing periods.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Feature Selection Approach for Robust Evaluation of Treatment Effects in High-Dimensional Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Randomized Control Trial (RCT) is considered as the gold standard for evaluating the effect of any intervention or treatment. However, its feasibility is often hindered by ethical, economical, and legal considerations, making observational data a valuable alternative for drawing causal conclusions. Nevertheless, healthcare observational data presents a difficult challenge due to its high dimensionality, requiring careful consideration to ensure unbiased, reliable, and robust causal inferences. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we propose a novel two-stage feature selection technique called, Outcome Adaptive Elastic Net (OAENet), explicitly designed for making robust causal inference decisions using matching techniques. OAENet offers several key advantages over existing methods: superior performance on correlated and high-dimensional data compared to the existing methods and the ability to select specific sets of variables (including confounders and variables associated only with the outcome). This ensures robustness and facilitates an unbiased estimate of the causal effect. Numerical experiments on simulated data demonstrate that OAENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by either producing a higher-quality estimate or a comparable estimate in significantly less time. To illustrate the applicability of OAENet, we employ large-scale US healthcare data to estimate the effect of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) on suicidal behavior. When compared to competing methods, OAENet closely aligns with existing literature on the relationship between OUD and suicidal behavior. Performance on both simulated and real-world data highlights that OAENet notably enhances the accuracy of estimating treatment effects or evaluating policy decision-making with causal inference.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian framework for measuring association and its application to emotional dynamics in Web discourse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Bayesian framework designed to measure the degree of association between categorical random variables. The method is grounded in the formal definition of variable independence and is implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Unlike commonly employed techniques in Association Rule Learning, this approach enables a clear and precise estimation of confidence intervals and the statistical significance of the measured degree of association. We applied the method to non-exclusive emotions identified by annotators in 4,613 tweets written in Portuguese. This analysis revealed pairs of emotions that exhibit associations and mutually opposed pairs. Moreover, the method identifies hierarchical relations between categories, a feature observed in our data, and is utilized to cluster emotions into basic-level groups.</description>
