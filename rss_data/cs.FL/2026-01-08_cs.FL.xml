      <title>Parsing Hypergraphs using Context-Free Positional Grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel work-in-progress approach to the parsing of hypergraphs generated by context-free hyperedge replacement grammars. This method is based on a new LR parsing technique for positional grammars, which is also under active development. Central to our approach is a reduction from hyperedge replacement to positional grammars with additional structural constraints, enabling the use of permutation-based operations to determine the correct ordering of hyperedges on the right-hand side of productions. Preliminary results also reveal a distinction between ambiguity in graph generation and ambiguity in graph recognition. While the exact class of hyperedge replacement languages parsable under this method remains under investigation, the approach provides a promising foundation for future generalisations to more expressive grammar formalisms. Graph parsing remains a broadly relevant problem across numerous domains, and our contribution aims to advance both the theoretical and practical understanding of this challenge.</description>

      <title>Policy Synthesis for Interval MDPs via Polyhedral Lyapunov Functions</title>

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is central to many safety-critical applications, where decisions must be guided by probabilistic modeling formalisms. This paper introduces a novel approach to policy synthesis in multi-objective interval Markov decision processes using polyhedral Lyapunov functions. Unlike previous Lyapunov-based methods that mainly rely on quadratic functions, our method utilizes polyhedral functions to enhance accuracy in managing uncertainties within value iteration of dynamic programming. We reformulate the value iteration algorithm as a switched affine system with interval uncertainties and apply control-theoretic stability principles to synthesize policies that guide the system toward a desired target set. By constructing an invariant set of attraction, we ensure that the synthesized policies provide convergence guarantees while minimizing the impact of transition uncertainty in the underlying model. Our methodology removes the need for computationally intensive Pareto curve computations by directly determining a policy that brings objectives within a specified range of their target values. We validate our approach through numerical case studies, including a recycling robot and an electric vehicle battery, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving policy synthesis under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Checking Timed Bisimilarity with Virtual Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15799v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timed automata are a widely used formalism for specifying the discrete-state/continuous-time behavior of time-critical reactive systems. For the fundamental verification problem of comparing two timed automata, it has been shown that timed trace equivalence is undecidable, while timed bisimulation is decidable. The corresponding decidability proof uses region graphs, a finite but space-consuming characterization of timed automata semantics. Most verification tools use zone graphs instead, a symbolic and, on average, more space-efficient representation of timed automata semantics. However, zone graphs provide correct results only for those verification tasks that are reducible to reachability problems, and are too imprecise for timed bisimilarity checking. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no practical tool for automated timed bisimilarity checking. In this paper, we propose a new representation of timed automata semantics that extends zone graphs by so-called virtual clocks. Our zone-based construction is, on average, significantly smaller than the corresponding region graph representation. We also present experimental results obtained by applying our tool implementation to timed automata models, which are often used to evaluate timed automata analysis techniques.</description>

      <title>Monadic Context Engineering</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.</description>
