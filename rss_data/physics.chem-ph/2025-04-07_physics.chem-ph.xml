      <title>Transfer learning from first-principles calculations to experiments with chemistry-informed domain transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02848v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-to-Real (Sim2Real) transfer learning, the machine learning technique that efficiently solves a real-world task by leveraging knowledge from computational data, has received increasing attention in materials science as a promising solution to the scarcity of experimental data. We proposed an efficient transfer learning scheme from first-principles calculations to experiments based on the chemistry-informed domain transformation, that integrates the heterogeneous source and target domains by harnessing the underlying physics and chemistry. The proposed method maps the computational data from the simulation space (source domain) into the space of experimental data (target domain). During this process, these qualitatively different domains are efficiently integrated by a couple of prior knowledge of chemistry, (1) the statistical ensemble, and (2) the relationship between source and target quantities. As a proof-of-concept, we predict the catalyst activity for the reverse water-gas shift reaction by using the abundant first-principles data in addition to the experimental data. Through the demonstration, we confirmed that the transfer learning model exhibits positive transfer in accuracy and data efficiency. In particular, a significantly high accuracy was achieved despite using a few (less than ten) target data in domain transformation, whose accuracy is one order of magnitude smaller than that of a full scratch model trained with over 100 target data. This result indicates that the proposed method leverages the high prediction performance with few target data, which helps to save the number of trials in real laboratories.</description>

      <title>Atomistic insights on prebiotic phosphorylation of methanol from Schreibersite (Fe2NiP) corrosion: ab-initio computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prebiotic history of phosphorus is a matter of debate in the scientific community: its origin, how it landed on Earth, the selective speciation of the phosphate, and its inclusion into the organic matrix are the main unsolved issues. In this regard, Schreibersite ((Fe,Ni)3P), a mineral present in iron meteorites, can play a fundamental role as a carrier of reactive P which, as a result of the weathering processes, produces oxygenated phosphorus compounds, even the phosphate among others. In the present paper, we studied the interaction of methanol (alone and mixed with water) with the Schreibersite surfaces throughout periodic density functional theory calculations at PBE level. The results indicate that Schreibersite promotes the deprotonation of methanol and water both from thermodynamic and kinetic points of view, thus enabling the first step towards corrosion. We have simulated advanced stages of the corrosion process up to the formation of the phosphate and the phosphorylated form of methanol (methyl phosphate), showing that the formation of both products is thermodynamically favoured, as well as its solubilization, which allows other water molecules to proceed with further corrosion of Schreibersite.</description>

      <title>Surface charge pattern: impact on vibrational spectroscopy and physics of charged interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface specific vibrational spectroscopies revolutionized the study of charged interfaces, by sensitively probing water's response in the electric double layer (EDL) and correlating it with surface charge via models like Gouy Chapmann Stern. The assumed one to one relationship between water's spectroscopic response and surface charge has been widely accepted without question. We hereby propose a theoretical experiment to evaluate this assumption. Interestingly, our findings reveal a non one to one relationship between surface charge and spectroscopic response, exhibiting a fascinating dependence on surface topology.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking as Predicted by a Phase Space Hamiltonian with a Spin Coriolis Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform electronic structure calculations for a set of molecules with degenerate spin-dependent ground states ($^3$CH$_2$, $^2$CH$_3^{\bullet}$, $^3$O$_2$) going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and accounting for nuclear motion. According to a phase space (PS) approach that parametrizes electronic states ($|\Phi\rangle$) and electronic energies ($E$) by nuclear position {\em and} momentum (i.e., $|\Phi(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{P}) \rangle$ and $E(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{P})$), we find that the presence of degenerate spin degrees of freedom leads to broken symmetry ground states. More precisely, rather than a single degenerate minimum at $(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{P}) = (\mathbf{R}_{min}, 0)$, the ground state energy has two minima at $(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{P}) = (\mathbf{R}_{min}',\pm \mathbf{P}_{min})$ (where $\mathbf{R}_{min}'$ is close to $\mathbf{R}_{min}$), dramatically contradicting the notion that the total energy of the system can be written in separable form as $E = \frac{\mathbf{P}^2}{2M} + V_{el}$. Although we find that the broken symmetry solutions have small barriers between them for the small molecules, we hypothesize that the barriers should be macroscopically large for metallic solids, thus offering up a new phase-space potential energy surface for simulating the Einstein-de Haas effect.</description>

      <title>Accurate extrapolation of MP2 correlation energies for small correlation-consistent core-valence basis sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atom-Calibrated Basis-set Extrapolation (ACBE) method is introduced as a robust approach for extrapolating MP2 correlation energies from small basis sets. Unlike conventional extrapolation techniques, ACBE incorporates system- and environment-specific parameters to enhance predictive accuracy, effectively mitigating errors associated with finite basis sets. Evaluated using the aug-cc-pwCV$n$Z basis set family across a diverse set of molecular systems, including first- and second-row species, ACBE consistently delivers reliable energy estimates, even when double- and triple-zeta basis sets are employed. These results highlight the computational efficiency of the method, making it a promising option for large MP2 studies.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Electronic Structure of Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last several decades have seen significant advances in the theoretical modeling of materials within the fields of solid-state physics and materials science, but many methods commonly applied to this problem struggle to capture strong electron correlation accurately. Recent widespread interest in quantum materials -- where strong correlation plays a crucial role in the quantum effects governing their behavior -- further highlights the need for theoretical methods capable of rigorously treating such correlation. Here, we present a periodic generalization of variational two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) theory, a bootstrapping-type method that minimizes the ground-state energy as a functional of the 2-RDM without relying on the wavefunction. The 2-RDM is computed directly by semidefinite programming with $N$-representability conditions, ensuring accurate treatment of strongly correlated electronic systems. By exploiting translational symmetry, we significantly reduce computational scaling, enabling applications to realistic materials-scale systems. Additionally, we introduce an alternative to conventional energy band structures: natural-orbital occupation-number bands, which, being independent of mean-field assumptions, offer deeper insights into electron correlation effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying the theory to hydrogen chains, molybdenum disulfide, and nickel oxide, showing that natural-orbital occupation bands correctly capture electronic character in regimes where density functional theory fails. This work represents a major step toward accurately describing the electronic structure of quantum materials using reduced density matrices rather than wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>State Specific Measurement Protocols for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central roadblock in the realization of variational quantum eigensolvers on quantum hardware is the high overhead associated with measurement repetitions, which hampers the computation of complex problems, such as the simulation of mid- and large-sized molecules. In this work, we propose a novel measurement protocol which relies on computing an approximation of the Hamiltonian expectation value. The method involves measuring cheap grouped operators directly and estimating the residual elements through iterative measurements of new grouped operators in different bases, with the process being truncated at a certain stage. The measured elements comprehend the operators defined by the Hard-Core Bosonic approximation, which encode electron-pair annihilation and creation operators. These can be easily decomposed into three self-commuting groups which can be measured simultaneously. Applied to molecular systems, the method achieves a reduction of 30% to 80% in the number of measurement and gates depth in the measuring circuits compared to state-of-the-art methods. This provides a scalable and cheap measurement protocol, advancing the application of variational approaches for simulating physical systems.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Atomic Layer Deposition with a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the study of an atomic layer deposition (ALD) of zirconium by means of a quantum computation on an emulator representing the features of an architecture based on qubits implemented on carbon nanotubes. ALD process control is key in several technological applications such as spintronics, catalysis and renewable energy storage. We first derive a large ab-initio model of the precursor molecule approaching the infinite hydroxylated silicon (100) surface. In particular, we optimize geometry in three configurations: reactants, transition state and products. Subsequently, we derive an effective small cluster model for each state. Atomic valence active space (AVAS) transformation is then performed on these small clusters, leading to an effective qubit Hamiltonian, which is solved using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. We study the convergence of the reaction activation barrier with respect to the active space size and benchmark quantum calculations on a noiseless emulator and on an emulator representing a carbon nanotube qubit architecture, including an appropriate noise model and post-selection error mitigation. These calculations reveal an excellent agreement between the two emulation modes. Our VQE calculations provide the multi-configurational corrections to the single determinant DFT and HF states and pave the way for the routine quantum calculations of ALD reactions.</description>

      <title>BondMatcher: H-Bond Stability Analysis in Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This application paper investigates the stability of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), as characterized by the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM). First, we contribute a database of 4544 electron densities associated to four isomers of water hexamers (the so-called Ring, Book, Cage and Prism), generated by distorting their equilibrium geometry under various structural perturbations, modeling the natural dynamic behavior of molecular systems. Second, we present a new stability measure, called bond occurrence rate, associating each bond path present at equilibrium with its rate of occurrence within the input ensemble. We also provide an algorithm, called BondMatcher, for its automatic computation, based on a tailored, geometry-aware partial isomorphism estimation between the extremum graphs of the considered electron densities. Our new stability measure allows for the automatic identification of densities lacking H-bond paths, enabling further visual inspections. Specifically, the topological analysis enabled by our framework corroborates experimental observations and provides refined geometrical criteria for characterizing the disappearance of H-bond paths. Our electron density database and our C++ implementation are available at this address: https://github.com/thom-dani/BondMatcher.</description>

      <title>Multiple Equilibria Enables Tunable Wetting of Droplets on Patterned Liquid Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patterning solid surfaces with varying wettability is important to manage droplets in microfluidics, heat transfer and printing. Solid surface roughness poses fundamental limitations including contact-line pinning and solid friction. Here, we report an experimental strategy and theoretical design principles for Patterned Liquid Surfaces (PaLS) that combines the controlled wettability from patterning with the ultra-smoothness of a lubricant-infused surface. In contrast to a solid, on PaLS a droplet can be in 10 different wetting states. This richness arises from the adaptation of the liquid lubricants, and can be harnessed to control the apparent contact angle of the droplet over the full range of wettability whilst removing contact-line pinning effects induced by the solid surface. In the limit of thin liquid films, we derive surface-averaged laws for the apparent contact angle for each wetting state, which capture both experimental and simulation data. Our results provide a distinct approach to surface patterning that exploits the interaction of fluids with lubricant-impregnated surfaces.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Training Enhances Machine Learning Potentials for Long-Lasting Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are vital for exploring complex systems in computational physics and chemistry. While machine learning methods dramatically reduce computational costs relative to ab initio methods, their accuracy in long-lasting simulations remains limited. Here we propose dynamic training (DT), a method designed to enhance model performance over extended MD simulations. Applying DT to an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) on the challenging system of a hydrogen molecule interacting with a palladium cluster anchored to a graphene vacancy demonstrates a superior prediction accuracy compared to conventional approaches. Crucially, the DT architecture-independent design ensures its applicability across diverse machine learning potentials, making it a practical tool for advancing MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Resolved Core Exciton Dynamics in LiF Using Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhanced enzyme diffusion (EED), in which the diffusion coefficient of an enzyme transiently increases during catalysis, has been extensively reported experimentally. We numerically and analytically demonstrate that such enzymes can act as Maxwell's demons. They use their enhanced diffusion as a memory of the previous catalytic reaction, to gain information and drive steady-state chemical concentrations away from chemical equilibrium. Our theoretical analysis identifies the conditions for this process, highlighting the functional role of EED and its relevance to cellular systems.</description>

      <title>Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity as the system enters the attractive regime, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics.</description>
