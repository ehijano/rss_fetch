      <title>How social reinforcement learning can lead to metastable polarisation and the voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous explanations for the persistence of polarization of opinions have typically included modelling assumptions that predispose the possibility of polarization (e.g.\ repulsive interactions). An exception is recent research showing that polarization is stable when agents form their opinions using reinforcement learning.
  We show that the polarization observed in this model is not stable, but exhibits consensus asymptotically with probability one. By constructing a link between the reinforcement learning model and the voter model, we argue that the observed polarization is metastable. Finally, we show that a slight modification in the learning process of the agents changes the model from being non-ergodic to being ergodic.
  Our results show that reinforcement learning may be a powerful method for modelling polarization in opinion dynamics, but that the tools appropriate for analysing such models crucially depend on the properties of the resulting systems. Properties which are determined by the details of the learning process.</description>

      <title>Strong and Weak Random Walks on Signed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random walks play an important role in probing the structure of complex networks. On traditional networks, they can be used to extract community structure, understand node centrality, perform link prediction, or capture the similarity between nodes. On signed networks, where the edge weights can be either positive or negative, it is non-trivial to design a random walk which can be used to extract information about the signed structure of the network, in particular the ability to partition the graph into communities with positive edges inside and negative edges in between. Prior works on signed network random walks focus on the case where there are only two such communities (strong balance), which is rarely the case in empirical networks. In this paper, we propose a signed network random walk which can capture the structure of a network with more than two such communities (weak balance). The walk results in a similarity matrix which can be used to cluster the nodes into antagonistic communities. We compare the characteristics of the so-called strong and weak random walks, in terms of walk length and stationarity. We show through a series of experiments on synthetic and empirical networks that the similarity matrix based on weak walks can be used for both unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering, outperforming the same similarity matrix based on strong walks when the graph has more than two communities, or exhibits asymmetry in the density of links. These results suggest that other random-walk based algorithms for signed networks could be improved simply by running them with weak walks instead of strong walks.</description>

      <title>CrowdEgress: A Multi-Agent Simulation Platform for Pedestrian Crowd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a simulation platform to study complex crowd behavior in social context. The agent-based model is extended based on the well-known social force model, and it mainly describes how agents interact with each other, and also with surrounding facilities such as walls, doors and exits. The simulation platform is compatible to FDS+Evac, and the input data in FDS+Evac could be imported into our simulation platform to create single-floor compartment geometry, and a flow solver is used to generate the roadmap towards exits. Most importantly, we plan to integrate advanced social and psychological theory into our simulation platform, especially investigating human behavior in emergency evacuation,such as pre-evacuation behavior, exit-selection activities, social group and herding effect and so forth.</description>

      <title>Python4Physics: A physics outreach program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a summer outreach program developed to cultivate interest in physics in particular and physical sciences more broadly among high school and early college students using small projects in the Python programming language. We discuss the lessons we learned in the hopes that they will be valuable to other physicists in planning their own outreach efforts. We also provide links to resources and materials from the Python4Physics program, which we hope might be useful in other outreach programs.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of social network polarization and its impact on the propagation of a virus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in 2020 has highlighted the complex interplay between vaccine hesitancy and societal polarization. In this study, we analyse the dynamical polarization within a social network as well as the network properties before and after a vaccine was made available. Our results show that as the network evolves from a less structured state to one with more clustered communities. Then using an agent-based modeling approach, we simulate the propagation of a virus in a polarized society by assigning vaccines to pro-vaccine individuals and none to the anti-vaccine individuals. We compare this propagation to the case where the same number of vaccines is distributed homogeneously across the population. In polarized networks, we observe a significantly more widespread diffusion of the virus, highlighting the importance of considering polarization for epidemic forecasting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For decades, hospital services have been faced with the challenge of ensuring quality care for patients despite the pressures on staff due to workload overload. Nursing staff are particularly affected by this reality, with a patient/nursing staff ratio so imbalanced that it directly affects the quality of care and the well-being of nurses. This article examines in detail the workload of nursing staff, shedding light on the various factors influencing this workload, including the type of care provided, the characteristics of patients and nursing staff, as well as the organizational context. Furthermore, different methods of calculating and estimating workload are analyzed, ranging from workload calculation systems to advanced predictive models. Finally, reflection is made on future research avenues, particularly concerning the identification of factors influencing workload, data collection and processing, and model validation.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Global Election Landscape on Social Media in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2024, half of the global population is expected to participate in elections, offering researchers a unique opportunity to study online information diffusion and user behavior. This study investigates the media landscape on social media by analyzing Facebook posts from national political parties and major news agencies across Europe, Mexico, and India. Our methodology identifies key topics and evaluates public interaction, reflecting broader trends in political engagement. Using Principal Component Analysis, we distil these topics to uncover patterns of correlation and differentiation. This approach reveals dominant themes that engage global audiences, providing critical insights into the interplay between public opinion and digital narratives during a major electoral cycle. Our findings highlight how different topics resonate across political spectrums, shaping political debate and offering a comprehensive view of the interaction between media content, political ideology, and audience engagement.</description>
