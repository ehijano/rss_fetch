      <title>Inferior interfacial superconductivity in 1 UC FeSe/SrVO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ with screened interfacial electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer FeSe/TiO$_x$ and FeSe/FeO$_x$ interfaces exhibit significant superconductivity enhancement compared to bulk FeSe, with interfacial electron-phonon coupling (EPC) playing a crucial role. However, the reduced dimensionality in monolayer FeSe, which may drive superconducting fluctuations, complicates the understanding of the enhancement mechanisms. Here we construct a new superconducting interface: monolayer FeSe/SrVO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, in which the itinerant electrons of highly metallic SrVO$_3$ films can screen all the high-energy Fuchs-Kliewer phonons, including those of SrTiO$_3$, making it the first FeSe/oxide system with screened interfacial EPC while maintaining the monolayer FeSe thickness. Despite comparable doping levels, the heavily electron-doped monolayer FeSe/SrVO$_3$ exhibits a lower pairing temperature ($T_\mathrm{g}$ $\sim$ 48 K) than FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ and FeSe/LaFeO$_3$. Our findings disentangle the contributions of interfacial EPC from dimensionality on enhancing $T_\mathrm{g}$ in FeSe/oxide interfaces, underscoring the importance of interfacial EPC in $T_\mathrm{g}$ enhancement. This FeSe/VO$_x$ interface also provides a platform for studying the interfacial superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Probing Topological Superconductivity of oxide nanojunctions using fractional Shapiro steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss the emergence of fractional Shapiro steps in a Josephson junction created by confining a two-dimensional electron gas at an oxide interface. This phenomenon is induced by an alternating current of proper amplitude and frequency and can be tuned by a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the Rashba spin-orbit axis. The presence of fractional Shapiro steps can be associated with the creation of Majorana bound states at the boundaries of the superconducting leads. Our findings represent a route for the identification of topological superconductivity in non-centrosymmetric materials and confined systems in the presence of spin--orbit interaction, offering also new insights into recently explored frameworks.</description>

      <title>Weakly Coupled Type-II Superconductivity in a Laves compound ZrRe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the superconducting properties of ZrRe2, a Re-based hexagonal Laves compounds. ZrRe2 crystallizes in a C14-type structure (space group P63/mmc), with cell parameters a=b=5.2682(5) and c=8.63045 . Resistivity and magnetic susceptibility data both suggest that ZrRe2 exhibits a sharp superconducting transition above 6.1 K. The measured lower and upper critical fields are 6.27 mT and 12.77 T, respectively, with a large upper critical field that approached the Pauli limit.Measurements of the heat capacity confirm the presence of bulk superconductivity, with a normalized specific heat change of 1.24 and an electron-phonon strength of 0.69 . DFT calculations revealed that the band structure of ZrRe2 is intricate and without van-Hove singularity. The observed large specific heat jump, combined with the electron-phonon strength , suggests that ZrRe2 is a weakly coupled type II superconductor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple model of a two-dimensional ``locally smectic superconductor'' that exhibits power-law non-linear I-V characteristics with different powers for current applied in two orthogonal directions. We discuss the potential relevance of this model to recent experimental findings on interfacial superconductivity in EuO/KTaO$_3$(110) (Nat. Phys. 20, 957 (2024)), where the apparent critical temperature ($T_c$) has been shown experimentally to depend on the current direction.</description>

      <title>Signature of Orbital Driven Finite Momentum Pairing in a 3D Ising Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite momentum superconducting pairing states (FMPs), where Cooper pairs carry non-zero momentum, are believed to give rise to exotic physical phenomena including the pseudogap phase of cuprate high-Tc superconductors and Majorana fermions in topological superconductivity. FMPs can emerge in intertwined electronic liquids with strong spin-spin interactions or be induced by lifting the spin degeneracy under magnetic field as originally proposed by Fulde-Ferrell and Larkin-Ovchinnikov. In quantum materials with strong Ising-type spin-orbit coupling, such as the 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the spin degree of freedom is frozen enabling novel orbital driven FMPs via magnetoelectric effect. While evidence of orbital driven FMPs has been revealed in bilayer TMDs, its realization in 3D bulk materials remains an unresolved challenge. Here we report experimental signatures of FMP in a locally noncentrosymmetric bulk superconductor 4Hb-TaS2. Using hard X-ray diffraction and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal unusual 2D chiral charge density wave (CDW) and weak interlayer hopping in 4Hb-TaS2. Below the superconducting transition temperature, the upper critical field, Hc2, linearly increases via decreasing temperature, and well exceeds the Pauli limit, thus establishing the dominant orbital pair-breaking mechanism. Remarkably, we discover a field-induced superconductivity-to-superconductivity transition that breaks continuous rotational symmetry of the s-wave uniform pairing in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory down to the six-fold rotation symmetry. Combining with a Ginzburg-Landau free energy analysis that incorporates magnetoelectric effect, our observations provide strong evidence of orbital driven FMP in the 3D quantum heterostructure 4Hb-TaS2.</description>

      <title>Superfluid transition temperature of bond bipolarons with Coulomb interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing an exactly sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo method, we explore the influence of long-range Coulomb interaction on the superfluid transition temperature of bipolarons in two dimensions. The model studied here is the bond Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with phonon-modulated electron hopping. Previously, in the absence of long-range Coulomb interaction, this model demonstrated the emergence of small-size, light-mass bipolarons that undergo a superfluid transition at high values of the transition temperature $T_c$ [Physical Review X 13, 011010, (2023)]. Our findings indicate that even with the inclusion of long-range Coulomb interaction, $T_c$ remains substantially high, even in the deep adiabatic regime where the phonon frequency is $\omega/t = 0.5$ and the Coulomb interaction $V = U/10$. This result suggests a physical mechanism for superconductivity in the low-density regime, which could hold relevance for ongoing experiments on dilute superconductors.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing nodal and nonunitary superconductivity in quasiparticle interference of an Ising superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit coupling: an example of NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NbSe$_2$ monolayer with Rashba spin-orbit coupling represents a paradigmatic example of an Ising superconductor on a substrate. Using a single-band model and symmetry analysis, we present general superconducting pairing functions beyond the nearest-neighbor approximation, uncovering new types of gap functions, including the nodal singlet gap function and the triplet non-unitary pairing function that breaks time-reversal symmetry. The non-unitarity builts in the asymmetrical band dispersion in the superconducting quasiparticle energy spectra. Performing exact T-matrix calculations of quasiparticle interference due to a single scalar impurity scattering, we found that the interference patterns possess characteristic features distinguishing the type of pairing and possible nematic and chiral symmetry violations.</description>

      <title>Why Mg$_2$IrH$_6$ is predicted to be a high temperature superconductor, but Ca$_2$IrH$_6$ is not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X$_2$MH$_6$ family, consisting of an electropositive cation X and a main group metal M octahedrally coordinated by hydrogen, has been predicted to hold promise for high-temperature conventional superconductivity. Herein, we analyze the electronic structure of two members of this family, Mg$_2$IrH$_6$ and Ca$_2$IrH$_6$, showing why the former may possess superconducting properties rivaling those of the cuprates, whereas the latter does not. Within Mg$_2$IrH$_6$ the vibrations of the IrH$_6^{4-}$ anions are key for the superconducting mechanism, and they induce coupling in the $e_g^*$ set, which are antibonding between the H 1$s$ and the Ir $d_{x^2-y^2}$ or $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Because calcium possesses low-lying d-orbitals, $e_g^* \rightarrow$ Ca $d$ back-donation is preferred, quenching the superconductivity. Our analysis explains why high critical temperatures were only predicted for second or third row X metal atoms, and may hold implications for superconductivity in other systems where the antibonding anionic states are filled.</description>

      <title>The Drude weight of a flatband metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flatband systems form a new class of materials with seemingly contradictory properties that challenge our understanding of their transport phenomenology. On the one hand, the large density of states at the chemical potential suggests a metallic behavior. On the other hand, all states have a vanishing velocity that essentially prevents transport. Furthermore, electronic correlation effects are intrinsically strong as the interaction energy scale naturally exceeds the narrow or vanishing bandwidth. In this work, we determine the conductivity of flatband systems by investigating their Drude weight, thereby avoiding issues associated with a particular choice of relaxation broadening. Our study is a controlled analytic treatment performed at temperatures above the bandwidth and the interaction strength and below the bandgap, a new distinctive transport regime for flat bands. We find that the Drude weight has geometric contributions that are unique to a perfectly flat band and are beyond the commonly studied quantum metric and Berry curvature. We expect that these novel contributions are essential in determining flatband response functions and shed new light on the stability of flatband systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore Bernal bilayer graphene in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions, short-range Hund's coupling, and proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling using self-consistent Hartree-Fock simulations. We show that the interplay between these three ingredients produces an intricate phase diagram comprising a multitude of symmetry-broken metallic states tunable via doping and applied displacement field. In particular, we find intervalley coherent and spin-canted ground states that may hold the key to understanding spin-orbit-enabled superconductivity observed in this platform. We also investigate various phase transitions where a continuous $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry is broken to ascertain the possible role of critical fluctuations on pairing.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric AlBN Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the properties of molecular beam epitaxy deposited AlBN thin films on a recently developed epitaxial nitride metal electrode Nb2N. While a control AlN thin film exhibits standard capacitive behavior, distinct ferroelectric switching is observed in the AlBN films with increasing Boron mole fraction. The measured remnant polarization Pr of 15 uC/cm2 and coercive field Ec of 1.45 MV/cm in these films are smaller than those recently reported on films deposited by sputtering, due to incomplete wake-up, limited by current leakage. Because AlBN preserves the ultrawide energy bandgap of AlN compared to other nitride hi-K dielectrics and ferroelectrics, and it can be epitaxially integrated with GaN and AlN semiconductors, its development will enable several opportunities for unique electronic, photonic, and memory devices.</description>

      <title>Abnormal planar Hall effect in quasi-1D Kondo chain CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$ and its implications for hybridization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process how heavy-electron state is established in Kondo-lattice compounds remains an unsolved issue. Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy imply an intermediate regime with hybridization fluctuations prior to the establishment of Kondo coherence, which appears at odds with traditional transport measurements. Extensive experimental works are highly demanded to both reconcile this dichotomy and delineate the intrinsic features in this special regime. Here, on the example of quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we investigated angular dependent magnetotransport properties by planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements. Upon cooling from $T_K^{on}$ (an onset of incoherent Kondo scattering ) to below $T^*$ (where coherent $c$-$f$ hybridization comes into play), the two-fold symmetrical pattern of planar Hall effect changes sign gradually (i.e. $180^\circ$ phase shift); most strikingly, as a crossover, additional oscillations appear and persist until the heavy-electron state is stabilized below $T^*$. These results provide new insights for the regime of hybridization dynamics which might be deemed as a precursor state of the heavy-electron state.</description>

      <title>OnionVQE Optimization Strategy for Ground State Preparation on NISQ Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising and widely used algorithms for exploiting the capabilities of current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. However, VQE algorithms suffer from a plethora of issues, such as barren plateaus, local minima, quantum hardware noise, and limited qubit connectivity, thus posing challenges for their successful deployment on hardware and simulators. In this work, we propose a VQE optimization strategy that builds upon recent advances in the literature, and exhibits very shallow circuit depths when applied to the specific system of interest, namely a model Hamiltonian representing a cuprate superconductor. These features make our approach a favorable candidate for generating good ground state approximations on current NISQ devices. Our findings illustrate the potential of VQE algorithmic development for leveraging the full capabilities of NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Nematic Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces from magnetic toroidal order in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently it has been argued that the superconducting state of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ exhibits Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces for $x&gt;0.17$. These Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces appear together with broken time-reversal symmetry and surprisingly demonstrate nematic behavior in a structurally tetragonal phase. Through a symmetry-based analysis of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces that can arise from broken time-reversal symmetry, we argue that the likely origin of time-reversal symmetry breaking is due to magnetic toroidal order. We show that this magnetic toroidal order naturally appears as a consequence of either static N\'{e}el antiferromagnetic order or due to the formation of a spontaneous pair density wave superconducting order. Finally, we reveal that independent of the presence of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, supercurrents will induce N\'{e}el magnetic order in many Fe-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Coherence Length in Superconductors with Quantum Metric</title>

Abstract: The coherence length $\xi$ is the fundamental length scale of superconductors which governs the sizes of Cooper pairs, vortices, Andreev bound states, and more. In existing microscopic theories of superconductivity, it is expected that as the strength of the attractive interaction increases, $\xi$ decreases as the electrons are bound together more strongly. In BCS theory, the coherence length is $\xi_\mathrm{BCS} = \hbar v_{F}/\Delta$, where $v_{F}$ is the Fermi velocity and $\Delta$ is the pairing gap. It is clear that increasing $\Delta$ will shorten $\xi_\mathrm{BCS}$. However, the situation is puzzling for superconductors with exactly flat bands in which $v_{F}$ goes to zero and $\xi_\mathrm{BCS}$ is expected to be zero. In this work, we show that the quantum metric, which is the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, gives rise to an anomalous contribution to the coherence length. Specifically, $\xi = \sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{BCS}^2 +\ell_{\mathrm{qm}}^{2}}$ for a superconductor where $\ell_{\mathrm{qm}}$ is the quantum metric contribution. In the flat-band limit, $\xi$ does not vanish but is bound below by $\ell_{\mathrm{qm}}$. We demonstrate that under the uniform pairing condition, $\ell_{\mathrm{qm}}$ is controlled by the quantum metric of minimal trace in the flat-band limit. Physically, the Cooper pair size of a superconductor cannot be squeezed down to a size smaller than $\ell_{\mathrm{qm}}$ which is a fundamental length scale determined by the quantum geometry of the wave functions. Lastly, we compute the quantum metric contributions for the family of superconducting moir\'{e} graphene materials, demonstrating the significant role played by quantum metric effects in these narrow-band superconductors.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Cooper-pair fluctuations in a 2D Electron System with Strong Spin-Orbit Scatterings: Crossover to Phase Separation and Large Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A microscopic theory of Cooper-pair fluctuations (CPFs) in a 2D electron system with strong spin-orbit scatterings is presented to account for the observation, at low temperatures, of large magnetoresistance (MR) above a crossover field to superconductivity in electron-doped SrTiO$_{3}$/LaAlO$_{3} $ interfaces. It is found that the conventional (diagrammatic) microscopic theory of superconducting fluctuations yields corrections to the normal-state conductivity too small to account for the pronounced MR. However, an extension of the theory, which introduces a proper definition of the CPFs density, reveals an operative mechanism of this intriguing large MR. A crossover to phase separation, due to Coulomb repulsion, between the rarefying unpaired normal-state electron gas and condensates of CPFs in real-space mesoscopic puddles, developed under increasing field, drive a crossover to a large MR. In the framework of this scenario it is possible to amend the state-of-the-art microscopic theory consistently with the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau functional approach, used previously in an extensive account of the experimentally reported effect.</description>

Abstract: We uncover a new superconducting state with partial spin polarization induced by a magnetic field. This state, which we call "magnonic superconductor", lacks a conventional pairing order parameter, but is characterized instead by a composite order parameter that represents the binding of electron pairs and magnons. We rigorously demonstrate the existence of magnonic superconductivity with high transition temperature in one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models with repulsive interaction. We further show that magnonic Cooper pairs can attract to form higher-charge bound states, which can give rise to charge-$6e$ superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Amplitude, phase, and topological fluctuations shaping the complex phase diagram of two-dimensional superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the amplitude and phase fluctuations of the Ginzburg-Landau quasi-order parameter for superconductors in two spatial dimensions. Starting from the mean-field critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}0}$, we calculate the beyond-mean-field critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ by including thermal fluctuations of the quasi-order parameter within the Gaussian level. Moreover, from our beyond-mean field results, we derive the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$, which takes into account topological vortex-antivortex excitations in the phase fluctuations as well as the amplitude fluctuations, to obtain the shifts of transition temperatures. We elucidate how the Gaussian thermal fluctuations and phase fluctuations associated with vortex excitations affect thermodynamic properties by determining the $H$-$T$ phase diagram for a type-II superconductor and computing the critical behaviors of the heat capacity, which are experimentally accessible, allowing the characterization of the cascade of different kinds of fluctuations in 2D superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconducting properties and electronic structure of CuAl2-type transition-metal zirconide Fe1-xNixZr2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CuAl2-type transition-metal (Tr) zirconides are superconductor family, and the Tr-site element substitution largely modifies its transition temperature (Tc). Here, we synthesized polycrystalline samples of Fe1-xNixZr2 by arc melting. From magnetic susceptibility measurements, bulk superconductivity was observed for 0.4 &lt; x &lt; 0.8, and the highest Tc of 2.8 K was observed for x = 0.6. Specific heat measurements were also performed, bulk superconductivity was observed for 0.4 &lt; x &lt; 0.8, and the highest Tc of 2.6 K was observed for x = 0.6. The obtained superconductivity phase diagram exhibits dome-shaped trend, which is similar to unconventional superconductors, where magnetic fluctuations are essential for superconductivity. In addition, from the c/a lattice constant ratio analysis, we show the possible relationship between the suppression of bulk superconductivity in the Ni-rich compositions and a collapsed tetragonal transition.</description>

      <title>Stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge density wave order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02322v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in a two-dimensional metal, at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of the Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the telltale signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz transitions and Weyl semimetals from a topological superconductor with supercurrent flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A current flowing through a superconductor induces a spatial modulation in its superconducting order parameter, characterized by a wavevector $Q$ related to the total momentum of a Cooper pair. Here we investigate this phenomenon in a $p$-wave topological superconductor, described by a one-dimensional Kitaev model. We demonstrate that, by treating $Q$ as an extra synthetic dimension, the current carrying non-equilibrium steady state can be mapped into the ground state of a half-filled two-dimensional Weyl semimetal, whose Fermi surface exhibits Lifshitz transitions when varying the model parameters. Specifically, the transition from Type-I to Type-II Weyl phases corresponds to the emergence of a gapless $p$-wave superconductor, where Cooper pairs coexist with unpaired electrons and holes. Such transition is signaled by the appearance of a sharp cusp in the $Q$-dependence of the supercurrent, at a critical value $Q^*$ that is robust to variations of the chemical potential $\mu$. We determine the maximal current that the system can sustain in the topological phase, and discuss possible implementations.</description>

      <title>Decoupled static and dynamical charge correlations in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relation between charge order, its quantum fluctuations and optical phonon modes in cuprate superconductors remains an unsolved problem. The exploration of these excitations is however complicated by the presence of twinned domains. Here, we use uniaxial strain in combination with ultra-high-resolution Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) at the oxygen K- and copper L3-edges to study the excitations stemming from the charge ordering wave vector in La1.875Sr0.125CuO4. By detwinning stripe ordering, we demonstrate that the optical phonon anomalies do not show any stripe anisotropy. The low-energy charge excitations also retain an in-plane four-fold symmetry. As such, we find that both phonon and charge excitations are decoupled entirely from the strength of static charge ordering. The almost isotropic character of charge excitations remains a possible source for the strange metal properties found in the normal state of cuprate superconductors.</description>
