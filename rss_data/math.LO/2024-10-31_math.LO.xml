      <title>Etale algebras over finite Heyting algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the concept of local homeomorphism in Esakia spaces. We introduce the notion of etale Heyting H-algebra and establish category-theoretic duality for etale Heyting H-algebra in the case of finite Heyting algebra H. Furthermore, we give an identity that axiomatizes the variety of etale Heyting H-algebras when H is finite. We also show that the category of Stone space-valued (co)presheaves over a finite Esakia space X is equivalent to the slice category of local homeomorphisms over X. The fact is used to show that, in comparison with the case of general Heyting H-algebras, it is easier to compute finite colimits in the category of etale Heyting H-algebras.</description>

      <title>Duality for distributive and implicative semi-lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new duality for distributive and implicative meet semi-lattices. For distributive meet semi-lattices our duality generalizes Priestley's duality for distributive lattices and provides an improvement of Celani's duality. Our generalized Priestley spaces are similar to the ones constructed by Hansoul. Thus, one can view our duality for distributive meet semi-lattices as a completion of Hansoul's work. For implicative meet semi-lattices our duality generalizes Esakia's duality for Heyting algebras and provides an improvement of Vrancken-Mawet's and Celani's dualities. In the finite case it also yield's K\"ohler's duality. Thus, one can view our duality for implicative meet semi-lattices as a completion of K\"ohler's work. As a consequence, we also obtain a new duality for Heyting algebras, which is an alternative to the Esakia duality.</description>

      <title>$\Sigma_1$-Stationary logic as an $\aleph_1$-Abstract Elementary Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mu$-Abstract Elementary Classes are a model theoretic framework introduced in [BGL+16] to encompass classes axiomatized by $\mathbb{L}_{\infty, \infty}$. We show that the framework extends beyond these logics by showing classes axiomatized in $\mathbb{L}(aa)$ with just the $aa$ quantifier are an $\aleph_1$-Abstract Elementary Class.</description>

      <title>Unifying Sequent Systems for G\"odel-L\"ob Provability Logic via Syntactic Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the inter-translatability of proofs between the most prominent sequent-based formalisms for G\"odel-L\"ob provability logic. In particular, we consider Sambin and Valentini's sequent system GLseq, Shamkanov's non-wellfounded and cyclic sequent systems GL$\infty$ and GLcirc, Poggiolesi's tree-hypersequent system CSGL, and Negri's labeled sequent system G3GL. Shamkanov showed how to transform proofs between GLseq, GL$\infty$, and GLcirc, and Gor\'e and Ramanayake showed how to transform proofs between CSGL and G3GL, however, the exact nature of proof transformations between the former three systems and the latter two systems has remained an open problem. We solve this open problem by showing how to restructure tree-hypersequent proofs into an end-active form and introduce a novel linearization technique that transforms such proofs into linear nested sequent proofs. As a result, we obtain a new proof-theoretic tool for extracting linear nested sequent systems from tree-hypersequent systems, which yields the first cut-free linear nested sequent calculus LNGL for G\"odel-L\"ob provability logic. We show how to transform proofs in LNGL into a certain normal form, where proofs repeat in stages of modal and local rule applications, and which are translatable into GLseq and G3GL proofs. These new syntactic transformations, together with those mentioned above, establish full proof-theoretic correspondences between GLseq, GL$\infty$, GLcirc, CSGL, G3GL, and LNGL while also giving (to the best of the author's knowledge) the first constructive proof mappings between structural (viz. labeled, tree-hypersequent, and linear nested sequent) systems and a cyclic sequent system.</description>

      <title>Monotone $T$-convex $T$-differential fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a complete, model complete o-minimal theory extending the theory of real closed ordered fields and assume that $T$ is power bounded. Let $K$ be a model of $T$ equipped with a $T$-convex valuation ring $\mathcal{O}$ and a $T$-derivation $\partial$ such that $\partial$ is monotone, i.e., weakly contractive with respect to the valuation induced by $\mathcal{O}$. We show that the theory of monotone $T$-convex $T$-differential fields, i.e., the common theory of such $K$, has a model completion, which is complete and distal. Among the axioms of this model completion, we isolate an analogue of henselianity that we call $T^{\partial}$-henselianity. We establish an Ax--Kochen/Ershov theorem and further results for monotone $T$-convex $T$-differential fields that are $T^{\partial}$-henselian.</description>

      <title>Generic Absoluteness Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the relation between recurrence axioms and Laver-generic large cardinal axioms in light of principles of generic absoluteness and the Ground Axiom.
  M. Viale proved that Martin's Maximum$^{++}$ together with the assumption that there are class many Woodin cardinals implies $\mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)^{\mathsf{V}}\prec_{\Sigma_2}\mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)^{\mathsf{V}[\mathbb{G}]}$ for a generic $\mathbb{G}$ on any stationary preserving $\mathbb{P}$ which also preserves Bounded Martin's Maximum. We show that a similar but more general conclusion follows from each of $(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_{\Sigma_2}$-${\sf RcA}^+$ (which is a fragment of a reformulation of the Maximality Principle for $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{H}(\kappa)$), and the existence of the tightly $\mathcal{P}$-Laver-generically huge cardinal.
  While under "$\mathcal{P}=$ all stationary preserving posets", our results are not very much more than Viale's Theorem, for other classes of posets, "$\mathcal{P}=$ all proper posets" or "$\mathcal{P}=$ all ccc posets", for example, our theorems are not at all covered by his theorem.
  The assumptions (and hence also the conclusion) of Viale's Theorem are compatible with the Ground Axiom. In contrast, we show that the assumptions of our theorems (for most of the common settings of $\mathcal{P}$ and with a modification of the large cardinal property involved) imply the negation of the Ground Axiom. This fact is used to show that fragments of Recurrence Axiom $(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_\Gamma$-${\sf RcA}^+$ can be different from the corresponding fragments of Maximality Principle ${\sf MP}(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_\Gamma$ for $\Gamma=\Pi_2$ or $\Sigma_2$.</description>

      <title>Enriching Disentanglement: From Logical Definitions to Quantitative Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disentangling the explanatory factors in complex data is a promising approach for generalizable and data-efficient representation learning. While a variety of quantitative metrics for learning and evaluating disentangled representations have been proposed, it remains unclear what properties these metrics truly quantify. In this work, we establish algebraic relationships between logical definitions and quantitative metrics to derive theoretically grounded disentanglement metrics. Concretely, we introduce a compositional approach for converting a higher-order predicate into a real-valued quantity by replacing (i) equality with a strict premetric, (ii) the Heyting algebra of binary truth values with a quantale of continuous values, and (iii) quantifiers with aggregators. The metrics induced by logical definitions have strong theoretical guarantees, and some of them are easily differentiable and can be used as learning objectives directly. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metrics by isolating different aspects of disentangled representations.</description>
