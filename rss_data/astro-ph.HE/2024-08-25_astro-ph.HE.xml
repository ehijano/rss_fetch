      <title>White Dwarf-Black Hole Binary Progenitors of Low Redshift Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although there is strong evidence that many long GRBs are associated with the collapse of a massive star, tantalizing results in recent years have upended the direct association of {\em all} long GRBs with massive stars. In particular, kilonova signals in some long GRB light curves as well as a suggested uptick in the rate density of long GRBs at low redshifts (deviating significantly from the star formation rate) suggest that compact object mergers may be a non-negligible fraction of the long GRB population. Here we investigate the contribution of white dwarf-black hole mergers to the long GRB population. We present evidence for the deviation of the long GRB rate density from the star formation rate at low redshifts, and provide analytic and numerical arguments for why a white dwarf-black hole merger system may be a viable progenitor to explain this deviation. We show the range of parameter space in which the durations, energetics, and rates of these systems can account for a significant sub-population of low-redshift long GRBs.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of the X-ray Polarimetric Properties of Stellar and Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray polarization provides a new way to probe accretion geometry in black hole systems. If the accretion geometry of black holes is similar regardless of mass, we should expect the same to be true of their polarization properties. We compare the polarimetric properties of all non-blazar black holes observed with IXPE. We find that their polarization properties are very similar, particularly in the hard state, where the corona dominates. This tentatively supports the idea that stellar and supermassive black holes share a common coronal geometry.</description>

      <title>Broad-band X-ray spectral and timing properties of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J17498$-$2921 during the 2023 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the broadband spectral and timing properties of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J17498$-$2921 during its April 2023 outburst using data from NICER (1$-$10 keV), NuSTAR (3$-$79 keV), Insight-HXMT (2$-$150 keV), and INTEGRAL (30$-$150 keV). We detect significant 401 Hz pulsations across the 0.5$-$150 keV band. The pulse fraction increases from $\sim$2% at 1 keV to $\sim$13% at 66 keV. Five type-I X-ray bursts have been detected, including three photospheric radius expansion bursts, with a rise time of $\sim$2 s and an exponential decay time of $\sim$5 s. The recurrence time is $\sim$9.1 h, which can be explained by unstable thermonuclear burning of hydrogen-deficient material on the neutron star surface. The quasi-simultaneous 1$-$150 keV broadband spectra from NICER, NuSTAR, and INTEGRAL can be well fitted by an absorbed reflection model, relxillCp, and a Gaussian line of instrumental origin. The Comptonized emission from the hot corona is characterized by a photon index $\Gamma$ of $\sim$1.8 and an electron temperature $kT_{\rm e}$ of $\sim$40 keV. We obtain a low inclination angle $i\sim34^{\circ}$. The accretion disk shows properties of strong ionization, $\log(\xi/{\rm erg~cm~s^{-1}})\sim4.5$, over-solar abundance, $A_{\rm Fe}\sim 7.7$, and high density, $\log(n_{\rm e}/{\rm cm^{-3}})\sim 19.5$. However, a lower disk density with normal abundance and ionization could also be possible. From the inner disk radius $R_{\rm in}=1.67R_{\rm ISCO}$ and the long-term spin-down rate of $-3.1(2)\times10^{-15}~{\rm Hz~s^{-1}}$, we constrain the magnetic field of IGR J17498$-$2921 in the range of $(0.9-2.4)\times10^8$ G.</description>

      <title>Checking the Empirical Relations with the Current Localized Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although fast radio bursts (FRBs) were discovered more than a decade ago, and they have been one of the active fields in astronomy and cosmology, their origins are still unknown. An interesting topic closely related to the origins of FRBs is their classifications. On the other hand, FRBs are actually a promising probe to study cosmology. In the literature, some new classifications of FRBs different from repeaters and non-repeaters were suggested, and some tight empirical relations have been found for them. In particular, Guo and Wei suggested to classify FRBs into the ones associated with old or young populations, which have also some new empirical relations. They also proposed to use one of the empirical relations without dispersion measure (DM) to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology. This shows the potential of the new classification and the empirical relations for FRBs. Nowadays, more than 50 FRBs have been well localized, and hence their redshifts $z$ are observationally known. Thus, it is time to check the empirical relations with the current localized FRBs. We find that many empirical relations still hold, and in particular the one used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology stands firm.</description>

      <title>Detection of a Transient Quasi-periodic Oscillation in $\gamma$-Rays from Blazar PKS 2255-282</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive variability analysis of the blazar PKS 2255-282 using Fermi-LAT observations spanning over four years, from MJD 57783.5 to 59358.5. Our analysis revealed a transient quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a period of 93$\pm$2.6 days. We employed a variety of Fourier-based methods, including the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) and Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform (WWZ), as well as time domain analysis techniques such as Seasonal and Non-Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and the Stochastic modeling with Stochastically Driven Damped Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) models. Consistently, the QPO with a period of 93 days was detected across all methods used. The observed peak in LSP and time-averaged WWZ plots has a significance level of 4.06$\sigma$ and 3.96$\sigma$, respectively. To understand the source of flux modulations in the light curve, we explored various physical models. A plausible scenario involves the precession of the jet with a high Lorentz factor or the movement of a plasma blob along a helical trajectory within the relativistic jet.</description>

      <title>The rates and host galaxies of pair-instability supernovae through cosmic time: Predictions from BPASS and IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) have long been predicted to be the final fates of near-zero-metallicity very massive stars ($Z &lt; Z_\odot/3$, $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{ZAMS} \gtrsim 140 \mathrm{M}_\odot$). However, no definite PISN has been observed to date, leaving theoretical modelling validation open. To investigate the observability of these explosive transients, we combine detailed stellar evolution models for PISNe formation, computed from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code suite, BPASS, with the star formation history of all individual computational elements in the Illustris-TNG simulation. This allows us to compute comic PISN rates and predict their host galaxy properties. Of particular importance is that IllustrisTNG galaxies do not have uniform metallicities throughout, with metal-enriched galaxies often harbouring metal-poor pockets of gas where PISN progenitors may form. Accounting for the chemical inhomogeneities within these galaxies, we find that the peak redshift of PISNe formation is $z=3.5$ instead of the value of $z=6$ when ignoring chemical inhomogeneities within galaxies. Furthermore, the rate increases by an order of magnitude from 1.9 to 29 PISN Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at $z=0$, if the chemical inhomogeneities are considered. Using state-of-the-art theoretical PISN light curves, we find an observed rate of $13.8$ (1.2) visible PISNe per year for the Euclid-Deep survey, or $83$ (7.3) over the six-year lifetime of the mission when considering chemically inhomogeneous (homogenous) systems. Interestingly, only 12 per cent of helium PISN progenitors are sufficiently massive to power a super-luminous supernova event, which can potentially explain why PISN identification in time-domain surveys remains elusive and progress requires dedicated strategies.</description>

      <title>The Radio Spectra of High Luminosity Compact Symmetric Objects (CSO-2s): Implications for Studies of Compact Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses, for the first time, a key aspect of the phenomenology of Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) -- the characteristics of their radio spectra. We present a radio-spectrum description of a complete sample of high luminosity CSOs (CSO-2s), which shows that they exhibit the \textit{complete} range of spectral types, including flat-spectrum sources ($\alpha \ge -0.5$), steep-spectrum sources ($\alpha &lt; -0.5$), and peaked-spectrum sources. We show that there is no clear correlation between spectral type and size, but there is a correlation between the high-frequency spectral index and both object type and size. We also show that, to avoid biasing the data and to understand the various classes of jetted-AGN involved, the complete range of spectral types should be included in studying the general phenomenology of compact jetted-AGN, and that complete samples must be used, selected over a wide range of frequencies. We discuss examples that demonstrate these points. We find that the high-frequency spectral indices of CSO-2s span $-1.3 &lt;\alpha_{\rm hi} &lt; -0.3$, and hence that radio spectral signatures cannot be used to discriminate definitively between CSO-2s, binary galactic nuclei, and millilensed objects, unless they have $\alpha_{\rm hi} &gt;-0.3$.</description>

      <title>Constraining binary mergers in AGN disks using the non-observation of lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dense and dynamic environments within active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks may serve as prolific birthplaces for binary black holes (BBHs) and one possible origin for some of the BBHs detected by gravitational-wave (GW) observatories. We show that a considerable fraction of the BBH in AGN disks will be strongly lensed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Thus, the non-observation of lensed GW signals can be used to constrain the fraction of BBH binaries residing in AGN disks. The non-detection of lensing with current ${\cal O}(100)$ detections will be sufficient to start placing constraints on the fraction of BBHs living within accretion disks near the SMBH. In the next-generation detectors era, with ${\cal O}(10^5)$ BBH observations and no lensed events, we will be able to rule out most migration traps as dominant birthplaces of BBH mergers; moreover, we will be able to constrain the minimum size of the accretion disk. On the other hand, should AGNs constitute a major formation channel, lensed events from AGNs will become prominent in the future.</description>

      <title>Generating ultra-compact neutron stars with bosonic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the properties of neutron stars admixed with selfinteracting scalar bosonic dark matter. The dark matter interaction is described by a generalized $\phi^n$ power-law potential. We perform a stability analysis of these two-fluid objects by studying the onset of the unstable radial modes. We find ultra-compact neutron star-dark matter configurations where the neutron star matter is confined to a core radius of values below $7$ km which is unreachable for pure neutron stars. The total gravitational maximum mass of these ultra-compact configurations can have values of $3.4 \, M_\odot$. With our general ansatz of the power-law potential we show that the compactness of these solutions can be extreme, i.e. the compactness is $C = 1/3$ or even larger, making them compact enough to have a light-ring mimicking black holes. These ultra-compact objects are stable and possess a dark matter halo while having a hadronic matter core. With the addition of dark matter to neutron stars recent unusual mass-radius measurements of compact stars can be explained. We conclude that apparently contradictory measurements of neutron star masses and radii could be not only an indication of the presence of dark matter around a the hadronic matter core which is stabilized by the gravitational potential of dark matter but could also serve to disentangle the selfinteraction strength of dark matter. Our work points to a stiff equation of state for the dark matter fluid, rather than a soft one.</description>

      <title>Polarization Measurement of Gamma-ray Bursts with Fermi-GBM: The Case of GRB 180720B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve confident non-zero polarization measurements for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) we need sensitive polarimeters and bright GRBs. Here we report on the polarimetric analysis of the bright GRB 180720B using the \Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). We rely on the detection of photons that scattered off Earth's atmosphere and into GBM from this burst. Polarized gamma-rays will exhibit a characteristic pattern when scattering off the atmosphere that differs from an unpolarized beam. We compare the measured photon counts in the GBM detectors with extensive simulations of polarized beams to derive the most probable polarization degree (PD) and angle (PA). For the entire GRB, we find PD$=72^{+24}_{-30}\% ~(1\sigma)$ and PA$=91^{+11}_{-9}$ deg ($1\sigma$, equatorial frame). Interestingly, the PA value is broadly consistent with an early optical PA measurement by the Kanata telescope, starting shortly after the end of the prompt emission. The consistency of PAs lends support for this method. The relatively high polarization degree (albeit with large uncertainties) agrees with similar past measurements suggesting that some GRBs might be highly polarized. This will be confirmed or refuted by the upcoming dedicated GRB polarimeters.</description>

      <title>Morphology of 137 Fast Radio Bursts down to Microseconds Timescales from The First CHIME/FRB Baseband Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectro-temporal analysis of 137 fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the first CHIME/FRB baseband catalog, including 125 one-off bursts and 12 repeat bursts, down to microsecond resolution using the least-squares optimization fitting routine: fitburst. Our measured values are compared with those in the first CHIME/FRB intensity catalog, revealing that nearly one-third of our sample exhibits additional burst components at higher time resolutions. We measure sub-burst components within burst envelopes as narrow as $\sim$23 $\mu$s (FWHM), with 20% of the sample displaying sub-structures narrower than 100 $\mu$s, offering constraints on emission mechanisms. Scattering timescales in the sample range from 30 $\mu$s to 13 ms at 600 MHz. We observe no correlations between scattering time and dispersion measure, rotation measure, or linear polarization fraction, with the latter suggesting that depolarization due to multipath propagation is negligible in our sample. Bursts with narrower envelopes ($\leq$ 1 ms) in our sample exhibit higher flux densities, indicating the potential presence of sub-ms FRBs that are being missed by our real-time system below a brightness threshold. Most multicomponent bursts in our sample exhibit sub-burst separations of $\leq$ 1 ms, with no bursts showing separations $&lt;$41 $\mu$s, even at a time resolution of 2.56 $\mu$s, but both scattering and low signal-to-noise ratio can hinder detection of additional components. Lastly, given the morphological diversity of our sample, we suggest that one-off and repeating FRBs can come from different classes but have overlapping property distributions.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories of dissipative fluids with one-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A system with a one-form global symmetry at finite temperature can be viewed as a dissipative fluid of string-like objects. In this work, we classify and construct the most general effective field theories for hydrodynamics of such string fluids, in a probe limit where the one-form charge density is decoupled from the energy-momentum tensor. We show that at leading order in the derivative expansion, there are two distinct types of diffusive transport in a string fluid depending on the discrete spacetime symmetries present in it. One particular application of interest is magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effective field theories describe the diffusion of magnetic field lines. Due to the distinction between the effective field theories for different discrete symmetries, we show that the MHD of a fluid with charge conjugation symmetry is qualitatively different from that of a neutron star, which we previously discussed in arXiv:2207.01636. The explicit effective actions that we write down can be used to obtain the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ up to cubic order in momenta for each of the different discrete symmetry choices. As another application of this formalism, we show that when the one-form symmetry is spontaneously broken, the effective action reduces to the Maxwell theory. This confirms the interpretation of the photon as a Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a one-form symmetry.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical shear mixing in subsonic boundary layers and its role in the thermonuclear explosion of classical novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition zone between the white dwarf (WD) envelope and a circumstellar accretion disk in classical novae, the boundary layer, is a region of strong dissipation and intense vorticity. In this strongly sheared layer, the hydrogen-rich accreted gas is expected to mix with the underlying WD outermost layers so the conditions for the onset of the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) in classical nova will be different from the the standard treatment of the onset and subsequent mixing. We applied the critical layer instability (CLI) to the boundary between a disk-accreted H/He zone and the C/O - or O/Ne - rich outer layers of a mass-accreting WD in a cataclysmic binary and then used the resulting structure as input to one-dimensional nuclear-hydrodynamic simulations of the nova outburst. We simulated the subsonic mixing process in two dimensions for conditions appropriate for the inner disk and a CO 0.8 solar mass and CO and ONe 1.25 solar mass WDs using the compressible hydrodynamics code PLUTO. The resulting compositional profile was then imported into the one-dimensional nuclear-hydrodynamics code SHIVA to simulate the triggering and growth rate for the TNR and subsequent envelope ejection. We find that the deep shear-driven mixing changes the triggering and development of the TNR. In particular, the time to reach peak temperature is significantly shorter, and the ejected mass and maximum velocity of the ejecta substantially greater, than the current treatment. The 7Li yield is reduced by about an order of magnitude relative to the current treatments.</description>

      <title>Laser-Driven Proton-Only Acceleration in a Multicomponent Near-Critical-Density Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An experimental investigation of collisionless shock ion acceleration is presented using a multicomponent plasma and a high-intensity picosecond duration laser pulse. Protons are the only accelerated ions when a near-critical-density plasma is driven by a laser with a modest normalized vector potential. The results of particle-in-cell simulations imply that collisionless shock may accelerate protons alone selectively, which can be an important tool for understanding the physics of inaccessible collisionless shocks in space and astrophysical plasma.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic equation of state with a momentum dependent interaction and neutron star structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and basic properties of dense nuclear matter still remain one of the open problems of Physics. In particular, the composition of the matter that composes neutron stars is under theoretical and experimental investigation. Among the theories that have been proposed, apart from the classical one where the composition is dominated by hadrons, the existence or coexistence of free quark matter is a dominant guess. An approach towards this solution is the phenomenological view according to which the existence of quarkyonic matter plays a dominant role in the construction of the equation of state (EOS). According to it the structure of the EOS is based on the existence of the quarkyonic particle which is a hybrid state of a particle that combines properties of hadronic and quark matter with a corresponding representation in momentum space. In this paper we propose a phenomenological model for quarkyonic matter, borrowed from corresponding applications in hadronic models, where the interaction in the quarkyonic matter depends not only on the position but also on the momentum of the quarkyonic particles. This consideration, as we demonstrate, can have a remarkable consequence on the shape of the EOS and thus on the properties of neutron stars, offering a sufficiently flexible model. Comparison with recent observational data can place constraints on the parameterization of the particular model and help improve its reliability.</description>

      <title>A GPU-accelerated semi-coherent hierarchical search for stellar-mass binary inspiral signals in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes with LISA remains a challenging open problem. Conventional template-bank approaches to the search are impossible due to the prohibitive number of templates that would be required. This paper continues the development of a hierarchical semi-coherent stochastic search, extending it to a full end-to-end pipeline that is then applied to multiple mock LISA data streams which include simulated noise. Particle swarm optimization is used as a stochastic search algorithm, tracking multiple maxima of a semi-coherent search statistic defined over source parameter space. The pipeline is accelerated by the use of graphical processing units (GPUs). No prior information from observations by ground-based detectors is used; this is necessary in order to provide advance warning of the merger. We find that the pipeline is able to detect sources with signal-to-noise ratios as low as $\rho\sim 17$, we demonstrate that these searches can directly seed coarse parameter estimation in cases where the search trigger is loud. An example of how the false-alarm probability can be estimated for this type of GW search is also included.</description>

      <title>To Be or not to Be: the role of rotation in modeling Galactic Be X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Be X-ray binaries (Be-XRBs) are one of the largest subclasses of high-mass X-ray binaries, comprised of a rapidly rotating Be star and neutron star companion in an eccentric orbit, intermittently accreting material from a decretion disk around the donor. Originating from binary stellar evolution, Be-XRBs are of significant interest to binary population synthesis (BPS) studies, encapsulating the physics of supernovae, common envelope, and mass transfer (MT). Using the state-of-the-art BPS code, POSYDON, which relies on pre-computed grids of detailed binary stellar evolution models, we investigate the Galactic Be-XRB population. POSYDON incorporates stellar rotation self-consistently during MT phases, enabling detailed examination of the rotational distribution of Be stars in multiple phases of evolution. Our fiducial BPS and Be-XRB model align well with the orbital properties of Galactic Be-XRBs, emphasizing the role of rotational constraints. Our modeling reveals a rapidly rotating population ($\omega/\omega_\mathrm{crit} \gtrsim 0.3$) of Be-XRB-like systems with a strong peak at intermediate rotation rates ($\omega/\omega_\mathrm{crit} \simeq 0.6$) in close alignment with observations. All Be-XRBs undergo a MT phase before the first compact object forms, with over half experiencing a second MT phase from a stripped helium companion (Case BB). Computing rotationally-limited MT efficiencies and applying them to our population, we derive a physically motivated MT efficiency distribution, finding that most Be-XRBs have undergone highly non-conservative MT ($\bar{\beta}_\mathrm{rot} \simeq 0.05$). Our study underscores the importance of detailed angular momentum modeling during MT in interpreting Be-XRB populations, emphasizing this population as a key probe for the stability and efficiency of MT in interacting binaries.</description>

      <title>Polarisation properties of X-ray emission from accreting supermassive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This dissertation elaborates on X-ray polarisation features of astrophysical environments near accreting black holes. Although the work was originally assigned to supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei, the results are also largely applicable to stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems. Several numerical models predicting the X-ray polarisation from these sources are presented, including their immediate applications in the interpretation of the latest discoveries achieved thanks to the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) mission that began operating in December 2021. The modeling ranges from radiative transfer effects in atmospheres of accretion discs to general-relativistic signatures of X-rays travelling in vacuum near the central black holes to reprocessing events in distant, circumnuclear components. Various scales in physical and computational complexity are examined. A unifying element of this dissertation is the focus on reflection of X-rays from partially ionized matter.</description>

      <title>Fermi and eROSITA Bubbles as Persistent Structures of the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles, large diffuse structures in our Galaxy, can be the by-products of the steady star formation activity. To simultaneously explain the star formation history of the Milky Way and the metallicity of $\sim$ Z$_\odot$ at the Galactic disk, a steady Galactic wind driven by cosmic-rays is required. For tenuous gases with a density of $\lesssim$10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$, the cosmic-ray heating dominates over radiative cooling, and the gas can maintain the virial temperature of $\sim$0.3 keV ideal for escape from the Galactic system as the wind. A part of the wind falls back onto the disk like a galactic fountain flow. We model the wind dynamics according to the Galactic evolution scenario and find that the scale height and surface brightness of the X-ray and the hadronic gamma-ray emissions from such fountain flow region can be consistent with the observed properties of the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. This implies that the bubbles are persistent structures of the Milky Way existing over (at least) the last $\sim$1 Gyr, rather than evanescent structures formed by non-trivial, $\sim$10 Myr past Galactic Center transient activities.</description>

      <title>New polarimetric study of the galactic X-ray burster GX 13+1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly magnetized neutron stars (WMNS) are complicated sources with challenging phenomenology. For decades, they have been studied via spectrometry and timing. It has been established that the spectrum of WMNSs consists of several components traditionally associated with the accretion disk, the boundary or spreading layer, and the wind and their interactions with each other. Since 2022, WMNSs have been actively observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). Polarimetric studies provided new information about the behavior and geometry of these sources. One of the most enigmatic sources of the class, galactic X-ray burster GX 13+1 was first observed with IXPE in October 2023. A strongly variable polarization at the level 2-5$\%$ was detected with the source showing a rotation of the polarization angle (PA) that hinted towards the misalignment within the system. The second observation was performed in February 2024 with a complementary observation by Swift/XRT. IXPE measured an overall polarization degree (PD) of 2.5$\%$ and the PA of 24 degrees, and the Swift/XRT data helped us evaluate the galactic absorption and fit the continuum. Here we study the similarities and differences between the polarimetric properties of the source during the two observations. We confirm the expectation of the misalignment in the system and the assignment of the harder component to the boundary layer. We emphasize the importance of the wind in the system. We note the difference in the variation of polarimetric properties with energy and with time.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Inner 0.1 pc of a Supermassive Black Hole Environment with the Tidal Disruption Event and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter AT 2022upj</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) are objects showing transient high-ionization lines in the centers of galaxies. They have been attributed to echoes of high-energy flares of ionizing radiation, such as those produced by tidal disruption events (TDEs), but have only recently been observed within hundreds of days after an optical transient was detected. AT 2022upj is a nuclear UV-optical flare at z=0.054 with spectra showing [Fe X] {\lambda}6375 and [Fe XIV] {\lambda}5303 during the optical peak, the earliest presence of extreme coronal lines during an ongoing transient. AT 2022upj is also the second ever ECLE (and first with a concurrent flare) to show broad He II {\lambda}4686 emission, a key signature of optical/UV TDEs. We also detect X-ray emission during the optical transient phase, which may be related to the source of ionizing photons for the extreme coronal lines. Finally, we analyze the spectroscopic evolution of each emission line and find that [Fe X] and [Fe XIV] weaken within 400d of optical peak, while [Fe VII] {\lambda}5720, [Fe VII] {\lambda}6087, and [O III] {\lambda}{\lambda}4959,5007 emerge over the same period. The velocities of the iron lines indicate circumnuclear gas within 0.1pc of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), while a dust echo inferred from NEOWISE data indicates that circumnuclear dust lies at a minimum of 0.4pc away, providing evidence of stratified material around a SMBH. AT 2022upj is the first confirmed ECLE-TDE with clear signatures of both classes. This event's spectroscopic evolution on a $\sim$year unveils the impact of highly energetic flares such as TDEs on the complex environments around SMBHs.</description>

      <title>JADES. The diverse population of infant Black Holes at 4&lt;z&lt;11: merging, tiny, poor, but mighty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01230v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present 12 new AGN at 4&lt;z&lt;7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z=10.6) revealed through the detection of a Broad Line Region as seen in Halpha. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases we find evidence for two broad components of Halpha which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs). The inferred BH masses range between 8 x 10^7 Msun down to 4 x 10^5 Msun, interestingly probing the regime expected for Direct Collapse Black Holes (DCBHs). The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities (~10^44-10^45 erg/s) imply accretion rates that are &lt; 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BHs, with M_BH ~ 10^6 Msun, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BH at z~4-11 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies stellar masses when compared to the local M_BH-Mstar relation, and even approaching M_BH~Mstar, as expected for DCBHs and super-Eddington scenarios. However, we find that these early BHs tend to be more consistent with the local relation between M_BH and velocity dispersion, as well as between M_BH and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the BPT excitation-diagnostic diagram these AGN are located in the region that is that is locally occupied by star-forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what expected for AGN hosted in metal poor galaxies (Z ~ 0.1-0.2 Zsun). The fraction of broad line AGN with L_AGN &gt; 10^44 erg/s, among galaxies in the redshift range 4&lt;z&lt;6, is about 10%, suggesting that the contribution of AGN and their hosts to the reionization of the Universe is &gt; 10%.</description>

      <title>Cold Filaments Formed in Hot Wake Flows Uplifted by Active Galactic Nucleus Bubbles in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength observations indicate that the intracluster medium in some galaxy clusters contains cold filaments, while their formation mechanism remains debated. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we show that cold filaments could naturally condense out of hot gaseous wake flows uplifted by the jet-inflated active galactic nucleus (AGN) bubbles. Consistent with observations, the simulated filaments extend to tens of kiloparsecs from the cluster center, with a representative mass of $\rm 10^{8}- 10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$ for a typical AGN outburst energy of $10^{60}~ \rm erg$. They show smooth velocity gradients, stretching typically from inner inflows to outer outflows with velocity dispersions of several hundred kilometers per second. The properties of cold filaments are affected substantially by jet properties. Compared to kinetic-energy-dominated jets, thermal-energy-dominated jets are easier to produce long cold filaments with large masses as observed. AGN jets with an early turn-on time, a low jet base, or a very high power tend to overheat the cluster center, and produce short cold filaments that take a relatively long time to condense out.</description>

      <title>BxC Toolkit: Generating Tailored Turbulent 3D Magnetic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent states are ubiquitous in plasmas and the understanding of turbulence is fundamental in modern astrophysics. Numerical simulations, which are the state-of-the-art approach to the study of turbulence, require substantial computing resources. Recently, attention shifted to methods for generating synthetic turbulent magnetic fields, affordably creating fields with parameter-controlled characteristic features of turbulence. In this context, the BxC toolkit was developed and validated against direct numerical simulations (DNS) of isotropic turbulent magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate novel extensions of BxC to generate realistic turbulent magnetic fields in a fast, controlled, geometric approach. First, we perform a parameter study to determine quantitative relations between the BxC input parameters and desired characteristic features of the turbulent power spectrum, such as the extent of the inertial range, its spectral slope, and the injection and dissipation scale. Second, we introduce in the model a set of structured background magnetic fields B0, as a natural and more realistic extension to the purely isotropic turbulent fields. Third, we extend the model to include anisotropic turbulence properties in the generated fields. With all these extensions combined, our tool can quickly generate any desired structured magnetic field with controlled, anisotropic turbulent fluctuations, faster by orders of magnitude with respect to DNSs. These can be used, e.g., to provide initial conditions for DNS simulations or easily generate synthetic data for many astrophysical settings, all at otherwise unaffordable resolutions.</description>
