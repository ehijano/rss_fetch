      <title>Velocity Syzygies and Bounding Syzygy Moments in the Planar Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Newtonian planar three-body problem, defining a syzygy (velocity syzygy) as a configuration where the positions (velocities) of the three bodies become collinear. We demonstrate that if the total energy is negative, every collision-free solution has an infinite number of velocity syzygies. Specifically, the velocities of the three bodies become parallel within every interval of time containing three consecutive syzygies. Using comparison theory for matrix Riccati equations, we derive new upper and lower bounds on the moments when syzygies occur.</description>

      <title>On the mean $\Psi$-intermediate dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the mean $\Psi$-intermediate dimension which has a value between the mean Hausdorff dimension and the metric mean dimension, and prove the equivalent definition of the mean Hausdorff dimension and the metric mean dimension. Furthermore, we delve into the core properties of the mean $\Psi$-intermediate dimensions. Additionally, we establish the mass distribution principle, a Frostman-type lemma, H\"older distortion, and derive the corresponding product formula. Finally, we provide illustrative examples of the mean $\Psi$-intermediate dimension, demonstrating its practical applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic generalized Kolmogorov systems with small diffusion: II. Explicit approximations for periodic solutions in distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is Part II of a two-part series on coexistence states study in stochastic generalized Kolmogorov systems under small diffusion. Part I provided a complete characterization for approximating invariant probability measures and density functions, while here, we focus on explicit approximations for periodic solutions in distribution. Two easily implementable methods are introduced: periodic normal approximation (PNOA) and periodic log-normal approximation (PLNA). These methods offer unified algorithms to calculate the mean and covariance matrix, and verify positive definiteness, without additional constraints like non-degenerate diffusion. Furthermore, we explore essential properties of the covariance matrix, particularly its connection under periodic and non-periodic drift coefficients. Our new approximation methods significantly relax the minimal criteria for positive definiteness of the solution of the discrete-type Lyapunov equation. Some numerical experiments are provided to support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Long Sequence Decoder Network for Mobile Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction and estimation of spatio-temporal patterns poses significant challenges when sensor measurements are limited. The use of mobile sensors adds additional complexity due to the change in sensor locations over time. In such cases, historical measurement and sensor information are useful for better performance, including models such as Kalman filters, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer models. However, many of these approaches often fail to efficiently handle long sequences of data in such scenarios and are sensitive to noise. In this paper, we consider a model-free approach using the {\em structured state space sequence} (S4D) model as a deep learning layer in traditional sequence models to learn a better representation of historical sensor data. Specifically, it is integrated with a shallow decoder network for reconstruction of the high-dimensional state space. We also introduce a novel initialization of the S4D model using a Butterworth filter design to reduce noise in the inputs. Consequently, we construct a robust S4D (rS4D) model by appending the filtering S4D layer before the original S4D structure. This robust variant enhances the capability to accurately reconstruct spatio-temporal patterns with noisy mobile sensor measurements in long sequence. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our model achieves better performance compared with previous approaches. Our results underscore the efficacy of leveraging state space models within the context of spatio-temporal data reconstruction and estimation using limited mobile sensor resources, particularly in terms of long-sequence dependency and robustness to noise.</description>

      <title>The geometry of preperiodic points in families of maps on $\mathbb{P}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of algebraic families of maps on $\mathbb{P}^N$, over the field $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers, and the geometry of their preperiodic points. The goal of this note is to formulate a conjectural characterization of the subvarieties of $S \times\mathbb{P}^N$ containing a Zariski-dense set of preperiodic points, where the parameter space $S$ is a quasiprojective complex algebraic variety; the characterization is given in terms of the non-vanishing of a power of the invariant Green current associated to the family of maps. This conjectural characterization is inspired by and generalizes the Relative Manin-Mumford Conjecture for families of abelian varieties, recently proved by Gao and Habegger, and it includes as special cases the Manin-Mumford Conjecture (theorem of Raynaud) and the Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture (posed by Ghioca, Tucker, and Zhang). We provide examples where the equivalence is known to hold, and we show that several recent results can be viewed as special cases. Finally, we give the proof of one implication in the conjectural characterization.</description>

      <title>Designing Chaotic Attractors: A Semi-supervised Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamics are ubiquitous in nature and useful in engineering, but their geometric design can be challenging. Here, we propose a method using reservoir computing to generate chaos with a desired shape by providing a periodic orbit as a template, called a skeleton. We exploit a bifurcation of the reservoir to intentionally induce unsuccessful training of the skeleton, revealing inherent chaos. The emergence of this untrained attractor, resulting from the interaction between the skeleton and the reservoir's intrinsic dynamics, offers a novel semi-supervised framework for designing chaos.</description>

      <title>Non-left-orderability of lattices in higher-rank semisimple Lie groups (after Deroin and Hurtado)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected, semisimple, real Lie group with finite centre, with real rank at least two. B.Deroin and S.Hurtado recently proved the 30-year-old conjecture that no irreducible lattice in $G$ has a left-invariant total order. (Equivalently, they proved that no such lattice has a nontrivial, orientation-preserving action on the real line.) We will explain many of the main ideas of the proof, by using them to prove the analogous result for lattices in $p$-adic semisimple groups. The $p$-adic case is easier, because some of the technical issues do not arise.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis and Monte Carlo Based Uncertainty Quantification of the In-process Modal Parameters in Milling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The material removal rates during milling operations are affected by the selection of the cutting depth and spindle speed. Poor selection of these parameters can result in chatter or suboptimal material removal rates. Stability Lobe Diagrams (SLDs) are the well-known approach to selecting appropriate chatter-free values for these parameters. The Physics-based stability lobe diagram is usually generated using the structural dynamics and the cutting parameters. However, since the machine dynamics are measured in the static state of the machine (zero speed), the generated SLD is not reliable as the machine behavior may vary during the cutting operations. Besides, measuring structural dynamics parameters under cutting conditions is difficult and needs new equipment. This study proposes a new approach to determining in-process structural dynamics parameters based on a multivariate Newton-Raphson method. The physics-based model is combined with empirical records to extract reliable structural dynamics parameters inversely. Some examples based on synthetic data are presented to illustrate this inverse approach. Also, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated on an empirical data set and its ability to improve the stability boundary is verified. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis is performed to quantify the exposure of the SLD to the changes in each structural dynamics parameter.</description>

      <title>On pairs of spectrum maximizing products with different numbers of the same name factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, J. Bochi and P. Laskawiec constructed an example of a set of matrices $\{A,B\}$ having two different (up to cyclic permutations of factors) spectrum maximizing products, $AABABB$ and $BBABAA$. In this paper, we identify a class of matrix sets for which the existence of at least one spectrum maximizing product with an odd number of factors automatically entails the existence of another spectrum maximizing product. Moreover, in addition to Bochi--Laskawiec's example, the number of factors of the same name (factors of the form $A$ or $B$) in these matrix products turns out to be different. The efficiency of the proposed approach is confirmed by constructing an example of a set of $2\times2$ matrices $\{A,B\}$ that has spectrum maximizing products of the form $BAA$ and $BBA$.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in 3D Spaces under Motion Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a three-dimensional nonlinear trajectory tracking control strategy for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of spatial constraints. As opposed to many existing control strategies, which do not consider spatial constraints, the proposed strategy considers spatial constraints on each degree of freedom movement of the UAV. Such consideration makes the design appealing for many practical applications, such as pipeline inspection, boundary tracking, etc. The proposed design accounts for the limited information about the inertia matrix, thereby affirming its inherent robustness against unmodeled dynamics and other imperfections. We rigorously show that the UAV will converge to its desired path by maintaining bounded position, orientation, and linear and angular speeds. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy through various numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Flow Map Learning of PDEs from Incomplete, Limited, and Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computational technique for modeling the evolution of dynamical systems in a reduced basis, with a focus on the challenging problem of modeling partially-observed partial differential equations (PDEs) on high-dimensional non-uniform grids. We address limitations of previous work on data-driven flow map learning in the sense that we focus on noisy and limited data to move toward data collection scenarios in real-world applications. Leveraging recent work on modeling PDEs in modal and nodal spaces, we present a neural network structure that is suitable for PDE modeling with noisy and limited data available only on a subset of the state variables or computational domain. In particular, spatial grid-point measurements are reduced using a learned linear transformation, after which the dynamics are learned in this reduced basis before being transformed back out to the nodal space. This approach yields a drastically reduced parameterization of the neural network compared with previous flow map models for nodal space learning. This primarily allows for smaller training data sets, but also enables reduced training times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an analogue of topological boundary of discrete groups $\Gamma$, we define the noncommutative topological boundary of tracial von Neumann algebras $(M,\tau)$ and apply it to generalize the main results of [AHO23], showing that for a trace preserving action $\Gamma \curvearrowright(A,\tau_A)$ on an amenable tracial von Neumann algebra, a $\Gamma$-invariant measure $\mu\in\mathrm{Prob}(\mathrm{SA}(\Gamma\ltimes A))$ supported on amenable intermediate subalgebras between $A$ and $\Gamma\ltimes A$ is necessary supported on the subalgebras of $\mathrm{Rad}(\Gamma)\ltimes A$. By taking $(A,\tau)=L^\infty(X,\nu_X)$ for a free p.m.p. action $\Gamma \curvearrowright(X,\nu_X)$, we obtain a similar results for the invariant random subequivalence relations of $\mathcal{R}_{\Gamma \curvearrowright X}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01989v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the semi-flow given by the continuous time shift $\Theta_t:\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{D} $, $t \geq 0$, acting on the
  $\mathcal{D} $ of \textit{c\`{a}dl\`{a}g} paths $w: [0,\infty) \to S^1$, where $S^1$ is the unitary circle. We equip the space $\mathcal{D} $ with the Skorokhod metric, and we show that the semi-flow is expanding. We also introduce a stochastic semi-group $e^{t\, L}$, $t \geq 0,$ where $L$ acts linearly on continuous functions $f:S^1\to\mathbb{R}$. This stochastic semigroup and an initial vector of probability $\pi$ define an associated stationary shift-invariant probability $\mathbb{P}$ on the Polish space $\mathcal{D} $. Given such $\mathbb{P}$ and an H\"older potential $V:S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$, we define a continuous time Ruelle operator, which is described by a family of linear operators $ \mathbb{L}^t_V$, $t\geq 0,$ acting on continuous functions $\varphi: S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$. More precisely, given any H\"older $V$ and $t\geq 0$, the operator $ \mathbb{L}^t_V$, is defined by
  $\varphi \to \psi(y) = \mathbb{L}^t_V(\varphi)(y)= \int_{w(t)=y} e^{ \int_0^t V(w(s)) ds} \varphi (w(0)) d \mathbb{P}(w).$
  For some specific parameters we show the existence of an eigenvalue $\lambda_V$ and an associated H\"older eigenfunction $\varphi_V&gt;0$.After a coboundary procedure we obtain another stochastic semigroup, with infinitesimal generator $L_V$, and this will define a new probability $\mathbb{P}_V$ on $\mathcal{D}$, which we call the Gibbs (or, equilibrium) probability for the potential $V$. In this case, we define entropy for some shift-invariant probabilities on $\mathcal{D}$, and we consider a variational problem of pressure. Finally, we define entropy production and present our main result: we analyze its relation with time-reversal and symmetry of $L$. We also show that the continuous-time shift $\Theta_t$, acting on the Skorohod space $D$, is expanding.</description>

Abstract: We establish a connection between two variants of van der Corput's Difference Theorem (vdCDT) for second countable amenable groups $G$ and the ergodic hierarchy of mixing properties of a unitary representation $U$ of $G$. In particular, we show that one variant of vdCDT corresponds to subrepresentations of the left regular representation, and another variant of vdCDT corresponds to the absence of finite dimensional subrepresentations. We then obtain applications for measure preserving actions of countable abelian groups.</description>

      <title>On Hamiltonian projective billiards on boundaries of products of convex bodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K\subset\mathbb R^n_q$, $T\subset\mathbb R^n_p$ be two bounded strictly convex bodies (open subsets) with $C^6$-smooth boundaries. We consider the product $\overline K\times\overline T\subset\mathbb R^{2n}_{q,p}$ equipped with the standard symplectic form $\omega=\sum_{j=1}^ndq_j\wedge dp_j$. The $(K,T)$-billiard orbits are continuous curves in the boundary $\partial(K\times T)$ whose intersections with the open dense subset $(K\times\partial T)\cup(\partial K\times T)$ are tangent to the characteristic line field given by kernels of the restrictions of the symplectic form $\omega$ to the tangent spaces to the boundary. For every $(q,p)\in K\times \partial T$ the characteristic line in $T_{(q,p)}\mathbb R^{2n}$ is directed by the vector $(\vec n(p),0)$, where $\vec n(p)$ is the exterior normal to $T_p\partial T$, and similar statement holds for $(q,p)\in\partial K\times T$. The projection of each $(K,T)$-billiard orbit to $K$ is an orbit of the so-called $T$-billiard in $K$. In the case, when $T$ is centrally-symmetric, this is the billiard in $\mathbb R^n_q$ equipped with Minkowski Finsler structure "dual to $T$", with Finsler reflection law introduced in a joint paper by S.Tabachnikov and E.Gutkin in 2002. Studying $(K,T)$-billiard orbits is closely related to C.Viterbo's Symplectic Isoperimetric Conjecture (recently disproved by P.Haim-Kislev and Y.Ostrover) and the famous Mahler Conjecture in convex geometry. We study the special case, when the $T$-billiard reflection law is the projective law introduced by S.Tabachnikov, i.e., given by projective involutions of the projectivized tangent spaces $T_q\mathbb R^n$, $q\in\partial K$. We show that this happens, if and only if $T$ is an ellipsoid, or equivalently, if all the $T$-billiards are simultaneously affine equivalent to Euclidean billiards. As an application, we deduce analogous results for Finsler billiards.</description>

      <title>The differential of self-consistent transfer operators and the local convergence to equilibrium of mean field strongly coupled dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the differential of a self-consistent transfer operator at a fixed point of the operator itself and show that its spectral properties can be used to establish a kind of local exponential convergence to equilibrium: probability measures near the fixed point converge exponentially fast to the fixed point by the iteration of the transfer operator. This holds also in the strong coupling case. We also show that for mean field coupled systems satisfying uniformly a Lasota-Yorke inequality also the differential does. We present examples of application of the general results to deterministic expanding maps outside the weak coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Predictability of Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06006v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To assess the quality of a probabilistic prediction for stochastic dynamical systems (SDSs), scoring rules assign a numerical score based on the predictive distribution and the measured state. In this paper, we propose an $\epsilon$-logarithm score that generalizes the celebrated logarithm score by considering a neighborhood with radius $\epsilon$. We characterize the probabilistic predictability of an SDS by optimizing the expected score over the space of probability measures. We show how the probabilistic predictability is quantitatively determined by the neighborhood radius, the differential entropies of process noises, and the system dimension. Given any predictor, we provide approximations for the expected score with an error of scale $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$. In addition to the expected score, we also analyze the asymptotic behaviors of the score on individual trajectories. Specifically, we prove that the score on a trajectory can converge to the expected score when the process noises are independent and identically distributed. Moreover, the convergence speed against the trajectory length $T$ is of scale $\mathcal{O}(T^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ in the sense of probability. Finally, numerical examples are given to elaborate the results.</description>

      <title>Large-scale circulation reversals explained by pendulum correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a low-order dynamical system to describe thermal convection in an annular domain. The model derives systematically from a Fourier-Laurent truncation of the governing Navier-Stokes Boussinesq equations and accounts for spatial dependence of the flow and temperature fields. Comparison with fully-resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) shows that the model captures parameter bifurcations and reversals of the large-scale circulation (LSC), including states of (i) steady circulating flow, (ii) chaotic LSC reversals, and (iii) periodic LSC reversals. Casting the system in terms of the fluid's angular momentum and center of mass (CoM) reveals equivalence to a damped pendulum with forcing that raises the CoM above the fulcrum. This formulation offers a transparent mechanism for LSC reversals, namely the inertial overshoot of a forced pendulum, and it yields an explicit formula for the frequency $f^*$ of regular LSC reversals in the high Rayleigh-number limit. This formula is shown to be in excellent agreement with DNS and produces the scaling law $f^* \sim Ra^{0.5}$.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Safety-Critical Control for Dynamically Coupled Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As modern systems become ever more connected with complex dynamic coupling relationships, developing safe control methods becomes paramount. In this paper, we discuss the relationship of node-level safety definitions for individual agents with local neighborhood dynamics. We define a collaborative control barrier function (CCBF) and provide conditions under which sets defined by these functions will be forward invariant. We use collaborative node-level control barrier functions to construct a novel \edit{decentralized} algorithm for the safe control of collaborating network agents and provide conditions under which the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a viable set of safe control actions for all agents. We illustrate these results on a networked susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a uniform vector-valued Wiener-Wintner Theorem for a class of operators that includes compositions of ergodic Koopman operators with contractive multiplication operators. Our results are new even in the case of complex-valued functions, as they also apply to some non-positive non-contractive operators, and they give new uniform pointwise theorems for ergodic, weakly mixing, and mildly mixing Koopman operators.</description>

      <title>Quantum space-time Poincar\'e inequality for Lindblad dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mixing properties of primitive hypocoercive Lindblad dynamics. By extending the variational framework originally developed for underdamped Langevin dynamics, we derive fully explicit and constructive exponential decay estimates for the convergence in the noncommutative $L^2$-norm. Our analysis relies on establishing a quantum analog of space-time Poincar\'{e} inequalities. To complement these hypocoercive estimates, we also analyze the limiting behavior of the spectral gap for Lindblad dynamics with a large coherent contribution, providing sharper convergence rate estimates in this asymptotic regime. A number of concrete examples are provided as applications of our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider labelings of a finite regular tree by a finite alphabet subject to restrictions specified by a nonnegative transition matrix, propose an algorithm for determining whether the set of possible configurations on the last row of the tree is independent of the symbol at the root, and prove that the algorithm succeeds in a bounded number of steps, provided that the dimension of the tree is greater than or equal to the maximum row sum of the transition matrix. (The question was motivated by calculation of topological pressure on trees and is an extension of the idea of primitivity for nonnegative matrices.)</description>
