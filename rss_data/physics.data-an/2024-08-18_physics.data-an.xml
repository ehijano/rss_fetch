      <title>Percolation analysis of spatio-temporal distribution of population in Seoul and Helsinki</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal distribution of urban population is crucial to understand the structure and dynamics of cities. Most studies, however, have focused on the microscopic structure of cities such as their few most crowded areas. In this work, we investigate the macroscopic structure of cities such as their clusters of highly populated areas. To do this, we analyze the spatial distribution of urban population and its intra-day dynamics in Seoul and Helsinki with a percolation framework. We observe that the growth patterns of the largest clusters in the real and randomly shuffled population data are significantly different, and highly populated areas during daytime are denser and form larger clusters than during nighttime. An analysis of the cluster size distributions at percolation criticality shows that their power-law exponents during daytime are lower than during nighttime, indicating that the spatial distributions of urban population during daytime and nighttime fall into different universality classes. Finally measuring the area-perimeter fractal dimension of the collection of clusters at criticality demonstrates that the fractal dimensions during daytime are higher than during nighttime, indicating that the perimeters of clusters during daytime are more rough than during nighttime. Our findings suggest that even the same city can have qualitatively different spatial distributions of population over time, and propose a way to quantitatively compare the macrostructure of cities based on population distribution data.</description>

      <title>NEAR: A Training-Free Pre-Estimator of Machine Learning Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have been shown to be state-of-the-art machine learning models in a wide variety of applications, including natural language processing and image recognition. However, building a performant neural network is a laborious task and requires substantial computing power. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) addresses this issue by an automatic selection of the optimal network from a set of potential candidates. While many NAS methods still require training of (some) neural networks, zero-cost proxies promise to identify the optimal network without training. In this work, we propose the zero-cost proxy Network Expressivity by Activation Rank (NEAR). It is based on the effective rank of the pre- and post-activation matrix, i.e., the values of a neural network layer before and after applying its activation function. We demonstrate the cutting-edge correlation between this network score and the model accuracy on NAS-Bench-101 and NATS-Bench-SSS/TSS. In addition, we present a simple approach to estimate the optimal layer sizes in multi-layer perceptrons. Furthermore, we show that this score can be utilized to select hyperparameters such as the activation function and the neural network weight initialization scheme.</description>

      <title>Optimal Symmetries in Binary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of group symmetries in binary classification tasks, presenting a novel framework that leverages the principles of Neyman-Pearson optimality. Contrary to the common intuition that larger symmetry groups lead to improved classification performance, our findings show that selecting the appropriate group symmetries is crucial for optimising generalisation and sample efficiency. We develop a theoretical foundation for designing group equivariant neural networks that align the choice of symmetries with the underlying probability distributions of the data. Our approach provides a unified methodology for improving classification accuracy across a broad range of applications by carefully tailoring the symmetry group to the specific characteristics of the problem. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that optimal classification performance is not always associated with the largest equivariant groups possible in the domain, even when the likelihood ratio is invariant under one of its proper subgroups, but rather with those subgroups themselves. This work offers insights and practical guidelines for constructing more effective group equivariant architectures in diverse machine-learning contexts.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curves Derived from Counting Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve is a widely used device for assessing decision-making systems. It seems surprising, in view of its history dating back to World War Two, that the assignment of uncertainties to a ROC curve is apparently not settled. This note returns to the question, focusing on the application of ROC curves to the analysis of data from counting experiments and taking a practical operational approach to the concept of uncertainty.</description>
