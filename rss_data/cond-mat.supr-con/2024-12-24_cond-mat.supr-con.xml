      <title>Multiple magnetic orders discovered in the superconducting state of EuFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and magnetism is an important subject in condensed matter physics. EuFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$-based iron pnictides could offer an interesting plateau to study their relationship that has attracted considerable attention. So far, two magnetic phase transitions were observed in EuFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$-based crystal, which were deemed to originate from the itinerant Fe moments ($\sim$ 190 K) and the localized Eu$^{2+}$ moments ($\sim$ 19 K), respectively. Here, we systematically studied the heat capacity for the EuFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ crystals with \textit{x} = 0.21 (optimally doped) and \textit{x} = 0.29 (overdoped). We have found two new magnetic orders in the superconducting state (ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 K) in the optimally doped crystal. As more P was introduced into the As site, one of the magnetic orders becomes absent in the overdoped crystal. Additionally, we observed strong field and orientation dependence in heat capacity. The present findings in EuFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ have detected the new low-temperature magnetic orders, which may originate from the localized Eu$^{2+}$ spins order or the spin reorientation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic pinning of FeSe$_1$$_-$$_x$S$_x$ single crystals probed by torque magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic pinning is caused by natural pinning centers that occur because of the modulation of the order parameter or weak superconducting layers. Early work has shown that intrinsic pinning generates a high pinning force and critical current density in some layered oxide superconductors. Studying the intrinsic pinning of superconductors is crucial for both fundamental studies and potential applications. Herein, we use torque magnetometry to study angle-resolved in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic torque for a series of high-quality FeSe$_1$$_-$$_x$S$_x$ single crystals. A fourfold torque signal was observed when the magnetic field was within the \textit{ab} plane. We interpret that this fourfold in-plane irreversible torque is from the intrinsic pinning due to combined effects of gap nodes/minimum and twin domains. Additionally, we attributed the observed out-of-plane torque peaks to intrinsic pinning due to the layered structure.</description>

      <title>Bulk and surface Dirac states accompanied by two superconducting domes in FeSe-based superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent investigations of FeSe-based superconductors have revealed the presence of two superconducting domes, and suggest possible distinct pairing mechanisms. Two superconducting domes are commonly found in unconventional superconductors and exhibit unique normal states and electronic structures. In this study, we conducted electromagnetic transport measurements to establish a complete phase diagram, successfully observing the two superconducting domes in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (0 $\le x \le$ 0.25) and FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ (0 $\le x \le$ 1) superconductors. The normal state resistivity on SC1 shows the strange metal state, with a power exponent approximately equal to 1 ($\rho (T)\propto T^n$ with $n\sim 1$), whereas the exponent on SC2 is less than 1. A bulk Dirac state observed on SC1, completely synchronized with the strange metal behavior, indicating a close relationship between them. While a topological surface Dirac state is witnessed on SC2, and undergoes a sign change near the pure nematic quantum critical point. The evolution of the Dirac states indicates that the appearance of the two superconducting domes may originate from the Fermi surface reconstruction. Our findings highlight distinct Dirac states and normal state resistivity across the two superconducting domes, providing convincing evidence for the existence of the two different pairing mechanisms in FeSe-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Josephson Field Effect Transistors with InAs on Insulator and High Permittivity Gate Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: InAs on Insulator (InAsOI) has recently been demonstrated as a promising platform to develop hybrid semiconducting-superconducting electronics, which features an InAs epilayer grown onto a cryogenic insulating InAlAs metamorphic buffer. The miniaturization of Si microchips has progressed significantly due to the integration of high permittivity (high-k) gate insulators, compared to the conventional thermally-growth SiO2. Here, we investigate the gate-tunable electrical properties of InAsOI-based Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs) featuring different high-k gate insulators, namely, HfO2 and Al2O3. With both dielectrics, the JoFETs can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal state resistance by 10-20 times using negative gate voltages. The HfO2-JoFETs exhibit improved gate-tunable electrical performance compared to those achieved with Al2O3-JoFETs, which is related to the higher permittivity of the insulator. Gate-dependent electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs were evaluated in the temperature range from 50 mK to 1 K. Moreover, under the influence of an out-of-plane magnetic field, JoFETs exhibited an unconventional Fraunhofer diffraction pattern.</description>

      <title>Large tunable Josephson diode effect in a side-contacted topological-insulator-nanowire junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI nanowire based Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Ambient-pressure superconductivity onset above 40 K in bilayer nickelate ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of bilayer nickelate superconductors under high pressure has opened a new chapter in high-transition temperature (high-TC) superconductivity. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset above the McMillan limit (40 K) in bilayer nickelate epitaxial ultrathin films. Three-unit-cell (3UC) thick La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 single-phase-crystalline films are grown using the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy) on SrLaAlO4 substrates. Resistivity measurements and magnetic-field responses indicate onset TC = 45 K. The transition to zero resistance exhibits characteristics consistent with a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-like behavior, with TBKT = 9 K. Meissner diamagnetic effect is observed at TM = 8.5 K via a mutual inductance setup, in agreement with the BKT-like transition. In-plane and out-of-plane critical magnetic fields exhibit anisotropy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and X-ray reciprocal space mappings (RSMs) show that the films maintain a tetragonal phase with coherent epitaxial compressive strain ~2% in the NiO2 planes relative to the bulk. Our findings pave the way for comprehensive investigations of nickelate superconductors under ambient pressure conditions and for exploring superconductivity at higher transition temperature through strain engineering in heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Edge modes in chiral electron double layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasiparticles in chiral double layers with electron pairing within the framework of the Bogoliubov de Gennes equation. In the presence of an edge it is demonstrated that the quasiparticle modes can be distinguished as edge modes and bulk modes, which appear at different energies. The bulk-edge correspondence is obtained by an analytic continuation from the in-gap edge modes to the bands of bulk modes. By varying the energy we find a transition from localized edge modes to delocalized bulk modes. We calculate the quasiparticle currents, discuss briefly how these currents couple to external currents, and predict how this can be used to control the quasiparticle modes.</description>

      <title>Development of a Neuromorphic Network Using BioSFQ Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductor electronics (SCE) appear promising for low energy applications. However, the achieved and projected circuit densities are insufficient for direct competition with CMOS technology. Original algorithms and nontraditional architectures are required for realizing SCE energy advantages for computing. Neuromorphic computing (NMC) is a commonly discussed deviation from conventional CMOS digital solutions. Instead of mimicking a conventional network of artificial neurons, we compose a network from the previously demonstrated single flux quantum (SFQ) electronics components which we termed bioSFQ. We present a design and operation of a new neuromorphic circuit containing a 3x3 array of bioSFQ cells - superconductor artificial neurons - capable of performing various analog functions and based on Josephson junction comparators with complementary outputs. The resultant asynchronous network closely resembles a three-layer perceptron. We also present superconductor analog memory and the memory Read/Write interface implemented with the neural network. The circuits were fabricated in the SFQ5ee process at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane intensity modulation of spin susceptibility in Ba$_{0.75}$K$_{0.25}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ as seen via time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study of the iron-based superconductor Ba$_{0.75}$K$_{0.25}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, focusing on its spin dynamics. Our measurements reveal a periodic intensity modulation of magnetic signals along the out-of-plane direction, which deviates from the behavior typically expected for two-dimensional magnetic materials. Using an effective model derived from density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the observed out-of-plane modulated spin susceptibility originates from the intrinsic three-dimensionality of the electronic band structure. Our study reveals the limitations of the widely assumed two-dimensional nature of spin susceptibility in iron-based superconductors, highlighting the importance of incorporating three-dimensional aspects of the electronic band structure for accurate modeling of spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconducting Properties of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ Films with sub-50-nm Thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-unit cell thick Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) layers have recently attracted much interest due to their extreme anisotropy and two-dimensional superconductivity, although they are typically susceptible to ambient conditions. In this study, we report on thin films approximately 13 unit cells thick that are stable in air, exhibit high anisotropy, and demonstrate extraordinarily high critical currents. By examining the superconducting transition under magnetic fields applied in both out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, we estimate key parameters such as pinning potentials, coherence lengths, London penetration depth, anisotropy factor, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The volume pinning force is better described by a model incorporating an exponential decay term attributed to pronounced thermally-assisted flux flow. The Hall effect in the Bi-2212 films exhibits an extensive anomaly with a double sign change that may challenge existing theoretical explanations for this poorly understood phenomenon in copper-oxide superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spin density wave and superconductivity in the bilayer $t$-$J$ model of $\rm{La}_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}$ under renormalized mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently discovered bilayer nickelate superconductor, the pressurized $\rm{La}_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}$, we present a renormalized mean-field theory of a bilayer single-band $t$-$J$ model, highlighting the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Phase-dependent supercurrent and microwave dissipation of HgTe quantum well Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the microwave response of a HgTe quantum well Josephson junction embedded into an RF SQUID loop which is inductively coupled to a superconducting resonator. The side-contacted devices studied here operate in bulk transport mode, with a separation between the superconducting contacts smaller than both the estimated carrier mean free path and superconducting coherence length. We extract the current-phase relation and the phase-dependent microwave dissipation, that, at low temperature, primarily is related to photon-induced transitions between the Andreev bound states. We study the effects of gate voltage and temperature on our devices and compare the measurements with a tight-binding model based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. A combined analysis of both microwave admittance components allows us to confirm the presence of a small gap in the Andreev bound state spectrum at phase $\pi$, indicating high interface transparency, matching our observations in DC measurements of a similar device. Our work demonstrates the versatility of microwave measurements as a tool for Josephson junction characterization and highlights the importance of the interface properties for side-contacted Josephson devices.</description>

      <title>DC-operated Josephson junction arrays as a cryogenic on-chip microwave measurement platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing radio frequency (RF) signals to circuits working in cryogenic conditions requires bulky and expensive transmission cabling interfacing specialized RF electronics anchored at room temperature. Superconducting Josephson junction arrays (JJAs) can change this paradigm by placing the RF source and detector inside the chip. In this work, we demonstrate that DC-biased JJAs can emit signals in the C-band frequency spectrum and beyond. We fabricate reproducible JJAs comprised of amorphous MoGe or NbTiN superconducting islands and metallic Au weak links. Temperature, magnetic fields, applied currents, and device design are explored to control the operation of the RF sources, while we also identify important features that affect the ideal source behavior. Combined with the proven ability of these JJAs to detect microwave radiation, these sources allow us to propose a fully DC-operated cryogenic on-chip measurement platform that is a viable alternative to the high-frequency circuitry currently required for several quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Nanosystems: A Fruitful Path to New Phenomenology in Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reason that various recent works by different groups reporting new phenomenologies in superconductors can be understood in a unifying way as instances of the appearance of novel competitions (or synergies in some cases) between the coexisting orders at play in superconducting materials. In particular, we argue that the main common feature of such phenomenologies is to have emerged from the induction, by nanoengineering, of novel characteristic lengths for each order, or of custom regular spatial patterns affecting them. We claim, thus, that a fruitful path to discover new phenomenology is opened by these and future searches of novel nanostructurations of superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>A scenario for the critical fluctuations near the transition of few-bilayer films of high-temperature cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical fluctuations near the resistive transition of very thin films of high-temperature cuprate superconductors composed of a number $N$ of only a few unit cells of superconducting bilayers. For that, we solve the fluctuation spectrum of a Gaussian-Ginzburg-Landau model for few-bilayers superconductors considering two alternating Josephson interlayer interaction strengths, and we obtain the corresponding paraconductivity above the transition. Then, we extend these calculations to temperatures below the transition through expressions for the Ginzburg number and Kosterlitz--Thouless-like critical region. When compared with previously available data in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ few-bilayers systems, with $N=1$ to $4$, our results seem to provide a plausible scenario for their critical regime.</description>

      <title>A New Bite Into Dark Matter with the SNSPD-Based QROCODILE Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first results from the Quantum Resolution-Optimized Cryogenic Observatory for Dark matter Incident at Low Energy (QROCODILE). The QROCODILE experiment uses a microwire-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a target and sensor for dark matter scattering and absorption, and is sensitive to energy deposits as low as 0.11 eV. We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons. We discuss the potential for improvements to both the energy threshold and effective volume of the experiment in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Optical evidence of the band reconstruction during the charge-density wave transition in annealed Kagome magnet FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Kagome magnet FeGe, the coexistence of electron correlation, charge-density wave (CDW), and magnetism renders it ideal to study their interactions. Here, we combined the optical spectroscopy and the first-principles calculations to investigate the band structures of FeGe annealed at different temperatures. Our observations reveal that the sample annealed at 320C experienced dramatic change in optical conductivity following the CDW transition. Specifically, a substantial portion of the spectral weight (SW) in the low-energy region ( &lt; 0.4 eV) was redistributed to the high-energy region (0.8 - 1.5 eV), suggesting a reconstruction of the band structure. The sample annealed at 560 C did not exhibit a CDW transition, but its SW transfer occurred progressively from 300 to 5 K. We noticed that: i) after the CDW transition, the sample annealed at 320 C showed similar tendency of SW transfer to that of the 560 C annealed sample; ii) the high-energy SW of both materials displayed a temperature dependence consistent with the magnetic roperties. Combining the first-principles calculations, we attribute the SW transfer to the band reconstruction triggered by the distortion of Ge1 atoms induced either by annealing at 560C or by the CDW transitions. This lattice distortion affects the energies of Fe 3d orbitals. Under the influence of Hund's rule coupling, the magnetic moment of Fe atoms is enhanced. Our findings elucidate the interactions among charge, lattice, and spin in FeGe, offering pivotal insights to modulate properties of this Kagome magnet.</description>

      <title>New experimental evidence for Podkletnov effect</title>

Abstract: The present study was conducted on dispersed YBa2Cu3O6+d (YBCO) during its hydration in gas-tight containers with K2CO3X1.5H2O crystal hydrate. The samples were exposed to an electromagnetic field with a frequency of 50 MHz or microwave radiation of 2 GHz. Changes in the weight of various bodies located in the immediate vicinity of containers with YBCO material were detected: when above the containers, the bodies lose weight, while the weight of bodies located under the containers, on the contrary, increases. The maximum weight defect recorded in experiments with a 5 g YBCO sample was about 1 mg. Discovered weight changes are very similar to the result obtained by E.E. Podkletnov et al. [Physica C: Superconductivity, 1992. V. 203. P. 441] - they observed a decrease in the weight of bodies placed above a rotating YBCO disk which was in a superconducting state and exposed to an alternating magnetic field. Podkletnov and other researchers put forward a hypothesis about screening of the gravitational field by the rotating YBCO-superconductor. Distinctive features of our experiments are the absence of the superconducting state in the YBCO material and its rotation. However, it is clear to us that we have observed the same phenomenon and, to our knowledge, this is probably the first time that Podkletnov effect has been confirmed in an independent study. Our interpretation of the effect differs from the initial one. According to our results, the YBCO material initiates a redistribution between bodies of a certain substance that affects their weight or mass.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transition between superconductivity and charge/spin-density wave as the reason of their coexistence in organic metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity (SC) and spin/charge density wave (DW) in organic metals shows many similarities to high-$T_c$ superconductors. It also contains many puzzles, for example, the anisotropic SC onset observed and the severalfold increase of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ in the coexistence region, as well as the microscopic origin of SC/DW phase separation there. In this paper, by the direct calculation of the Landau expansion for DW free energy, we argue that the phase transition between DW and metallic/SC phase in organic superconductors goes by first order at low enough temperature, which explains the spatial segregation of DW and SC at large length scale, consistent with experimental observations. This first-order phase transition is not directly related to SC and happens even above the SC transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Brillouin zone folding method for quasiperiodic superconductivity in multilayer systems: application to electronic structure and optical responses</title>

Abstract: We construct an efficient momentum space approach to the superconductivity in quasiperiodic multilayer systems. To this end, we extend the Brillouin zone (BZ) folding method to the superconducting (SC) phases by formulating the gap equation in the momentum space representation with the BZ folding. We show that the physical observables in quasiperiodic multilayers are generally given by so-called quasiperiodic functions. Consequently, there appear SC order parameters with finite momenta in the BZ folding method, which corresponds to the spatial fluctuation of the SC order in quasiperiodic multilayers. We also find a systematic way to compute the physical observables in the BZ folding method with a proper normalization condition using the continued fraction approximation. We apply the BZ folding method to a one-dimensional toy model of quasiperiodic superconductors and demonstrate its numerical efficiency compared to the conventional method based on the real space representation with a large system size. We also study a quasiperiodic bilayer system of Rice-Mele model and an s-wave superconductor to demonstrate an efficient computation of optical responses of a quasiperiodic superconductor with inversion symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial structure of in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states induced by a magnetic impurity in a superconductor is the essential ingredient for the possibility of engineering collective impurity states. Recently, a saddle-point approximation [Phys. Rev. B 105, 144503] revealed how the spatial form of a YSR state is controlled by an anisotropic exponential decay length, and an anisotropic prefactor, which depends on the Fermi velocity and Fermi-surface curvature. Here we analyze scanning tunnel microscope (STM) data on YSR states in NbSe$_2$, focusing on a key issue that the exponential decay length predicted theoretically from the small superconducting gap is much larger than the observed extent of YSR states. We confirm that the exponential decay can be neglected in the analysis of the anisotropy. Instead, we extract the anisotropic prefactor directly from the data, matching it to the theoretical prediction, and we establish that the theoretical expression for the prefactor alone captures the characteristic flower-like shape of the YSR state. Surprisingly, we find that up to linear order in the superconducting gap the anisotropic prefactor that determines the shape of YSR states is the same as the anisotropic response to the impurity in the underlying normal metal. Our work points out the correct way to analyze STM data on impurities in small-gap superconductors, and reveals the importance of the normal band structure's curvature and Fermi velocity in designing multi-impurity in-gap states in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity in altermagnets with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate some possible symmetries of the superconducting state that emerges in three-dimensional altermagnets in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate within a weak-coupling approach that these altermagnets, which naturally possess an order modulated by a vector form factor $\boldsymbol{g}_{\mathbf{k}}$, favor spin-triplet superconductivity described by gap functions given by $\boldsymbol{d}(\mathbf{k}) = \boldsymbol{u}(\mathbf{k}) \times \boldsymbol{g}_{\mathbf{k}}$, where $\boldsymbol{u}(\mathbf{k}) = - \boldsymbol{u}(-\mathbf{k})$. Consequently, this singles out $f$-wave spin-triplet superconductivity as the most favorable pairing state to appear in the vicinity of $d$-wave altermagnetism. Furthermore, we obtain that the combination of spin-singlet superconducting states with altermagnetism gives rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which are protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant. Using a Ginzburg-Landau analysis, we show that, for a class of spin-orbit coupled altermagnetic models, a superconducting phase is expected to appear at low temperatures as an intertwined $d + if$ state, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry spontaneously.</description>

      <title>Pair size and quantum geometry in a multiband Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the size of two-body bound states and Cooper pairs within a multiband Hubbard model that features time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing on a generic lattice. Our analysis involves (i) an exact calculation of the localization tensor to determine the size of lowest-lying two-body bound state in vacuum, and (ii) an evaluation of the analogous tensor to estimate the average size of Cooper pairs within the mean-field BCS-BEC crossover theory at zero temperature. Beyond the conventional intraband contribution that depends on Bloch bands, we show that pair size also has a geometric contribution governed by the quantum-metric tensor of the Bloch states and their band-resolved quantum-metric tensors. As a concrete example, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that, while the pair size diverges in the weakly interacting BCS regime of dispersive bands, it remains finite and relatively small in the flat-band regime, even for infinitesimal interaction, perfectly matching the exact two-body result in the dilute limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. We demonstrate that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states protected by inversion symmetry and identify a family of organic semiconductors realising the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also show that the topological phase can be controlled through experimentally realisable strains and chemical functionalisation of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. Furthermore, we show that the dielectric environment allows to control the excitonic quantum geometry. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>
